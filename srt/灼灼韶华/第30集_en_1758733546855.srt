2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I heard the wind from the sky above the sea

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That is not the wind, that is not the wind

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the sharpness in my eyes

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not easy, then let's break it

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My bitter pain, my pain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I finally turn around

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the wildest night

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to break the world

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is the one for me

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's take this money to buy a business for Xiaobao

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Isn't it good?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's spent on him anyway

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Isn't that good?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are too much

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right, it's not suitable

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How about this

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Look, I think you are alone anyway

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How about Xiaobao being your son

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's not too much for mom to spend money on her son

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's a good deal

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have no son

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I only have one daughter

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She is dead

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You mean Xiaobao doesn't care

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and won't give the money

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, he won't give a penny

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I am leaving

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ok

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Shu Chaoao

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you think you are doing this

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to your brother and me

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Tell me

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You don't know what you did

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I really don't know

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You killed Chen Ershun's family

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to elope with the wild man

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What are you talking about

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am not talking nonsense

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Your brother and I have guarded you for so many years

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You are not a man

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You are a man

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are a man

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Your brother and I have guarded you for so many years

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We are worried about you

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now it's time for you to pay us back

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Shut up

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The government has closed the case

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Chen's family was killed by bandits

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But does the government know you are still alive

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Does the government know that before the accident

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
there was a wild man in your pharmacy

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Shut up

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can shut up

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Give all your money to Chu Xiaobao

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Or I will go to the police station to sue you

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Or we go together

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
To see if the police station is charged with your murder case

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Or I will sue you for slander

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't think I dare not

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I am waiting for you

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Shaohua

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you crazy

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He has so much money

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He doesn't dare to give us some

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Shaohua

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That day

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I didn't tell anyone about that night

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Including mother

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Zhou Yan doesn't know anything

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What she said just now

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She guessed it

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Shaohua

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You are good to me and our family

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I know it

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Zhou Yan

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He is such a person

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's it for this life

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I really can't do anything about him

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can do something

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All the time

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I always tell myself

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No matter how bad he is

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's also my wife

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Xiaobao's mother

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She suffered a lot with me

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And gave birth to a son for our Chu family

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can't just throw him away

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Brother

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I am here today

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Actually I have another thing

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
To discuss with you

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
During this time

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The consumption of housework suddenly increased

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The income is always not right

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Over the past quarter

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There is a gap of more than 100 taels

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I asked the primary school to secretly check

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Found that the accounts with problems

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Are all from Zhou Yan's hand

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This stupid woman

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Brother

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can add this deficit

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But Zhou Yan

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can't stay in the Wen's Pharmacy anymore

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Indeed can't stay anymore

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I resign with Zhou Yan

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is a matter of personal interest

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't do it

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I can't do it

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's okay

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It has nothing to do with you

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Wen's Pharmacy

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who doesn't know that I am his wife

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now he did such a thing

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How can I take it?

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This matter is now only me, Xiao Xue

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And Boss Wen know

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's just forget it

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I have no face to face you

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I take her and Xiaobao

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Go back to the old house in Qizhou

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Go back to the old house

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The old house has nothing now

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How do you live without it?

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's talk again

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Brother

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't persuade me

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In fact, we should have left long ago

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Shaohua

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You just live your own life

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I will take good care of Zhou Yan

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I won't let her bother you again

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I will take good care of her

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Have you talked to your sister?

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I am asking you

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What are you doing?

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You are so naughty

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Pack up and go back to Qizhou

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why do you go back to Qizhou?

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know you live a good life

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why do you always dissatisfied?

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You always want to put others' money in your pocket

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Whose money did I put in my pocket?

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Didn't you ask Shaohua for money?

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
She should give it

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why should I give it to you?

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because Xiaobao is her son

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Chenghui, who can't even play the 8th string

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Spend so much money on her

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's wrong with Xiaobao spending?

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Chenghui is her godbrother

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Xiaobao is her son

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Then I ask you

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Did you move the hands and feet on the warehouse?

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is it true?

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Who said that?

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Who framed me?

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Tell me, you find him out

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We can go to the confrontation

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Zhou Zhao

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Enough Zhou Yan, stop it

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You are just stubborn

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know better than anyone

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
if you are wronged

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Chu Shaozhou

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You are bullying me with those people, right?

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You are good

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Enough

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You can talk about it

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you crying?

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Chu Shaozhou

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I have lived with you for so many years

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You don't know what kind of person I am

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know them

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How can I do such a thing?

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Enough, Xiaobao is still asleep

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I know, I know

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Shaozhou

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Someone must have wanted to drive me away

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They framed me

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Maybe

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You have to support me, do you hear me?

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Enough, don't cry

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, you have to go to Shaohua tomorrow

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You have to explain it to her

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I can't be a thief for nothing

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can talk to Shaohua

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But we can't stay in Wen's Pharmacy

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Why?

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You offended Shaohua

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How can you stay?

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So I asked you to find her

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
She wanted to drive us away last time

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You went to find her, she changed her mind

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This time it's ok

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I have told Shaohua

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We will go back to our hometown

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We won't disturb her again

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
How can you talk nonsense?

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Shaohua has nothing to do with the Chen family's murder case

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You can't mention those crazy things again

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you hear me?

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You didn't say that in the beginning

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What did I say?

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You said Chu Shaohua killed someone

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I was blinded by it

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I was lying

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Really?

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Of course

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Pack up

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You can go if you want to

225
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I won't go

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Chu Shaohua had nothing

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He can go to the world

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can go too

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can go

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I can go

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can go

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can go

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Ok

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Ok

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Boss

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What's the matter?

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I have a good news

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There is a ship docking from Shanghai to Dalian

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
People are ok

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But all the drugs and bullets are on the sea

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Those opium

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Great

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We made it by ourselves

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Boss Xia made it

246
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He?

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He said he would not destroy anything

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Otherwise we wouldn't have asked others to do it

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Maybe he thinks we are right after talking with us

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's good that he can think it through

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I have something to tell you

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You can come to the business award

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, I bought something from him

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What?

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's the brand name of Chun Tang

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Now it's mine

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How much did he sell you?

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Double

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's the brand that your grandfather founded

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Double

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ten times

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Ten times is ok

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How much is ten times?

265
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Ten times ten big sheep

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He bought you a big sheep

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Do you want it?

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And you are going to hang this brand in Shanghai Bund

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can help you

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank you

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I want to make money by myself

273
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And hang it

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Boss

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Should I pay you more?

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I just got the salary last year

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The salary of Wen's and Da's are increasing every year

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The salary is increasing too

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The salary is the salary

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The salary is the salary of each person

281
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's increasing

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why are you so greedy?

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You don't know me on the first day

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I will pay you tomorrow

285
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Thank you

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Welcome back

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What?

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Good night

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Good night, boss

290
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Boss

291
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Remember the thing about Jiaxin

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What do you say?

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Jiaxin and Fenhong are all increasing

294
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Boss

295
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The compensation of the insurance company has all arrived

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
According to the previous contract with them

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The whole loss insurance agreement

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
A total of 132,000 big sheep

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I still feel a little pity

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Originally, we could earn one hundred and fifty thousand big sheep

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Now

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Because of the insurance fee

303
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We lost at least 200,000 big sheep

304
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We can't make money

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We can't make money

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The insurance fee

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We lost at least 200,000 big sheep

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
With 200,000 big sheep

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's worth to exchange for Wen Zhiqiu and Chu Shaohua

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
To continue to work for us

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's true

312
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If this batch of goods really goes to the northeast

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We have to split with Wen Zhiqiu

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But now

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This one hundred and fifty thousand is all in our pocket

316
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Isn't it good?

317
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Or the boss will settle the accounts

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
In the meantime

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let's make money

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Our recruitment instructions are clear

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Only hand-in-hand

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Manager, I am hand-in-hand

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Then you say

324
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Which pharmacy have you worked in?

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Hua Shun Pharmacy

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, right, Chichun Hall

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And Chichun Hall

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You said these pharmacies

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I haven't heard of it

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Manager, these pharmacies are famous in Beiping

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Miss Zhou, I have something to do

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Please go back

333
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Have you heard of Wen's Pharmacy?

334
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Wen's Pharmacy

335
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Correct

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He said he was in the warehouse before

337
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
His husband is a teapot

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Where is he?

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Waiting down there

340
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Boss

341
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Let him come up

342
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Boss

343
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This woman

344
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is it sent by Wen's Pharmacy

345
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
To be a spy?

346
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You are stupid

347
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If she is a spy

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How can she say herself

349
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Is it from Wen's Pharmacy?

350
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's right

351
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Maybe

352
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Wen Zhiqiu and Chu Shaohua

353
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are so cunning

354
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Maybe they can do this

355
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Then you want to see her?

356
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes

357
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why not?

358
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
She can send someone to my place

359
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
To inquire about the news

360
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Can't I

361
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Get some words from her?

362
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You are not stupid

363
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Boss

364
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Come in

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Boss

366
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You came out from Wen's Pharmacy?

367
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes

368
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Wen's Pharmacy

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The salary paid to her

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is the highest in the industry

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Why do you want to leave?

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It depends on people

373
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Those people

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Who are stupid

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They don't do anything

376
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And they are all rich

377
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Others are not necessary

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I see you

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You are capable

380
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And capable

381
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But you are a little

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
High-spirited and arrogant

383
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You are right

384
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Boss

385
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You are so great

386
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You are so good

387
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't want to see her

388
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't want to see her

389
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't want to see her

390
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't want to see her

391
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So I don't want to see her

392
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What is Chu Shaohua doing?

393
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He is busy building money

394
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I heard that Wen's Pharmacy

395
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Is pushing some new drugs

396
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What kind of drugs?

397
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What kind of drugs?

398
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Those are the same

399
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No stupid drugs

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You are so eloquent

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Great

402
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No, boss

403
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I really don't know

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I heard that Chu Shaohua

405
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Is very talented in business

406
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Right?

407
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He is talented

408
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He can do medicine business

409
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
My husband took him into the industry

410
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Who is your husband?

411
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Chu Shaohua's brother

412
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He is a good-for-nothing

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He can do business

414
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He is a good-for-nothing

415
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Boss, let me tell you

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Chu Shaohua

417
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He is not smart

418
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He is not a good-for-nothing

419
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
He can do business

420
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He is so lucky

421
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I am different from him

422
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I have real skills

423
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I can do it

424
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If you can let me stay

425
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I will do it

426
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
With all my heart

427
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And I...

428
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Shut up

429
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What happened?

430
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You are the spy sent by Chu Shaohua

431
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You are still working for me

432
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You are so useless

433
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
No, no, no

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Boss, you misunderstood

435
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I have nothing to do with Chu Shaohua

436
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You dare to say that?

437
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You just said it yourself

438
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Your husband is Chu Shaohua's brother

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You are his sister-in-law

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
How can he fire her?

441
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What does it matter?

442
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He can kill the little uncle

443
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Wait, wait, wait

444
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I will kill him

445
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Boss, I really have nothing to do with Chu Shaohua

446
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I really have nothing to do with him

447
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What are you doing?

448
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Boss

449
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Wait

450
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What?

451
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What did you say?

452
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I have nothing to do with Chu Shaohua

453
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No, it's the last sentence

454
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No

455
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Who did he kill?

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Nonsense

457
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No, no

458
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No, no

459
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Who did he kill?

460
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Who did he kill?

461
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes

462
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Who did he kill?

463
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You

464
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You

465
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You

466
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Boss is coming

467
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You need to read the paper for the branch

468
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The contract with Fujian Grocery

469
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
is a little changed than last year

470
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But you don't need to worry

471
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I have marked it

472
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But today you have to send it out

473
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Also the new product next year

474
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
has to be settled today

475
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And the budget next year

476
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We need to have a result, too

477
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,960
Four hours.

478
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
You can give it to me now.

479
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,160
Can I take a break?

480
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,840
No.

481
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,680
I want to have a good harvest today.

482
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,880
So that I can get more

483
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,000
of my salary and salary.

484
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,040
So that my store can open earlier.

485
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,720
Okay.

486
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,840
Or you can open a store and bully me.

487
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,880
Mr. Wen.

488
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,520
It's your good fortune

489
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,400
to have the staff's will to bully you.

490
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,720
You should cherish it.

491
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,760
Who is Chu Shaohua?

492
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,520
What are you doing?

493
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,600
Don't you get out of bed?

494
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,840
Who are you looking for?

495
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,440
Who is Chu Shaohua?

496
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
I am Chu Shaohua.

497
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,160
What's wrong?

498
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,960
You are Chu Shaohua?

499
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
What's the matter?

500
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,600
I am the boss here.

501
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,920
Arrest that woman.

502
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,760
Why do you arrest her?

503
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:32,840
Move.

504
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,640
If you are in the way,

505
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
arrest her.

506
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,760
Wait.

507
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,440
Why do you arrest her?

508
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,120
Zhixing.

509
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,160
Move.

510
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,120
Go away.

511
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,080
Don't move.

512
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,000
Go.

513
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,800
Don't drag me.

514
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,400
I will go with you.

515
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,280
I will go with you.

516
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,840
Did you report Shaohua?

517
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
You are so naughty.

518
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
You just made a fool of yourself.

519
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,840
Did the police

520
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,280
arrest Shaohua because of you?

521
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,480
No.

522
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,120
Not you?

523
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,120
All right.

524
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,920
Come on.

525
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,080
Sit down.

526
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,800
What are you doing?

527
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,440
Listen to me.

528
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,400
Shaohua was caught.

529
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,280
It has nothing to do with you.

530
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,840
Don't talk about Shaohua.

531
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,880
Are you concerned about

532
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,360
your wife?

533
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,680
What's the matter with you?

534
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,000
Shaozhou.

535
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,280
I found a job.

536
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,480
The salary is five times that of the big pharmacy in Wen's.

537
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,880
And the boss

538
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,560
gave me a raise.

539
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,200
We don't have to leave Shanghai.

540
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,560
We can buy a big house.

541
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,520
Xiaobao can stay in Shanghai to study.

542
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,360
What job are you looking for?

543
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,400
His company is one of the biggest

544
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,160
pharmaceutical companies in Shanghai.

545
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,040
And the boss said

546
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,120
he wanted me to be the manager.

547
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,960
By the way,

548
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,000
he said if you want to go,

549
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,720
he will arrange a good position for you.

550
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,960
How is that possible?

551
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,920
How is that impossible?

552
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,040
You just need to ask your wife

553
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,000
if she can do it.

554
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,120
Zhou Yan.

555
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,600
Tell me honestly.

556
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,040
Did you sell the past

557
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,960
to sell Shaohua?

558
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,320
What do you mean?

559
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,520
I don't mean that.

560
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,760
I'll ask you again.

561
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Yes or no?

562
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,600
Didn't you tell me

563
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,800
that Shaohua killed Chen Ershun's family?

564
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,560
I didn't lie.

565
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
You're killing Shaohua.

566
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,760
You didn't hit me.

567
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,560
You dare to hit me, right?

568
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,320
Chu Shaochong,

569
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,800
I didn't have a good day

570
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,480
since I married you.

571
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,480
I didn't eat or drink

572
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,720
or drink anything.

573
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,360
I never disliked you.

574
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
You dare to hit me now, right?

575
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,000
You're a hit.

576
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,240
I'm a hit.

577
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,680
You're a hit.

578
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,840
A man can't be an official or a rich man.

579
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,080
Now I can make money.

580
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,440
How dare you hit me?

581
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,600
What money do you make?

582
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,720
It's all black money.

583
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,840
You dare to say you make money?

584
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,160
You think I'm a black heart?

585
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,040
When I gave you a son,

586
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,200
why didn't you think I was a black heart?

587
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,200
When I gave you a mother,

588
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,960
why didn't you think I was a black heart?

589
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,600
I served you to wash clothes and cook.

590
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,680
Why didn't you think I was a black heart?

591
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,480
You have a sister.

592
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,880
You have money.

593
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,760
Why do you think I'm a black heart?

594
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,640
Zhou Yan,

595
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,960
no matter what you did before,

596
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,760
I could let you do whatever you wanted.

597
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,480
But you hurt Shaohua

598
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,240
and my sister.

599
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,240
It's a disgrace.

600
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,760
If Chu Shaozhong still let you do it,

601
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,920
he will be sorry to our Chu family.

602
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,120
Get out.

603
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Chu Shaozhong.

604
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,720
Don't regret it.

605
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,480
Get out.

606
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,200
Uncle.

607
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
The police are still investigating.

608
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,480
These Rebel reporters

609
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,880
and their sales account

610
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,440
have committed a crime against Shaohua.

611
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
We can completely ведwill them.

612
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,040
This is the last step.

613
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,040
Chen Ershun, Chen Mu and Chen Xuan.

614
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,320
These three people

615
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,760
died before the fire.

616
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,000
Chen Mu and Chen Ershun died of knife wounds.

617
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,400
Chen Xuan died of suffocation.

618
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,040
Did the file mention Shaohao?

619
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,800
Yes.

620
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,760
The file said

621
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,400
Miss Chu was kidnapped by bandits

622
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,640
and died halfway.

623
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,240
So she couldn't find the corpse.

624
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,360
But two years ago,

625
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,760
the bandit Ertuzi was caught.

626
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,120
According to Ertuzi's confession,

627
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,640
they wanted to take Miss Chu away.

628
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,640
But something went wrong.

629
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,560
So Shaohua was taken away by a group of horses.

630
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,600
The whereabouts are unknown.

631
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,480
What about Chen Mu, Chen Ershun and Chen Xuan?

632
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,080
Ertuzi admitted that

633
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,200
they robbed and burned down the pharmacy.

634
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,840
In order to report that many years ago,

635
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,640
they robbed Shaohua's wife,

636
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,360
but Shaohua kidnapped her.

637
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,920
The police were furious.

638
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,960
But she didn't admit that she killed them.

639
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,160
But the police

640
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,720
were in a hurry to solve the case.

641
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,840
So they tied the three people's hats

642
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,320
to Ertuzi's head.

643
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,640
Why did the case start again?

644
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,280
It's said that someone reported that

645
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,960
Chu Shaohua was the murderer

646
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,000
behind the murder of Chen's family.

647
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,000
And he was willing to testify in court.

648
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,240
Who?

649
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,160
I haven't heard of it.

650
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,240
Any news?

651
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,920
When we went to the police station,

652
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,600
they said it was unproven.

653
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,720
Unproven?

654
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,080
I think it's a crime against the family.

655
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,840
Shaohua did kill someone.

656
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,760
Senior plants are blooming.

657
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,600
They are on their đượcs.

658
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,200
Are you all right?

659
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,440
Erniu probably told you

660
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,560
what happened 10 years ago.

661
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,920
Miss Chu,

662
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,840
what happened.

663
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,480
But after you're in the court,

664
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,920
you must not

665
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,640
admit your crime.

666
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,600
If the judge asks you,

667
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,240
you can say

668
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,040
it's been too long

669
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,640
and you can't remember it.

670
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,080
In short,

671
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,920
you leave the rest to me.

672
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,640
I'm sure

673
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,080
you'll be acquitted.

674
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,480
Lawyer Liu.

675
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,920
I don't want to lie

676
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,240
and make myself red.

677
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,240
I don't want to hide it anymore.

678
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,760
It's been ten years.

679
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,360
There should be an end to it.

680
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,520
What do you want to know?

681
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,040
I want to tell the truth

682
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,360
in front of all the judges

683
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,040
and reporters.

684
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,360
I want the law to decide

685
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,880
what kind of punishment I should be punished with.

686
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,460
I give you 144

687
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,320
won.

688
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,680
And the resign.

689
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,880
You always

690
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,640
just tell me

691
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,880
it's really bad.

692
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,520
I don't have providers.

693
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,840
Please let me know.

694
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,280
will it bear the consequences of the public opinion?

695
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,320
Miss Chu,

696
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,080
not all reporters

697
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,360
are after the truth.

698
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,320
Many people only care about

699
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:52,840
the

700
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,720
truth.

701
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,560
From the current atmosphere

702
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,040
and your personal reputation,

703
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,360
it's the best way to end it.

704
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,200
This case will be restarted

705
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
because the police

706
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,920
have found a new witness.

707
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,880
It's probably the bandit from that year.

708
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,680
A bandit's testimony

709
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,560
is easy to be

710
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,640
refuted in court.

711
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
As long as we insist

712
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,040
that the bandit from that year

713
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,600
killed the whole Chen family,

714
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,040
then Lawyer Lin will have the confidence

715
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
to help you

716
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,200
be released on the spot.

717
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,960
The witness in your heart

718
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,680
is not a bandit.

719
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
It's Zhou Yan.

720
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,360
Zhou...

721
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,920
Zhou Yan?

722
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,720
Who is she?

723
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,600
She's my sister-in-law.

724
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,600
Maybe

725
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,760
she heard something

726
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,880
from my brother.

727
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,880
This is a bit urgent.

728
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,640
It's okay.

729
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,680
I've decided

730
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
on this matter.

731
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,200
You don't have to worry about it.

732
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,880
Go back.

733
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,720
Xiao'e.

734
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,080
As for the next

735
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,440
storm or disaster,

736
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,440
I can bear it.

737
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,280
Go back.

738
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,880
See you later.

739
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,800
In other words?

740
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,240
Let's get rid of Zhou Yan?

741
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,080
Yeah.

742
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,760
Get rid of her.

743
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,040
Now cred en questo

744
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,160
can be revoked by the police.

745
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,800
No.

746
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,760
These are key to

747
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,720
destroy Zhou Yan.

748
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,160
We have no choice

749
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,320
but to bring greater trouble.

750
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,240
to live a life.

751
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,000
We just

752
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,440
added a burden to him.

753
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,160
You're right.

754
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,840
What should we do?

755
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,560
We can't just let Zhou Yao

756
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,880
slander Shao Hua.

757
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,720
Don't forget.

758
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
We still have a spoon.

759
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Is this enough?

760
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,880
Yes.

761
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,000
You only eat meat,

762
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
not vegetables.

763
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,880
I like meat.

764
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,960
Boss Wen.

765
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,680
Dad, why are you back so late?

766
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,600
If Boss Wen didn't buy me food,

767
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,960
I'd starve to death.

768
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,600
I bought you some cakes.

769
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,800
Xiaobao.

770
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,280
I need to talk to Uncle Wen.

771
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,520
Go out and play.

772
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,440
Shao Hua was caught.

773
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
It's all my fault.

774
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,560
Where is Zhou Ying?

775
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,680
Can I talk to her?

776
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I don't know either.

777
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,560
She hasn't been back for days.

778
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,640
Boss Wen.

779
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,680
Is Shao Hua okay?

780
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,880
The government

781
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,440
won't let her

782
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,840
kill Chen Ershun, right?

783
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I don't know yet.

784
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,320
But the police

785
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,840
have evidence against her.

786
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,840
If you can testify in court,

787
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,440
and prove that Zhou Ying is lying,

788
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,480
maybe

789
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,960
you can help your sister.

790
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,160
Actually, I have another thing

791
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,240
to do today.

792
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,080
Didn't you say

793
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,400
you were going back to your hometown?

794
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,520
Shao Hua prepared a sum of money for you.

795
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,320
This money

796
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,320
is enough for you to go back

797
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,160
to do some small business

798
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,960
and buy a parcel.

799
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,880
I also prepared a small portion

800
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,840
to show you

801
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,440
that no one is allowed to use it.

802
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,560
I want to learn

803
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,080
craftsmanship from her.

804
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,560
Originally,

805
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,360
Shao Hua wanted to give it to you.

806
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
In my life,

807
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,200
the best person for me is Shao Hua.

808
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,560
But the person I'm most sorry to is also Shao Hua.

809
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,640
Can I ask you one more thing?

810
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,320
Shao Hua is so nice to your family.

811
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,160
Why did Zhou Ying report her?

812
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,600
Zhou Ying did it for money.

813
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,880
She should have gotten

814
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,880
a lot of rewards from the police.

815
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
But the case of the case has been solved.

816
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,000
The police won't reward her.

817
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,840
But she suddenly became rich.

818
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,520
And she also said

819
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,000
she is now working in

820
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,360
a pharmaceutical company as a manager.

821
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,080
But she doesn't know business at all.

822
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,640
How could she be a manager?

823
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,120
Her money must have been

824
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,480
bought by Shao Hua.

825
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,400
Brother,

826
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,720
if you see Zhou Ying,

827
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,960
please help me persuade her.

828
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,640
Boss Wen,

829
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
to be honest,

830
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,280
Zhou Ying is already hopeless.

831
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,160
But don't worry.

832
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,920
I will show the people

833
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,880
who are in charge of the case

834
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,960
what I saw.

835
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,160
And I will also tell the judge

836
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,840
that Zhou Ying was not present at all.

837
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,880
Everything she said was made up by her.

838
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,840
emaker

839
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,600
The contemplative case

840
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,720
How long was she alive?

841
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,880
In just a few days,

842
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,280
she had a big loss.

843
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Sometimes she was locked up

844
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,080
and went back to work.

845
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,200
Especially being locked up.

846
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
It's so big.

847
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
It's not strange

848
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
to have a big man like him.

849
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,240
He can buy Zhou Yan.

850
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,360
We can do the same.

851
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,120
It's just a matter of

852
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,160
who gets the higher price.

853
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,760
Shaozhong has agreed to be the witness.

854
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,000
I think Zhou Yan

855
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,600
is not a bad choice.

856
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,640
The most important thing now is

857
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,480
how to get rid of

858
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,800
the interference of Tian Dashao.

859
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,960
Leave it to me.

860
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,280
I still have some connections with him.

861
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,880
I can't do it by the law.

862
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,360
It's not a problem to

863
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,560
follow the law.

864
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,720
What are you doing?

865
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,800
How much did Tian Dashao give you?

866
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,400
I don't understand what you're talking about.

867
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,840
Your hair is

868
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,000
burnt in the cave.

869
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,160
The one in the robe was worn last year.

870
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,000
The bag,

871
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,520
leather shoes,

872
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,800
are second-hand.

873
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,320
The amount is glass.

874
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,680
The perfume

875
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,120
is not imported.

876
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,520
Tian Dashao didn't give you much money, right?

877
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,720
I don't know.

878
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,760
I just know that

879
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,960
he is not a good person.

880
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,880
He is not a good person.

881
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,720
None of your business.

882
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,600
I think you are a good person.

883
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,680
Tian Dashao gave you

884
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,640
at most 2000 silver dollars.

885
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,720
I'll give you 4000.

886
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,960
It's enough for you to buy

887
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,320
Miss Photo's lipstick,

888
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,840
LV's bag,

889
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,760
Paris perfume,

890
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,160
and Prada's high heels.

891
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
What do you think?

892
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,160
The conditions are very simple.

893
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,440
As long as you are in court,

894
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
don't talk nonsense.

895
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,480
I have offended Chu Shaohua.

896
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,280
You want me to offend Tian Dashao again?

897
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,200
Then how can I live in Shanghai?

898
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,360
As long as Shaohua can be released without any crime,

899
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,040
I'll give you 2000 more silver dollars.

900
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
It's enough for you to live anywhere,

901
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,440
even abroad.

902
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,840
Kang Erniu,

903
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,080
if Chu Shaohua

904
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,480
is as generous as you,

905
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,960
there is no future.

906
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,000
Right?

907
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,760
You are talking in the court.

908
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Are you out of your mind?

909
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,880
Your Honor,

910
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
this is the testimony of Wang Shuangxi

911
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,840
and Song Dawei,

912
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,160
the partners of the Chinese medicine department.

913
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,000
They confirmed that

914
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,880
Chu Shaohua had a close relationship with a man

915
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,840
before the crime.

916
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,640
They planned to leave with this man.

917
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,480
This is the testimony of the deceased,

918
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,880
Chen Zhangshi's sister,

919
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,200
Song Zhangshi.

920
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,600
He confirmed that

921
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,200
before the crime,

922
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,440
his mother, Chen Zhangshi,

923
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,240
opposed Chu Shaohua's marriage.

924
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,640
But Chu Shaohua was alone.

925
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,240
Their relationship was like a fire.

926
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,160
The evidence is more than comprehensive.

927
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,360
We have a reason to infer

928
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,720
that Chu Shaohua killed Chen Zhangshi,

929
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,800
Chen Ershun and Chen Xuan

930
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
to achieve his purpose of marrying again,

931
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,320
and used the bandits to rob and destroy the city.

932
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,880
You are talking nonsense.

933
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,200
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,080
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm sorry.

946
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'm sorry.

947
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'm sorry.

948
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm sorry.

949
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm sorry.

950
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm sorry.

951
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm sorry.

952
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm sorry.

953
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm sorry.

954
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm sorry.

955
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm sorry.

956
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
