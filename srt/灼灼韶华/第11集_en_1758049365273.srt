1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be honest

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk this life in a gentle way

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sea and the sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the sea, the smoke is the wind

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That is my knife in my eyes

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world can't be melted, then let it be

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain will turn around

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the biggest night star

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If the world can't be melted, then let it be

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My Little Princess

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
France? Why are we going there?

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Looking for a way to save the country and its people.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You haven't done this business yet.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That is not a business. That is my career.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Your career should be here.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
As long as the country is in the dark,

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The situation of the people is not changing.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I will not give up.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I will not give up.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You have done so much for so many years.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You can't go back to your home.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can't see your family.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You will die for a lifetime.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
For what?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The country is still so weak, the society is still so messy.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is the point of doing this?

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This time it is different.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What is different?

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My most respected friends

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In France, the Youth Communist Party of China was established.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I want to join them.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I believe that this time we have found the real rescue.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In the end,

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You still don't want to go home, right?

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are enough in the family.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
When the country is rich and the people are healthy,

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I will go home.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will focus on helping my brother and serving my mother.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tell me.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How much money do you need to go to France?

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How much money?

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you, brother.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I still have a little savings.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And the purpose of our study is

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To work hard and study hard.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To do the work of the hard worker.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I don't need money.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't listen to you.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't need your money.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Brother.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What you have done for me

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Is too much.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why do you say this?

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I really think you have no way.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's go.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hurry up and go home with me.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I haven't seen you for six years.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I haven't seen you for six years.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come on.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Master.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I miss you.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That ungrateful son.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He has lost his medicine shop.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How can I live in the future?

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Master.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mother.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go to bed early.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How can I sleep?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How can I live in the future?

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How to live today.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How to live in the future.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I mean.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Beijing's medicine shop is gone.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Isn't the Chinese medicine shop still there?

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't worry.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
In the future.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
As long as there are me and Xuanxuan.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are indispensable.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
After the boss.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I really have to rely on you.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Get up.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Boss.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There is something.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have to tell you.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You say it.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This second son is back.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Can't stay at home all the time.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Always have to do things.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Or you are in the Chinese medicine shop.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You find him a job.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This child has no heart.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In addition to being cheated, he is bullied.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If he can follow you.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I believe him.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mother.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Never.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He is the brother of Shun.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He is like this now.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Can you see it?

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How to say it?

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Elder sister-in-law is like a mother.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Since the day his father took over the Chinese medicine shop.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I and his second son.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No relationship.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This child did.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I tell you.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He is too much.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I remember once.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I was angry.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I can't give him a second son.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This thing is over.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We are still a family.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mother.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because of the fate with Shun.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I am a family with you.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But I am not with Chen Ershun.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Listen to my advice.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Spare people.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You are his mother.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You are willing to spare him.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's your business.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I am not his mother.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I won't spare him.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will never spare him.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Second uncle has nothing now.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Except for a disease.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You pity him.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I made him sick.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why should I pity him?

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
In my place.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He is not pitiful at all.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He only has hatred.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Mother.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Elder sister-in-law.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Listen to me.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I haven't finished.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You come to my Chen family.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I never asked you for anything.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I beg you this time.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You help Ershun.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Mother.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I tell you.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Anything can be discussed with me.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But this thing can't.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And you can't tell me about this thing again.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do you know?

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I will leave if there is nothing.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Elder sister-in-law.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Even if Ershun can't do it.

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Song brother can do it.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can't be your family.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You don't need any of them.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If others know it.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They will think you are a traitor.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You are my business partner.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But mother.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I tell you.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There is someone in the pharmacy.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Song brother can do it.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But he can only be a servant.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is it ok?

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ok.

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ok.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I will go back if it's ok.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Pickle.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Isn't that a servant?

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Shaohua.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Your brother Chu Shaozhong was the boss of Chichun Drugstore.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Now you ask me to be a pickling warden.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I think a pickling warden is appropriate.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Not appropriate.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If you want to call me.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can only be a manager.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I will do it.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You are a good maid.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will do it.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,960
I'm a shopkeeper.

184
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
You're a shopkeeper.

185
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm an outsider.

186
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,240
You'd rather be a shopkeeper

187
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,600
than a brother.

188
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,760
Brother, it's two different things.

189
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
Then I'm sorry.

190
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
You're smart.

191
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,480
It's important to be a shopkeeper.

192
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,120
I can't afford to lose that person.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,880
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
You don't need me to be a shopkeeper.

195
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,160
Just lend me 100 silver.

196
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,680
100 silver?

197
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,080
What are you going to do?

198
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,560
I've seen a lot of business.

199
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,000
I still need 100 silver.

200
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,080
What business?

201
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,360
Don't worry about it.

202
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,600
I'll make money anyway.

203
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,320
I'll return it to you when I make money.

204
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,800
If you don't tell me,

205
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,720
I can't lend you.

206
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,040
It's okay to tell you.

207
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,720
I plan to go to Henan with Boss Wang

208
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,560
to sell wood.

209
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,880
Which Boss Wang?

210
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
The friend of the boss of the Dongseng He family.

211
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,920
Do you know about wood business?

212
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,880
I just followed you here.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,240
I know everything.

214
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,440
Brother.

216
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,160
I still can't lend you the money.

217
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,720
Shaohua.

218
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,600
It's not okay.

219
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,760
It's not okay.

220
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,640
You're trying to be nice to your brother.

221
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,320
No.

222
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,760
I think

223
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,840
the business

224
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,760
doesn't sound reliable.

225
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,200
Why not?

226
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,080
I understand.

227
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,400
Since I sold Chichun Hall,

228
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,240
I've become

229
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,040
a unreliable person in your heart.

230
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,840
Right?

231
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,480
Brother, it's not like that.

232
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,560
Brother.

233
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,240
Mother.

234
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,400
Where's your sister-in-law's meal?

235
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
It's reserved.

236
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,680
Where's Shun'er?

237
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,120
She's still sleeping.

238
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,400
What time is it?

239
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,440
She's still sleeping here.

240
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,360
Shun'er.

241
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,360
Shun'er.

242
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,440
Look at my handsome ass.

243
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,440
Shun'er.

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,920
What's the matter?

245
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,160
You're not deaf.

246
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,600
What's the matter?

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,960
Give her the chopsticks.

248
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,000
Give her the bowl.

249
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
Right away.

250
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,520
There's no meat.

251
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,640
You're giving me a reward.

252
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,960
Why do you eat meat?

253
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,120
Here.

254
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,360
Where are you going?

255
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,320
It's too plain. I can't swallow it.

256
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Is there meat?

257
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,320
There's one more bowl.

258
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,480
I'll save it for tonight.

259
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,480
Give it to her.

260
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,720
Shun'er, eat it.

261
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,560
Sit down.

262
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,400
Let's eat.

263
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,080
Mother.

264
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,560
Give me five yuan.

265
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,080
Why do you need money?

266
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,880
I'll treat my friends to dinner tonight.

267
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,520
I want to see

268
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,920
if there's any business to do.

269
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,240
You're still doing business?

270
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,320
If I don't do business,

271
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,920
how can I start over?

272
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,960
I have no money.

273
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,080
Isn't there money in your wallet?

274
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,200
I can't give you that money.

275
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,040
Mother, just five yuan.

276
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
I don't want it if I have more.

277
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,880
Just five yuan, okay?

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,560
Shun'er, listen to me.

279
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,400
I'll feed you, drink you, and live with you.

280
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,880
You can do whatever you want.

281
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,600
But you need money.

282
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,040
No.

283
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,280
Mother.

284
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
My mother.

285
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,440
Mother.

286
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,680
I know you love me.

287
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
You're the best mother to me.

288
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,360
Stop talking nonsense.

289
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,080
Stop it.

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,680
Mother.

291
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
My friends are doing big business.

292
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,360
As long as they're willing to help me,

293
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,880
I can stand up again.

294
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
Believe me.

295
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,400
I swear to God.

296
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,520
I swear to you, too.

297
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,760
I can't give you any more money.

298
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,640
I don't have any money.

299
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,520
Eat first.

300
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
You're not giving me money?

301
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,920
No.

302
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,160
Eat.

303
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,160
I don't want to eat.

304
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,120
I'm starving to death.

305
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,360
You...

306
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,160
Are you blind?

307
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
What's going on?

308
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,920
My meat.

309
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,600
My bowl.

310
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,800
Come on.

311
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,040
Chu.

312
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,400
Eat more.

313
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,160
You're leaving in a few days.

314
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,680
There's not much to eat after you leave.

315
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,000
Where are you going, uncle?

316
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,760
To France.

317
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Where is France?

318
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,280
Europe.

319
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,240
When are you leaving?

320
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,400
I booked a ticket for the third day of next month.

321
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,760
It's only a few days away.

322
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,320
You're only back for a few days.

323
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
It's not easy for us to get together

324
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,680
and separate again.

325
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,280
You don't know that your brother...

326
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,760
Good men are wise.

327
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,640
Why do you say that?

328
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,240
Mom.

329
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,080
This is for you.

330
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
Thank you for understanding me.

331
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,640
Here.

332
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,360
Chu.

333
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,800
I have one more thing to tell you.

334
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,640
Go ahead.

335
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,360
There's a saying in the Flower-Mulan Pond.

336
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,800
A soul is a dream, a heart is a mother.

337
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,800
You're out there alone.

338
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,560
You must protect yourself.

339
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,600
If you have another one or two more,

340
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
I won't be able to live.

341
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,760
Mom.

342
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,280
Don't worry.

343
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,880
I'll cherish my life.

344
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,080
Brother.

345
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,320
Sister-in-law.

346
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,160
I'll drink this to you.

347
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,080
Thank you for being there for me

348
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
when I was away.

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,800
Okay.

350
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,800
Thank you, too.

351
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,920
Thank you for loving our country.

352
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,320
Uncle.

353
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,440
We must live in peace

354
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,800
in this trip to France.

355
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,720
Sit down.

356
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,280
Let's eat.

357
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,560
Come on.

358
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,400
Let's eat.

359
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,360
Uncle.

360
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,840
Try the braised chicken.

361
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
It's brought back from Qi State.

362
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
You can't eat it outside.

363
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,920
Is Qi State still so lively?

364
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,240
It's more lively than before.

365
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,400
Are the opera troupe of Yongshuo River still performing?

366
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,440
They moved out early.

367
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,400
They opened a pharmacy there.

368
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,560
A pharmacy?

369
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,080
Speaking of that pharmacy,

370
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,760
Mom.

371
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
Do you remember the yurong powder

372
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,320
that was popular a few years ago?

373
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,520
Yes.

374
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,320
The pharmacy was opened by the young lady

375
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,200
of Chen Family who sold yurong powder.

376
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,720
Didn't their family

377
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,520
do business in Beijing?

378
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,920
I heard that her husband died.

379
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
So she went back to Qi State to open a pharmacy.

380
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,320
This woman is really capable.

381
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,080
Yes.

382
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,000
She's the daughter of the Chu family of Chichun Hall.

383
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,440
Eat slowly.

384
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,520
The End

385
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,280
Shuangxi.

386
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,280
Wake up in the middle of the night.

387
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,680
Don't knock on the door for the guest.

388
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,280
Don't worry, Young Lady.

389
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm leaving.

390
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,600
Okay.

391
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,480
When did he leave?

392
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,640
He left before dawn.

393
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,240
He said he was going to Qi State to see an old friend.

394
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,760
Yes.

395
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,760
He also left a letter.

396
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,620
Thisoon!

397
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,060
It's...

398
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
It's you.

399
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
It's me.

400
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,340
She is 받з

401
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,340
What?

402
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,280
She has feуч medza side.

403
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,040
I don't want to peddle because I'm embarrassed.

404
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,800
When did you come back?

405
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,000
Just now.

406
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,800
I...

407
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,400
I heard about you.

408
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,240
Are you okay?

409
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,760
We should get along.

410
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,000
I have a pharmacy there.

411
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,040
I'm doing business.

412
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,920
You are finally doing business.

413
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,880
There is a cameo in the story.

414
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,840
How are you going to S wandering?

415
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,360
How about I sell the company

416
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,680
to raise my daughter, Xuanxuan,

417
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
to be a rich woman

418
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,360
and take care of

419
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,840
Shun's mother.

420
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,880
That's good.

421
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,760
How about you?

422
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,360
Are you all right?

423
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,040
As planned.

424
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,720
Then you

425
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,440
have to go back to the capital.

426
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,320
What's your plan?

427
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm going to

428
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,120
France in a few days.

429
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,880
Have a safe trip.

430
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,400
It's getting late.

431
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,000
I should go back.

432
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,360
My daughter is waiting for me.

433
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,760
All right.

434
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,920
Go.

435
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,800
Let's go to the Western Prefecture.

436
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,960
Women can't walk on the doorstep.

437
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
What era is it?

438
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,000
You're still talking about the men's and women's cup.

439
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,080
Come with me.

440
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,320
Where are you going?

441
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,360
No.

442
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,760
Don't be afraid.

443
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,880
So this is how it feels

444
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,440
to walk in from the front door of the temple.

445
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,600
Thank you.

446
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,480
You're welcome.

447
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Now it's a republic.

448
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
It's time for men and women to be equal.

449
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,480
Men and women to be equal?

450
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,920
Yes.

451
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,960
Women can do

452
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,440
what men can do.

453
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
Women should enjoy

454
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,480
the rights of all men.

455
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,120
I want to open a drug store.

456
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,040
So I can open a drug store,

457
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,960
do business,

458
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,400
and rebuild our Chishun Drugstore.

459
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,080
Right?

460
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,920
Of course.

461
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,640
That means

462
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,880
one day

463
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,280
I can be Xia Yuan, too.

464
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,320
My true love

465
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,120
Xia Yuan

466
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,760
is nothing.

467
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
In Qizhou,

468
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,480
Xia Yuan may be one of the best.

469
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,400
But if you walk out of Qizhou,

470
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,440
out of China,

471
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,720
and see the outside world,

472
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,520
you'll realize

473
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,760
Xia Yuan is nothing.

474
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,000
The outside world?

475
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,200
Shaohua,

476
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,760
with your intelligence and courage,

477
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,720
as long as you're willing to walk out,

478
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
you can do great things.

479
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
One day

480
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,720
I can do great things, too.

481
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,960
You'll have me in your heart.

482
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
I have something to do.

483
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,240
I have to go.

484
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,560
Can I see you again?

485
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,120
Yes.

486
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
The second one is following us.

487
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,480
Hurry up.

488
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,000
Hurry up.

489
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,600
Grandma.

490
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,880
Zhen'an,

491
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,200
your task today

492
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,760
is to finish the stickers.

493
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,200
Your task today

494
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,440
is to get the Zhejiang special.

495
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,840
Xunxuan, you're great.

496
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm leaving.

497
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,560
Song Ping,

498
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,200
where's the food?

499
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,200
I'll go get it.

500
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Are you waiting for me?

501
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,720
I was waiting here

502
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,040
last night.

503
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,400
I came back to Qizhou

504
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,240
for you.

505
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,640
What's up?

506
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,800
Are you

507
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,360
willing to go to France with me?

508
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,800
For the past six years,

509
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,480
I've been wearing this veil

510
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,680
and I've never forgotten you.

511
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,800
Xiaochun, you...

512
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,080
If Chen Dashun is still alive,

513
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,560
I won't disturb him.

514
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,400
But now,

515
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
Chen Dashun is gone.

516
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
I want to fight for myself again.

517
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,440
Four years ago,

518
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,520
you said that this life would end here.

519
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,000
I respect your choice.

520
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,320
What I want to say today four years later

521
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,000
is that we should start over.

522
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,560
Shaohua,

523
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,200
come with me.

524
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,200
Xia Chu,

525
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
I'm not the same Chu Shaohua anymore.

526
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,000
In my eyes,

527
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,240
you're always the same Chu Shaohua.

528
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
I married someone

529
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,320
and had a child.

530
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
No matter how many times you married

531
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,880
and had children,

532
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,320
you're the one

533
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,840
I want.

534
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,360
Xia Chu,

535
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,440
I'm not your brother.

536
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,600
Your brother is Xia Yuan.

537
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,760
You're the second son of the Xia family.

538
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,840
And I'm

539
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,400
the second son of Chen Dashun.

540
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,440
I'm the widow of a poor family

541
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,000
and the mother of a three-year-old child.

542
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,440
It's impossible for us to be together.

543
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,520
I don't care.

544
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,960
I don't care who you're the widow

545
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,800
and who's the mother.

546
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I don't care about your family.

547
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
The only thing I care about

548
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,920
is you.

549
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,320
Why me?

550
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,800
Because we're of the same kind.

551
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,880
When I held your hand

552
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,280
and went through the door

553
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,680
of that woman,

554
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,040
we were of the same kind.

555
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,600
It's already engraved in our bones.

556
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,120
We're of the same kind.

557
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,840
But we have different feelings.

558
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,680
We're both single now.

559
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,160
I have another singer.

560
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,800
Is it your daughter?

561
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,680
Of course we'll take her with us.

562
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,360
Not only that.

563
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,880
What else?

564
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,280
Sister-in-law.

565
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,080
Sister-in-law.

566
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,520
Sister-in-law.

567
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,840
Bad news.

568
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,240
Something happened to the pharmacy.

569
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,120
Give me a reason.

570
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,040
I promised to be a good daughter.

571
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,880
But the pharmacy in Hua Chuan

572
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,240
is closed.

573
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,680
Sister-in-law.

574
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,160
It's already like this.

575
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,320
You can't say that.

576
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,120
We don't know what happened.

577
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,320
Come and have a look.

578
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,400
The pharmacy in Hua Chuan sells fake medicine.

579
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,360
Don't talk nonsense.

580
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,240
It's not true.

581
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,280
Don't talk nonsense.

582
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,760
Before we investigate it,

583
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,520
if it's about Hua Chuan,

584
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,280
we'll take responsibility.

585
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,400
If not,

586
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,440
we won't be wronged.

587
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,080
Everyone, come and have a look.

588
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,920
The pharmacy in Hua Chuan doesn't sell fake medicine.

589
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
Madam, what's going on?

590
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,920
It's like this when we opened the door today.

591
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,320
They said it's our medicine.

592
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,400
I said I wanted to check.

593
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,000
But she didn't let me.

594
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
I said I'd get a doctor for her.

595
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,920
But she didn't let me.

596
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,760
She's here to make trouble.

597
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,080
You want to check?

598
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,960
You're still beating me?

599
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,480
Don't touch me.

600
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Don't touch me.

601
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,000
You're beating me.

602
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,440
You're beating me.

603
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,120
Stop it.

604
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,080
Madam.

605
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,240
What do you want?

606
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,480
What do I want?

607
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,960
She's lying here.

608
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,080
Can't you see?

609
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Listen to me.

610
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,240
You must compensate me with ten thousand silver dollars.

611
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,040
I can't even get one more dollar.

612
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,840
How is that possible?

613
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,720
Don't wrong us.

614
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,160
If you don't compensate us,

615
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,600
we'll smash your pharmacy.

616
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,040
What are you doing?

617
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,920
Who dares to smash the pharmacy?

618
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,720
I'll fight with you today.

619
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,760
My man.

620
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
If you're gone,

621
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,720
how can I live?

622
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,880
Her man's business

623
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,840
has nothing to do with us.

624
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,880
Jiang, shut up.

625
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,960
Madam.

626
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm sorry.

627
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,360
Yesterday, our pharmacy was on fire.

628
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,040
When we were preparing the medicine,

629
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,440
we were careless

630
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,480
and mixed up the medicine.

631
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,120
That's why

632
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,600
your man's condition is like this.

633
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,800
She's really a woman.

634
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,160
She's really a woman.

635
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,480
She's really a woman.

636
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,840
Then you admit it.

637
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
Of course I have to admit it.

638
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,360
But you don't have to worry.

639
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,680
I think your man's condition is quite serious.

640
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
It's important to save him.

641
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,120
I have a special effect medicine.

642
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,320
Once you take it,

643
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,960
his disease will be cured immediately.

644
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,600
Wang.

645
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,920
Please go get five-poison grass.

646
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,240
Five-poison grass?

647
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,960
Go.

648
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,160
Are you kidding me?

649
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,120
Five-poison grass is very poisonous.

650
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,240
Ordinary people just need to take one thousand.

651
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,800
They have to die immediately.

652
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,400
Yes.

653
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,760
You don't know.

654
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,840
Ordinary people are addicted to five-poison grass.

655
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,800
They are indeed going to lose their lives.

656
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,680
But people who take mixed medicine

657
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,640
can save themselves

658
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,920
by taking five-poison grass.

659
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,840
This is what we call

660
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,000
poison against poison.

661
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,320
Madam.

662
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,880
Okay.

663
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,680
Wait.

664
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,480
You should explain it to everyone.

665
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,600
If my man takes your medicine,

666
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,320
he will be in trouble.

667
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,120
What will you say?

668
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,720
If he takes it, he will be in trouble.

669
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,560
I will risk my life.

670
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,760
If he takes this,

671
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,480
if there is any accident,

672
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,360
I will take this.

673
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Forget it.

674
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,520
No.

675
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,640
It's important to save him.

676
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,760
Wang, hold him.

677
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,600
I don't want to.

678
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,680
I don't need to.

679
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,440
I'm fine.

680
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,240
Save him.

681
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
We can make a good picture.

682
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,800
We...

683
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,200
Come on.

684
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,120
Two more people.

685
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,000
Hold his legs.

686
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,520
Don't.

687
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,680
Help.

688
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,360
Hold his legs.

689
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,080
Open your mouth.

690
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,400
Open your mouth.

691
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,440
Open your mouth.

692
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,960
Let go.

693
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,640
Open your mouth.

694
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm fine.

695
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,960
I'm fine.

696
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,560
Really?

697
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,880
Yes.

698
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,720
What's wrong?

699
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,160
Let's go.

700
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,440
Let's go.

701
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,480
Hurry up.

702
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,280
Wang, keep this.

703
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Don't let people misbehave.

704
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,520
Zhu,

705
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,480
clean up here.

706
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,080
Okay.

707
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,280
Song.

708
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,880
Sister-in-law.

709
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,680
Bring some tea.

710
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,560
Okay.

711
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Everyone was

712
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
so excited

713
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,400
that they were thirsty.

714
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,560
Jiang,

715
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,080
tell the guests who were disturbed

716
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,920
that our price is all discounted today.

717
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,400
Okay.

718
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,360
Okay.

719
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,040
Okay.

720
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,720
Okay.

721
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,760
You must be concerned about

722
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,880
your career

723
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,400
besides your daughter.

724
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,920
Mr. Xia,

725
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
please come in.

726
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,120
Okay.

727
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,080
Everyone, leave.

728
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,880
Leave.

729
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,000
Dear guests,

730
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,880
we, Young Mistress,

731
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,720
thank you

732
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,200
for discounting the price today.

733
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,160
It hurts.

734
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,560
You're afraid of the pain,

735
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,760
but you blocked it for me.

736
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,760
I'm afraid you'll be in pain.

737
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,160
Young Mistress,

738
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,200
it's not a problem.

739
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,840
What's not a problem?

740
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,160
You like to do business.

741
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,920
You should go to France with me.

742
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,440
There's the oldest

743
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,360
business school in the world.

744
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,480
You can learn law,

745
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,280
accounting,

746
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,160
management,

747
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,880
marketing,

748
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,400
and market there.

749
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,160
After you graduate,

750
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,280
you can do business

751
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,000
all over the world.

752
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,600
I believe

753
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
you can do business

754
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,400
in France.

755
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,240
I believe you can do business

756
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,040
in France.

757
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,640
You can open your eyes more.

758
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,400
You can do more business.

759
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,760
Zhuzi.

760
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,120
Young Mistress.

761
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,000
Send Mr. Xia out.

762
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
Mr. Xia, please.

763
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,120
Shaohua,

764
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,120
do big business.

765
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,840
It's a national matter

766
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,320
to start a new business.

767
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,800
Xia Chu is back?

768
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,080
How come I don't know about this?

769
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,440
Mr. Xia didn't tell you?

770
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,600
You... you know it.

771
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Why did Xia Chu

772
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,880
stop us?

773
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,320
How can I know?

774
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,800
If he hadn't

775
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,080
protected that widow

776
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,120
at the scene,

777
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,640
I would have

778
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,120
smashed the pharmacy.

779
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,240
That's strange.

780
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,120
Xia Chu

781
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,240
is not interested

782
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,520
in the medicine business.

783
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,880
In the same year,

784
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,160
Mr. Xia

785
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,000
came back

786
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,400
with a broken heart.

787
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
He wanted to

788
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,120
start a revolution

789
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,040
but he didn't go home.

790
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,240
Maybe he changed his mind.

791
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,840
He can

792
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,440
start a revolution with money.

793
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,240
Of course.

794
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,640
Of course he can.

795
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,680
Sit down.

796
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,400
Tell me.

797
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,760
Did Xia Chu really

798
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
come back

799
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,240
to help his brother

800
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,120
to start a business?

801
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,480
Okay.

802
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,600
I understand.

803
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,840
Think about it.

804
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,280
No matter

805
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,560
who is interested

806
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,920
in that widow,

807
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,960
they already

808
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,080
see her as their own.

809
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,000
So

810
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,120
Xia Chu

811
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,920
will definitely

812
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,240
hire that widow, right?

813
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,320
Are you going to use that widow

814
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
to replace you?

815
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,160
This is already a big deal.

816
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,520
Don't kill us.

817
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
If that's the case,

818
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,560
we'll quit.

819
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,200
Why?

820
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,840
As soon as I leave,

821
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,880
Mr. Xia will be charged.

822
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,680
Can we really

823
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,040
investigate the money we've been in?

824
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,240
It's too hard.

825
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,640
It's too hard for us.

826
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
If this gets out,

827
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,880
who dares to

828
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,280
use us?

829
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,800
What should we do?

830
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,800
What should we do?

831
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,760
If he doesn't trust me,

832
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,520
I'll just give him a beating.

833
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,520
Didn't he

834
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,680
use that widow?

835
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,080
I'll

836
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,560
just let that widow disappear.

837
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,280
If he doesn't get caught,

838
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,360
he'll still use me.

839
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,240
Right.

840
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,520
You're right.

841
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,560
Come on.

842
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,400
Come on.

843
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,120
Drink.

844
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,760
I don't want you to come

845
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,360
and I don't want you to worry.

846
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,760
I don't want you to get the wrong message.

847
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,560
The little girl's words are all...

848
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,480
Mr. Liang.

849
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,480
Little girl, little...

850
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,200
Mr. Liang.

851
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,280
You're quite ambitious.

852
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,920
You're eating and drinking,

853
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,120
but you're still singing.

854
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,640
Sit down.

855
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,840
Sit down.

856
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,840
You three

857
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,560
will spend the night here tonight.

858
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,200
I'll arrange a car

859
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,160
to send you back to Shanxi tomorrow.

860
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,400
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

861
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
Drink less.

862
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,360
You have to work tomorrow.

863
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,320
No, no.

864
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
I'll just take a little punishment.

865
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,360
Wait.

866
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,080
You went to the Chinese medicine shop today

867
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,720
and got yourself in trouble.

868
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,880
It's you.

869
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,760
Don't mention it.

870
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,840
Just for this,

871
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,320
Mr. Liang

872
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,200
scolded us very hard.

873
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,920
You went to the Chinese medicine shop?

874
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,720
You're so ignorant.

875
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,920
No.

876
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,800
What do you mean?

877
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,600
Even the bandits and the rabbits

878
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,720
were killed

879
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,520
by the young master of the Chen family.

880
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,040
You...

881
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,880
You...

882
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,120
You're no match for him.

883
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,800
The shopkeeper is here.

884
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,880
Miss Xuan is here too.

885
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,560
Call me Dr. Guan.

886
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,520
Dr. Guan.

887
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,560
He got a cold last night.

888
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,840
I said I'd bring him here today

889
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,040
to show you.

890
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,720
Okay.

891
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,560
Miss Xuan, come here.

892
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,160
Sit here.

893
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,800
Come on, put your hands on it.

894
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,840
Let me show you.

895
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,720
Xuanxuan,

896
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,400
listen to Dr. Guan, okay?

897
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,560
Okay.

898
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,640
Stretch out your tongue.

899
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,560
Let me see.

900
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,240
Okay.

901
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,080
Brother Wang,

902
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,360
the medicine of Master Xie

903
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,320
and Young Mistress Xu

904
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,160
are ready.

905
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,720
Okay.

906
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,960
Zhu,

907
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,200
bring the medicine.

908
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,880
I haven't finished

909
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,960
the medicine of the Zhang family and Fengqiao family.

910
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,080
How about you...

911
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,160
I...

912
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,400
I still have eight sets of medicine

913
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,440
to be prepared.

914
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,880
I can't leave now.

915
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,320
I'll bring the medicine.

916
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,640
Young Mistress, thank you.

917
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,840
Master Xie?

918
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,440
And Young Mistress Xu.

919
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,040
Okay.

920
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,560
It's all right.

921
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,760
It's sacred blows here.

922
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,480
oil

923
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
O difficult

924
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,320
I said running

925
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,480
здесь

926
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,080
You are here.

927
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,520
Here.

928
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,960
Take it while it's still hot.

929
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,280
I'll go and get the medicine.

930
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Thank you, Doctor.

931
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,080
Dr. Guan, where's Xuanxuan?

932
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,280
Shopkeeper, Xuanxuan is in the backyard.

933
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,680
Xuanxuan is fine.

934
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,680
She just got a cold.

935
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
I prescribed her two medicines.

936
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,680
She should be fine after taking them.

937
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,080
But these two days, you need to be careful.

938
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,680
Don't catch a cold again.

939
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,880
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Guan.

940
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,680
I'll go and get the medicine.

941
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
Okay.

942
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,880
Dreaming of home,

943
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,080
dear home, home,

944
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,480
home, home, my childhood and mother.

945
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,480
When my wake,

946
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,880
is sweet to find,

947
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,880
I think dreaming of home

948
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,280
and mother.

949
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,080
Xuanxuan is so great.

950
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,680
Mom, I can sing English songs.

951
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,080
You sing so well.

952
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
I can also speak English.

953
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,480
Really?

954
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,680
Come is come.

955
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,880
Go is go.

956
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,480
Yes.

957
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,080
It's yes.

958
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,280
No is no.

959
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,880
What else?

960
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,480
Mommy, I love you.

961
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,680
Mommy, I love you.

962
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,080
Uncle Xia also gave me this.

963
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,480
This is the earth.

964
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,680
We live on the earth.

965
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,080
This is the moon.

966
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,480
The moon revolves around the earth.

967
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,680
This is the sun.

968
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,880
The earth revolves around the sun with the moon.

969
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,680
There are many friends on the earth.

970
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,080
These...

971
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,680
These are all your drawings?

972
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,280
When I was studying in Japan,

973
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,680
I saw a children's drawing book that talked about astronomy.

974
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,280
It made me very interested in it.

975
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,480
I drew one for Xuanxuan with my memory.

976
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,080
You drew it so well.

977
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,680
I found that

978
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,280
Xuanxuan is really very clever.

979
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,480
No matter what it is,

980
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,280
I'll tell Xuanxuan once

981
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
and she'll remember it all.

982
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Right?

983
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,080
Xuanxuan,

984
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,880
Xuanxuan will remember it all, right?

985
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Yes.

986
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,680
Her uncle's drawing book is already ready.

987
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,880
She also learned a lot of words.

988
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,280
But I don't think these are enough.

989
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Xuanxuan should be educated more systematically.

990
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,880
Systemic education is...

991
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,080
Shanghua,

992
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,280
let's take Xuanxuan to France together.

993
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Let her experience the most advanced science and technology

994
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,880
and experience more diverse cultures

995
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,480
and experience more diverse worlds.

996
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,880
Shanghua,

997
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,080
you and Xuanxuan shouldn't be limited to the Chinese medicine shop.

998
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,280
You should be limited to the state of Qi.

999
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,280
You and Xuanxuan

1000
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,280
deserve a broader world.

1001
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,880
Xuanxuan,

1002
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,480
do you want to go to France?

1003
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,080
The wind blows in the heart

1004
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,880
The little wind

1005
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,280
Blows the chaos

1006
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:35,480
The little peony in her heart

1007
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,080
A little bit

1008
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,880
Warms her heart

1009
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,080
She speaks non-stop

1010
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,480
She says winter is still short

1011
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Morpflicht

1012
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,680
Rely on her

1013
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,880
Day by day

1014
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,680
Bit by bit

1015
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,360
Play night by night

1016
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,280
Bit by bit

1017
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,080
bit by bit

1018
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,080
be not lonely anymore

1019
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,440
The waves are far

1020
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,480
Ruin in participant

1021
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,080
I brandish oh sorry for you

1022
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,180
Per secured by the如果

1023
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:24,180
to find the eternal peace in my heart.

1024
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,180
Day by day, night by night,

1025
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,180
there is regret.

1026
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,180
Day by day, night by night,

1027
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,180
I am not lonely anymore.

1028
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,180
The fire is burning, the hope is burning.

1029
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,180
I will fight for you.

1030
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:14,180
I am going to reach the eternal peace in my heart.

1031
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:19,180
Eternal peace.
