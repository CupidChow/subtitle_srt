1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Don't let her control you again.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,440
Do you love me sing it?

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,140
He will...

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,880
I love him sing it in heaven easily.

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,600
Don't let his love Topsy-Tux,

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,180
have my heart cooker in heaven.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,100
What am I thinking

8
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,540
are you going to be just like me?

9
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,500
Call me a wooden doll

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,260
And you will be not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,040
405!

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,160
You'veæ¨¡usted as slow as a field.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
I can't buy a house in the city

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,160
I have to walk this life in a gentle way

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,160
But I heard the wind from the sea and the sky

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,160
It said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,160
You are the waves, you are the wind

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,160
How can you be lost

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
I can't hold the bow and the arrow in my eyes

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,160
If you don't want to, just break it

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,160
My bitter pain will turn around

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,160
I am my biggest night star

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,160
I don't want to break through the wall

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,160
My Little Princess

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
Episode 16

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Are you hurt?

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
No, I'm fine

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Don't be so impulsive next time

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,160
Mu Ziru won't let you go

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,160
I don't want to let them go

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
I just want to move

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Miss Bai asked for this

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
She still left

34
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Brother, don't be sad

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
You can buy a big diamond for Miss Bai in two days

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Maybe she will change her mind

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm afraid I need two big diamonds to get her back

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Then buy it

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Buy it?

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Do you know how much are two big diamonds?

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
500 silver

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Brother, there is a big deal

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,160
My friend wants these three people to disappear forever

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
We only do business

45
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
This is the deposit of 30%

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
We will pay 70% after the 10%

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Your boss knows the rules

48
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
There is a dinner next Wednesday

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,160
All three of them will go

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,160
The best time to do business is on the west

51
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Who else is on the west?

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Don't worry, the dinner starts at 7 o'clock

53
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,160
But the three of them will leave at 16 o'clock

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,160
So no one else will be on the chessboard

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Brother, Mr. Jin just said

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Don't let us do business like this

57
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
If it's another business, forget it

58
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,160
But I will do this even without gold bars

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
If Mr. Jin knows

60
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
If Mr. Jin knows

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
It's the Tian family's business

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
It has nothing to do with us

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Tian family?

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Since Mr. Tian lost the position of chairman of the National Medicine Congress

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,160
He hates Xia Yuan

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
I know

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
And

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Brother, if we kill Chu Shaohua

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,160
You and Miss Bai will never get back together

70
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Let's make money first

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Let's go

72
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Oh, you should wear my new dress

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
No, I'm going to talk business

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
I'm not going to film

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Talk business needs to be dressed up

76
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
I give you this

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
You put it on your head

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,160
You are the most beautiful girl in the world

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
No matter what you have been through

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
You are always the most beautiful girl in my heart

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
I'm going to the hospital

82
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
I'll be back in a minute

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
I'll be back in a minute

84
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
I'll be back in a minute

85
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
I'll be back in a minute

86
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
I'll be back in a minute

87
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
I'll be back in a minute

88
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
I'll be back in a minute

89
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
I'll be back in a minute

90
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
I'll be back in a minute

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
I'll be back in a minute

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I'll be back in a minute

93
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
I'll be back in a minute

94
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I'll be back in a minute

95
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I'll be back in a minute

96
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
You're on time

97
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Brother, let's go in

98
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Have you confirmed the room?

99
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Yes, 202

100
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Have you confirmed the room?

101
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I've shown them the photos

102
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
See them out

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Go

104
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Go

105
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Sir, your dishes are ready

106
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Please enjoy

107
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Brother

108
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
How's it going down there?

109
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
The police have withdrawn

110
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
One of them was arrested

111
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
What happened?

112
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
It seems to be a poacher's birthday

113
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
The police went to make trouble

114
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
They shot

115
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
They are so ungrateful

116
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Yes

117
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Thank you, sir

118
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Go

119
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
How big do you think it will be?

120
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
It won't be too big

121
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,160
But it will bury a seed

122
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Eat some fertilizer in the summer

123
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,160
The seed will sprout

124
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
I'm a man of my word

125
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Since I'm on the case

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,160
I won't be involved in the dirty business

127
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,160
How dare you buy my brother's work?

128
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,160
You're talking nonsense

129
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Master, it's Master Tian

130
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
I thought you knew about it

131
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
How dare you fool me?

132
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
I asked Master Tian

133
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
He said it had nothing to do with him

134
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
He won't admit it now

135
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
You're taking advantage of me

136
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Damn it

137
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Damn it

138
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
You're a man of your word

139
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
You're making dirty money

140
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
You can make money

141
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
You should be more efficient

142
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
when you work

143
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
But you wronged someone

144
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Wronged someone

145
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
It's okay if you wronged someone

146
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
You even ran into the police station

147
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
He was caught

148
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
You've done a lot of bad things

149
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
A lot

150
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Listen

151
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
If I can't get into the police station

152
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
and get involved in it

153
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
I'll throw you into the Huangpu River

154
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Do you hear me?

155
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Master, don't worry

156
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I've told others

157
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Zeng Haosan was expelled from the Qing

158
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
He's not from the Qing

159
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
No matter what he does

160
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
it won't affect your political future

161
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Bullshit

162
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
It doesn't matter if you say it

163
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
You're the chief of the Procurement Bureau

164
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
How many people are jealous?

165
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
How many people want to pull me down?

166
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
You're being punished

167
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Do you know?

168
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Master, I'm sorry

169
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Please forgive me

170
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
The police station

171
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
You should pay for it

172
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
If I know

173
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
you're trying to make trouble for me

174
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
I won't forgive you

175
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I know, master

176
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Don't worry

177
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Get out

178
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
How much cash do we have?

179
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
More than 30,000

180
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Take them all out

181
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
I hope the 30,000

182
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
can help the police station get rid of the evil

183
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
What about Zeng Haosan?

184
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
He'll stay in jail

185
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Not him?

186
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
If he didn't turn 302 into 202

187
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
I would lose so much money

188
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
I would be in trouble

189
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
If I don't throw him into the Huangpu River

190
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
I'll be in trouble

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Brother, calm down

192
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
And

193
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Keep an eye on Chu Shaohua

194
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
After this is settled

195
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
we should find a chance to get rid of him

196
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Otherwise

197
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I'll be blinded

198
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
I understand

199
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Mu Ziru

200
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
will be out of action for a while

201
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
But I think he'll think of

202
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
finding a chance to attack you

203
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
I hope the seed can sprout quickly

204
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Miss Chu

205
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Someone is looking for you

206
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Who?

207
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I don't know

208
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Where is he?

209
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
At the gate

210
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Xiaohua

211
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Xiaohua

212
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
You're still so beautiful

213
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Aunt, call me aunt

214
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Aunt

215
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Xiaohua

216
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Great

217
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Great

218
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Come in

219
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
Come in

220
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Brother

221
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
How's your health these two years?

222
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
I'm fine

223
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
How's your health these two years?

224
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
It's all my fault

225
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
I didn't take care of my mother

226
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
After you jumped into the river

227
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
She was unhappy

228
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Soon

229
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
She left

230
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
She was sick

231
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
She lay on the bed for half a year

232
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
She died in the morning

233
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
After my mother died

234
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
My family was sadder

235
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Your sister-in-law discussed with me

236
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
She said we should go to Beijing

237
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I thought about it

238
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
We sold all the land

239
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
and house

240
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
We went to Beijing

241
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
You sold the land

242
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
that Dachun got back?

243
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
I had no choice

244
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
I was so tired

245
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
I couldn't even get the rent

246
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
I couldn't even get the rent

247
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
I couldn't even get the rent

248
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
I couldn't even get the food

249
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
How did you live

250
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
after you went to Beijing?

251
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
When I first came to Beijing

252
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
I did some business

253
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
But it was not easy

254
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
I lost all my money

255
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
I couldn't go back to Qizhou

256
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I had to pull the cart

257
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Your sister-in-law helped others

258
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
I had to eat

259
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I had to eat

260
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Brother, eat

261
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Eat while you talk

262
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Why don't you eat?

263
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I eat

264
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Then

265
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Brother

266
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
How do you know I'm in Shanghai?

267
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Do you know?

268
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
One day when I pulled the cart

269
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
I met an old friend

270
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
He was a waiter in the pharmacy

271
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
He said you were in Shanghai

272
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
He also talked to the boss

273
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
He said we should do business together

274
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
I was so happy

275
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
First, I was alive for you

276
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Second, I was so successful for you

277
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
I was so successful

278
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
So I took your sister-in-law and your nephew

279
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
to Shanghai to see you

280
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
You eat

281
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
I eat

282
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Boss Wen

283
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
I want to eat the ribs

284
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
I'll order it for you

285
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Braised pork with soy sauce

286
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Okay

287
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Sit down and eat

288
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
I have something to do

289
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I'll go back and buy you western food

290
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
We haven't eaten western food yet

291
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I'll send him away

292
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
I won't send you away

293
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Take care

294
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Eat

295
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Don't come to the store these two days

296
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Take them around

297
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Leave the car and the driver to you

298
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Thank you

299
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
And your quilt and pillow

300
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I'll find someone to send you

301
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
No need

302
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I'll send them to the hotel after dinner

303
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
I won't pay attention to you

304
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Okay

305
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
And

306
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
If my brother and sister-in-law

307
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
What did they tell you

308
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
You don't have to care

309
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
If they

310
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Ask you to do something

311
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Without my consent

312
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
You must not agree

313
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Okay, I know

314
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Thank you

315
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
So many houses

316
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Oh my god

317
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
What are these women wearing

318
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Xiaobao, look

319
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
foreigners

320
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Mom, what is that

321
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
I want to eat that

322
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
I want to eat that

323
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I want to eat that

324
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
I want to eat that

325
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
I want to eat that

326
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I want to eat that

327
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I want to eat that

328
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Don't do it

329
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Mom has no money

330
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Let your aunt buy it for you

331
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Shaohua, how much does this car cost?

332
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
This one

333
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
It costs more than two thousand

334
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
More than two thousand

335
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
More than two thousand

336
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Sister

337
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
You have made a lot of money these years

338
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
You must have made a lot of money

339
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
This car is not mine

340
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
This is the company's

341
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Sister, how much do you earn in the company?

342
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
You can just talk

343
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Xiaobao

344
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
How about my clothes?

345
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Is it good?

346
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
How about it?

347
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Pretty good

348
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Hello, give him a pair of leather shoes

349
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Okay, please wait

350
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Xiaohua, no need

351
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Sister, I also want a pair of leather shoes

352
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
This one

353
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
He also comes

354
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
Good, look at my blue cheongsam

355
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Good

356
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
The red one was also good

357
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Both look good

358
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Sister

359
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
How about both?

360
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Just buy one

361
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Why buy two? Waste

362
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
I didn't want to, you care

363
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Right, sister? Thank you

364
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Thank you

365
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Wrap it up

366
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
This coat is really good

367
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
It's going to be cold

368
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
This cheongsam is outside

369
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
You should wear it

370
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Xiao Zhu, move away

371
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Let me see

372
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
My body

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
This shape

374
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Not bad as my Miss in Shanghai

375
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Not bad

376
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
How about comparing with Xiaohua?

377
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Almost

378
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
How about Xiaohua?

379
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Xiaohua is

380
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
rich, good at dressing

381
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
If I really dress up

382
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I'm afraid I'm better than her

383
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
I'm asking you

384
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Right

385
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
You can't come to Shanghai for nothing

386
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Not for nothing

387
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Look, Xiaohua bought so many things for us

388
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Food, clothes, and clothes

389
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
And bought so many toys and stationery for Xiaobao

390
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
We are full

391
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Where to go? Beijing

392
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Why go back to Beijing?

393
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Xiaohua is here

394
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
There are houses, cars, and companies

395
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
She has a house in Shanghai

396
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
She has a car and a company in Shanghai

397
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
That's her business

398
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
We can be happy for her

399
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
It seems to have nothing to do with us

400
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
You are her brother

401
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
You can be half of her

402
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Half of her things

403
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Should be yours

404
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Let me tell you

405
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
These words

406
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,160
You can say it in front of me

407
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Don't say it in front of Xiaohua

408
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
You know her temper

409
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
OK

410
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
She doesn't recognize you

411
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
She has to recognize Xiaobao

412
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
That's her biological nephew

413
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
That's her only successor

414
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
In the future, when she dies

415
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Her money will be ours

416
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
What are you talking about?

417
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
How can you curse people to die?

418
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
I'm discussing with you

419
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Liu Shanghai

420
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Xiao Zhong

421
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Do you really want to go back

422
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,160
To the car

423
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
To drink porridge with a stick

424
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
To be a coward

425
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
When I was in my hometown

426
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
They said Beijing is good

427
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Here in Shanghai

428
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
I can feel Shanghai

429
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
It's a place where people stay

430
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Compared to Shanghai

431
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
It's a little more commercial

432
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Like our Xiao Zhong

433
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
If you want to develop

434
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
You have to come to Shanghai

435
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
In Beijing, it's not good

436
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
You have to stay in Shanghai

437
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
What's your major?

438
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I didn't tell you

439
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Our Xiao Zhong

440
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Also does medicine business

441
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
But these years

442
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Bad luck

443
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Business failed

444
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Thank you

445
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Xiao Bao is eleven this year

446
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
How many years ago

447
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Sister, look at what you said

448
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Just the two words of your brother

449
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
What school

450
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Just a few words

451
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Sister, a few days ago

452
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
When I was shopping

453
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I passed a few elementary schools

454
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
I was thinking

455
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
If Chu Xiaobao

456
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Can be in Shanghai

457
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Xiaobao

458
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
In terms of education

459
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Beijing atmosphere

460
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Should be stronger than Shanghai

461
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
This is not money

462
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Xiaobao

463
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Xiaobao, use a knife

464
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Go

465
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Aunt, go to the bathroom first

466
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
I have a while, I'll get it for you

467
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Come

468
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Come

469
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Wash it

470
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
This is a fragrance

471
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
You take it and rub it

472
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Can wash the oil on your hands

473
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Xiaobao

474
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Do you want to go to school?

475
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
No

476
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
What do you want to do in the future?

477
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I want to go to the car

478
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
But the car doesn't make money

479
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
If you go to school

480
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
You can study and learn

481
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Then you can make

482
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
More money than the car

483
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,160
I don't have to make money

484
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Your money is mine

485
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Who told you?

486
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
My mother

487
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Said I was your successor

488
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
After you die

489
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Your car and house are mine

490
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Come, wipe your hands

491
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
You go back first

492
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Aunt also wash her hands

493
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Go right away

494
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Go

495
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
Boss Wen

496
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
You see your business is so prosperous

497
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Your store must be short of people

498
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
How about let Shaozhong stay

499
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Help you, okay?

500
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
The personnel of our pharmacy

501
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Mainly manage the shop

502
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
If big brother has any needs

503
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Just tell him

504
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
I believe he will make the most appropriate arrangements

505
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Boss Wen, our sister

506
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Thin face

507
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
I'm embarrassed to tell you

508
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
This is for me

509
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
OK, or later

510
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Boss Wen, let's make it like this

511
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Tomorrow, let Shaozhong go to your place

512
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Okay

513
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
You take care of her brother so much

514
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Shaohai will be your love

515
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
With their brother's help

516
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Your business will get better and better

517
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Is it Shaozhong?

518
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
Come, let's toast to Boss Wen

519
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
OK, Boss Wen

520
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Come, Boss Wen, I wish you a successful business

521
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Rich and prosperous

522
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Make a fortune

523
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Come

524
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
When you were not here

525
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Boss Wen has invited your brother

526
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Worked in the big pharmacy in Wen's

527
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Your brother and I have agreed

528
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Thank you, Boss Wen

529
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
But my sister-in-law, brother and Xiaobao

530
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm going back to Beijing tomorrow

531
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
I can't accept your invitation

532
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Who said we were going back to Beijing

533
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I said

534
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
I have bought you a ticket to Beijing

535
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Leave early tomorrow

536
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Why are you leaving?

537
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
We are not leaving

538
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
We go

539
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Whatever

540
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Anyway, the room fee

541
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
I only paid it on the weekend

542
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Boss Wen

543
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Then I wish you a successful business

544
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
OK, thank you

545
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Isn't it just making money?

546
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Is it necessary? Chu Shaohua

547
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
You don't even recognize your brother

548
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Zhou Yan

549
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
I tell you

550
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
I don't believe you can be famous forever

551
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Don't blame us for not recognizing you

552
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Zhou Yan

553
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
Go, stop eating

554
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
What to eat if people don't treat you

555
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Zhou Yan

556
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Boss Wen, I'm so sorry

557
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Shaohua

558
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
I

559
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Why do you do this?

560
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
I said

561
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
This is my family

562
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
After all, they are relatives

563
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I have met him

564
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
I know, Boss Wen

565
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
I thought after experiencing those things

566
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
He can change

567
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
He is even more powerful than before

568
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
He is afraid that we take advantage of him

569
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Unbearable

570
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
He is talking about

571
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
You said too much

572
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Just because Shaohua bought so many things for us

573
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
You can't say he is unbearable

574
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Just these things?

575
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Just these?

576
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
These things

577
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
For him

578
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
That's a lot

579
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
A lot

580
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Why did he buy it for us?

581
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
You can totally not buy it

582
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Zhou Yan

583
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Are you too greedy?

584
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Yes, I am greedy

585
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
I've been greedy for a long time

586
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
For whom?

587
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
For your family?

588
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Chu Haozhong

589
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
If you can

590
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
You can buy a car and a house for me

591
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
I can also not be greedy

592
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
I can also not want it

593
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
I can also be generous

594
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
But my man, he can't

595
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
He can't even support himself

596
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
He has to rely on me

597
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
To be his mother

598
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
To wash clothes and cook

599
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Chu Haozhong

600
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
You dare not even fart

601
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
You sleep and sigh all day

602
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
What do you dare to do?

603
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Thank you

604
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Brother, Shaohua

605
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
It's so late, what's the matter?

606
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Nothing

607
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Just come and say goodbye to you

608
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
We will go back to Beijing tomorrow

609
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
I don't know when we will meet next time

610
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
So although it's a bit late

611
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
I still want to come and see you

612
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
To talk to you

613
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Actually

614
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
The distance between Beijing and Shanghai

615
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Is not far

616
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
It's easy to meet

617
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
If you want to see me

618
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
You can come and see me anytime

619
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
If I have something to go to Beijing

620
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I will also see you

621
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I know

622
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
But what I want to say is

623
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
First

624
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,160
I want to apologize to you on behalf of our family

625
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,160
I have caused you a lot of trouble this time

626
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
You

627
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
From childhood to adulthood

628
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
You are a person with feelings

629
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
You haven't changed

630
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
We came here this time

631
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
You are so generous to us

632
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
But

633
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Your sister-in-law

634
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
How to say

635
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
She is a little bit fast

636
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Anyway

637
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
What she said

638
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Don't take it to heart

639
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Her problem is just a quick tongue

640
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
It's all my fault

641
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
I'm not capable

642
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Let her suffer with me for a lifetime

643
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
She can't think of it

644
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
It's normal

645
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Brother, don't do anything

646
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Put it on yourself

647
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
I will not admit it when I was younger

648
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
But now

649
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
I'm more than forty

650
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I know who I am

651
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
I passed on the three generations of ancestral night

652
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
The last field production

653
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Also pawned

654
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
If it weren't for you

655
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I may have died

656
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Shaohua

657
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
You know my life

658
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
The most self-pity

659
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Is it the most self-pity thing?

660
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
The day the bandits came

661
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
I, as a brother

662
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Didn't protect you well

663
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
I really hate myself

664
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
If I was a little bit more brave

665
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Maybe I could save you

666
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Don't say that

667
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
I was very brave at that time

668
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
If it weren't for you

669
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
I may really fall into the bandits' hands

670
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
There is no today

671
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Then today

672
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
You must have suffered a lot

673
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Brother

674
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Brother

675
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Shaohua

676
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I have something to tell you

677
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
We are here

678
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
We are not here to take advantage of you

679
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
I believe you

680
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Since you were taken away by that horse

681
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
You have been missing

682
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Some people say you jumped off the cliff

683
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Some people say you were killed by bandits

684
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Some people say you became a lady of the government

685
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
I have never

686
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
I have never felt good

687
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
So as soon as I heard your news

688
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
I rushed over

689
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
For nothing else

690
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
I just want to see you now

691
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
What you look like

692
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
How are you doing

693
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Mom

694
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Seeing you now

695
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
So good

696
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
I am really happy

697
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
My heart

698
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Even if it is put down

699
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Shaohua

700
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Although I am your brother

701
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
But since childhood

702
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
You are smarter than me

703
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
More attentive than me

704
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
So before I left

705
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I have nothing to tell you

706
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Just one word

707
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
You are alone in Shanghai

708
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Not easy

709
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
If you meet the right person

710
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Just give yourself a home

711
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
As long as your brother and I are in Beijing

712
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
More at ease

713
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
OK

714
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Nothing else

715
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
I am leaving

716
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
Take care

717
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Don't cry

718
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Brother

719
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Brother

720
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
You will be a counter there

721
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Sister-in-law is at the kitchen

722
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Storage room

723
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
The rules of the studio

724
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Is every month

725
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
In addition to the bottom

726
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
Can get a commission

727
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
So as long as you look at it

728
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
The income will be your

729
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
In Beijing

730
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
In Beijing

731
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
In Beijing

732
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
In Beijing

733
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
In Beijing

734
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
In Beijing

735
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
In Beijing

736
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
So good

737
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Sister-in-law

738
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
I can't stand you

739
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
I will be happy

740
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
In Beijing

741
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
In Beijing

742
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
In Beijing

743
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
In Beijing

744
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
In Beijing

745
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
In Beijing

746
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
In Beijing

747
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm sorry.

748
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,600
Shuhua.

749
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,240
Sister.

750
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,680
That's great.

751
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,520
Shuhua.

752
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,640
Thank you so much.

753
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,920
But there are some things

754
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,720
I need to make it clear.

755
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,880
At home,

756
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,800
you are my big brother and little brother.

757
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,960
But once you enter this door,

758
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,640
you are the staff here.

759
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,320
All rules of the Wen's Pharmacy

760
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,120
must be strictly followed.

761
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,840
If there are any errors,

762
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,320
you must be punished

763
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,760
according to the rules.

764
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,560
No.

765
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,160
There will be no errors.

766
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,200
Sister, you won't.

767
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,880
No problem.

768
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,280
Mr. Li.

769
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,400
Mr. Chu.

770
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,240
Come.

771
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,680
Take them to work.

772
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,760
Yes, Mr. Chu.

773
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,480
Okay.

774
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,040
Thank you, sister.

775
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,800
This way, please.

776
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,840
Mr. Li, how long have you been here?

777
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,560
Two years.

778
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,760
Mr. Chu.

779
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,160
Mr. Wen.

780
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,360
The seed can sprout.

781
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,560
The businessman said it was medicine from Hankou.

782
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,720
But the workers of the store

783
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,640
took a batch secretly.

784
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,320
They found that it was all opium.

785
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,160
How many?

786
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,080
Twenty.

787
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,760
Where did you get it?

788
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,760
A commercial company in Suzhou.

789
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,760
I checked.

790
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,880
There is no big boss behind.

791
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,160
Great.

792
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,400
You can finally make big money.

793
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Tell all the brothers

794
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,400
to act at 12 o'clock tonight.

795
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,720
Come back.

796
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,640
Keep it a secret.

797
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,280
Yes.

798
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,000
Open the door.

799
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,440
We are from the Bureau of Investigation.

800
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,320
Open the door.

801
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,120
Get out of the way.

802
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,400
Open the door.

803
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,880
Open the door.

804
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,320
Open the door.

805
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,960
Open the door.

806
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,920
Open the door.

807
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,400
Open the door.

808
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,040
Open the door.

809
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,440
Open the door.

810
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,120
Open the door.

811
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,880
Open the door.

812
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,400
Open the door.

813
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,560
Open the door.

814
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,600
Open the door.

815
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,480
Headmaster.

816
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,480
They are there.

817
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,880
High level commerce?

818
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,480
Yes.

819
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,720
Why are there so few?

820
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,320
We only found a few bags for now.

821
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,760
Didn't you say there were 20 bags?

822
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,000
There are at most two bags.

823
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,920
I told my men to keep looking.

824
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,440
Search every corner.

825
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,520
Search carefully.

826
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,760
Chief, we've searched everywhere.

827
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,600
There's really nothing.

828
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,560
Search again.

829
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,800
Those wooden boxes

830
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,560
and those sack bags.

831
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,480
Did you find them?

832
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,280
Send them to me.

833
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,320
Go.

834
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,920
Ask the guard to come here.

835
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,160
The guard heard the wrong sound.

836
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,160
They ran away.

837
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,240
They're really practical.

838
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,240
Chief, we've searched again.

839
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,280
There's really nothing.

840
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,440
Did they get the wrong information?

841
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,480
I remember they said there were 20 bags.

842
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,040
Two bags are enough.

843
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,040
It's not a waste of time.

844
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,320
As you ordered,

845
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,560
we'll give one bag to the police.

846
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,120
Mr. Xiao Jianji has 60 jin.

847
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,640
We've left 100 jin.

848
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,120
Besides,

849
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,560
I've asked someone to write the report.

850
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,360
It's on Mr. Jin's desk.

851
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,560
Who did you give the 100 jin

852
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
we left?

853
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,440
It's still for Hu.

854
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,840
He said the price is the highest.

855
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
It's said that Mr. Jin's 60 jin

856
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,400
was also given to him.

857
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,400
The bag we sent to the police

858
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,720
should be with him.

859
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,600
I don't know.

860
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,280
You can try next time.

861
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,400
The stuff we sent to the police

862
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,120
can be bought by him in the afternoon.

863
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,240
Hu is so knowledgeable.

864
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,600
Not at all.

865
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,640
There's someone behind.

866
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,960
Hello?

867
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,280
Master.

868
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,840
Yes, I'm here.

869
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

870
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,240
Mr. Jin wants to see me?

871
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,120
It must be about your father's case.

872
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,520
You always think about good things.

873
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,240
But

874
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,160
it's time.

875
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm sorry.

876
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,080
Chief.

877
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,600
We're waiting for you.

878
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,520
Come in.

879
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,920
Master, you want to see me?

880
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,240
Sit.

881
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,040
A chief came to the police department.

882
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,320
He said they got a batch of opium.

883
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,120
It's in Warehouse No. 18.

884
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,640
Two days ago,

885
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,240
a group of unknown people

886
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,400
robbed it.

887
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,400
Warehouse No. 18?

888
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,440
Isn't that...

889
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,000
Yes.

890
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,240
It's the case you just investigated.

891
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,280
After their secret investigation,

892
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,920
they found the opium in Hu's hospital.

893
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,640
They all confessed after interrogation.

894
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,880
Hu said

895
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,320
it was our men who sold it to him.

896
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,720
What?

897
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,640
How should we handle this?

898
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,240
We'll kill Hu

899
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,320
and prove that they're innocent.

900
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,640
Hu is now in the police department.

901
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,320
He killed someone in the police department.

902
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,160
What are you thinking?

903
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,360
Let's find someone to be the scapegoat.

904
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,720
Let's say

905
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,280
he colluded with Hu.

906
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,600
We'll be held responsible for

907
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,320
the misdemeanor.

908
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,760
I swear

909
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,200
I'll pull an all-out blade

910
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,120
and bring on the women.

911
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,080
I'll show you

912
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,440
how to ride a horse.

913
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,320
Jingbei Chief Ð´Ð°

914
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,320
All of you have treated people

915
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,760
as your own men.

916
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,320
But two days ago

917
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,000
I met a man

918
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
who was led by his wife.

919
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
The goods are from a Su-Zhou merchant

920
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,960
It has nothing to do with the Commander of the Police

921
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,240
Bullshit

922
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,480
If you check it, you can have the money

923
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,960
Fan Tong

924
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,560
Master

925
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,200
I was wrong

926
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,280
I will be cautious in the future

927
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,880
I won't give you a hard time

928
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,600
Give me another chance

929
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,520
Forget it

930
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,440
I will explain to the Commander of the Police

931
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,480
Just say it's a misunderstanding

932
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,200
You can have a feast with them

933
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,600
But

934
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,640
the goods will be returned soon

935
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,240
You can think about it yourself

936
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,120
OK

937
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,200
Give me two days

938
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,680
I will fill the two bags of opium

939
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,920
Two bags?

940
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,720
They told me 20 bags

941
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,800
I will go to the store

942
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,760
I will go to the store

943
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,720
I will go to the store

944
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
I will go to the store

945
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I will go to the store

946
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
I will go to the store

947
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,720
I will go to the store

948
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
I will go to the store

949
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
I will go to the store

950
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
I will go to the store

951
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
I will go to the store

952
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
I will go to the store

953
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I will go to the store

954
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
I will go to the store

955
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,720
I will go to the store

956
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
I will go to the store

957
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
I will go to the store

958
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
I will go to the store

959
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
I will go to the store

960
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
I will go to the store

961
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
I will go to the store

962
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
I will go to the store

963
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
I will go to the store

964
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
