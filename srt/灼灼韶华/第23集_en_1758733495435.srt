1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,460
Indian

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I heard the wind from the sky above the sea

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That is not the wind, that is not the wind

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the sharpness in my eyes

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not easy, then let's break it

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My bitter pain, my pain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I finally turn around

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the wildest night

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to break the world

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is the one for me

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 14

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How is the thing about teaching me going?

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How is the thing about disbanding the family?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't think about this

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You just go and drive them away

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How can there be such a good thing

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If so, that's fine

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Since you don't want to disband the family

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
After we get married

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I will continue to hook up with Wen Zhiqiu

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You dare, I kill her

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can kill if you want

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Anyway, you killed a Wen Zhiqiu

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And a Wen Zhidong, Wen Zhixia

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There are many men in this world

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Can you finish it

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I even kill you

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What did you do to me

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I said why you don't understand

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You don't drink a cup of tea in front of you

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You have to drink my medicine

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What medicine did you give me

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
To remove the medicine

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The toilet is in that room

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You stupid woman

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wait for me

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Go

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Where is she

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Where is she

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This way

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Go

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Give me the antidote

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No antidote

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Just pull it out

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't believe you

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Look at you, pulling out the gun again

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Always so fierce

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Am I your enemy or your prisoner

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Then you don't fight

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Still drug me

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's not forced by you

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you treat me well

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I won't do that

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I won't do that

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I treat you like this

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How can I treat you well

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then you talk about it

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Have you watched a movie with me

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Have you eaten chicken with me

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Take me for a walk in the rain

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Dance with me

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you talking about

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't want your money

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't want your rights

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't even want you to support me

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I just want

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I just hope you can talk to me

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
A real, romantic,

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
romantic relationship.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Romantic?

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
What are you talking about? It's so bad.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,840
What romantic relationship?

83
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,240
Love.

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,760
Just like the one in the movie.

85
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,480
But my ex-girlfriends

86
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,000
never asked me

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,280
for such a request.

88
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800
If I were like them,

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,000
why did you come to me

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
so suddenly?

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
What you said is not true.

92
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
It's true.

93
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,440
Then what do you think?

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,360
Fine.

95
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,840
I'll have a romantic relationship

96
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
with you.

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Romantic... No, romantic.

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,440
So you agree

99
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
to let all your wives go?

100
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
We can't

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,720
date if we have wives.

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Why don't you understand?

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,760
A single man and a woman

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,600
should date when they're together.

105
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,120
You're a married couple.

106
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,080
Why do you want to

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
seduce me?

108
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,840
Go.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,560
You'll be in trouble

110
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
if you're late.

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm tired.

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,880
I need to go to the toilet.

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
You're so lazy.

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Yes.

115
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,800
Have you made up your mind?

116
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,480
Forget it.

117
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,840
What do you mean?

118
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,920
Don't bother me again?

119
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
Or do you want to

120
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
have a relationship

121
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,680
with your wives?

122
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,040
I'll have a romantic relationship

123
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
with all of them

124
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,920
when I'm back.

125
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
If you can do it,

126
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,240
Mr. Wang,

127
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,080
I'll have a romantic relationship

128
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,000
with you.

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,840
Miss Chu,

130
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,200
I want to have a shower.

131
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
Go ahead.

132
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,280
What are you doing?

133
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm going home.

134
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
Where is she?

135
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,880
She's gone.

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,920
Gone?

137
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,400
What did you do to her again?

138
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,920
Nothing.

139
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
She's the one who did it.

140
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,760
It's okay.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
She ate the wrong food.

145
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,320
Why is there smell in the house?

146
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
You should go take a shower.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
It really smells.

148
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,920
Come on.

149
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
Wang Guodong's wife

150
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,720
took a few wives

151
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,460
to several

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,640
newspaper companies

153
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
and called them names.

154
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,760
They said they were

155
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,640
unreliable women.

156
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,360
They were abandoned

157
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,640
and had no other choice.

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,680
And you

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,200
are that fox.

160
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,400
Fox?

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
You forced them to go to the dead end.

162
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,960
What are you doing?

163
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
You can't get done that.

164
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:54,180
I'm not

165
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,760
a warehouse manager.

166
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,340
I should

167
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,360
do something for my company.

168
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Welcome Miss Chu.

169
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,920
Miss Chu, Manager Wang is waiting for you inside.

170
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Manager Wang,

171
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
are you feeling well?

172
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Very well.

173
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
It's just that I'm worried when I'm waiting for you.

174
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Don't worry.

175
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I guarantee that your waiting is worth it.

176
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
That's the best.

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Don't let me down.

178
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Manager Wang,

179
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Manager Wang,

182
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
look at this.

183
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Come on, feel this.

184
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Look at this.

185
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Is it romantic enough?

186
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Look, I'm a big guy.

187
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I invited a foreigner to decorate this for me.

188
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm so sorry to have caused you to waste money.

189
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
What's that?

190
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
As long as you're satisfied,

191
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I'll spend this little money.

192
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Isn't that a silly thing?

193
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Manager Wang,

194
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
there seems to be someone outside.

195
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
We don't care.

196
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Go on.

197
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
It seems to be your wife.

198
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
These rotten women.

199
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
They just throw people in the newspaper.

200
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
They're so stupid.

201
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
You're so stupid.

205
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
You just throw people in the newspaper.

206
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
You're so stupid to come here today.

207
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Don't touch me.

208
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Don't touch me.

209
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Don't touch me.

210
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Go away.

211
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Don't touch me.

212
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Don't touch me.

213
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Don't touch me.

214
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Go away.

215
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Go away.

216
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Don't touch me.

217
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Take them away.

218
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Take them away.

219
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Get out.

220
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Get out.

221
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Get out.

222
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
What do you think you're doing?

223
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
You're really...

224
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Don't touch me.

225
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Give me my child back.

226
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
What are you doing?

227
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Give me my child back.

228
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Give me my child back.

229
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Don't touch me.

230
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Give me my child back.

231
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Give me my child back.

232
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Give me my child back.

233
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Get out!

234
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Let me go!

235
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Who are you?

236
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
You!

237
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Let me go!

238
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Let me go!

239
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Let me go!

240
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Let me go!

241
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Let me go!

242
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Let me go!

243
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
You're so cruel!

244
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
You can't leave!

245
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Don't go!

246
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Go back!

247
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Don't go!

248
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Go back!

249
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Go back!

250
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Don't go!

251
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Go back!

252
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Go back!

253
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Go back!

254
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Sister!

255
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Go with me!

256
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Don't go!

257
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Go back!

258
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Don't go!

259
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Go back!

260
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Don't go!

261
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Go back!

262
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
You're so cruel!

263
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Get in the car!

264
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Boss Xia,

265
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
if it weren't for your eye-catching skills,

266
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
I'm afraid it's hard for me to get away with this.

267
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
I have to thank you.

268
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
You're too kind, Miss Chu.

269
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
First of all, I'm your old friend.

270
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,040
And I'm also the shareholder of Wen's Pharmacy.

271
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

272
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Secondly,

273
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
with your talent

274
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
and Mr. Lu's relationship,

275
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
even without me,

276
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
you can still get away with it.

277
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Here.

278
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Erniu,

279
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
I have to thank you.

280
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
If it weren't for you,

281
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I wouldn't have been able to do this.

282
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I didn't do anything.

283
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I just happened to hear Wang Guangdong

284
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
going on a date with you in the hot spring.

285
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
I happened to run into his Liu Yitai

286
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
at the department store.

287
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
When I was having coffee with Liu Yitai,

288
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
I accidentally told him your secret.

289
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
I accidentally broke the oil tank

290
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
of those women.

291
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Okay, then I'll toast to your accidental

292
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
coincidental and accidental cooperation.

293
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Accidental, coincidental,

294
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
accidental, and unintentional.

295
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Here.

296
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
I forgot about you.

297
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Come on, Mr. Wen.

298
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Let's not talk about it anymore.

299
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Let's just drink.

300
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Let's just say a few words.

301
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Say thank you to Mr. Wen.

302
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
He's handsome and cool.

303
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
He's not messy.

304
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
He's a man of his word.

305
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Okay, okay, okay.

306
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I can't say those words.

307
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Here, cheers.

308
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Mr. Xia, have some food.

309
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Okay.

310
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
By the way, where's Wang?

311
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
I've arranged it.

312
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
You can't treat him.

313
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Okay.

314
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Mr. Xia,

315
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
what's your hobby?

316
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
I really don't have any hobbies.

317
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
I only have one hobby.

318
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Making money.

319
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
What a coincidence.

320
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
This is also my hobby.

321
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Then we have to drink.

322
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Come on, let's toast to our common hobby.

323
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
It's bleeding.

324
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
It's bleeding.

325
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
There should be clean gloves in my bag.

326
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
It's okay.

327
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Is there any painkiller?

328
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Yes.

329
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Help me take it.

330
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Okay.

331
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Here.

332
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
No need.

333
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
The blood is already stopped.

334
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Okay.

335
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
It doesn't hurt anymore, does it?

336
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
It doesn't hurt anymore.

337
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Thank you, Miss Bai.

338
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
You're welcome.

339
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
I have a lot of experience

340
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
in dealing with these small injuries and pains.

341
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Mr. Xia.

342
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Thank you.

343
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Boss, I just received the news.

344
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Mr. Lu's cousin

345
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
has been appointed as the director of the police station.

346
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Our goods will be sent to the West Department this week.

347
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Come on, let's have a drink.

348
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
What makes you so happy?

349
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
I just received the news.

350
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Mr. Lu's cousin

351
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
has been appointed as the director of the police station.

352
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
And after investigation,

353
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
our Wen's Pharmacy

354
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
has no illegal place.

355
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,040
All goods will be returned in a week.

356
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Then we should drink it.

357
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Someone is not good at being self-reliant.

358
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
It's worth drinking.

359
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
I have good news too.

360
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
What news?

361
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
My new movie is going to be released next week.

362
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Then I have to drink it.

363
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Come on.

364
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
I can't drink it.

365
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Then I must drink it.

366
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
What's wrong with you?

367
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I can't drink it.

368
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
You can't drink it.

369
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Why?

370
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
I should drink it.

371
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
This is my drink.

372
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
I have a big mouth.

373
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
You can't drink it.

374
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Take it.

375
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
You can't drink it.

376
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Take it.

377
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Here you are.

378
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
I can't drink it.

379
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm so sorry.

380
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
It's okay.

381
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
I'm just a little drunk.

382
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
I just need some rest.

383
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Okay.

384
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
I just need some rest.

385
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I just need some rest.

386
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
I just need some rest.

387
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Here you are.

388
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Okay.

389
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,000
You must be tired.

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,400
You should go back and rest.

391
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,880
I'm not tired.

392
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,360
You're tired.

393
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,640
Fine.

394
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
I'll be tired if you say so.

395
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,360
Take these away.

396
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,000
These aren't mine.

397
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,760
Don't live in my house.

398
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,680
I bought them on purpose.

399
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,640
If you leave now,

400
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,480
I can't finish them.

401
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,280
Take them away.

402
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,160
Don't waste them.

403
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,480
I won't.

404
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,160
Thank you.

405
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,320
We won't be polite to you.

406
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,440
Thank you.

407
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,040
Wait.

408
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,360
You were coughing in the middle of the night.

409
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,120
I was so annoyed.

410
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
You were sipping the medicine.

411
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,160
You didn't know where to go.

412
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,280
Thank you.

413
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,000
Thank you.

414
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Now that you're gone,

415
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,560
I can get my freedom back.

416
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,640
Congratulations.

417
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,720
Bye-bye.

418
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,800
Bye-bye.

419
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,840
You two have been living together for days.

420
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,400
Nothing happened.

421
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,040
It happened many times.

422
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,960
You didn't care about him

423
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,480
when you were together every day.

424
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,680
I cared about him?

425
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,160
I almost hit him.

426
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,920
But I'm sure

427
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,480
he cared about you.

428
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,920
He

429
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
doesn't care about anyone.

430
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,000
Shaohua.

431
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,160
Don't you think he likes you?

432
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,920
Yes.

433
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,840
He likes me.

434
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
He likes you.

435
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,480
He likes you.

436
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
He likes you.

437
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,920
Really?

438
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,840
He likes the way I make money.

439
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,720
Okay.

440
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,800
Let's go.

441
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,480
Let's go.

442
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,080
We're home.

443
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
You're so good at everything.

444
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,920
Look at you.

445
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,120
You're good at cooking.

446
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,280
You're considerate.

447
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,360
You're good at doing business.

448
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,120
You never thought

449
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,320
of making a friend seriously.

450
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,920
I'm sorry.

451
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I didn't mean to.

452
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
I didn't mean to.

453
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I didn't mean to.

454
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
I didn't mean to.

455
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
I didn't mean to.

456
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
I didn't mean to.

457
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
I didn't mean to.

458
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
I didn't mean to.

459
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,080
You didn't mean to?

460
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
You didn't mean to?

461
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,840
Yes, I did.

462
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Okay, thank you.

463
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,840
Sleep in this room.

464
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The bed sheet, quilts, pillows

465
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,120
and windows are all really new.

466
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,200
Then where'll you sleep?

467
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,820
Next to you.

468
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,760
The couch.

469
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,400
I know him very well and I will definitely find him another opportunity.

470
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,900
It's a great honor to receive like this.

471
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,000
Boss, it's me, Mr.ifter.

472
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,480
Mr.hammer.

473
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,960
The supermarket is open now.

474
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,680
Please come in, Sir.

475
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,680
I found Lin Fang Lou.

476
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,680
I also found Lu Ning Xiang's mother.

477
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,680
I also found the little house that sold Lu Ning Xiang to Lin Fang Lou.

478
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Did you find her?

479
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
You said it was useful, but it's useless.

480
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm asking if Lu Ning Xiang found it.

481
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
No.

482
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Then you still dare to come back?

483
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Why didn't you find Huai Dong and die on the way back?

484
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
You bastard, you lie down.

485
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Lie down!

486
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
Lie down!

487
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Lie down!

488
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
I said lie down!

489
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Boss, I have one more thing.

490
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
Say it.

491
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Although I didn't find Lu Ning Xiang,

492
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
I found another thing.

493
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
What is it?

494
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Five years ago, Lu Ning Xiang left Lin Fang Lou.

495
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,680
She said a young lady from Chen family helped her to get rid of the body.

496
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
And that young lady from Chen family

497
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,680
is called Chu Shao Hua.

498
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
Thank you.

499
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Thank you all for coming.

500
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,680
I believe everyone has a very different feeling.

501
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Next, I will leave time for all the media friends here.

502
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
All reporters and audiences,

503
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
you can freely ask questions.

504
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,680
You can contact our actors and our director directly.

505
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Director Zhang,

506
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
what is the original intention of this play?

507
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Our original intention is to hope that

508
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,680
all the women can be like the female lead in our movie.

509
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Bravely break the shackles of family and society.

510
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,680
To be brave to pursue their own happiness.

511
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Miss Liang Shan Shan,

512
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,680
what is the difference between your role and the previous one?

513
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
I played the female lead Li Xiu Hua in the play,

514
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
In the play, Reborn.

515
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
She is an independent woman.

516
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
She is a role model for us to learn.

517
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,680
I have a question to ask Miss Bai Bin Xin.

518
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Miss Bai Bin Xin.

519
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,680
No, I should call you Miss Lu Ning Xiang.

520
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Mr. Reporter, are you mistaken?

521
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,680
The role played by Miss Bai Bin Xin in the movie is called Li Xiu Xiang.

522
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,680
I am not mistaken.

523
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
Lu Ning Xiang is the name that Bai Bin Xin used

524
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,680
when she was in the hotel in Beijing.

525
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
What are you talking about?

526
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
May I ask, Lu Ning Xiang,

527
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,680
when did you change your name to Bai Bin Xin?

528
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
What are you talking about?

529
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Yes.

530
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Yes, when did you change your name to Bai Bin Xin?

531
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Today is the premiere of the movie Reborn.

532
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
Please pay attention to the movie.

533
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
May I ask, Miss Liang Shan Shan,

534
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,680
what is the similarity between your role and the previous one?

535
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
There are many similarities.

536
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Lu Ning Xiang.

537
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Lu Ning Xiang, you are a traitor.

538
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
You are a traitor.

539
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Lu Ning Xiang, you are a traitor.

540
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Lu Ning Xiang, you are a traitor.

541
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Lu Ning Xiang, you are a traitor.

542
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
You are a traitor.

543
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,680
You are a traitor.

544
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,680
You have stolen the banknote of 8 copper coins in Beijing.

545
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
You are the cheater of 15 copper coins.

546
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
The banknote?

547
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
There is a banknote.

548
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
I didn't expect.

549
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
Now you have become the movie star.

550
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Lu Ning Xiang,

551
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
do you remember him?

552
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
Don't bother, don't bother.

553
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Here is a stolen banknote.

554
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
You have stolen the banknote.

555
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
You have stolen the banknote.

556
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
You have stolen the banknote.

557
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Lu Ning Xiang,

558
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Lu Ning Xiang.

559
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,880
Lu Jingxiang, I'm a prostitute.

560
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,080
I'm not going to talk to you.

561
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,960
Lu Jingxiang.

562
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,440
Lu Jingxiang.

563
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,560
Tell me.

564
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,840
Tell me.

565
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,800
Lu Jingxiang.

566
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,280
Tell me.

567
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,400
Lu Jingxiang.

568
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,000
Don't go.

569
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,680
You're lying.

570
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,560
You're lying.

571
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,600
You're lying.

572
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,920
Lu Jingxiang.

573
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,160
Lu Jingxiang.

574
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,000
You're a prostitute.

575
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,480
You can touch any of my copper coins.

576
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,440
You're a prostitute.

577
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,480
You're a prostitute.

578
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,560
Lu Jingxiang.

579
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,160
Bai.

580
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,080
He's not back yet?

581
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,160
No.

582
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,360
I went to the film company.

583
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,840
I asked all his colleagues.

584
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,080
They all said he wasn't there.

585
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,600
I asked him

586
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
where he likes to go.

587
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,880
They all said they didn't see him.

588
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,720
The landlord's wife

589
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
said he didn't come back.

590
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,760
Where could he go?

591
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,440
I checked just now.

592
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,600
He didn't take anything with him.

593
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,760
He even left his money there.

594
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,320
He probably didn't go far.

595
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,520
Mu Ziru?

596
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,120
Will he go to see Mu Ziru?

597
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
I called Mu Ziru.

598
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
He didn't answer.

599
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,640
But I asked his subordinate.

600
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,880
They all said they didn't see him.

601
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,120
He's not responsible at all.

602
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,520
Any news?

603
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,040
I've looked everywhere I can.

604
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,760
Will he go back to his hometown?

605
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,880
Impossible.

606
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,600
From what I know,

607
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,440
he won't go back even if he dies.

608
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
I think

609
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,760
he's still in Shanghai.

610
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,760
How about this?

611
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
We can take his photo.

612
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,600
I'll go to Mr. Xia.

613
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,120
I'll ask two pharmacists to look for him.

614
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,560
I'll go to the train station and the dock.

615
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,200
I'll ask the same bank.

616
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,920
See if there's any new clues.

617
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,440
Okay.

618
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,560
No matter if there's any news,

619
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,640
we'll meet here

620
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,880
at 10 p.m.

621
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,640
Okay.

622
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,240
And...

623
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Mu Ziru is a busy man.

624
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,120
How about asking him to help us?

625
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,840
No need.

626
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,600
I don't need him.

627
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,240
Brother.

628
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,200
Have you found

629
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,120
the bastard called Wu?

630
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,760
Yes.

631
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,600
He's at Tongjiang Inn.

632
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,920
I told a few men to bring the bastard.

633
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,360
If I don't beat him to death today,

634
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,720
I'll be dead.

635
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,760
Go now.

636
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,600
Wu has been

637
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,120
working with

638
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,400
the manager of the pharmacy.

639
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,760
And he's wearing the same clothes

640
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,280
as the pharmacy.

641
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,360
The pharmacy?

642
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,200
Yes.

643
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,800
The pharmacy has a business cooperation with Mr. Jin.

644
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,680
If we want to move the pharmacy,

645
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,000
we should ask Mr. Jin.

646
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,080
Where's the newspaper I asked you to buy?

647
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,640
I bought it.

648
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,680
But I haven't finished it.

649
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,120
I told you to buy it.

650
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,360
The newspaper is hard again today.

651
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,320
And several newspapers

652
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,520
have joined the newspaper business.

653
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,840
You're so shameless.

654
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Stop.

655
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,240
Master.

656
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,720
You want to destroy the newspaper?

657
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,800
What does it have to do with you?

658
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,440
Those reporters are too cruel.

659
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,200
Kid.

660
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,040
A beautiful woman has her own reason.

661
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,280
You don't have to make yourself a laughing stock.

662
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,120
You're not allowed to go.

663
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,880
Uh.

664
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,080
The reporters went to interview Wu

665
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,720
because they couldn't get the white star.

666
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,160
Wu just Security Force v Creed.

667
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,960
When considering their conference,

668
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,120
Wu Elder should be the bakeout.

669
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,480
This Drop has earned a lot of money.

670
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,800
This fellow

671
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,520
is quite calm.

672
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,920
Besides,

673
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,360
the reporters

674
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,720
of Da Mai Daily

675
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,080
have gone to Beijing

676
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,680
for the 과 Easter.

677
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,320
And they even went to

678
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,600
I'm very surprised.

679
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,160
This reporter is very surprised.

680
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,560
Does Mrs. Yan remember Lu Ningxiang?

681
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,040
She even said that she became pretty after she arrived in Shanghai.

682
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,400
Did this reporter

683
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
interview the old ruffians?

684
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,600
Of course.

685
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,120
There are even men who found the gossip magazine.

686
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,600
They said that they had interviewed Lu Ningxiang.

687
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,480
They revealed many of Lu Ningxiang's past experience in bed.

688
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
If Zhou doesn't listen,

689
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
push him out.

690
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,560
I understand.

691
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,280
Brother.

692
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,880
Brother.

693
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,800
Did you read the newspaper?

694
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,200
I did.

695
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,200
These reporters are so uncivilized.

696
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,360
They even accused Bixin of being a prostitute.

697
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,120
It's not an accusation.

698
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,800
It's the truth.

699
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,080
The truth?

700
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,880
Move your brain.

701
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,720
I'm not a prostitute.

702
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,320
I'm a prostitute.

703
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,640
Move your brain.

704
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,920
Give me the plate.

705
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,760
Is the person that Mr. Zhou mentioned last time

706
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,000
Bixin?

707
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
You and Zhou

708
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,160
were all fooled by them.

709
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,800
But...

710
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,920
But if these reporters do this,

711
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,280
will Bixin kill herself?

712
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,680
She's the one who deceived the Tian family.

713
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,280
She deserves it.

714
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,240
Eat.

715
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,280
According to your order,

716
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,540
the two raw

717
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,240
rice noodles are here.

718
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,160
No need to look for it.

719
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,280
Miss.

720
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,280
Why did you buy so many raw rice noodles?

721
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,480
Leave it alone.

722
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,080
Raw rice noodles are poisonous.

723
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,000
Thank you.

724
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,320
I didn't recognize her at first.

725
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,760
When I realized it was Miss Bai,

726
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,800
she left.

727
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,080
When did this happen?

728
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,440
An hour ago.

729
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,760
What did she buy?

730
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
She only bought raw rice noodles.

731
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm really going to die.

732
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,680
Can you drive faster?

733
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,680
Black snow

734
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,440
White snow in the long night

735
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,000
Where is the end

736
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,440
Is the sky or the abyss

737
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Who is the one who is waiting for the moon

738
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,400
The light following

739
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,880
Passing through the lies of the drizzle

740
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,840
How to judge the mountain

741
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,040
The heart does not write this part

742
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,280
If the heart is broken

743
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,760
Where to find the answer

744
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
Black snow

745
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
White snow in the long night

746
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,680
The fire in the heart

747
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,560
If Ding Ran says

748
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,760
her clothes are still clean,

749
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,160
it means she didn't show up on the street these days.

750
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,720
Maybe she lives in the nearby inn.

751
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,560
But she doesn't have much money.

752
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,720
She should only live in the nearby inn.

753
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,760
How about this?

754
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,040
Let's split up.

755
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
You go there.

756
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,120
I'll go this way.

757
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,920
Be careful.

758
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,400
Okay.

759
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,400
Do you have a young girl

760
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,520
in cheongsam

761
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,360
with pink hair?

762
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,440
She is about the same height as me.

763
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
She is young and beautiful.

764
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,480
Think about it.

765
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,600
The sky

766
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,600
Follows the sunset

767
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,720
Forgetting its mountain

768
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,880
When the wind blows

769
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,760
The new moonlight

770
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,720
I haven't seen it.

771
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,240
Okay.

772
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,120
Thank you.

773
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,640
Mr. Ding.

774
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,520
I want to ask you

775
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,800
if you have seen a car

776
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,520
with a cheongsam

777
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,800
with pink clothes?

778
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,680
The white snow

779
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,800
The clouds and the moon

780
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,840
The fire in my heart

781
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,800
Only tears

782
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,840
The light in the dark night

783
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
In the light

784
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Break through the dust

785
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,080
In the light

786
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,760
I will not come

787
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,960
I will not come

788
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,760
Want to save her?

789
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,360
How is the situation?

790
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
She can die if she has more than five thousand.

791
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,720
She swallowed twenty thousand.

792
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,820
Andrew Ma was in font ofлю

793
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,120
I will not let you get away with it.

794
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,280
Tian Dashao.

795
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,360
I will not

796
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
let you off

797
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
if something happens to her.

798
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,840
Tian Dashao.

799
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
She sent her to shanghai from Beijing.

800
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,080
Yes.

801
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,000
It's them!

802
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,320
She's the one behind this!

803
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,840
Mr. Bai's new family.

804
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,480
I...

805
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,680
I'm his sister.

806
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,640
Luckily, it was sent in time.

807
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,080
I finally got my life back.

808
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,240
Thank you.

809
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,040
Erniu.

810
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,480
Erniu.

811
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,000
I...

812
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,800
Am I still alive

813
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,760
or dead?

814
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,480
You're still alive.

815
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,280
Shaohua saved you.

816
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,400
Why didn't you let me die?

817
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,160
If you die,

818
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,200
those who want to push you into death

819
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,200
will succeed.

820
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,960
Let them succeed.

821
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,800
Why?

822
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,880
You finally survived.

823
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,440
You finally got to this day.

824
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,400
Why did you give up so easily?

825
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,640
Those who hate us

826
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,680
want us to die.

827
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,600
We won't die.

828
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,840
Even if we're alive,

829
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,880
we've won.

830
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,880
But if I'm like this,

831
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,680
what's the point of living?

832
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,000
I have nothing.

833
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,600
Everything is gone.

834
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,720
You still have me.

835
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,360
Erniu.

836
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,360
No matter what happens in the future,

837
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,480
you'll never lose me.

838
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,360
Even if it's for me,

839
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,640
you have to live well.

840
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,720
I have no one in this world.

841
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,240
I have no one in this world.

842
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,480
I can't lose you again.

843
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,320
Shaohua.

844
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
It's okay.

845
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,280
It's not the first time we've lost everything.

846
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,800
Don't be afraid.

847
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,720
At worst,

848
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,800
we'll start over.

849
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,360
I'm tired.

850
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,440
I don't have the strength.

851
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,520
Take a break if you're tired.

852
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,520
You've endured so much

853
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,160
and you've survived.

854
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,560
Can you still hold on?

855
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,960
Can I still...

856
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,440
You can.

857
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,760
Erniu.

858
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,720
You're not only the most beautiful girl

859
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,960
in the world,

860
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,320
you're also the strongest girl.

861
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,080
Do you still remember

862
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,600
when you used to stay with me,

863
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
in the middle of the snow?

864
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,480
I remember when we first met each other.

865
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,360
The two of us will spend ten years together.

866
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,760
I need to forget Whom I used to love.

867
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,600
I don't want to leave

868
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,520
or make An просто living.

869
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,560
However,

870
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,440
I never iPL

871
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,680
to a machine that can fix it and make it smaller.

872
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,200
Let's talking about it.

873
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,360
and leave the hospital,

874
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,200
you can go there

875
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
and have a good rest.

876
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,240
I will

877
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,600
be with you forever.

878
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,800
Thank you.

879
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,680
When you recover,

880
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,400
we can plan together

881
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,440
for the future.

882
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,760
Don't be afraid.

883
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,600
At worst,

884
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,120
we can change our name

885
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,560
and live in another place.

886
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,640
Okay.

887
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,880
Wait.

888
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,760
Did he kill someone

889
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,800
and set the fire today

890
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
or do something evil?

891
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,320
Why do we have to

892
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,640
change our name

893
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,000
and live in another place?

894
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,000
Why do those

895
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,480
despicable people

896
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,200
roam around outside

897
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,680
and swallow their own breath

898
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,840
when they are really hurt?

899
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,160
I don't want to face

900
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,240
my past anymore.

901
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,360
Your past

902
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,680
has no mistakes.

903
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,280
I'm dirty.

904
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,040
The dirty ones are the ones who hurt you.

905
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,760
They should be

906
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
criticized by public opinion

907
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,520
and be punished by law.

908
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,680
You don't need to feel

909
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,200
any guilt

910
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,360
or shame.

911
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,840
You don't need to

912
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,160
carry this burden.

913
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,600
But others don't think so.

914
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,520
You mean those who watch the class?

915
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,880
They are all stupid

916
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,840
and have no difference.

917
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,520
Do we have to care about

918
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,240
their taste and their saliva?

919
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,680
But their saliva

920
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,000
will drown Xiaobai sooner or later.

921
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,600
Then let the bull stand higher.

922
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,400
You have been writing articles

923
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,360
and speaking for him, haven't you?

924
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,520
If you really want to help him,

925
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,280
don't let him hide.

926
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,560
Stay with him.

927
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,040
Stay with him and face everything.

928
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,160
Face everything?

929
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,920
Yes.

930
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,400
You don't need to change your name

931
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,440
or erase your past.

932
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,520
What you need to do now

933
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,000
is not only to live,

934
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,400
but also to live better,

935
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,080
to live more brilliantly,

936
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,960
to live more honorably.

937
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,720
Tell those people

938
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,880
they can't beat you

939
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,000
and let them know

940
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,840
you were hurt

941
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,880
and didn't fall down.

942
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,600
That's a more noble soul.

943
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,880
Zhixiu,

944
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,320
you are so kind.

945
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,840
Xiaobai,

946
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,840
you don't need to hide

947
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,280
or be afraid.

948
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,640
You should stand up

949
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,720
and confess their crimes

950
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,040
and let them

951
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,680
be punished

952
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,760
and be punished.

953
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,920
I just got the news.

954
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,680
There are three other magazines

955
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,480
and two foreign newspapers.

956
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,320
I'll add two more rows of chairs.

957
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,840
Is the tea water

958
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,640
being added?

959
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,320
I'll prepare it.

960
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,560
Well,

961
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,280
can you give me

962
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,320
the information

963
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,880
of each reporter?

964
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,360
Sure.

965
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,160
I'll go check it now.

966
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,680
Okay.

967
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,160
Where is Xiaobai?

968
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,640
She's ready.

969
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,920
I'll go check it now.

970
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,480
Okay.

971
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,280
I'll go check it now.

972
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,840
Okay.

973
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,720
I'll go check it now.

974
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,520
I'll go check it now.

975
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,320
I'll go check it now.

976
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,840
Okay.

977
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,680
I'll go check it now.

978
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,480
I'll go check it now.

979
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,320
I'll go check it now.

980
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,040
Okay.

981
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,720
Shaohua,

982
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,360
it's the first time

983
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,520
I've felt

984
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,320
that I'm strong

985
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,040
and not afraid of anything.

986
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,160
It's you.

987
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
It's been a long time.

988
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,840
I was busy

989
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,080
and couldn't get out of bed.

990
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,040
I know.

991
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,040
I'm sorry

992
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
for hurting you.

993
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,640
I'm sorry for hurting you.

994
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm sorry for hurting you.

995
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm sorry.

996
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,880
No.

997
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,320
We are friends.

998
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,920
I understand.

999
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,800
Later in the press conference,

1000
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,040
if someone asks me

1001
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,360
what our relationship is,

1002
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
I'll tell them

1003
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,520
that we are just friends.

1004
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,560
If no one mentions it,

1005
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,400
I won't mention it

1006
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,320
at all.

1007
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,400
I'm here today

1008
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
to face those reporters

1009
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,520
as your boyfriend

1010
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,760
and you.

1011
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,560
I don't care

1012
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,920
how those crap newspapers are written.

1013
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,600
I just want to be with you.

1014
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,720
But those newspapers

1015
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,760
are all true.

1016
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,240
I really have a bad past.

1017
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,040
I don't care.

1018
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,480
Besides,

1019
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,880
my background is not that good.

1020
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,920
But we are different.

1021
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,960
You won't really

1022
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,720
think

1023
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,720
I, in Changshan,

1024
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,920
am a superior person

1025
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,880
in being in every field of life.

1026
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1027
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1028
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1029
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1030
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1031
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1032
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1033
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1034
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1035
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1036
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1037
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1038
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1039
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,960
The wind blows, the leaves fall

1040
00:43:47,960 --> 00:44:16,200
A forever

1041
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:26,940
To call you

1042
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Day by day, night by night, I leave regrets.

1043
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Day by day, night by night, I'm not lonely anymore.

1044
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,960
The fireworks light up the hope.

1045
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,960
I give my all to fight for you.

1046
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:17,960
The green road leads to the eternal peace in my heart.
