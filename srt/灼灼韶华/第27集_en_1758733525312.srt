1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
Equinox

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:21,980
Burnly

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,980
I'm tired of looking for my old man

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,980
My sincerity can't buy a home

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,980
I don't need to be a man to walk through this life in peace

6
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,980
But I heard the wind from the sea

7
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,980
The sky says don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go to the cage

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,980
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,980
How can you be wrong?

10
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:08,840
That

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,840
I am me

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,840
The most beautiful night is cold

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,840
I don't want to be the world

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,840
To break through it

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Become me

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Episode 18

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,840
There are rules for the precedence of the English word

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
For example

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Come is come

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Go is go

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
And?

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Mommy, I love you

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,840
You can learn these rules in a few words

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Thank you, Mr. Xia

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
I'll think about it when I go back

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Looking forward to your good score next time

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Sure

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Come on

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
What's wrong?

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Nothing

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
By the way, how is your mother these days?

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,840
In the hospital

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Is she sick?

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,840
No, she is angry with me and my brother

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Because of me?

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
It has nothing to do with you

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
She didn't think it through

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Then do you think I can do something?

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
No need

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
No need

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
I understand her

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
I lost a lot of family members too

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
I know the pain

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,840
So I hope you don't get into a fight with your family because of me

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
She is angry now

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm afraid whatever you do

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
You can't change her mind about you

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,840
What she thinks about me is not important

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
The most important thing is that as your son

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
You should make your mother happy

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,840
It's not easy for your mother to live her life

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
It's easy to make her happy

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Follow her will

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
But I will never compromise on this

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
No, Xia Chu

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Xia Chu

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
I think you don't know your mother

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,840
What your mother wants most is not a son's obedience

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
What is it?

60
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Shanghai Women's Association held the second temporary meeting and issued a statement

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Is it 17th today?

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Yes

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Really?

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
It's written here

65
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Shanghai Women's Association

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
They all forgot me

67
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Forgot what?

68
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,840
Shanghai Women's Association held the second temporary meeting

69
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
You are here

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Are you feeling better?

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Yes, I am

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Why are you alone?

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Xia Yuan is very busy these days

74
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
He can't go to the store

75
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
What about Xia Chu?

76
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
I don't know

77
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
I haven't seen him for days

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
What about Youwen and Youze?

79
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
They are still in school

80
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
What about you?

81
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Forget it

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
No one can count on me

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
What's wrong?

84
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Are you in a bad mood?

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
No

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
I will go out with you

87
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
No

88
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
You must go

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,840
The doctor told me that you have a heart disease

90
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,840
You should go out more

91
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Look, the weather is so good today

92
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
I will go out with you

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Let's go

94
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
I won't go

95
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Let's go

96
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
I won't go

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Hurry up

98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
You are like a child

99
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Let's go out for a walk

100
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
You will get better soon

101
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Are you tired?

102
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Let's take a rest

103
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
I am not tired

104
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
I want to know what day it is

105
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Today is the 17th

106
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
What day is the 17th?

107
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Oh, no

108
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
I forgot to pay the bill with the Ministry of Finance

109
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Look at me

110
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Look at me

111
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Ok, ok

112
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
I changed my clothes for nothing

113
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
I will go back and wait for death

114
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Mom, you look so beautiful

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
The weather is so good

116
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Let's go out for a walk

117
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
I won't go

118
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Go, go

119
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Take a walk

120
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
Go, go, go

121
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Look ahead

122
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Grandma is here

123
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Grandma

124
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Aren't they my grandchildren?

125
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Why are you...

126
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
You are here too

127
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Mom

128
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
What are you doing?

129
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
You are so rude

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
You will know it later

131
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
What are you doing?

132
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Why do you take me here?

133
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
This is...

134
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Mom

135
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
This is the opera troupe

136
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
that I invited from my hometown

137
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Hebei Gang

138
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Yes

139
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
Sing Hua Mulan

140
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Yes

141
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Open your eyes

142
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Hurry up

143
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Wait a minute

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
What are you waiting for?

145
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Sing it

146
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,840
I haven't prepared the opera troupe yet

147
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Then...

148
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Mom

149
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
We have a gift for you

150
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
A gift?

151
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Of course

152
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Dad

153
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Mom

154
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,840
I knew it from the beginning

155
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,840
that you really like to hide this kind of thing

156
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
I often saw you

157
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,840
taking it out when you were alone at night

158
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
You kept looking at it

159
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
and touching it

160
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Later, I went out to do business

161
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
and lacked money

162
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,840
You sold it without hesitation

163
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Is this the same one as mine?

164
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
It's a copy of the old photo

165
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
that you took back then

166
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,840
I'm so sorry for your filial piety

167
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Mom

168
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Put it on

169
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Put it on?

170
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Yes, mom

171
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
You are a ten-year-old singer

172
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,840
The most popular one is this Hua Mulan

173
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
If you hadn't married my dad

174
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,840
you might be a famous singer now

175
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Come on

176
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Put it on

177
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Let's open our eyes

178
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
No, no

179
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm old now

180
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I can't sing

181
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Mom

182
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
You always say that

183
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
you are very beautiful on stage

184
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
The days of singing opera

185
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,840
are the happiest and most relaxing days in your life

186
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Let's do it again today

187
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
No, no

188
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I can't sing

189
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Mom

190
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
No, I can't sing

191
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Mom, look

192
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
There are no outsiders today

193
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Sing for us

194
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Yes

195
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Yes

196
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
I want to sing Hua Mulan for grandma too

197
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Me too

198
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Grandma, just sing

199
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Okay

200
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
I'll sing

201
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
The late emperor

202
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
The late emperor

203
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
The late emperor

204
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Big mistake

205
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
The late emperor

206
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I'm waiting here

207
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I don't know if you want to come or not

208
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I want to think about my hometown tomorrow

209
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,840
and be with my old friends

210
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Put it on the table

211
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Wait a minute

212
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Let me see

213
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Ok, slow down

214
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Come here

215
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Good

216
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Good

217
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Good

218
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Good

219
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Grandma, you sing so well

220
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Mom

221
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm old

222
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I can't sing at all

223
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Great

224
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
Mom

225
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
How do you feel on stage again?

226
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I feel like I'm back to the old days

227
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Mom

228
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Are you happy?

229
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Happy

230
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Today is my 60th year

231
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
The happiest day

232
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
That's good

233
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Do you know who arranged all this?

234
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Who?

235
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
All of this today

236
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Including the custom-made form of the hall and the opera class

237
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,840
It was all arranged by Chu Shaohua

238
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Shaohua said

239
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,840
You have been working hard for the Xia family all your life

240
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
It's almost time to relax

241
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,840
So you must find the happiest time of your life on your 60th birthday

242
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Where is he now?

243
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
We also booked a birthday party for you

244
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
He should be busy there

245
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Go, go see him

246
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Go

247
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Madam, congratulations

248
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Thank you, please have a seat

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840

Thank you

253
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Congratulations

254
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Thank you

255
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Please have a seat

256
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Congratulations

257
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Thank you

258
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Thank you

259
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Let's go

260
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Hello, Mr. Zuo, hurry up

261
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Hurry up

262
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Madam

263
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Shaohua, thank you

264
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
It's my pleasure

265
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,840
It must be hard for you all the way here

266
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
No

267
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Xia Chu

268
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,840
You will have a better life with Xia Chu

269
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Mother, you agree to my marriage with Shaohua

270
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,840
As long as you two think you are a good match

271
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Don't care what others say

272
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
As long as you two feel happy

273
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Nothing else matters

274
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Madam, thank you

275
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
You are welcome

276
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,840
I have to thank you today

277
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
If you want me to be happy

278
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
You should get married

279
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
I will have more grandchildren

280
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Mother, we will get married when the North French army comes back

281
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
How long will it take?

282
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Soon

283
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
We will get married

284
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
We will get married

285
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,840
We will get married

286
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,840
We will get married

287
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,840
The Chinese unification is coming

288
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Xia Chu is right

289
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Xia Chu is the most political-minded among the students who studied in Japan

290
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,840
It seems that I agreed to let him be a politician

291
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
But I was wrong

292
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:50,420
You need to sign the salary of the

293
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
The Chinese unification is coming

294
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
I will sign it

295
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,420
You have signed it

296
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
You have signed it

297
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
It is the salary of the North French army

298
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
The salary of the North French army

299
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,420
Let's go together

300
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,420
Ok

301
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Zhixiu

302
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,420
Xia Chu and Miss Chu are preparing for the wedding

303
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
I think you and Miss Chu are good friends

304
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I didn't expect that fate is not easy

305
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,420
I hope it won't affect our cooperation

306
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
Don't worry

307
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,420
I can't live without money

308
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Mr. Xia, tell me if you need anything

309
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Thank you

310
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,420
How is it?

311
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
So beautiful

312
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,420
I feel like I am dreaming

313
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
It is more beautiful than a dream

314
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
How far is it?

315
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,420
I finally marry you

316
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,420
We are finally together

317
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,420
We will never be apart

318
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Sorry

319
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
Miss Chu, do you want to try this cheongsam?

320
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,420
Don't you have wedding dress?

321
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,420
You need to wear cheongsam for the wedding and the wedding banquet

322
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Try it

323
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
I haven't seen you wear a red cheongsam

324
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Ok

325
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
Ok, come

326
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
Miss, this way please

327
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
Thank you

328
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Xiaohua, I have something urgent to deal with

329
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
I need to go now

330
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
You can go home after you finish the cheongsam

331
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Why are you so anxious?

332
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
I am here to see you

333
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Miss Chu

334
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,420
You...

335
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
I am leaving

336
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,420
Miss Chu

337
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
You look so beautiful in this dress

338
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Miss Chu

339
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,420
Miss Chu

340
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Miss Chu

341
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Xiaohua

342
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,420
Miss Chu

343
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
You are awake

344
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,420
I am in the hospital

345
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
You fainted

346
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
We will send you back

347
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Be careful

348
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
What day is it today?

349
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
14th

350
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Xiaohua

351
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,420
Xiaohua

352
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,420
Xiaohua

353
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
Xiaohua

354
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
What are you doing?

355
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,420
The wedding will be held in two days

356
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Many things haven't been settled yet

357
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
Xiaohua

358
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
Xia Chu

359
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
I know

360
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
He is busy

361
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
I have discussed with him

362
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Leave the wedding to me

363
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
He just needs to attend the wedding

364
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
Why are you here?

365
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
He has been waiting for you all day and night

366
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,420
You are free

367
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,420
You don't care about the wedding room?

368
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,420
Hello

369
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
Dahua Restaurant?

370
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
Yes

371
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,420
I am Chu Xiaohua, the wedding planner for No.16

372
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,420
I want to add two more dishes of leeks

373
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
Is it ok?

374
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
Ok, thank you

375
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Hello, the flower shop

376
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
I am Chu Xiaohua

377
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
I want to confirm with you

378
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,420
Are the flowers ready for my wedding?

379
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
Ok, thank you

380
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
Ok

381
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
You are really free, right?

382
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,420
If you are free, help me to get the wedding cake

383
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
At the station

384
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Xiaohua

385
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
There is no wedding

386
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Erniang, I should get the ring of the ring circle

387
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Or you can go with me

388
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
Go

389
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
What's wrong with him?

390
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
He is not a good man

391
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
He is not a good man

392
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
He is not a good man

393
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
He is not a good man

394
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,420
He is not a good man

395
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,420
He is not a good man

396
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
He is not a good man

397
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
He is not a good man

398
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,420
He is not a good man

399
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,420
He is not a good man

400
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,420
He is not a good man

401
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
He is not a good man

402
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
He is not a good man

403
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
He is not a good man

404
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
He is not a good man

405
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,420
He is not a good man

406
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
He is not a good man

407
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
He is not a good man

408
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
He is not a good man

409
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
He is not a good man

410
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,420
He is not a good man

411
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
He is not a good man

412
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,420
He is not a good man

413
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
He is not a good man

414
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
He is not a good man

415
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
He is not a good man

416
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
He is not a good man

417
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
Madam Xia

418
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,420
Madam Xia

419
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Madam Xia

420
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Madam Xia

421
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
Madam Xia

422
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Where is Boss Xia?

423
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
He is handling the post of Xia Chu

424
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,420
Jie Ai

425
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,420
How is he?

426
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,420
He is in the hospital now

427
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,420
You Ze and You Wen are there with him

428
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
What is wrong with Shao Hua?

429
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
He has been preparing for the wedding

430
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
Still unwilling to accept the fact

431
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
No matter how we persuade

432
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
No matter how we say

433
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
He doesn't believe

434
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
I can only invite you

435
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,420
Maybe what Xia Jiaen said

436
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
He can believe

437
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
Shao Hua

438
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
Sister-in-law

439
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,420
You are here just in time

440
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,420
Come and help me look at the wedding menu for tomorrow

441
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
Shao Hua

442
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Stop working for me

443
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,420
There will be no wedding tomorrow

444
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Xia Chu

445
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,420
He has left

446
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Where did he go?

447
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,420
He will never come back again

448
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Impossible

449
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,420
He will definitely come back

450
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Shao Hua

451
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
Listen to me

452
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,420
Xia Chu is dead

453
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
He will come back to life

454
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,420
He will not come back to life

455
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
But Xia Chu can

456
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
There was no news of him for many years

457
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
Everyone thought he might be dead

458
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
He held a funeral for him

459
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,420
And made a tombstone

460
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
But in the end

461
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
He came back

462
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,420
This time it's real

463
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
It's really Xia Chu

464
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
Sister-in-law

465
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
Don't cry

466
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,420
Don't worry

467
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
He will definitely come tomorrow

468
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,420
He will definitely attend the wedding on time

469
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,420
He will definitely attend the wedding on time

470
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
This wedding dress is so beautiful

471
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,420
So good

472
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,420
Tomorrow is my wedding with Xia Chu

473
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
Don't cry

474
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,420
I know you can't bear to leave me

475
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
Erniu

476
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,420
Don't worry

477
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Even if I get married

478
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
We can still meet again

479
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
We are still good sisters

480
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
A lifelong good sister

481
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,420
Do you know

482
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
Do you know how many years I have been waiting for this day

483
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
Eleven years

484
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
I know

485
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,420
Sleep

486
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,420
Come

487
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
Sleep well

488
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Ok, you should sleep too

489
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,420
Sleep

490
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
Sleep

491
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
Have a good sleep

492
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Tomorrow

493
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
I will come to see you

494
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,420
I will come to see you

495
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,420
I still have to hold the wedding

496
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,420
I will come to see you

497
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Shaohuan

498
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,500
Wang Gente, are you all right?

499
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,340
I'm fine.

500
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,260
I want to answer the phone.

501
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,000
Go on in.

502
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,840
Are like the little Blood

503
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,640
Soft taste

504
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,600
You'll be quite cheeksy

505
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,600
Alsora

506
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,640
It's totally bothering me

507
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,720
This

508
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

509
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
He got shot in the chest with five guns.

510
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
He's still waiting for me at the Taohua Hotel.

511
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
We all saw his body, including you.

512
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Today is the day of my wedding with Xia Chu.

513
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Today is the day of his funeral.

514
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Let go!

515
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The wedding is about to start.

516
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The wedding is about to start.

517
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If I don't go now, I won't make it.

518
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Xia Chu!

519
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Xia Chu!

520
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Stop it!

521
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Calm down.

522
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Look at yourself.

523
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You disappoint me.

524
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You wouldn't have fallen down no matter what you've been through.

525
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You know what happened.

526
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But you chose to be a coward.

527
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You chose to be a coward.

528
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You chose to escape.

529
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You're a coward.

530
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm not.

531
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm not.

532
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then face the reality.

533
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Xia Chu is dead.

534
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Xia Chu is dead.

535
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Xia Chu is dead.

536
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Xia Yao!

537
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Xia Yao!

538
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I found the murderer who killed Xia Chu.

539
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Who is it?

540
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Mu Ziru.

541
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He's dead.

542
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm sorry.

549
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm sorry.

556
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm sorry.

558
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm sorry.

560
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm sorry.

563
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm sorry.

565
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm sorry.

567
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm sorry.

570
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm sorry.

573
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm sorry.

574
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm sorry.

576
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm sorry.

582
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm sorry.

583
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm sorry.

584
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm sorry.

585
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm sorry.

586
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Let's go try some...

587
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
better world food.

588
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What do you want for dinner?

589
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,680
I'm not.

590
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm not.

591
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,120
Do you like it?

592
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,920
You're rich.

593
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,760
Can't I be rich and have a good reputation?

594
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,360
If you take it out,

595
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,800
their eyes will be blinded.

596
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,480
Oh my god.

597
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,720
I love you so much, Wang Mo.

598
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,080
If you love me,

599
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,840
then marry me.

600
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,000
Are you proposing to me?

601
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,800
Look.

602
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,360
We've been together for years.

603
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,440
I should have been married by now.

604
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,520
And my master is about to change his career.

605
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,520
I don't have to fight anymore.

606
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,200
I just want to live a good life with you.

607
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,040
Marry me.

608
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,760
Shaohua.

609
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,480
Look.

610
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,160
Shaohua, what are you doing?

611
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,600
Miss Chu.

612
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,520
What do you mean?

613
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,960
Don't kill Xia Chu.

614
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

615
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,240
Stop pretending, Captain Wu.

616
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,360
Who did this?

617
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,080
Who?

618
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,320
Shaohua.

619
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,480
Did you make a mistake?

620
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,640
Okay.

621
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,920
Tell me.

622
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,600
How did you make it?

623
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,320
And how did you get the prize?

624
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,480
Who told you?

625
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,080
If you don't know,

626
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,640
you're dead.

627
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,800
Don't shoot.

628
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,960
It's a misunderstanding.

629
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,280
Xia Chu is dead.

630
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,600
The gun is on fire.

631
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,520
I swear.

632
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,080
I didn't want to shoot.

633
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,480
Five bullets are on her body.

634
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,520
They're all on fire.

635
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,800
It was a mess.

636
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,320
The gunmen were shooting.

637
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,240
I don't know who they were.

638
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,360
It's really you.

639
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,560
I was on duty.

640
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,360
I swear.

641
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,800
I didn't mean to kill Xia Chu.

642
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,840
And there was no name on the list.

643
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,240
She suddenly appeared there.

644
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,680
You shot her.

645
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,800
Someone was shouting.

646
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:14,320
Someone was

647
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
I was really confused.

648
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
I really didn't know what I did.

649
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,360
I still regret it now, Shaohua.

650
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Regret?

651
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
Captain Wu.

652
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,640
You said it on the celebration banquet.

653
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,360
If you knew how to kill the Communist Party,

654
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
you would kill more people.

655
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
I know.

656
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,120
I don't have anything to say now.

657
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,760
Please give me a chance

658
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,640
to make up for your relationship with An Zheng.

659
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,960
You can say whatever you want.

660
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,760
As long as I can do it,

661
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
I will do it.

662
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,960
I will do it.

663
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,360
Don't drag us down.

664
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,960
You can talk about the conditions.

665
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,240
Go to see Xia Chu.

666
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,040
If he can forgive you,

667
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,800
we will have a fight.

668
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
No.

669
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,240
Erzhuang, get out of the way.

670
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,040
No.

671
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,760
Don't shoot.

672
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
Get out of the way.

673
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,160
Xia Chu is dead.

674
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,840
I want to take care of Xia Chu.

675
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
I know.

676
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,560
But I beg you.

677
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
Don't shoot.

678
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Go.

679
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Go.

680
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
Put down the gun.

681
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
You almost killed me.

682
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,560
I told you to put down the gun.

683
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
Get out.

684
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Captain Wu.

685
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,360
If you dare to shoot,

686
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,760
I will make sure you never see me again.

687
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
You...

688
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Slow down.

689
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
They are all here.

690
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Wen Zhiqiu.

691
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Mu.

692
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
You are so rude.

693
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,560
You are shooting at a woman.

694
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Don't move.

695
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
Brother.

696
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,160
And your daughter.

697
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,760
Don't touch the gun.

698
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Put it down.

699
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
It's none of your business.

700
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Go.

701
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,760
Didn't we agree to watch a movie?

702
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
What is this place?

703
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,760
You can come and go as you want.

704
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Okay.

705
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Don't go.

706
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
You can go.

707
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
But he can't.

708
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
No.

709
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
The movie ticket is full.

710
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
If he doesn't go with me,

711
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
you will have to watch it with me.

712
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Go to the front.

713
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Watch the movie.

714
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Go.

715
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Damn it.

716
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Get out.

717
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
I and Shaohua

718
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,760
have been best friends since childhood.

719
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
For a man like you.

720
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
I know you are good to me.

721
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
I will pay you back more.

722
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Mu Ziru.

723
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
We are not meant to be.

724
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
What do you mean?

725
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
I saved your life today.

726
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
I have paid back

727
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,760
the love you have been giving me for so many years.

728
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
From now on,

729
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
I will never let you go.

730
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
I will never let you go.

731
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
From now on,

732
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
we will be on different paths.

733
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Why?

734
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
You killed Xia Chu.

735
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,760
If I am with you again,

736
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
I will be so sorry to Shaohua.

737
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
You broke up with me

738
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
for a man you don't love?

739
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
You don't know

740
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
what Xia Chu means to Shaohua.

741
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
From now on,

742
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
you are not allowed to go to Shaohua.

743
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,760
You can't touch her.

744
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Even if I don't touch her,

745
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,760
she won't let me go.

746
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
I am begging you.

747
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Do you miss me?

748
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
I miss you.

749
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
How do you know I took your gun?

750
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
You have my key.

751
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
You know where I hid my gun.

752
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,760
You don't need to hide it from me.

753
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
I am sorry.

754
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
What are you thinking?

755
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
You don't want me to go to the same place as Wang Guodong.

756
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
You are here to find Mu Ziru

757
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
and take him to the grave.

758
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
What about your brain?

759
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
I really want to avenge Xia Chu.

760
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Then use this method.

761
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
You are smart.

762
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
You can judge

763
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
and even use your hatred as a bait.

764
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
You are about to be killed.

765
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,760
A little bit of white dew melts.

766
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Love is in the snow.

767
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,760
It's your eyes in your heart.

768
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,760
The little wind and the coldness are all gone.

769
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:34,760
The little peony hidden in his heart.

770
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,760
It warms his heart a little bit.

771
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,760
He speaks the words of the day.

772
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,760
He says winter is short.

773
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,760
