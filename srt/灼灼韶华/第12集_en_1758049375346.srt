Timing & subitles brought to you by 中剧独播

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sky

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the sea, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't stop the heartbeats, it's the knife in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world can't be melted, then let's break it

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, finally turns

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am me, the biggest night star

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't let the world break through it

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Be me

Episode 16

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Xuan, do you want to go to France?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Xuan, can you sing that English song for me again?

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We are all here

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We are all here

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We are all here

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We are all here

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We are all here

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We are all here

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We are all here

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We are all here

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Send it here

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going back to Beijing to give you and Xuan Xuan the procedures

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It may take three days to book the train ticket and ship ticket

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I need some time to settle the family and Shun's mother

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll come back to pick you up after everything is done

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Xuan, say goodbye to Uncle Xia

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Goodbye

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is the secret between me and Xuanxuan

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
See you at the crossroads three years later

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
See you

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wait for me

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Wait for you

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wait for me

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Mom, listen to me

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't talk nonsense

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No way

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The guys in this shop have met a few times

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
They don't know how to do it

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Really?

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The boss told me personally

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He said he didn't plan to remarry

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He just wanted to raise Xuanxuan and live a good life

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sister, this is a dead man

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The heart is alive

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then they all lie to me together

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, they won't lie to me

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Sister, with your boss's mind

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You can't play with everyone's mind

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Sister, listen to me

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You must make a decision

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Do you hear me?

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What can I decide?

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sister, you're back

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Home, dear old home

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Home with a child to his mother

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What is the girl singing?

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She's singing an English song

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What is an English song?

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Grandma, look

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Sister, I'll get you a pot of hot water

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, wait

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Grandma, look

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This book is so beautiful

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Grandma, look, where did you get this book?

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Uncle gave it to me

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Uncle? Which uncle?

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Uncle Xia

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Which Uncle Xia?

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Uncle Xia, Uncle Xia

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you, Song Ping

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's wrong?

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You look different today

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why?

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You look very good today

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Really?

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm embarrassed to see you

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So white

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So white

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He went to the flower and bamboo pharmacy

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To find that little widow

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He stayed there for two hours

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Then the two people came out together

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
On the way, they were talking and laughing

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They smiled

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know where they went

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That means the conditions are already good

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Boss, do we have to do it quickly?

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This year, the gifts for Sanshou Gang

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Have you sent them all?

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Our goods are safe and sound for a year

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It must have been sent

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The person who contacted Sanshou Gang

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Or the old woman?

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes, it's always her

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay, then you tell the old woman

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The two kids who the old woman always wanted to find

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The young couple came to Qizhou again

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let her do it quickly

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If someone leaves

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The second child will never want to revenge again

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes, go

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Young Mistress, are you looking for us?

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can go now

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Wang, Jiang

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I have something important to tell you

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I decided to divide Hua Shunyao's shares

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Four percent for my mother-in-law

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The other four percent are for my mother

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The remaining two percent of shares

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
According to their position and position

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Divide to you two

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,040
the details of the contract.

122
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
We have it too?

123
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,200
Yes.

124
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
Thanks to you two,

125
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,120
and the other employees on the counter,

126
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
we, Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company,

127
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
have this kind of dragon.

128
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,120
So you should have

129
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,360
the shares.

130
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,880
Thank you, Young Mistress.

131
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,680
Thank you.

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,440
Besides,

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,280
I've also mentioned

134
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
the contract of the shares.

135
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,440
You two will

136
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,600
manage the Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company together.

137
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,080
Although my mother and Dashun's mother

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,400
have the most shares,

139
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,040
neither of them

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
nor anyone from the Chen and Chu families

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
can interfere

142
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,520
in the management of the pharmacy.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,680
Besides,

144
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,360
they only have the share.

145
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,400
The shares can never be transferred.

146
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,880
Young Mistress,

147
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,120
you trust us so much?

148
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,240
You don't need to doubt anyone.

149
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,400
I used you two

150
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,080
to work for Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company.

151
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,720
I've known

152
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
how you feel.

153
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,120
From now on,

154
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,760
we'll depend on your hard work.

155
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,360
So Dashun's mother and my mother

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,680
will depend on each other.

157
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,680
Besides,

158
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,880
whether you two

159
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,320
or the other employees with shares,

160
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,360
if you leave Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company one day,

161
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,160
you'll take back the shares.

162
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,480
I understand.

163
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,120
Young Mistress, don't worry.

164
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
We won't let you down.

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
Young Mistress,

166
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
do the Chen and Chu families

167
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,760
know about your arrangement?

168
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,960
Do they agree?

169
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
I started Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company.

170
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,080
It's my business how to handle it.

171
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,320
I believe it's the best arrangement

172
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,920
for the two families.

173
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,160
Besides,

174
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,480
I wrote this contract personally.

175
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,520
We can go to Anke Hall to write it later.

176
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm not afraid of any trouble in the future.

177
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,040
Young Mistress,

178
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,240
must you leave?

179
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,600
You held on to Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company.

180
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,640
Are you really willing to leave?

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,640
We...

182
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,760
We can't bear to leave you.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,120
I can't bear to leave Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company either.

184
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
I can't bear to leave you either.

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,360
But,

186
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,440
I'm afraid

187
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,760
if I don't leave,

188
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,000
I might regret it for the rest of my life.

189
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,000
Young Mistress,

190
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
you're a man of great cause.

191
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,760
We'll help you and Miss Xun

192
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,120
to live a long and happy life.

193
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,040
Young Mistress,

194
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,120
don't worry.

195
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,320
Don't worry.

196
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I'll cooperate with Brother Wang

197
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,760
to make Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company a successful company.

198
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,960
At the same time,

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
we'll treat the two families well.

200
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,360
Then,

201
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,920
I'll leave you to it.

202
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,960
Please.

203
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,680
Young Mistress,

204
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,400
the people from Shouyuan Pharmaceutical Company are here.

205
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,760
Old Liang from Shouyuan Pharmaceutical Company

206
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,000
greets Madam Wei.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,880
What's the matter?

208
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,760
You have something to do on the mountainside again.

209
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,120
I hope you can take care of it.

210
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
I don't have anything to do this time.

211
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,000
I have news this time.

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,320
I want to inform Brother Ertuzi.

213
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,000
What news?

214
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,480
It's been years

215
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,640
that Brother Ertuzi

216
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,400
is looking for a couple.

217
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,200
I accidentally

218
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
blocked their way.

219
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Where is it?

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
The man is dead.

221
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,240
The woman is still alive.

222
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
They opened a Hua Shun Pharmaceutical Company in the town.

223
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,040
All right.

224
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,880
I'll bring the painting.

225
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,720
You're still feeding her?

226
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,480
Brother, Mother.

227
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,680
Shaohua.

228
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,040
Why are you here?

229
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,360
I'm here to see you.

230
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,480
Shaozhong,

231
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,040
I'm here.

232
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,200
Come and talk to me.

233
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,880
You...

234
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,640
Just pretend that I'm not home.

235
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,120
Mother, sit down.

236
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,160
I miss you.

237
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,720
Mother,

238
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,680
I'm here

239
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
to say goodbye to you.

240
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm taking Xuanxuan

241
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,160
to a faraway place.

242
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,240
I don't know

243
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,680
when I'll be back.

244
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,400
What did you say?

245
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,000
You're going to a faraway place?

246
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,800
Yes.

247
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,440
Where are you going?

248
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,440
To France.

249
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,760
France?

250
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
Isn't that a foreign place?

251
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,200
Yes.

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,160
Why are you going there?

253
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,880
Are you taking Xuanxuan alone?

254
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,360
I have a friend.

255
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,720
What friend?

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is it reliable?

257
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Very reliable.

258
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,640
Well,

259
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,680
is the food enough?

260
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,040
Is it safe on the way?

261
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
Can we Chinese

262
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,760
stay in that foreign place?

263
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,720
Shaohua,

264
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,600
don't be fooled.

265
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,640
Brother,

266
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,920
don't worry.

267
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,000
Xuanxuan and I

268
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,680
will be safe and sound.

269
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,800
All right, all right.

270
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,040
Don't worry.

271
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,960
Shaohua has been capable since childhood.

272
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,040
She'll be fine.

273
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,680
Mother,

274
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,840
she's gone too far this time.

275
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,680
Yes.

276
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,560
You're living a good life.

277
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,240
Why do you have to leave?

278
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,480
I've always wanted to go out and have a look.

279
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,360
This is also a good opportunity.

280
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,080
But what about

281
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,640
your family when you leave?

282
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,080
That's right.

283
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,000
What about

284
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,400
your pharmacy?

285
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,920
After I leave,

286
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,520
Mr. Wang and Mr. Jiang

287
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,080
will take care of the Washun Pharmacy.

288
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,840
Two outsiders?

289
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,040
They started their business with me.

290
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,240
They're not outsiders.

291
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
They're not outsiders.

292
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,480
They're also outsiders.

293
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,720
Why don't you leave it to me?

294
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,640
Right?

295
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,680
Do you

296
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,000
not trust me?

297
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,720
Brother,

298
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,720
I don't trust you.

299
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,800
It's because the Washun Pharmacy

300
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,760
is doing

301
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,960
a good job.

302
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,640
If we change our company,

303
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm afraid

304
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,960
it will affect the business of the Washun Pharmacy.

305
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,680
What's the good thing?

306
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,560
The Washun Pharmacy

307
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,040
is a little different from other pharmacies.

308
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,920
What's the difference?

309
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,080
I've been running the pharmacy for decades.

310
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,680
It's just a low-cost business.

311
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,960
Brother, believe me.

312
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,240
I'm doing this

313
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,680
because I have my reasons.

314
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,160
And it's the most appropriate thing.

315
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,440
Anyway,

316
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,960
you still don't trust me.

317
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
You're afraid I'll ruin your pharmacy.

318
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,640
No.

319
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,440
I'm not going to fight with you.

320
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,080
Brother.

321
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,400
Shaohua,

322
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,200
you're leaving.

323
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,800
Why don't you

324
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,120
give the pharmacy to your brother?

325
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:06,960
You...

326
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,680
Are you being a little too much?

327
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,440
Mother,

328
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
my brother is not a material for business.

329
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
If I give the Washun Pharmacy to him,

330
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,320
the outcome

331
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,440
will be the same as Chichun Drugstore.

332
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,840
But...

333
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,320
Let's not talk about this.

334
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm here today

335
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,480
to tell you something important.

336
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm telling you

337
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,360
that after I leave,

338
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,440
you and Shui's mother

339
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,480
will take over the shares

340
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
of the Washun Pharmacy.

341
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,640
How much is that?

342
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,840
Let's put it this way.

343
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,200
Without the help of the natural disaster,

344
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,560
the Washun Pharmacy's annual profit

345
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,480
can maintain

346
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,040
the entire family's livelihood.

347
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,360
Even if Xiaobao goes to school in the future,

348
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,760
it won't be a problem.

349
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,680
That's good.

350
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,080
But you only have to share the profits.

351
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,960
You can't participate in the pharmacy's management

352
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,480
or transfer the shares.

353
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,080
Then...

354
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,120
What do you mean?

355
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
I mean

356
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,080
you can keep the money safely.

357
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,320
In the future,

358
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,120
you don't have to worry about the money.

359
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,640
All right, Mother.

360
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm going back.

361
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,880
In a few days,

362
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,760
we'll go to the Anke Hall

363
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,120
and sign the contract.

364
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,200
It's settled then.

365
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,120
No matter what,

366
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
you have to be careful.

367
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,600
Don't worry.

368
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm leaving, Mother.

369
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,240
Take care.

370
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,840
Where is it?

371
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,160
I'll see.

372
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,880
Sister!

373
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,880
I found you!

374
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,640
My sister!

375
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,960
You're really my sister!

376
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,400
Mother.

377
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,200
You...

378
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,040
What?

379
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,680
You're still eating here?

380
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,080
I'm sorry.

382
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,440
Are you two stupid?

383
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,800
He said whatever he wanted.

384
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,960
Why don't you two argue?

385
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,360
What's there to argue about?

386
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,320
The pharmacy is all burned.

387
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,040
He can do whatever he wants.

388
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,200
Why?

389
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
You're his big brother.

390
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,720
Do you think he still

391
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,360
has me as his big brother?

392
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,480
You're just a coward.

393
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,200
Mother.

394
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,240
You...

395
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,040
Why don't you help Shaozhong?

396
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,720
Why are you being a coward?

397
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,120
You can't say that.

398
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,400
If Shaohua doesn't let Shaozhong

399
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,560
run the pharmacy,

400
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,080
at least the shares

401
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,280
will still belong to us.

402
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,920
40% of it.

403
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,160
We only have 40% of it.

404
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,680
Shaohua said that

405
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,880
40% of it

406
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,440
will be enough for our family

407
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,160
to live forever.

408
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,960
Mother, that's not true.

409
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
The pharmacy belongs to Chu Shaohua.

410
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,360
He's the boss.

411
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,800
It should belong to the Chu family.

412
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,440
Right?

413
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,760
It has nothing to do with the Chen family.

414
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,080
Chen Dachuan is dead.

415
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,920
Why should he share our shares?

416
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,760
Forget it.

417
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,880
Let's just leave it at that.

418
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,720
No.

419
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,600
We have to get it back.

420
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,280
Then you should get it back.

421
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,760
Shaozhong, speak.

422
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,320
Didn't I say

423
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,560
you should get it back?

424
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,840
You're such a loser.

425
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,720
Fine.

426
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll go.

427
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,640
This family is not as good as mine.

428
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
I don't dare to say that.

429
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,800
Is that true?

430
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,160
What else did she say?

431
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,480
I passed by her door during the day

432
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,720
and listened to her.

433
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,960
That's all I heard.

434
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,200
She's leaving.

435
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,440
If she's leaving,

436
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,280
she'll give the pharmacy's shares

437
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,880
to Mr. Wang and Mr. Jiang.

438
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
How can that be?

439
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,840
My sister.

440
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,200
What did I tell you?

441
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,120
I told you to make up your mind earlier.

442
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,280
You didn't listen, right?

443
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
Now it's all gone.

444
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,360
I...

445
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,800
I...

446
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,520
Aunt.

447
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,120
I have to go back to the pharmacy.

448
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,320
I've told you

449
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,400
what I should say.

450
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
It's up to you.

451
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,680
Go back now.

452
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,720
I...

453
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,760
I...

454
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,040
What should I do?

455
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,240
I have no choice now.

456
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,000
I...

457
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
I...

458
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,680
Chu Changhua.

459
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Chu Changhua.

460
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,680
Why are you so mean to your brother?

461
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,200
Let's talk inside.

462
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Young Mistress.

463
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,440
Yes?

464
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,320
The debt of Master Xie's family has been paid back.

465
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,800
The total is 103 silver dollars.

466
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Please have a look.

467
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,080
Have a seat.

468
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
That's right.

469
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Okay.

470
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,000
I think

471
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,160
we can fix it.

472
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,640
Shit.

473
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,120
I want to ask you three questions.

474
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,480
What's that?

475
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,680
What's that?

476
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,580
You still remember that

477
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,160
I was working at a cucumber factory.

478
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,120
You even Game 북

479
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,440
invented Home Mondrian Sparkling Drink.

480
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,040
Under the new version of Home Mondrian Sparkling Drink,

481
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,560
Delight will have

482
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,940
the new flavor of a Lam夜盒菜式.

483
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,060
I think

484
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,700
I should arrange it in your opinion.

485
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
If I were to say,

486
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,780
you shouldn't have divided it into Chen's family.

487
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,020
Sister, have you thought about it?

488
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,940
You've been

489
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,860
supporting this pharmacy alone.

490
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,620
Does it have anything to do with Chen's family?

491
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,260
You're right.

492
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,740
But according to your statement,

493
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,340
my pharmacy

494
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,540
is not as good as Chen's family's.

495
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,500
So I can't divide it into her family.

496
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,100
If you want to divide it,

497
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,460
you can't be so stingy.

498
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Chen's family and Chu's family are divided into four parts.

499
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,820
How can you divide it into two parts?

500
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,340
What about the other two parts?

501
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,140
I'm planning to give those two parts

502
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,260
to Mr. Wang Jiang

503
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,660
and the other employees.

504
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,540
You can divide the employees?

505
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,340
Why?

506
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,860
After I leave,

507
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,340
the pharmacy will be taken care of by others.

508
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,260
You don't give them any shares.

509
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,980
Why should they sell their lives?

510
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,740
Sister,

511
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,740
I think

512
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,340
this is your fault.

513
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,020
You and your brother are relatives.

514
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,460
Both of you are named Chu.

515
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,900
Now you don't give him any shares.

516
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,180
You give them to outsiders.

517
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,980
You're just trying to sell your life.

518
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,940
You don't help your family.

519
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,260
It's not reasonable.

520
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
I can help my family.

521
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,940
I have an idea.

522
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,740
Go ahead.

523
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,980
I can help you to break up with your sister-in-law.

524
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,540
What do you mean?

525
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,220
Look.

526
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,940
Although you married my brother,

527
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,700
you're named Zhou, not Chu.

528
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,740
If my brother breaks you up,

529
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,420
I can give my pharmacy to him.

530
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,220
You said

531
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,060
the pharmacy can only be left to your family.

532
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,700
Chu Shaohua,

533
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,740
you're trying to disgust me, right?

534
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,780
I'm disgusted?

535
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,260
I have another idea.

536
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,780
I'll light the pharmacy

537
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,100
and burn it up.

538
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,580
I'll see who still cares.

539
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,900
Fine.

540
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,300
You're cruel.

541
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
If I'm not cruel,

542
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,700
you would have eaten me up

543
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,220
and left me with no bones.

544
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,500
Zhou, listen to me.

545
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,380
I'm not from the Chen family or Chu family.

546
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,540
I'm my own family.

547
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,420
If you want to get some benefits from me,

548
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,180
you can take advantage of your greed.

549
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,940
If you want to trick me,

550
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,940
I'll make you lose all your words.

551
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,380
Do you believe me?

552
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,020
Fine.

553
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,900
You're cruel enough.

554
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,740
Listen to me.

555
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,380
You'll regret it.

556
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:53,160
Didn't

557
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,460
Young Mistress.

558
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,500
Please don't blame me for gossiping.

559
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,180
Why would you

560
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,140
hate to give your shares

561
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,940
to your mom but not your brother?

562
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,100
What kind of man was she?

563
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,500
You looked over there, too.

564
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,580
If I leave the shares

565
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,860
to my mother,

566
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,340
then my eldest brother must be there.

567
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,300
If I leave all the shares to my eldest brother,

568
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,460
then nothing will happen to my mother.

569
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,460
What is my mother like?

570
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,260
Xuan,

571
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,460
I'm back.

572
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,620
Mother.

573
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,380
Sister-in-law.

574
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,260
Did you eat the medicine today?

575
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,220
I just drank a big bowl.

576
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
You're so good.

577
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,020
Did you eat well today?

578
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,980
Report to Miss Xuan.

579
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,940
I ate on time today.

580
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,740
You're so good.

581
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Mother.

582
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,020
The second son

583
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,060
will take Xuan to play outside.

584
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,540
I have something to talk to your sister-in-law.

585
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,300
Come on.

586
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,140
Xuan, go with your aunt.

587
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,940
I'll be back soon.

588
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,220
Mother.

589
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,540
Master,

590
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,780
Dashun

591
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,860
blesses our family.

592
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
We're all

593
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,100
in a good mood.

594
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,140
We're all in this together.

595
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,540
Life is easy.

596
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,660
We can't miss one.

597
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,740
Bless us.

598
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,060
If anyone wants to tear this family apart,

599
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,460
don't say I won't forgive him.

600
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,180
You two are under it.

601
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,820
I won't let him rest in peace.

602
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
You want a big family?

603
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,660
Mother.

604
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,660
As the master and Dashun,

605
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,260
I have to ask you a few questions.

606
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,100
Go ahead.

607
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
These days,

608
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,420
I've heard a lot of gossip

609
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,900
that you're having an affair.

610
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,820
But don't worry.

611
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,940
I don't believe it.

612
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,580
I know you've been

613
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,300
a good son-in-law.

614
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,500
Mother.

615
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,460
What you heard outside

616
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,220
is all true.

617
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,980
You have the nerve to admit it?

618
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,100
Yes.

619
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,780
I have someone outside.

620
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,740
And I plan to

621
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,260
marry her with Xuanxuan.

622
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,300
Then we'll go abroad with her.

623
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,100
What?

624
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,900
You want to marry her?

625
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,580
With Xuanxuan?

626
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
And go abroad?

627
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,820
Mother.

628
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,900
Actually,

629
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,100
even if you don't ask me today,

630
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,820
I'm going to tell you tonight.

631
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,780
Absolutely not.

632
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:49,980
Mother.

633
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,900
I've made my decision.

634
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,660
Will you be able to do this to Dashun?

635
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,300
I believe

636
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,620
if Dashun is in heaven,

637
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,060
he will support me.

638
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,900
You forget about Dashun so soon?

639
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,660
No.

640
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
I won't forget about Dashun

641
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,180
in my heart.

642
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
But I can't

643
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,740
live in the past forever.

644
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,140
Daqian.

645
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,340
You can't leave.

646
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,140
You can't leave.

647
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,260
If you leave this family,

648
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,740
what about the family?

649
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,220
What about the life?

650
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,380
How can you live?

651
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,700
The family of Dashun

652
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,460
is not reliable.

653
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,660
Daqian,

654
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,260
you can't just think about yourself

655
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,700
in the eyes of

656
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,580
Master and Dashun.

657
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,540
You have to think about

658
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,940
how I can live in the future.

659
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,780
Come on, mother.

660
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,300
Don't worry.

661
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,180
Sit down.

662
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,820
Mother.

663
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,940
Don't worry about this.

664
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,580
Actually, I've arranged everything.

665
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,860
Why do you want to

666
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,020
share the family with your mother?

667
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,340
This is my

668
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,100
own family business.

669
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,220
I can share it with anyone I want.

670
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,020
Besides,

671
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,820
I've shared it with the Chen family.

672
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,780
Why can't I

673
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,220
share it with my own mother?

674
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,660
No, no, no.

675
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,100
You can't leave.

676
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,900
You can't give the pharmacy to outsiders.

677
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,500
Mother,

678
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,220
please believe me.

679
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,660
Only in this way

680
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,860
can you have a guarantee of your future.

681
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,340
As long as I have a breath,

682
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,380
you can't sell the Chen family.

683
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,580
Then I'll tell you the truth.

684
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,460
You can't stop me from doing this.

685
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,900
I'm determined to leave.

686
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,260
No one can stop me.

687
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,500
The Chen family can't decide for you.

688
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,540
I'm not the master of the Chen family.

689
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,540
I'm the master of myself.

690
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,860
You...

691
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,420
You...

692
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,820
Mother.

693
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,420
I call you mother

694
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,780
to show my respect to you

695
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,780
and to show my affection to you.

696
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,620
If you also understand

697
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,420
our friendship and respect,

698
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,220
when we meet again,

699
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,580
if Xuanxuan calls you grandma again,

700
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,860
I'll call you mother again.

701
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,100
Don't call me mother.

702
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,340
I don't have a cruel daughter-in-law like you.

703
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,740
What did the Chen family do to you?

704
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,580
Da Shun treats you so well.

705
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,860
You're always

706
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,100
a man when he dies.

707
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,100
You broke my hand.

708
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,940
You're a man.

709
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,060
How can I

710
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,100
wrong the Chen family?

711
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,220
I'm loyal to Da Shun.

712
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,020
He's gone.

713
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,180
I'm doing my duty.

714
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,580
Even if I have to leave,

715
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,100
I've left a good family

716
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
for you and the Chen family.

717
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,700
I'm loyal to Da Shun.

718
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,260
I have no regrets.

719
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,180
I'm loyal to the Chen family.

720
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,380
I'm a man of my word.

721
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
The Chen family

722
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,100
has saved me,

723
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,820
too.

724
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,900
Okay!

725
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,700
It wouldn't be different

726
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,260
to have an eggしu.

727
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,220
the dish is too dry,

728
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,420
pinch it a little worse,

729
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,340
do it right.

730
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,540
opinion

731
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,340
According to 옛날 raids adept's

732
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,300
scientists are often

733
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,100
here to insist that

734
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,260
the style is not suitable for Chinese

735
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,100
women.

736
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,820
I want to

737
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,180
do as you want.

738
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,820
If you dare to leave, I'll kill myself for you.

739
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,340
You won't.

740
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,380
Try it.

741
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,020
Try it.

742
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,660
I...

743
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,580
Sister, don't go.

744
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,300
Come on.

745
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,020
Mother.

746
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,700
Don't be angry.

747
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,740
Come on.

748
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,700
You can't go.

749
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,780
You...

750
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,820
How can I

751
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,900
be so ungrateful?

752
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,980
Mother.

753
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,340
You can't take the child away.

754
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,060
Grandma.

755
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,180
You can go if you want to.

756
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,100
You can't take Xuanxuan away.

757
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,780
This child is my only child.

758
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,980
I brought her up.

759
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
She's from my family.

760
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,580
Oh, my God.

761
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,060
Why did you push me away?

762
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,940
Mother.

763
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,620
Mother.

764
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,300
Mother.

765
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,620
Don't cry.

766
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,220
It's all gone.

767
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,540
Mother.

768
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,820
Don't cry.

769
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,020
You'll break your body.

770
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,620
I'm here.

771
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,500
You...

772
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,980
are my only child.

773
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Mother, listen to me.

774
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,580
If you want to keep Xuanxuan and sister-in-law

775
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,260
and keep the pharmacy,

776
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,260
I have an idea.

777
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,220
Why do you say that?

778
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,660
I'm doing it for you.

779
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,380
Didn't Shaohua give us the shares of Sicheng?

780
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,620
Is that our share?

781
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,660
It's in my hand.

782
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,140
It's equal to ours.

783
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,820
It's not certain.

784
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,340
Besides,

785
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,580
you said

786
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,220
you had a deal.

787
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,100
You only need a hundred-yen share.

788
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,700
You have it.

789
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,300
But I can't steal...

790
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,420
my sister's money.

791
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,260
Don't steal it.

792
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,380
You have to borrow it.

793
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,500
We can make more money

794
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,860
and return it to her.

795
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,940
It's embarrassing.

796
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,260
I can't see it.

797
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,540
Besides,

798
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,460
if Shaohua finds out

799
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,140
that she's having an affair,

800
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,140
I'm afraid.

801
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,740
You're afraid.

802
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,940
You're afraid of everyone.

803
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,460
You're not afraid of me, are you?

804
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,860
I am.

805
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,620
You're the one I'm most afraid of.

806
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,820
Go to sleep.

807
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,580
I've found a way.

808
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,220
I can't let her find out.

809
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,740
Mom.

810
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,460
To be honest,

811
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,300
she just needs a man.

812
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,820
A man?

813
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,980
Think about it.

814
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,220
She's a good girl.

815
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
But she's a widow at a young age.

816
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,220
She said she'd take care of her brother.

817
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,700
But she's a living woman.

818
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,620
If you can help her,

819
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,940
she won't think too much.

820
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,740
What do you mean?

821
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,460
Mom.

822
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,020
I have my own way.

823
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,540
I know what I'm doing.

824
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,820
I know what I'm doing.

825
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,900
What's that?

826
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,340
That's the only way

827
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,900
to get her medicine.

828
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,420
No way.

829
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,460
Don't worry.

830
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,620
Once I succeed,

831
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,100
she'll only accept it.

832
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,220
She won't leave even if you kick her.

833
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,460
She'll be loyal to our Chen family.

834
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,780
Will you let your brother down?

835
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,500
Will you let your family down?

836
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,940
It's a crime.

837
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,580
If the Chen family dies,

838
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,300
it'll be a crime against my brother,

839
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,300
my father,

840
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,740
and my ancestors.

841
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,460
It's a huge crime.

842
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,100
Shiyun, you...

843
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,580
After you let her cure him, I...

844
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,380
It's our family's business.

845
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,500
Who can know?

846
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,660
Your sister-in-law

847
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,220
doesn't think

848
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,940
that a normal person can help her.

849
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,700
I have my own way.

850
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,820
But you have to help me.

851
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,580
Mom.

852
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,180
Let me think.

853
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:13,980
Fine.

854
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,620
Think about it.

855
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,100
Grandma.

856
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,060
Grandma.

857
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,220
Shiyun. Shiyun.

858
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,660
Don't be afraid.

859
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,660
I'm here.

860
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
I'm here.

861
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,820
Mom.

862
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,180
Don't hesitate.

863
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
I'm here.

864
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm here.

865
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
I'm here.

866
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm here.

867
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,220
The spend Double-De cILF

868
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,460
is about ten times more than Sock culture.

869
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,500
Yes.

870
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,220
Shun.

871
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,500
This idea...

872
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,180
is not right.

873
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,220
Then tell me.

874
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,420
What's the right idea?

875
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,580
Do it the way

876
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,740
your sister-in-law said.

877
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,700
It's her plan.

878
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,380
About half of the share of Hua Shun's clinic

879
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,820
are put away by others.

880
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,620
They put away and let us sell them?

881
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,780
But it's not a good idea to say it.

882
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,260
He's been guarding the pharmacy every day.

883
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,260
He's been using his hands and feet

884
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,660
to take over the shares of Sicheng.

885
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,140
It's too easy for him.

886
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,580
He can't do that.

887
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,460
He...

888
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,060
Can he do that?

889
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,140
Of course.

890
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,500
I've seen this kind of thing many times.

891
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,260
Besides, old mother,

892
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,180
you're really willing to let Xuanxuan go?

893
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,100
Once she leaves,

894
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,340
maybe she'll never see you again.

895
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,740
Xuanxuan?

896
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,260
I raised her up.

897
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,220
She's a girl,

898
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,460
but she's smart and sensible.

899
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,060
If she dares to take Xuanxuan away,

900
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,900
she'll be really

901
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,500
a crybaby.

902
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,420
You're right, mother.

903
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,660
So I can't use her.

904
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,900
I can only use her.

905
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,260
First,

906
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,380
we can take over the pharmacy.

907
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,180
Second,

908
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,220
Xuanxuan can stay with you

909
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,500
forever.

910
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
You...

911
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,580
You...

912
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,100
Mother,

913
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,780
stop being a coward.

914
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,300
Mother, the chicken soup is ready.

915
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,500
Who let you in?

916
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,620
You scared me.

917
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,500
Didn't you

918
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,500
ask me to make chicken soup for you?

919
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,700
Get lost.

920
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,220
Listen to me.

921
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,060
You just need to

922
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,340
put the medicine bag

923
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,420
into the chicken soup.

924
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,620
Is that so?

925
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,140
Are you afraid?

926
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,220
Isn't that too immoral?

927
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,420
Isn't it the same as

928
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,460
collecting chicken ashes before?

929
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,940
Of course it's the same.

930
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,700
Collecting chicken ashes?

931
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,540
The chicken wasn't collected.

932
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,780
The soup isn't mixed either.

933
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,900
Mother, it's too late

934
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,220
if you don't leave now.

935
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,380
I... I need to think about it.

936
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,500
What are you thinking about?

937
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,300
We don't have time, mother.

938
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,740
Didn't you hear your cousin say

939
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,500
that the pharmacy

940
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,100
is closed for a day

941
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,020
and the workers are all in the shop?

942
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,220
What does that mean?

943
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,420
It means

944
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,580
that you're going to hand over the medicine bag.

945
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,380
Don't move.

946
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:13,980
I'm busy.

947
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,500
Mom...

948
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,380
Grandma!

949
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,340
My good granddaughter.

950
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,580
Do you miss me?

951
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,780
Mom, have a seat.

952
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,180
I'm busy, big sister.

953
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,380
I came here today

954
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,580
to apologize to you.

955
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,380
Why did I say that yesterday?

956
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,380
I was so anxious.

957
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,380
I said it so loudly.

958
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,780
I didn't mean it.

959
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,980
Don't take it to heart.

960
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,180
Don't let these things

961
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,780
affect our harmony.

962
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,780
Mom, what are you singing?

963
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,780
I just want to

964
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,780
talk to you

965
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
in a polite way.

966
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,380
It's been so many years.

967
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,780
When you came to the Chen family,

968
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
I did

969
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,180
mean something to you.

970
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
But it's for the Chen family's rules.

971
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,380
It's been so many years.

972
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,380
So many things have happened.

973
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,980
I know you

974
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,980
are polite,

975
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,580
capable,

976
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,580
and good to me.

977
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,580
I'm good to you.

978
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,780
Don't you think

979
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,980
I'm different from

980
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,380
before?

981
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,380
I'm totally different.

982
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,580
Right?

983
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,580
Mom,

984
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,780
I was too bold

985
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,380
to say that yesterday.

986
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,580
I was not

987
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,980
polite.

988
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,580
I apologize to you.

989
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,980
Why do you apologize to me?

990
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,180
I just want to ask you

991
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,580
if you can stay.

992
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,580
You can stay.

993
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,180
The Chen family can't leave you.

994
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,980
I can't leave you either.

995
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,380
Xuanxuan,

996
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,580
if you agree to stay,

997
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,980
I promise you

998
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,380
I'll treat you

999
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,980
like a daughter.

1000
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,180
Mom,

1001
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,580
I will leave.

1002
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,780
Not only for my business,

1003
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,980
I also want to

1004
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
be educated better for Xuanxuan.

1005
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,380
Okay.

1006
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
Then...

1007
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,380
I'll take Xuanxuan away.

1008
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,180
Before you leave,

1009
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:00,980
I'll take her away.

1010
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
I can talk to her.

1011
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,780
I can be with Xuanxuan.

1012
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,380
Forget it.

1013
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,580
Two days ago,

1014
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,380
I was sick.

1015
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,780
I just recovered.

1016
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,380
I'm afraid I'll catch a cold

1017
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,180
on the way back.

1018
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,780
I'm afraid I'll get sick again.

1019
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,180
I'll take her away in two days.

1020
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,180
I want her to recover soon.

1021
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,780
Mom,

1022
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,180
it's late.

1023
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,580
It's not easy to go.

1024
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,580
If you have nothing to do,

1025
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,180
go back first.

1026
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,380
Okay.

1027
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,980
Okay.

1028
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:32,980
I'll listen to you.

1029
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,180
Okay.

1030
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,580
At this time,

1031
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,980
you must have finished your meal.

1032
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,780
When you're done,

1033
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,180
it's midnight.

1034
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,580
Drink the soup.

1035
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,380
Chicken soup is good for your health.

1036
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,780
You look thin.

1037
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,180
Mom, thank you.

1038
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,580
You're welcome.

1039
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,780
Just drink it.

1040
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,780
I'm sorry.

1041
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,980
I'm sorry.

1042
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
I'm sorry.

1043
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,380
I'm sorry.

1044
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,580
I'm sorry.

1045
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,780
I'm sorry.

1046
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,980
I'm sorry.

1047
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,180
I'm sorry.

1048
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,380
I'm sorry.

1049
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,580
I'm sorry.

1050
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,780
I'm sorry.

1051
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,980
I'm sorry.

1052
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,180
I'm sorry.

1053
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,380
I'm sorry.

1054
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,580
I'm sorry.

1055
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,780
I'm sorry.

1056
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,980
I'm sorry.

1057
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,180
I'm sorry.

1058
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,380
I'm sorry.

1059
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,580
I'm sorry.

1060
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,780
I'm sorry.

1061
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,980
I'm sorry.

1062
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,180
I'm sorry.

1063
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
I'm sorry.

1064
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,780
A little bit

1065
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,380
warms her heart

1066
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,980
She speaks out

1067
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,980
She says winter is short

1068
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,780
Eternal love

1069
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,180
Look at her again

1070
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,380
Day by day

1071
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,980
Night by night

1072
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,380
No regrets

1073
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,980
Night by night

1074
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,580
No regrets

1075
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,580
No regrets

1076
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,980
The wind blows the smoke away

1077
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,180
I fight for you

1078
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,980
The rain falls

1079
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:23,580
Eternal love

1080
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,580
Day by day

1081
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,580
Night by night

1082
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,580
No regrets

1083
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,580
Night by night

1084
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,580
No regrets

1085
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,580
The wind blows the smoke away

1086
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,580
I fight for you

1087
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,580
The rain falls

1088
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,580
Eternal love

1089
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,580
The wind blows the smoke away

1090
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,580
Night by night

1091
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,580
No regrets

1092
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,580
Night by night

1093
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,780
The wind blows the smoke away

1094
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,980
I fight for you

1095
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,580
The rain falls

1096
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:18,980
Eternal love
