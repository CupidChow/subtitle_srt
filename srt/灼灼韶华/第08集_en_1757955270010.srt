1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
We can never be together

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,900
We can never be apart

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,800
We shall always be together

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,400
We shall always be together

5
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,200
Do you understand?

6
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,400
Do you understand?

7
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,320
Do you understand?

8
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,580
I love you

9
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,540
Do you understand?

10
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,720
What's wrong?

11
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,380
What's wrong?

12
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,920
What are you waiting for?

13
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,880
Let's not talk about amazing things

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,920
Brother

15
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,500
Give me a kiss

16
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,220
Okay

17
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,000
Sister

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,420
Sis

19
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,300
Don't go

20
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,180
Sister

21
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,800
Let go

22
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,420
Sister

23
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,520
Let go

24
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,520
I can't buy a house

25
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,520
I have to be gentle

26
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Walk this life gently

27
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,520
But I heard the wind from the deep sky

28
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
You are the sea, the smoke is the wind

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,520
How can you be lost

31
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,520
That is not a good thing, it is a sharp knife in my eyes

32
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,520
If this world doesn't want to, then let it be

33
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,520
My bitter pain, my pain, I will turn around

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,520
I am me, the biggest night star

35
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,520
If the world doesn't want to, then let it be

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Who is the one for me

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Episode 15

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Dad and Da Shuai have been in this business for so many years

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,520
They must know how to use medicine and how to prevent it

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,520
They will be fine

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
They will come back safely

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Da Shuai

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Young Mistress

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Take the madam back first

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Ok

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
I'm not afraid

47
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Madam, let's go

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Really

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Really

50
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm not afraid

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Slowly, madam, slowly

52
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Little stone

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,520
You go to hire a carriage for me, I want to go to Shanxi

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
You want gold?

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Yes, I can't rest assured

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

57
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Don't do it

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
The roads in Shanxi have been blocked recently

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
You can't go in

60
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Even if you go in, what if you get infected with the plague?

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
But I can't do nothing like this

62
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Go

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Young Mistress, you can't do anything

64
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,520
It's better to stay here and keep the madam safe

65
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Take care of the medicine shop

66
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Besides, there is still one thing to do when the branch opens

67
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Can the branch still open like this?

68
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Can't you see it?

69
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,520
The water flows from the west to the capital

70
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,520
The dragon flies in the dragon gate of Yuegu

71
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Yang Liu San Chi is very impressive

72
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,520
The peach blossoms are so beautiful

73
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Kun is the ground and Shun is the river

74
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,520
The right is the water

75
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
The water changes the direction

76
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,520
It means the family business is smooth and the financial situation is smooth

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,520
The owner's family will be blessed

78
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,520
You can see when you can come back

79
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
The opening ceremony is a big joy

80
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
The bride and bridegroom are back

81
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Don't worry

82
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,520
The day the new shop opens, people will be back

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
The day of opening

84
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Yes, the day of opening

85
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Take care

86
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Really?

87
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Li Banxing is very accurate

88
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Then we will open the branch at 15

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Boss Wang, congratulations

90
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Please come inside

91
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Please come inside

92
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Congratulations to Boss Chu

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Boss Zhou, please come inside

94
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Come inside please

95
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Young Mistress, when will the opening ceremony be held?

96
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Wait a little bit

97
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
If you wait a little bit, you will miss the auspicious time

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Young Mistress

99
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Boss Wei is here

100
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,520
After the wedding ceremony, we were all trapped in the inn

101
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Brother Dashun was fine

102
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,520
But he saw many people outside were in danger

103
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,520
No medicine can save him, he only waited to die

104
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Brother Dashun said he was a doctor

105
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
He said he was a doctor

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
He said he was a doctor

107
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
He said he was a doctor

108
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
He said he was a doctor

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,520
He said he was a doctor

110
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
He said he was a doctor

111
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Brother Dashun said he couldn't die of illness

112
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
So he stood up and saved people from everywhere

113
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,520
He saved more than ten people

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
But he…

115
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Where is master?

116
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Boss Chen was infected with the plague when he saved him

117
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
And he died within days

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Dead?

119
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,800
My Shun...

120
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
My Shun...

121
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
My Master...

122
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
My Master...

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,840
My Shun...

124
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
Mother!

125
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,080
Mother!

126
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,800
Madam!

127
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,000
Madam!

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,520
No...

129
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,520
No...

130
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,520
No...

131
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,200
No...

132
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
My Shun...

133
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Where is he now?

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Because Brother Dashun and Boss Chen

135
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,000
died together.

136
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,720
According to local rules,

137
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,960
they were buried together.

138
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,480
How can I live?

139
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,360
Dashun...

140
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Young Mistress,

141
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,680
do you want to know

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,040
how my foreign students

143
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,680
are doing?

144
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,360
son-in-law and prime minister

145
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,080
already informed all.

146
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
But,

147
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,720
they say Si Ting has died.

148
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,360
I know.

149
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
But there's a delivery.

150
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
I have to deliver it in two days.

151
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,840
Who do you think I should send?

152
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,720
Why didn't you take it?

153
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,480
Nothing went out of your hands.

154
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,680
Sister-in-law

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,280
Imagine drinking some porridge.

156
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,000
Ze.

157
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,840
You haven't eaten anything all day.

158
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Father! Big Brother!

159
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Father!

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
I'm not filial.

161
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
I'm not filial.

162
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Big Brother.

163
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,840
It's no use being a brother.

164
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,840
If I could help you a little bit,

165
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,840
you wouldn't have left like this.

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I was wrong.

167
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Er Shun, you're back!

168
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I miss you!

169
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Mother!

170
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I miss Er Shun!

171
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,840
I miss you so much!

172
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Mother! Mother!

173
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Don't be afraid!

174
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
I'm here!

175
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Don't be afraid!

176
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Mother!

177
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Er Shun!

178
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Er Shun is back!

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Sister-in-law.

180
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,840
From now on,

181
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Xuan Xuan is my daughter.

182
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I will take good care of you.

183
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
My Shun is back!

184
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Mother!

185
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,840
I don't have a father anymore.

186
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Shun!

187
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Big Brother!

188
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
A few days ago, I saw you wanted to vomit.

189
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
You couldn't eat anything.

190
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I asked someone to go to Mr. Wang Hong Chun

191
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
and ask for a prescription.

192
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
I used the best white worms,

193
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
liver, liver,

194
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
redness and back pain

195
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
to make you a

196
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,840
fragrant sachet of the golden phoenix.

197
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Young Mistress.

198
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Young Mistress.

199
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
I have a few things to report to you.

200
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Xia Shi Teng.

201
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
What is it?

202
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Second Young Master has come to the drug store several times.

203
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
What does he do at the drug store?

204
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
I don't know.

205
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I just asked

206
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
how much assets and cash there are.

207
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
And

208
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,840
who has the name plates and the business list?

209
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,760
Wait for me.

210
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,680
Okay.

211
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,640
Keep this.

212
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,800
The chapter and the guest list are all in here.

213
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Except me,

214
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,120
don't give it to anyone else.

215
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,400
Okay.

216
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,920
Go.

217
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,680
Okay.

218
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,040
ны

219
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,000
Song Ping.

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,480
Song Ping.

221
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,880
suffers

222
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,280
Please help me see her off.

223
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,440
Okay.

224
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,360
I'm going out for a while.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Where are you going?

226
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,200
I need to go to the pharmacy

227
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,640
to deal with something.

228
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,320
Grandaunt.

229
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,240
Young Mistress,

230
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,760
A'Shun wants to see you.

231
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,440
I'm going to do something.

232
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,400
I'll go to him when I get back.

233
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,600
He wants you to go now.

234
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,600
Young Mistress,

235
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,520
you should go with him.

236
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,200
Me?

237
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,840
Yes.

238
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,720
Mother.

239
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,960
Third Master.

240
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,040
Third Master.

241
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,760
Third Master,

242
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,680
everyone has arrived.

243
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,440
Has arrived?

244
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,320
Who has arrived?

245
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,360
Third Master,

246
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,760
you can speak now.

247
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,400
The funeral of A'Shun

248
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
is almost done.

249
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,280
How do you say this old saying?

250
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,840
The country can't be without a ruler.

251
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
The family

252
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,840
can't be without a master.

253
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,200
This...

254
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,800
This...

255
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,600
According to the rules of the Chen family,

256
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,280
A'Shun will be the next one.

257
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,440
A'Shun will be the next one.

258
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,200
What?

259
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,960
Daughter-in-law?

260
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,480
Daughter-in-law?

261
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,880
Third Master, I'm here.

262
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,040
First, go home.

263
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,160
Do you agree with what Third Master said?

264
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,600
I agree.

265
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,520
You agree?

266
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,160
I agree.

267
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,800
Then, it's settled.

268
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,920
I don't agree.

269
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,160
You're from A'Shun's family.

270
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,640
You can't speak here.

271
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,520
Third Master,

272
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,240
A'Shun has left.

273
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,720
But this family

274
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,280
is still half of it.

275
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,000
Since you say I'm from A'Shun's family,

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
I should be half of it

277
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
on behalf of A'Shun.

278
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
A woman's family?

279
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,760
What family?

280
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,960
When father was alive,

281
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,560
I could speak in the old shop of Chen's family.

282
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,560
I was in charge of the branch.

283
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,400
Why can't I be the head of the family?

284
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,520
Da'shun's family.

285
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,520
If there's no man in this family,

286
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,480
you can speak.

287
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
But now,

288
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,160
Second Master is still here.

289
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,920
It's a great honor

290
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,080
to let him be the head of the family.

291
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,080
Sister-in-law,

292
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,240
after I become the head of the family,

293
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,880
I won't treat you and Xuanxuan badly.

294
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,920
Don't worry.

295
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,640
A'Shun has made his statement.

296
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,320
What else do you want?

297
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
Chen A'Shun can be the head of the family.

298
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
But when father was alive,

299
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,760
he promised to

300
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,760
let me and Da'shun manage the branch.

301
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,440
And he divided us half of the shares.

302
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,160
Now Da'shun is gone.

303
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
I think we should

304
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,800
manage half of the shares.

305
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,160
So I think we should

306
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,080
manage the branch.

307
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,280
What's going on?

308
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,760
You...

309
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,920
What are you talking about?

310
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,280
Mother,

311
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,640
you were present when father made the decision.

312
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,520
Tell me.

313
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,200
Am I telling the truth?

314
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,200
I don't know.

315
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,240
I...

316
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
How can I know?

317
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,000
I...

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You don't know?

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,240
I'm a rich woman.

320
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,720
I don't know anything about business.

321
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
I don't remember what they said.

322
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Mother.

323
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,080
Father and Da'shun's

324
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,840
head is still alive.

325
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,160
You can't talk to them with a conscience.

326
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,840
They will die.

327
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,480
How can I talk to you?

328
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,440
Mother.

329
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,280
Business is not a small thing.

330
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,480
You know A'Shun's character.

331
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,640
You...

332
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,320
You can't be fooled by his words.

333
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,720
What's my character, Chu Shaohua?

334
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,240
Since you married into our Chen family,

335
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,920
you've been spoiled by your brother.

336
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,680
You always go against me.

337
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm just trying to

338
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,560
bear with you.

339
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,360
I was not sensible before.

340
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,720
But I've grown up.

341
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,240
I'm telling you.

342
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,080
From now on,

343
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,320
I can't let you go to the warehouse.

344
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:25,920
Mother.

345
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,120
Tell me the truth.

346
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,560
Did father promise

347
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,600
to let me and Da'shun manage the branch

348
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,480
and 50% of the shares?

349
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,600
No.

350
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,560
Zongping.

351
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,680
You were there.

352
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,400
Tell us.

353
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
What did father say?

354
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,640
I...

355
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
Say whatever you hear.

356
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,720
That day,

357
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,840
father did...

358
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,720
What did he say?

359
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,200
How dare you?

360
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,040
Zongping.

361
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,800
Say it.

362
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,480
Say it.

363
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,440
I forgot.

364
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,560
Zongping.

365
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,160
Zongping.

366
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,520
Sister-in-law.

367
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,040
Don't push me.

368
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,720
Say it.

369
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,240
I didn't hear anything.

370
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,560
I really didn't hear anything.

371
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,200
It seems that

372
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,880
everything is clear now.

373
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,360
Sister-in-law.

374
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,440
I won't bother you

375
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,920
with the past.

376
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,960
From now on,

377
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,080
you and Xuanxuan

378
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,400
live a good life.

379
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,840
Don't be a troublemaker.

380
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,080
Chen Da'shun.

381
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,360
Don't think that

382
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,840
you can control the world

383
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,680
by using mother and Weike Zongping.

384
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
Don't forget.

385
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,560
Father and Da'shun

386
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,160
and the business partners,

387
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,640
the workers and helpers

388
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,560
in the pharmacy,

389
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,160
they all know

390
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,040
what's going on.

391
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,280
I'll go to them now

392
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,480
to see your face.

393
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,320
Stop.

394
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,160
Move.

395
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,280
Da'shun's family.

396
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,880
As a father,

397
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,400
you are arrogant

398
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,360
and unfilial.

399
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,800
You are too much.

400
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,560
Shut up.

401
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,800
It's our family's business.

402
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
It's not your turn to talk.

403
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,200
Third Master.

404
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
Say something.

405
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,720
It's too much.

406
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,520
It's too much.

407
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,720
And you.

408
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,640
You are so stupid.

409
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,120
You don't want to be the leader

410
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,000
when others are doing things.

411
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,400
Third Master.

412
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,920
Look.

413
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,760
Take her out.

414
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,480
Let me go.

415
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,320
Let me go.

416
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,280
Let me go.

417
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,680
Lock her in the workshop.

418
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,040
Let me go.

419
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
Let her stay for a few days.

420
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,000
See if she dares to disobey the leader.

421
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,240
Zongping.

422
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,680
Where is Xuanxuan?

423
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640
Is Xuanxuan okay?

424
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,680
She is fine.

425
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,840
I've been watching her.

426
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,800
Don't worry.

427
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,240
Come.

428
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,800
I'll bring you some food.

429
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,360
Su Ming.

430
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,560
Can you untie this for me?

431
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,000
I dare not.

432
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,120
Ershun said

433
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,560
if anyone let you go,

434
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
he would beat him to death.

435
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,240
Don't be afraid of him.

436
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,120
I'm just afraid.

437
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,640
Ershun said

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
as long as you give him

439
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,760
the account book or name list,

440
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,640
he would let you go.

441
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,360
Su Ming.

442
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
Just let him go.

443
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,960
You can't beat him.

444
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,720
It's painful for him to hit people.

445
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,160
I'm not afraid of pain.

446
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,840
Just let Ershun be the leader.

447
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,960
Let me tell you.

448
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Ever since Ershun came back,

449
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,720
I've been willing to use money.

450
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,920
I have enough money to buy meat.

451
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,720
That's enough.

452
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,080
What else do you want?

453
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,600
I want a fair one.

454
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,760
Su Ming.

455
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,200
Help me.

456
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,040
Let me go secretly.

457
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,920
Secretly.

458
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,960
Song Ping.

459
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,200
You know it in your heart, right?

460
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,880
You know that Chen Ershun

461
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,360
is lying.

462
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm telling the truth, right?

463
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm leaving.

464
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,280
Song Ping.

465
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,080
Song Ping.

466
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,600
Song Ping.

467
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,880
Sister-in-law.

468
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,440
Don't be like this.

469
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,160
Life is full of pain.

470
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,320
Song Ping.

471
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,320
Song Ping.

472
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,200
It's okay.

473
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,420
The musician who lives in me

474
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,140
iki person will be so miserable.

475
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,080
The life Jamie marked

476
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,040
will pass, right?

477
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,400
It's just an umbrella still roaring in the sky,

478
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,480
the moon light sphere that is always so bright.

479
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,000
Suddenly it Gentlemen racing after it

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,600
forms a pack

481
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,200
that opens the door.

482
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,320
And it maximizes the sense of sense of responsibility.

483
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,680
It's time for all together,

484
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,480
Second Uncle, did you treat him too much that day?

485
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,640
Too much, Mom?

486
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,840
I didn't step on him.

487
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,960
With his looks, he must have caused trouble. Do you believe me?

488
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,760
I do believe you.

489
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,880
But these past two days, I...

490
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,360
Second Uncle, listen to me.

491
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,960
Second Uncle, listen to me.

492
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,080
When your father was alive, he did say

493
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
that he wanted to give half of the shares to him.

494
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,280
Or else, I would be like this.

495
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,680
It's just half of the shares. Just give it to him.

496
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,280
Forget it. You're really generous.

497
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,880
Even if Dad said that he wanted to give shares, that's not for him. It's for my brother.

498
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,280
My brother is gone now. Shouldn't we return the shares to our Chen family?

499
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
You're giving it to him?

500
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,880
It's not good to say this, Mom.

501
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,080
You're not afraid that he'll run away with the shares?

502
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,680
Or you'll give it to his mother's family?

503
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,280
He's giving it to his...

504
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,680
He's also Xuanxuan's mother.

505
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
You're really so muddled.

506
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,480
Xuanxuan is going to marry when she grows up.

507
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,680
You know how much my sister-in-law is.

508
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,280
Let's let her take a step now. Let her relax.

509
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,080
Then she'll be able to eat us all.

510
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Her personality is just a face.

511
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,880
But you're keeping her in this way. If anything happens to her,

512
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,080
I... in my heart...

513
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,280
Mom, how about you try to persuade her again?

514
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
I'll treat you like a daughter when you get married.

515
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
You're capable.

516
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
You're capable.

517
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,680
Your personality is too strong.

518
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
When Da Shun was here,

519
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,080
he favored you and cared about you.

520
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
But from now on,

521
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
when Da Shun is gone, no one in this family

522
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,680
will be like before.

523
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,080
They'll favor you and care about you.

524
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,080
No one can protect us.

525
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
I can't let you guys

526
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
bully us like this.

527
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Er Shun is a bit too much.

528
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,480
I scolded him.

529
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,080
But if you were obedient,

530
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
how could you do this?

531
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,080
I just want to get what I have.

532
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Am I wrong?

533
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm not.

534
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
I'm not.

535
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Am I wrong?

536
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Why do you want those things?

537
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
You're a womanizer.

538
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
You have food and drinks at home.

539
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,080
You're doing housework and raising Xuanxuan.

540
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,080
Isn't that good?

541
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Mom.

542
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Whether it's Chen's Manor or Beijing City,

543
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
you should ask around.

544
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Which woman is like you?

545
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
She's always running around.

546
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Mom.

547
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,080
Only I can make money in Chen's Manor.

548
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Only I can do this business.

549
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
Why don't you let me go?

550
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
You have to make money.

551
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,080
If you didn't have to get that military supply,

552
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,080
why can't her father and Da Shun come back?

553
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,080
If I...

554
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,080
If I knew that there would be that Wenbin,

555
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
I would rather go there myself.

556
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
I can't let Da Shun go.

557
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Regret is useless.

558
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,080
I advise you not to force yourself.

559
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
This family

560
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,080
must be Da Shun's.

561
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,080
This is the rule of Chen's family.

562
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
You have to obey.

563
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
I have to obey.

564
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Why didn't you let Da Shun

565
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,080
get involved in the business?

566
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Why did you drive him back to the hometown?

567
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
You should know better than anyone

568
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
about being a mother.

569
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Do you really think

570
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
Chen Ershun can afford this family?

571
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,080
That's the past.

572
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
In the past, his father was there.

573
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
Da Shun was there.

574
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
They were waiting in front of the door.

575
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Ershun was young.

576
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
So he was playful.

577
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Now they're all gone.

578
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Ershun won't be like that.

579
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
He said it himself.

580
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
He wants to make this family.

581
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
He also told me

582
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
that he would set you free forever.

583
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
He's no different from

584
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
the big brother.

585
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
No difference?

586
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
The big brother in the house,

587
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I advise you again.

588
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Don't fight with Ershun.

589
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
You gave me my share.

590
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
There's still time in the Chen family.

591
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
I beg you.

592
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
If you dare to

593
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
let Chen Ershun

594
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
get involved in the Chen family,

595
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
it'll be over.

596
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
I...

597
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
I can't persuade you.

598
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
I won't persuade you.

599
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Stay here.

600
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Mother.

601
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Look at this yard.

602
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
I'll leave the painting here.

603
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
But how long

604
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,080
will it be here?

605
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Chief Chen.

606
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
I see.

607
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
You're smellsy.

608
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,080
You can go down stairs.

609
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,740
Rubbing my feet,

610
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,240
I can XJ finally.

611
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
So you went down

612
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
the stairs,

613
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,480
when I discrete from

614
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,080
what I'm doing

615
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,280
now.

616
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Yah Yah!

617
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,180
In between star light going,

618
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,360
Why did you increase on below zero sous Zhen

619
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,380
And take it to opposite everywhere

620
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,780
Since I put it here to give circumstances

621
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,040
How can it beunes a mouthful of hot lag for no reason

622
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,280
It's no wrong, passing out

623
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,360
For you

624
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,540
After you

625
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,740
You...

626
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
Stop playing!

627
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,540
What are you doing?

628
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,540
Enough, stop crying.

629
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,940
Grandma!

630
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,740
Good girl, don't cry.

631
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,740
Grandma!

632
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,340
Enough, don't cry.

633
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,140
Don't cry.

634
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,340
Grandma!

635
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,140
There's a way.

636
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,340
Mom.

637
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,140
Xuan.

638
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,740
What's wrong with Xuan?

639
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,140
Nothing.

640
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,340
Xuanxuan said she misses her mom.

641
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,540
I brought her here to see her.

642
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,940
Go. Go to your mom.

643
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,340
Mom!

644
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,140
Xuan is crying.

645
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,540
I'm not afraid.

646
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,940
Why is your hair still dirty?

647
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,740
Don't touch me!

648
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
I'm not afraid.

649
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,540
Sister-in-law.

650
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,340
I found out that day.

651
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,340
You don't look good when you're angry.

652
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,340
You look pretty when you smile.

653
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,540
That's right.

654
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,340
You can talk to me like that.

655
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,140
I'm not afraid that your brother will come to you when you're in a bad mood.

656
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,740
Okay.

657
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,940
Let's get down to business.

658
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,940
You heard what the Third Master said that day.

659
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,140
Now, I, Cheng Ershun, am the head of this family.

660
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,740
You have to accept it.

661
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,540
If you don't, you have to accept it.

662
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,540
Will you accept it or not?

663
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,740
I won't accept it.

664
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
Will you accept it or not?

665
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,540
I will.

666
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,540
Believe it or not, I'll find someone to strangle you.

667
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,340
You dare!

668
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,540
See if I dare or not.

669
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,740
Don't make me do it.

670
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,940
You're forcing me?

671
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,380
That's true.

672
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,060
A woman who has a child

673
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,220
can't sell a few dollars.

674
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,900
Sell a child?

675
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,740
Zhang Shuai, you're not a human.

676
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,660
Now you're going to find a human.

677
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,700
I'll kill you!

678
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,340
Lu Shaohua!

679
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:49,980
Xiao Jing!

680
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,500
You should get to know your daughter better.

681
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,420
You should think about it.

682
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,060
You're a businessman.

683
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,700
You should know how to deal with this.

684
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,100
Let Xu Xuan go.

685
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,900
Mom!

686
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,860
Let Xu Xuan go.

687
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,180
Alright, Xu Xuan, stop crying.

688
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,180
I'll take you to the street

689
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,220
to buy some long-legged hams.

690
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,060
Zhang Shuai.

691
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,420
Zhang Shuai!

692
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,140
Mom!

693
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,060
Mom!

694
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,100
I promise you!

695
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,700
Mom!

696
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,260
I promise you!

697
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,100
Let Xu Xuan go!

698
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,020
Please give me Xu Xuan!

699
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,700
I'll promise you everything!

700
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,940
I'll give you everything!

701
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,500
Please!

702
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,860
I promise you everything!

703
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,660
Let Xu Xuan go!

704
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,580
Young Master asked us to come here early in the morning.

705
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,780
What's going on?

706
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,820
Who knows?

707
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,980
Whose side are we on?

708
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,460
Young Mistress' side, of course.

709
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,260
When will Young Mistress come?

710
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,940
It's going to be the first day after the wedding.

711
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,380
What about Young Master?

712
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,740
Ignore him.

713
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,180
How can I ignore him?

714
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,980
He's the owner.

715
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,580
Yeah.

716
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,300
He's going to give you a job?

717
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,220
You...

718
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,260
Young Master.

719
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Young Master.

720
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,900
Young Master.

721
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,420
Young Master.

722
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,340
Are you here?

723
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,940
Yes, Young Master.

724
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,140
The people from the old shop are here.

725
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,100
Someone wants to talk to you.

726
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,780
Come in.

727
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,140
Young Mistress.

728
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,940
Young Mistress.

729
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,340
Little Stone.

730
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,940
Give the account book

731
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,660
and the business card

732
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,620
to Chen Ershun.

733
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,620
Me mean it now.

734
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,380
You mean thatires made of black plates

735
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,940
are dirty.

736
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,460
Me mean all that Kitty Chen

737
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,340
II is doing to him?

738
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,260
He killed me on purpose!

739
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,860
Let's call text that one artist

740
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,900
One artist who is with train lyrics

741
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,960
Why do they call him Lucky?

742
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:23,140
How can Zhang Daxi

743
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,380
tell his uncle

744
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,820
I won't come again.

745
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,700
Thank you for

746
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,740
your support and contribution.

747
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,860
I'll take this opportunity

748
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,500
to continue my study.

749
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,540
Rest in peace.

750
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,100
No bad has happened to Shen clarinhippus.

751
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,780
Dear.

752
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,460
Mr. Hong

753
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,700
Is it true

754
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,580
your!]

755
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,900
Take it easy, please.

756
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,780
Do you remember

757
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,380
How can I change?

758
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,860
Dashun.

759
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,020
Let's open a branch in the next town

760
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,380
and open it in Shanghai.

761
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,700
Okay.

762
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,900
Then,

763
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,700
we'll open another branch in the next town.

764
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,700
Open it in...

765
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,500
in Guangzhou.

766
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,140
Okay.

767
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,940
You can open it wherever you want.

768
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,740
Then we'll open the branch

769
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,940
in...

770
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,860
in all over the country.

771
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,380
One by one.

772
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,380
The Long Ballad

773
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,740
What's wrong?

774
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,300
You want me to go back to my hometown?

775
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,980
You and your wife, Quanxuan,

776
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,100
and the one who is not in the mood,

777
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,380
go back together.

778
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,620
What if...

779
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,780
Sanshou Gang comes to us?

780
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,860
What should we do?

781
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,860
I've lived in my hometown for so long.

782
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,660
I haven't even seen a hair of Sanshou Gang.

783
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,660
It's been two years.

784
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,620
No one mentioned it.

785
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,740
I...

786
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,620
I just got used to living here.

787
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,660
Mom.

788
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,340
You'll get used to it when you go back to your hometown.

789
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,020
Mom.

790
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,700
That's your hometown for decades.

791
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,980
It's not like I live according to the Yun virus,

792
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,140
borne by other people.

793
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,140
Dad,

794
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,300
let's go.

795
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,100
Do as you like.

796
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,140
Only you be my life.

797
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,620
Mom.

798
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,940
This is what I'm thinking.

799
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,380
Since Dad and Qing's left so suddenly,

800
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,780
it's inevitable that

801
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,740
you'll start to be selfish

802
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,940
Mother.

803
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,820
We...our family suddenly lost two people.

804
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,340
I feel that living in such a big house is a waste.

805
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,620
The old house is empty and no one lives in it.

806
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,420
Don't you feel a bit regretful?

807
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,340
If you two go back, I will return this house.

808
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,500
I will move to the back yard of the pharmacy.

809
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,660
I calculated it. In one year, it can save more than 100 big sheep.

810
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,500
Save how many?

811
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,180
More than 100 big sheep?

812
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,100
Not only that.

813
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,900
In Beijing, the expenses of a month can be one year cheaper than the old house.

814
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,500
You four people, you calculate how much you can save.

815
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,300
These four people...can save a lot of money.

816
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,700
Yes.

817
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,820
Mother, the most important thing is that

818
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,500
Sister-in-law is already a widow at this age.

819
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,140
Even if she wants to save,

820
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,700
but in Beijing, there are always bad people. She might not be able to save them.

821
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,900
What happened to Old Zhen? How can I explain to Big Brother?

822
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,700
This is a disgrace to our Chen family.

823
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,180
Then Young Mistress, where should we put the firewood?

824
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,580
Put it inside.

825
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,380
Okay.

826
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,780
Come.

827
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,100
Put it inside.

828
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,980
Put it inside.

829
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,380
Okay.

830
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Just put it in here.

831
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,300
Then go back.

832
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,700
Okay.

833
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
I'll decide.

834
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,900
Mother, why didn't you let me stay in Beijing?

835
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,380
What's the use of you staying here?

836
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,580
I'm already old. You should serve me.

837
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,980
Oh.

838
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,380
Mother, where are we going?

839
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,980
We're almost home.

840
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,380
My sister!

841
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,780
Brother-in-law!

842
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,380
Mother, why are you here?

843
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,580
Brother-in-law!

844
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
Young Master!

845
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,380
Young Master!

846
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,780
My Young Master!

847
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,780
Young Master!

848
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,380
Young Master!

849
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,380
Young Master!

850
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,380
Young Master!

851
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,660
Young Master!

852
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,580
My Brother-in-law!

853
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,580
Mother!

854
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,580
Auntie!

855
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,260
No matter what the Duke said, he's already gone.

856
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,260
Such a good person.

857
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,460
This is too early.

858
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,060
Auntie.

859
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,860
Mother, Big Brother, Sister-in-law,

860
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,660
come sit in my room.

861
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,380
I'll go first. I'll come visit you later.

862
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,340
I'll come to see you soon.

863
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,940
Okay.

864
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,340
Okay.

865
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,100
Come in.

866
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,700
Come in.

867
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,380
It's heavy.

868
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,660
Don't cry.

869
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,860
This is the daughter of you and Dashun?

870
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,660
Mom, her name is Xuanxuan.

871
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,020
Xuan, Xuan, call grandma.

872
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,620
Call grandma.

873
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,700
Grandma.

874
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,660
Xuan, this is uncle.

875
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,780
This is aunt.

876
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,540
Uncle, aunt.

877
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,460
Why is your mother's life so hard?

878
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,500
How will you live in the future?

879
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,620
Mom, brother,

880
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,300
don't worry.

881
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,180
Although Dashun is gone,

882
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,780
I'll live well

883
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,700
with Xuanxuan in the future.

884
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,620
Shaohua,

885
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,340
you should

886
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,300
behave yourself in the future.

887
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,700
Don't say too much.

888
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,460
I hope your mother-in-law

889
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,700
can treat your daughter well

890
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,700
in the face of Dashun's death.

891
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,500
Mom, I know my business.

892
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,020
Mom.

893
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,980
Mom,

894
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,300
you're so smart and capable.

895
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,700
No one will lose her.

896
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,700
Don't worry.

897
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,300
Shaohua,

898
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,180
why did you let Ershun

899
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,620
take over the family property?

900
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,700
I won't make such a mistake again.

901
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,900
What do you mean?

902
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,420
I won't let myself

903
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,380
lose judgment and respond to pain.

904
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,660
Shaohua,

905
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,300
what are you going to do in the future?

906
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,060
You're so stubborn.

907
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,900
I wish I could let her

908
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,500
have 2 more years of housework.

909
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,260
Then I'll give all of us the background

910
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,980
so that I can find

911
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,260
something

912
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,580
to do for her and Xuanxuan.

913
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,100
Sister, I still Alors

914
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,180
forget my decision.

915
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:58,820
As the daughter of the family,

916
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,340
my son can't afford being unruly.

917
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,300
He said winter is short

918
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,000
The eternal

919
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm looking at him again

920
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Every day

921
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm lonely every night

922
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Every day

923
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm not alone

924
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm not alone

925
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm not alone

926
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm not alone

927
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,700
The wind blows far away, illuminating despair

928
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,700
I'm fighting for you

929
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,700
Bitter and bitter

930
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,700
The eternal in the heart

931
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,900
I wrote each and every做一点事

932
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,900
The end

933
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,160
Next midterm

934
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,300
In flight

935
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,300
Day by day

936
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,300
The night stays

937
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:08,300
Every day

938
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,220
Shall I attend to what others think?

939
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,780
She has done a good job.

940
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,560
Why are you here?

941
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,720
What do you want?

942
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,100
It's time to say goodbye to you.

943
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,720
Bye bye, Mu Zhe.

944
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,940
arosrich

945
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,660
Rose겠지만

946
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,220
Rosehehe Yes

947
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,840
N bu
