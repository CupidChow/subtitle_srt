00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 21

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be honest

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk this life in a gentle way

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the sky above the sea

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the sea, the fire is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can't be fooled, you can't be held, it's the sharpness in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world doesn't want to, then just break it

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, finally turn around

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am my greatest night

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If the world doesn't want to break through it

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
All for me

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Sorry, Manager Yi

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I won't sell this year's Ziwan

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What do you mean

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You really brought me a stand

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Chang Gua-Feng, don't be so rude

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How do you talk

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Manager Yi, if there is nothing else

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Please

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What do you mean

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are pushing me away

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I said, Chen Gua-Feng

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't think you have this ten thousand jin of Ziwan

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You can be bought

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I tell you, as long as I say one word

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All the medicine shops in Qizhou city

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I dare not buy you a jin of Ziwan, do you believe it

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I believe

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I also learned the prestige of Manager Yi

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is not a robbery

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I bought you sincerely

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's okay to tear your feet

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hurry up and sell this thing to me

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But I didn't plan this year

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sell Ziwan on this Qizhou drug market

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
what

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why should I put this pharmacy

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In such a remote place

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Pharmacy in such a remote place

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This famous person knows at a glance

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You are a young widow

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Beautiful

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In that market

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The strict trade will ruin your reputation

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Who is so remote?

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's me

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Only I buy your Ziwan

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Otherwise, who will you sell it to?

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Manager Yi

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will tell you the truth

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I plan to sell these Ziwan to Shanghai

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know if Shanghai's medicine shops

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is it also under the command of Manager Yi?

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Sell to Shanghai

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You are still in Nanjing

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I tell you one word

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you want to sell, I will buy

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you don't buy, I will leave immediately

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I count one two three

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
one

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
two

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
two

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
three

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Liang

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's go

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Liang

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't pull me

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's useless for you to pull me

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Just go

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's useless for you to pull me

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just go

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I think he is trying to fool me

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He is a little widow

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He doesn't go out and sell

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He can climb on the medicine shop in Shanghai

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The ghost will believe you

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Boss Xia is so capable

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Didn't say that Shanghai opened the situation

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Just like his widow

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hurry up and notify us

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All the medicine shops in the alliance

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This year is empty-handed

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No one can buy him a penny of Ziwan

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Manager

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What is that

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Empty-handed

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How do they explain

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How to explain

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Do business

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
See who can stand it

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Come

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Young Mistress

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Actually, a penny is worth it

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I can get it all out

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So what

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I think

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think I can buy

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Not yet

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you really going to sell it to Shanghai?

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
maybe

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Not even a cent

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How can that be

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hunan, Hubei, Shanxi, Shaanxi

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And the clients of Yun Guikuan

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I signed two months ago

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I got the deposit

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If you can't deliver it on time

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then we have to pay

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's a small thing to lose money

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,960
If someone knows

121
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,740
that you broke the

122
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,700
Use..

123
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,560
All the money in the Kon벽

124
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
But why?

125
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,720
Because I don't like that

126
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,980
so I don't bother you

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,300
Miss

128
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,340
If

129
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,980
Are there hundreds of thousands of the Yangs

130
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,060
involved in the situation as of yet?

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,340
The Chu family

132
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,420
are shaking behind us.

133
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,180
He would do so with such powers?

134
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,900
That's true

135
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,100
but someone still occlu lavoko behind us.

136
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,300
How bold the man behind us was!

137
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,460
How dare he parameters the city under our illegal barrels?

138
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
Shopkeeper.

139
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,500
Tell me.

140
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,100
Who is it?

141
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,780
I don't know who it is.

142
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,620
I just heard it.

143
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,100
It seems to be from Shanghai.

144
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,700
Shanghai?

145
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,180
Is it the Tian family of Shanghai?

146
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,540
What did I do?

147
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,340
I wasn't even th Fan Xicheng's son.

148
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,180
He was不到 спортluent.

149
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,780
He was not worth it.

150
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,960
Just like my 있는 lying

151
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,500
I lovedfilms.

152
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,300
Talking about my anno��라고요

153
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,100
I mean my 2022 of若

154
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
What are we doomed to do?

155
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,500
Don't worry.

156
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,140
Someone will come b o addressing for sale.

157
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,060
Who?

158
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,620
I'm sure intention what he said

159
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,020
to make business做

160
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,180
But the thing is

161
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,180
the drug testing

162
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,020
the next three days

163
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,980
will be over!

164
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:38,580
If we can come up

165
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,880
with Yao Nong's account dependant

166
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,100
person

167
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:40,740
What's…

168
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,220
Have we made a bet?

169
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,080
Within today

170
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:45,880

171
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,480

177
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,100
I'll come again.

178
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,060
I hope so.

179
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,580
Sir, what can I do for you?

180
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,780
It's a small shop.

181
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,860
You want to do such a big deal?

182
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,420
Mr. Xia.

183
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,620
Miss Chu.

184
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,700
Please sit.

185
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,900
Mr. Xia, please have some tea.

186
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,700
Does Tong Dao

187
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,780
come to Qizhou recently?

188
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,860
Is his father

189
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,220
doing better?

190
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,780
Mr. Xia, just say it.

191
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,020
Miss Chu, you're so straightforward.

192
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,180
I'll be more straightforward.

193
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,260
I have

194
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,500
170,000 jin of Qizhou Ziwan.

195
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,340
Mr. Xia, please have a price.

196
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,740
Okay.

197
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,900
I'll also have a price.

198
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,340
No matter what price

199
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,380
the Tian family gives you,

200
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,180
I'll give you a higher price.

201
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,380
There's only one condition.

202
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,740
I want all the goods.

203
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,500
Ziwan's market today

204
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,940
is five-legged.

205
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,820
Then I'll give you five-legged.

206
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,020
Deal.

207
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,140
But I have a condition.

208
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,340
Please say it.

209
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,140
I only want four-legged and five-cent per jin.

210
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,180
But I'll pay all the money today.

211
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,740
Okay.

212
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,660
Is that so?

213
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,300
I promise

214
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,420
that all the goods are of this kind.

215
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,380
Deal.

216
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,140
I'll let Manager Yi

217
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,260
contact you about the rest.

218
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,140
No problem.

219
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,900
But I have a question.

220
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,060
You were going to send this batch of goods

221
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,020
to Shanghai.

222
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,020
Why would you rent

223
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,260
such a small pharmacy?

224
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,060
Mr. Xia,

225
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,460
the reason I sent the goods

226
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,420
to Shanghai

227
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,100
is actually

228
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,780
a false claim.

229
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,740
I have nothing to do

230
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
with the Tian family.

231
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,020
Really?

232
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,900
That's why I'm willing

233
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,980
to give you all the goods

234
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,220
with four-legged and five-cent per jin.

235
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,460
I don't want you to think

236
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,260
that I'm a member of the Tian family.

237
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,980
What about the second reason?

238
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,220
After three days,

239
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,860
I'll hand over all the medicine farmers

240
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,740
the money.

241
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,740
Otherwise,

242
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,700
all the money in my hands

243
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,940
will be returned.

244
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,860
I can't return the deposit.

245
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,180
That means

246
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,620
if I don't come to you today,

247
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
you'll come to me in two days.

248
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,660
Yes.

249
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,300
But I know

250
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,620
you'll come to me first.

251
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,500
Why?

252
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,900
Because you must be very curious about me.

253
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,860
I'm really curious.

254
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,020
You're really curious.

255
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,500
What I'm more curious about now

256
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,180
is how much money you owe the medicine farmers.

257
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,100
90%.

258
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,820
90%?

259
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,340
Yes.

260
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,620
90%.

261
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,340
Your purchase price

262
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,500
won't be lower than three-legged

263
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,540
or higher than three-legged and five-cent.

264
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,180
That means

265
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,820
you earned 8,000 taels

266
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,860
with 6,000 taels.

267
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,180
I only have 35 taels in my account.

268
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,700
Apart from all the expenses,

269
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,900
I only have 6,000 taels in my profit.

270
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,220
Tell me about it.

271
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,220
With 35 taels as the deposit,

272
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,260
I can sign a contract

273
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,620
with 350 taels.

274
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,380
Then I can deposit the contract

275
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,660
into Xianzhuang.

276
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,860
At least, I can bring out

277
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,940
150 taels of cash

278
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
and return it.

279
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,020
Miss Chu,

280
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,500
I have a feeling

281
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,300
that we'll

282
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,300
cooperate more often in the future.

283
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,860
Thank you, Boss Xia.

284
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,980
But you've given me

285
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,060
all the money, Miss Chu.

286
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,740
Aren't you afraid that I'll regret

287
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,060
and re-sign with you?

288
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,300
Boss Xia,

289
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,740
if you can really regret it,

290
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,460
you're not Xia Yuan anymore.

291
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,260
It's a pleasure

292
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,780
to do business with you.

293
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,260
It's my honor

294
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,620
to do business with you.

295
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,620
Goodbye.

296
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,100
Okay.

297
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,940
Please.

298
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,580
Dajin,

299
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,220
I've made a deal

300
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,740
with Miss Chu about Ziwan.

301
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,100
You can contact her directly later.

302
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,580
Okay.

303
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,260
Don't worry.

304
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,180
Young Mistress?

305
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,900
Manager Gao,

306
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,100
long time no see.

307
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,700
You know each other?

308
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,540
Boss Wang,

309
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,140
Miss Chu

310
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,380
still has an identity.

311
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,860
She's the Young Mistress

312
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,020
of the Chen family.

313
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,660
Did you steal the order

314
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,140
from Lao Xu?

315
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,460
It was a coincidence.

316
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,860
I thought it was a coincidence, too.

317
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,140
I did.

318
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,260
But now that I see it,

319
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,820
I don't think so.

320
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,460
Lao Luo.

321
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,860
Help Young Master

322
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,860
get on the car.

323
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,940
Take a look.

324
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,820
This is the account of Yi Dajin

325
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,740
in the past two years.

326
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,340
Manager Gao.

327
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,660
What's wrong with you?

328
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,340
The business of Chichun Drugstore

329
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,740
is a little unsatisfactory.

330
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,380
I bought Chichun Drugstore

331
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,260
because I wanted to take the name of Chichun Drugstore

332
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,700
and get some experience in the medicine market.

333
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,780
Who would have thought that...

334
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
Yi Dajin

335
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,900
may not be suitable for the medicine business.

336
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,860
But the raw medicine is also

337
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,100
very popular.

338
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,140
That's right.

339
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,420
This year,

340
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,060
the Chichun Drugstore

341
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,020
was attacked

342
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,220
by 35 big-shot people.

343
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,500
Yes.

344
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,060
Fortunately, the boss was quick-witted.

345
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,020
Well...

346
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,220
You found out, too?

347
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,340
What?

348
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,260
Some accounts

349
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,620
look fine.

350
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,740
But when comparing them,

351
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,900
Boss,

352
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,100
there is something wrong.

353
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,060
I found out last year.

354
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,220
Last year?

355
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,900
Then we should have opened it last year.

356
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,900
It's not that simple.

357
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,820
You opened it last year.

358
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,420
What about the market?

359
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,380
Who will manage Chichun Drugstore?

360
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,380
If we don't find the right person to take over,

361
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,380
we will lose more money.

362
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,780
But we can't keep the goods

363
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,860
that are out of the city.

364
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,780
I know that.

365
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,580
It's a good place to understand the white- ذ

366
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,940
and inside- ذ as hard- nd.

367
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,460
It's not suitable

368
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,140
either.

369
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,260
That's why I know

370
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,500
that you will be having a hard time.

371
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,420
Look,

372
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,340
the boomers

373
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,340
that took over this business

374
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,100
are still working hard nowadays.

375
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,460
Some cóalb

376
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,340
are running behind them

377
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,300
in the morning.

378
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,940
I want to know

379
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,700
who are they.

380
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,140
Lawao,

381
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,420
Sun,

382
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,860
They said you were too weak.

383
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,420
You were too calm.

384
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,020
You were too weak.

385
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,540
You were too weak.

386
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,900
So you couldn't get pregnant.

387
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,020
You had to

388
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,700
have a half-year's treatment.

389
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,220
You were weak and weak.

390
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,300
If you had a full-blown operation,

391
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,980
you would have been fully recovered.

392
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,780
I could get pregnant if I had a full-blown operation?

393
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,420
I couldn't expect that from your sister-in-law.

394
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,900
I only expected you to have a full-blown operation.

395
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,980
I spent a lot of money on it.

396
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,500
If you can't get pregnant again,

397
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,740
don't blame me for not telling you.

398
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,620
I'll ask Ershun to think of another way.

399
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,620
Mom, I'll drink it.

400
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,660
I'll drink it.

401
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,420
Mom.

402
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,140
I'm back.

403
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,700
Sister-in-law.

404
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,340
Here.

405
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,420
You're back.

406
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,580
What...

407
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
What is this?

408
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,740
Open it.

409
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,380
So much money.

410
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,060
Mom,

411
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,420
you don't have to worry about

412
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,060
Chen Ershun's family.

413
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,420
I'll take care of this family.

414
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,180
You're a man of early age.

415
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,660
You...

416
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,940
You're going to make money?

417
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,700
Yes.

418
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,980
I misjudged you.

419
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,700
Yes.

420
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,980
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

421
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,540
Will you believe me if I tell you?

422
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,660
Mom,

423
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,420
do you believe me now?

424
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,220
Yes.

425
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,460
I believe you now.

426
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,540
Mom,

427
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,060
I'll continue to make money.

428
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,900
Your life will get better and better.

429
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,140
But

430
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,100
I may be busier and busier.

431
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,700
I may even stay up all night.

432
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,260
You're a man of early age.

433
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,940
Go back to work.

434
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,980
Leave the house and Xuanxuan to me.

435
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,140
Don't worry.

436
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,300
Where's Xuanxuan?

437
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,580
She just fell asleep.

438
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,740
That's good.

439
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,860
Sit down.

440
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,140
I'll pour you some water.

441
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:49,820
No, thanks.

442
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,660
I'll do it myself.

443
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,620
Hello, Mr Wei,

444
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
how much will I earn for this?

445
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,100
You have Sacrilegious leaves, right?

446
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,700
Sacrilegious leaves?

447
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,060
You are so capable.

448
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,860
You are really capable.

449
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,180
You're young after all,

450
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,340
people are ок.

451
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,380
It's easy to earn a lot of money.

452
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,680
Can't you just

453
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,780
gift me with the money

454
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
and I keep it for you?

455
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,380
The scores are so close.

456
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,460
So that's good.

457
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,340
You're keeping me?

458
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,020
Mom,

459
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,140
I've spent all the money I earned.

460
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,020
You've spent it all?

461
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,020
Who's the best?

462
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,700
The first woman to be your lover.

463
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,380
I only ask for one sentence in my dream.

464
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,100
I want to meet you.

465
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,900
Congratulations, mom.

466
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,060
Congratulations, mom.

467
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,420
Congratulations, mom.

468
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,020
Bye.

469
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Congratulations.

470
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,580
Mom,

471
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,860
go ahead.

472
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,260
Go ahead.

473
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,660
Bravo!

474
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,980
Bravo!

475
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,500
Sliding, sliding, and walking.

476
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,300
Sliding, sliding, and walking.

477
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,940
Yes.

478
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,300
Sister-in-law,

479
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,340
I haven't seen you so happy for a long time.

480
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,980
I'll be happy every day in the future.

481
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,820
Mom,

482
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,100
what does it mean to slide?

483
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,140
Come on.

484
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,380
Don't be so happy.

485
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,820
Yes, I'll be happy.

486
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,220
If I'm happy,

487
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,980
Mom,

488
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,620
if I'm happy,

489
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,380
he'll be happy for me.

490
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,180
Yes, I'm happy.

491
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
But this is called

492
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,900
sliding, sliding, and walking.

493
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,260
It's more appropriate, right?

494
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,140
Song Ting,

495
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,020
come on.

496
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,900
Take Xuan Xuan and mom to have a rest.

497
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,700
Come on.

498
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,660
Go with Xuan Xuan.

499
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,260
I'll take her.

500
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,100
Boss Lv,

501
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,660
please come in.

502
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,060
Mr. Li,

503
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,900
please come in.

504
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,860
Please come in.

505
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,660
Mr. Tong,

506
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,500
please take your time.

507
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,300
Take your time.

508
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,060
Please come in.

509
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,420
Boss Xia is here.

510
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,140
Madam,

511
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,460
Boss Xia is here.

512
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,220
Boss Xia?

513
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,500
It's really Boss Xia.

514
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,420
Boss Xia came in person.

515
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,460
Boss Xia is here.

516
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
The face of the Chinese medicine shop

517
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,260
is really big.

518
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,180
That's not true.

519
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,220
In the future, we have to

520
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,420
rely on Boss Xia for our business.

521
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,980
That's necessary.

522
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,940
Boss Xia,

523
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,740
Manager Gao.

524
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,980
Miss Chu,

525
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,180
congratulations.

526
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,500
Thank you, Boss Xia.

527
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,060
It's a big business.

528
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,740
This is a little gift from our boss.

529
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Please accept it.

530
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,860
It's already the honor of the shop

531
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,580
for you two to come here.

532
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,860
When we came here just now,

533
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,020
we saw that the brand that was hanging

534
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,940
was familiar.

535
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,940
What does the one that is standing mean?

536
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,980
Every fifth,

537
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,220
fifteenth and twenty-fifth of each month,

538
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,540
we will do more lottery.

539
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,300
The lottery is one yuan,

540
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,700
five points, five points and so on.

541
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,300
You can buy it at the bottom line.

542
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,780
So,

543
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,860
do you deliver these tea

544
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,820
every day or only today?

545
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,900
We deliver every day.

546
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,180
We have chrysanthemum tea in summer,

547
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,380
ginger tea in winter.

548
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,660
Please come in.

549
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,820
Please.

550
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,140
Please.

551
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,420
Come on, Madam.

552
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,020
Thank you.

553
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,620
Thank you.

554
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,460
Come on, everyone.

555
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,180
Everyone,

556
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,380
there is free tea.

557
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,460
Come on, everyone, let's drink together.

558
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,580
Come on, everyone, let's drink together.

559
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,220
Young Mistress,

560
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,140
you also sell toothpaste?

561
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,700
It's the same as selling

562
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,900
the chrysanthemum powder

563
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,460
in Chenji Pharmacy.

564
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,340
Then why don't you

565
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,820
sell the chrysanthemum powder directly?

566
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,300
Qizhou is not as good as Beijing.

567
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,380
Selling the chrysanthemum powder here

568
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,820
is priceless.

569
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Come on, you two,

570
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
sit here.

571
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,380
Sit down.

572
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Please.

573
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,940
This is a good place.

574
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,380
The rent is not cheap, right?

575
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,180
In addition to the purchase,

576
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,980
the biggest expense

577
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,420
is the rent.

578
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,580
Then why

579
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,180
do you choose this place?

580
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,980
The most important thing

581
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,980
in doing business is the flow of customers.

582
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,140
I spent seven days

583
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,220
on several streets in Qizhou.

584
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,380
I found that

585
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,380
the most important thing

586
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,580
is the flow of customers.

587
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
I found that

588
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,380
the most important thing

589
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,580
is the flow of customers.

590
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,580
I found that

591
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,780
the flow of customers

592
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,780
is the biggest on this street.

593
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
And the most popular street

594
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
is this section.

595
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,980
I took this opportunity

596
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,380
to take this opportunity.

597
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,580
Can you balance the bill?

598
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,380
The rent

599
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,180
is 30% higher than the other places.

600
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
But the flow of customers

601
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,180
is twice as high as the other places.

602
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
The monthly profit

603
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,780
is at least 100 big foreign dollars.

604
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,180
So,

605
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,980
you can

606
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
take back the cost

607
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,580
in one and a half years.

608
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,380
My plan is one year.

609
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,380
You're great.

610
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,580
You're welcome.

611
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
It's a pity.

612
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,180
I earn 100 more big foreign dollars

613
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,780
in one month.

614
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
I earn a store

615
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,980
in one year.

616
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Miss Zhu,

617
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
is that enough?

618
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,580
The life of a family

619
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
is enough.

620
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,180
What about your ambition?

621
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,980
Mr. Xia, what do you mean?

622
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
I'll be honest.

623
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,380
I think

624
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,780
this shop is too small.

625
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,780
You can't even

626
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
make a full-length exhibition.

627
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,580
Join our first drug store.

628
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,380
Well,

629
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,580
you work with Yi Dajin for two years.

630
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,780
After two years,

631
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,780
I'll give you

632
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,980
the key to Qizhou

633
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,780
and Chichun Drugstore.

634
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,180
Thank you for your trust.

635
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,980
But I just started

636
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,180
the drug store.

637
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:11,980
Well...

638
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,580
It doesn't matter.

639
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,980
I'll take back

640
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,380
the cost three times.

641
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,380
It's my first drug store.

642
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,580
I want to see

643
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
if I can

644
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,980
make it.

645
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,580
No need to see.

646
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,380
With your ability,

647
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,980
you can make

648
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,980
this store

649
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,580
one of the most profitable drug stores in Qizhou.

650
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
So what?

651
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,580
You're a rich man.

652
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,980
You have a good family.

653
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,980
You'll be the boss

654
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,980
of a small drug store

655
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,580
for the rest of your life.

656
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,780
Miss Chu,

657
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,980
are you happy?

658
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,380
But...

659
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,580
The key to Qizhou

660
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,180
is more than a million yuan per year.

661
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,180
The size of Chichun Drugstore

662
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,580
must be

663
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,380
three times that of Huashun Drugstore.

664
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,980
And I want to

665
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,980
open a branch in Tianjin, Beijing.

666
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,180
I think

667
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,980
this is the perfect match for Miss Chu's ambition.

668
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,580
Don't hesitate.

669
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,180
Join the Chichun Drugstore.

670
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,180
Besides,

671
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,180
Chichun Drugstore is the family of Chu.

672
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,980
It's the best

673
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
for you to manage it.

674
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,380
What's your identity?

675
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,780
You're the one

676
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,980
who's the leader of the big company.

677
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,780
You're the one who knows

678
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,380
how to divide the money.

679
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,980
Thank you again, Boss Xia.

680
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
I

681
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,380
want to stay in Huashun Drugstore.

682
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,580
That's all.

683
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,580
I just want to see

684
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,780
how much Chu Shaohua

685
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,980
can go

686
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,780
and where I can go.

687
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,980
Let me say one more thing.

688
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,580
In business,

689
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,580
the most important thing

690
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,380
is to know how to use your strength

691
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,180
and explain.

692
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,580
I think

693
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,980
in business,

694
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,780
you must see yourself clearly.

695
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,780
That's right.

696
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,380
Okay, Miss Chu.

697
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,380
I appreciate

698
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,980
your explanation.

699
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,980
Thank you for your understanding.

700
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,180
If you need anything,

701
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
just call me.

702
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,980
With your words,

703
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
I feel more at ease.

704
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,380
Okay.

705
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,580
I'll leave now.

706
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,780
I've made up my mind

707
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,580
to do this in half a year.

708
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,380
As long as you change your mind,

709
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,780
I, Shouyuan Drugstore,

710
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,580
will wait for you.

711
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,580
I understand.

712
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,580
I'll leave now.

713
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,380
Take care.

714
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,380
Please wait.

715
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,780
Young Mistress,

716
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,980
do you know how many people in Qizhou

717
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,780
want to join Shouyuan Drugstore

718
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,380
and become Boss Xia's subordinate?

719
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
Why are you still...

720
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,380
Why are you still

721
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
being Xia Yuan's subordinate?

722
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
Just be Xia Yuan's subordinate.

723
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
You mean

724
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,980
the Young Master

725
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,580
went to visit the Young Master himself?

726
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,580
Yes.

727
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,980
That's not right.

728
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,180
According to the Young Master's age,

729
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,980
he shouldn't be interested in the Young Master.

730
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,980
What did they talk about?

731
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,580
I don't know.

732
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,180
But when Boss Xia came out,

733
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
he said

734
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580
he would welcome us anytime.

735
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,180
It seemed like Boss Xia was trying to persuade that widow

736
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,980
to join Shouyuan Drugstore.

737
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,980
What?

738
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,980
I just heard about it.

739
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,180
It's not impossible.

740
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,180
Think about it.

741
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,980
Zhichun Drugstore is in this state now.

742
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,180
And

743
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,180
about the last night,

744
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,580
the boss didn't say anything

745
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,580
or say anything,

746
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,180
but he must be

747
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,180
dissatisfied with me.

748
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,580
Besides,

749
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,580
if he's really interested in this widow,

750
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,980
and the widow is still thinking about doing something here,

751
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,980
this place

752
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,380
was originally hers.

753
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,780
She's also from Qizhou.

754
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
It's too fast to get started.

755
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,980
You mean

756
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,380
the boss wants to give the Chichun Drugstore

757
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,180
to this widow?

758
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,180
Maybe that's true.

759
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,580
That's absolutely not possible.

760
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,580
So

761
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,180
we must think of some cruel tricks

762
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,780
to make that widow

763
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,780
stay in Qizhou.

764
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Understood.

765
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,180
The End

766
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,380
Next,

767
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
we're going to draw the prize today.

768
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
The 1-yuan gold ring.

769
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,180
Great!

770
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,380
Are the two effects the same?

771
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,580
They're all the same.

772
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,780
But they taste different.

773
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,780
Young Mistress,

774
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,180
we should stock up on incense.

775
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,980
We don't have any more green-leaf azoth.

776
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,780
We also need to drop some of the medicine stock.

777
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,580
Okay, got it.

778
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,380
Young Mistress,

779
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,180
the food is here.

780
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
They also added three more.

781
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Okay, put it here.

782
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,580
Boss Zhang, the food is ready.

783
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,380
Zhuzi,

784
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,180
come here.

785
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Go and deliver it.

786
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,580
What about the backyard?

787
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,380
Lin's prize is being given.

788
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,180
Let him go.

789
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,780
Okay.

790
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,580
Boss,

791
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,380
do you have some ancient rice cake?

792
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,180
Wait a minute.

793
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,980
Jiang,

794
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,380
come out and welcome the guests.

795
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,580
What about the backyard?

796
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,580
I'll do it.

797
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,180
Young Mistress,

798
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,780
we should really invite someone.

799
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,780
I'm too busy to come.

800
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
You're right.

801
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
I'll go first.

802
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Cheng Hua.

803
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,580
Sister,

804
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,180
I'm here to visit you.

805
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,580
Mother,

806
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,580
your brother and I

807
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,980
are worried about you.

808
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
A few days ago,

809
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,180
we had a lot of things to do

810
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
and couldn't make it.

811
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
Today, when we were free,

812
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
I told Mother

813
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,180
to visit Hua.

814
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,180
Yes.

815
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Mother, have some tea.

816
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,580
What's the matter?

817
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,380
I heard that...

818
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,180
You said that

819
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,780
you had to come here

820
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
because of something.

821
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,780
I heard that your business

822
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,980
is doing well.

823
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,780
It's not bad.

824
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
Sister,

825
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,180
you're modest.

826
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,780
Now in Qizhou,

827
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,580
everyone knows

828
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,980
that Hua's medicine store

829
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,580
is doing very well.

830
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
It's going to be

831
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,580
better than

832
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,180
Chichun Drugstore.

833
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,980
Shaohua,

834
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,580
you're alone with your child.

835
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,580
It's hard for you

836
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,580
to work in such a big drugstore.

837
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,780
Take care.

838
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,980
Xiaowang, where's Sister-in-law?

839
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,780
She's with her mother.

840
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
She's in the backyard.

841
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,980
Sister,

842
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,380
you're so slim.

843
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,180
Really.

844
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,980
Look at your hands.

845
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,380
They're so thin.

846
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
It's hard,

847
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:51,980
but I'm happy.

848
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,980
No, you can't.

849
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,180
We can't see it

850
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,780
and feel sad.

851
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
Especially you.

852
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,580
Shaohua,

853
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,180
I'm thinking

854
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,180
about your brother.

855
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,180
He's also

856
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,580
free at home.

857
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,380
How about

858
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,580
asking him to come here

859
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
to help you?

860
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,980
Right.

861
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,180
I have a good idea.

862
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,380
First,

863
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,580
you have a warm

864
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,980
and warm family.

865
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,780
Second,

866
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,580
the drugstore

867
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,380
is your brother's old business.

868
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,380
When he comes,

869
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,380
your business

870
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
will only get better

871
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
and not worse.

872
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
What can he do

873
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,780
when he comes?

874
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,580
Well,

875
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,180
he can do a lot.

876
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:33,780
Listen,

877
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
you can give him

878
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,180
all the work.

879
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,980
He can do everything.

880
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,780
Shaohua,

881
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,580
your brother is here.

882
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,780
You don't have to do anything.

883
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,980
Go home.

884
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,380
Take Xuanxuan to the house of marriage.

885
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,180
It's great.

886
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,780
You mean

887
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
to give the drugstore

888
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,380
to my brother?

889
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,180
Yes.

890
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Let your brother do everything.

891
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,580
You can think about the house of marriage

892
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,180
and be the shopkeeper.

893
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,580
My brother also thinks so.

894
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,580
Well,

895
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,780
he didn't say it directly.

896
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,980
But as a couple,

897
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,780
I know what he thinks.

898
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,580
I think

899
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,380
you should give up.

900
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,580
Well,

901
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,980
what should we do?

902
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,980
This Huaishen Drugstore,

903
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,180
have you ever

904
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,980
given a penny?

905
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,180
Okay.

906
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,780
Even if you don't have money,

907
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,780
you can always make a profit.

908
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,180
Have you ever given a penny?

909
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,380
You can give up

910
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,580
or not.

911
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,780
You don't even have a word.

912
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,380
Now I open this Huaishen Drugstore,

913
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,780
and the business is going well.

914
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,180
You come to make my idea.

915
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
Do you think I'm stupid?

916
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,980
Sister,

917
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,180
what you said

918
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
is what you didn't know before.

919
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,780
You just knew it.

920
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
You just want your brother

921
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,180
to help you.

922
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,380
I don't need your help.

923
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,780
I know my business.

924
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,180
If you have nothing to do,

925
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,380
you can go back.

926
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,380
No, sister.

927
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,980
I...

928
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,980
I haven't finished.

929
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,180
If you want to

930
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,780
manage this Huaishen Drugstore,

931
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,980
you can discuss it.

932
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,380
My business?

933
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,180
Why should I discuss it with you?

934
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,980
Shaohua.

935
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,780
Let me tell you.

936
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,980
Three gangs of good men,

937
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,780
right?

938
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,380
No matter how good you are,

939
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,980
can you finish all your work?

940
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,780
No.

941
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,180
You still have to hire someone.

942
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,980
Right?

943
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,180
Instead of letting outsiders make that money,

944
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,580
you can let your brother do it.

945
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Besides,

946
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,980
can outsiders always give you a heart?

947
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,180
People's hearts are different.

948
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,580
Shaozhong is different.

949
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,980
He is your brother.

950
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,180
He is related to blood.

951
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,780
Shaohua.

952
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
I...

953
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,580
I'll tell you this.

954
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,780
Since our Chichun Drugstore was sold,

955
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
your brother

956
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,980
hasn't found a suitable job yet.

957
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,780
He is always eating and sleeping at home.

958
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,180
If this continues,

959
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,980
he will be useless.

960
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,980
Just help him.

961
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,780
Okay?

962
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580
Shaohua.

963
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,380
Actually,

964
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,180
I said I would help you.

965
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,980
But...

966
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,580
But I'm sorry.

967
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,780
We came here today

968
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,180
to ask you

969
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,180
to help your brother.

970
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Is it okay?

971
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,580
Let me think about it.

972
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,780
Drink tea.

973
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,180
I don't drink.

974
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,980
I'm not drinking water now.

975
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
Sister.

976
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,780
I heard that the boss

977
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,980
opened a drugstore in the town.

978
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,580
The business is good.

979
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,780
Yes.

980
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,580
He must have made a lot of money.

981
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,780
I don't know.

982
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,180
How can you not know?

983
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,380
The boss's temperament...

984
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,780
I can't control him.

985
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,180
No matter how strong his temperament is,

986
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
you are his mother.

987
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,980
You are Xuanxuan's grandmother.

988
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,780
You are the owner of this family.

989
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,180
Yes.

990
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,980
I know I'm the owner of this family.

991
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,580
But the business is not good.

992
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,180
I don't know about the business.

993
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,780
You can manage the money.

994
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,180
Mom, you are here.

995
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
Have you eaten?

996
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,980
Yes.

997
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,980
I just had dinner with your mom.

998
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,780
Be...

999
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,180
Be steady.

1000
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,580
How is the business going today?

1001
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,780
There are many people.

1002
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
Today, his mother-in-law,

1003
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,180
his mother-in-law and his sister-in-law are here.

1004
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,380
Didn't he say that he had a relationship

1005
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,580
with his mother?

1006
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,780
No.

1007
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,580
I saw them holding hands and talking.

1008
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,180
Who is it?

1009
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,780
Is he in a good mood again?

1010
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,180
I don't know.

1011
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,580
Mom, I'll go back to work.

1012
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
Go.

1013
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,780
Sister, I think

1014
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,980
you should keep the money safe.

1015
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Don't let others

1016
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,980
move back to your house.

1017
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,180
He is in charge of the business in the pharmacy.

1018
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,580
If he moves all the money to his mother's house,

1019
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,380
I have no choice.

1020
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,580
I'm telling you,

1021
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,980
if you really want to manage the money,

1022
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,980
there must be a way.

1023
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,780
Mom.

1024
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,580
Come down.

1025
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
Come.

1026
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,980
You're back.

1027
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,780
Second daughter,

1028
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,780
heat the steamed buns and soup.

1029
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,180
Bring it to your sister-in-law.

1030
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,780
Right away.

1031
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,580
Let your mother rest for a while.

1032
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,180
It's okay.

1033
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,980
Look.

1034
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,180
Don't burn your hands.

1035
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,980
Don't burn your hands.

1036
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,580
Wipe it.

1037
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,180
Wipe it.

1038
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,780
Thank you, mom.

1039
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,380
You're so old-fashioned.

1040
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,580
Look at your clothes.

1041
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,180
You should

1042
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,180
wear it when you were a kid.

1043
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,380
You look old.

1044
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,980
I told Caifeng

1045
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,780
to make you a new one tomorrow.

1046
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,580
No, mom.

1047
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,380
I can wear this.

1048
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,180
You're working outside now.

1049
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,780
You should wear it.

1050
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,580
We Chen family have a good reputation.

1051
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,180
We can make you a new one.

1052
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,180
Is it the new year?

1053
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,980
You know it.

1054
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,780
Xuanxuan, didn't you say

1055
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,380
you wanted to talk to me?

1056
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,180
Mom, don't work too hard.

1057
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,580
Come home early every day

1058
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,980
and stay with me.

1059
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,180
But I have to wait until the pharmacy is closed

1060
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,380
before I can go home.

1061
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,580
Then you can invite more people.

1062
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,780
I think Uncle Song is a good idea.

1063
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,180
Mom,

1064
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,780
you taught him, right?

1065
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Second Aunt Song is here this year.

1066
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,380
She wants you to

1067
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,580
find a job for Uncle Song

1068
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,380
in the pharmacy.

1069
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,580
Mom.

1070
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,180
Mom.

1071
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,580
Mom.

1072
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,780
Er... Ershun?

1073
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,180
Mom.

1074
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,180
I'm back.

1075
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,580
Sorry, we're closed.

1076
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,980
Boss.

1077
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,580
Boss.

1078
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,580
We're back.

1079
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
We're back.

1080
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
We've been here for six years.

1081
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,580
We're back.

1082
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
Two pharmacies

1083
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,780
are gone.

1084
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,980
They're all gone.

1085
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,780
What have you done?

1086
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,380
What have you done?

1087
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,380
Mom,

1088
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,980
I didn't want to be like this.

1089
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,380
I met a liar.

1090
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,180
Liar. Didn't you say you were fine?

1091
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,180
Didn't you say your father had a property

1092
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,780
and your brother had a property?

1093
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,580
Can you stand it?

1094
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,380
How did you meet a liar?

1095
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,980
How did you meet...

1096
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,780
You're so mad at me. You...

1097
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,380
Grandma, don't be mad.

1098
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,980
I was fine.

1099
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,980
It's all because of those liars.

1100
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,180
I'm so sorry.

1101
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,380
Liar.

1102
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,780
How did you meet a liar?

1103
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,980
Mom, did Uncle Song do something wrong?

1104
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,380
Xuan'er, remember.

1105
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,180
Don't ever think about it when you grow up.

1106
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,980
I remember.

1107
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,380
Xuan'er, come here.

1108
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,580
Mom, let me tell you

1109
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,180
something that's really embarrassing.

1110
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,780
Come on.

1111
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,380
Let me tell you.

1112
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,380
Mom, hit me.

1113
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,380
Hit me.

1114
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,380
Hit me to death.

1115
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:52,980
I'll hit you.

1116
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,980
Mom, hit me.

1117
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,780
Hit me.

1118
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,380
Hit me.

1119
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:55,980
Hit me.

1120
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,180
Hit me to death.

1121
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,980
Hit me, mom.

1122
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,380
How are we going to live in the future?

1123
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,180
Sixty-three.

1124
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,980
Sixty-nine.

1125
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,980
Fifty-four.

1126
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,780
It seems that your business plan

1127
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,780
has expanded a lot.

1128
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,180
If you were here, it would have grown faster.

1129
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,980
You have a strong army.

1130
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,180
You're no match for me.

1131
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,380
Why are you saying this?

1132
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,580
Seriously, what are you planning to do this time?

1133
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,380
Come with me to Shanghai.

1134
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,580
It's just right. You've been there for so many years.

1135
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,380
You must have a wide network.

1136
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,980
You're still a student.

1137
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,980
You're a real brother.

1138
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,980
You can definitely help me.

1139
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,980
I'm going to France soon.

1140
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,380
I came to Beijing this time

1141
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,580
to handle the study abroad.

1142
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,580
And I want to see my mom and brother before I leave.

1143
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,380
I want to say goodbye to you.

1144
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,580
France?

1145
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,580
Why are you going there?

1146
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:15,380
A little melting white dew

1147
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,580
Love is in the snow road

1148
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,980
Is the eye in your heart

1149
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:28,580
Small wind and waves

1150
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:35,180
The little motor in his heart

1151
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:41,580
A little warming his heart

1152
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,980
He is complaining about the day is not far

1153
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,180
He said winter is short

1154
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:55,180
Eternal

1155
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:11,180
Unfortunately you are not there

1156
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:22,380
The wind..

1157
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,380
I will leave you with regrets

1158
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,380
Little by little, I will be with you

1159
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,380
I will not be lonely anymore

1160
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,380
The wind blows through the smoke and the waves are desolate

1161
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,380
I will fight for you

1162
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,380
I will reach the end of the world

1163
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:19,380
In my heart, there is always a wish

1164
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:27,380
