Episode 13

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Who are you?

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm his sister-in-law.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I just called Chen Ershun out.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I've already sent someone to call him.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But it takes two hours to come and go.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's okay. We can wait.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anyway, he won't pay today, we will never leave.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay, no problem.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But I think it's tiring for the big brothers to wait here for two hours.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How about you guys come inside and we will prepare some tea for you.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can sit and wait.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Where to wait?

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Anyway, he's a monk, he can't run away.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Prepare tea for the guests.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Young Mistress, why did you lure them in?

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why?

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You don't let them in and let them stay at the door all the time?

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You want to affect our business?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, it's easy to invite the gods and easy to send them away.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't worry, someone will be responsible for sending them away.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I said we can come back at noon.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What time is it now?

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why is there no one here?

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are you kidding us?

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Stop talking nonsense.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If we don't pay, we will be in trouble.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Big brothers, let's talk it over.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Da Shun.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What are you doing?

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What are you doing?

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Da Shun.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What do you want?

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Dad, don't worry.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I will deal with this with Da Shun.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You are Chen Shaoshun's father?

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Pay back your debt.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Pay back your debt.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What debt?

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Chen Shaoshun owes us money.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What do you do?

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is Mr. Huang from Shuangfenglou.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is Mr. Du from Deyilou.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is Mr. Bai from Quyuanlou.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You said Shaoshun owes you money.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you have any evidence?

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Of course we have.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Look carefully.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is the loan he signed himself.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have not only a bill,

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
but also a witness.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How about I call Jinfeng, Fengxian,

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and Yukui here

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
to confront him face to face?

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Look.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
These are all Chen Shaoshun's signature.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The bill.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Old man, what do you think about this?

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I am satisfied.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How much do you owe?

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We owe 340 yuan.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We owe 500 yuan.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I owe 275 yuan.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's 1115 yuan in total.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How much do we owe?

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
1557 yuan.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Pay back your debt.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's the best.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You are so generous.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sir,

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
come to my Deyilou to have some fun.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mr. Chen, I will treat you to a drink later.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And welcome the girls from Shuangpulou.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Enough.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why is it so short?

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What's wrong?

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sir, I thought it would be 200 or 300 yuan.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I didn't expect...

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How much?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There are only 870 yuan in the money box.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Dad, it's nothing.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We...

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Shuanghua.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's impossible to hide it now.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Tell me the truth.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Say it.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I...

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Say it.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Say it.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Dad, here's the thing.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've been working on the music for the last two months.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So I asked Shun to pay the bills himself.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And...

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Shun.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sir.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You dare to come back?

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I was wrong.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You were wrong. You are a bastard.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Sir, stop it.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Stop it.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Stop it.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Baby, sleep.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Really.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I was wrong.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was wrong.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I was wrong.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was wrong.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I won't do it again.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Please forgive me.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was wrong.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You've grown up.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're in the school now.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Who knows the truth?

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Dad asked the second son to leave overnight.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Go back to your hometown.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Song Ping stays here to take care of his mother and Xuanxuan.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But dad said,

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
from tomorrow on,

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you should take care of Yu Rongfen.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I see.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Come in and have fun.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sir.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Come in and have a seat.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Cheng Anshun's sister-in-law?

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
She asked you to go there to pay the bills with her.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't have time.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let her come here.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But our young lady...

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What's wrong with the young lady?

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm still a lady.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She asked me to go to her.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Young lady.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Give me the account book.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll go to pay the bills with her.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But I know the bad accounts that Cheng Anshun left.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What should we do?

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Isn't it just a foreign gift?

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's go.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Cheng Anshun promised to give me some feedback.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Is this still counted?

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's good.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Zhou Yuanyuan.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You haven't been here for a long time.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Really?

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where's my Lu Ningxiang?

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She's waiting for you.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Really?

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll take you there.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're so thin.

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Ningxiang.

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Where's Mrs. Yan?

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mrs. Yan.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
She went to see a customer.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Please tell her

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that we've finished the accounts.

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Her order

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
has been organized and placed on the table.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay. I got it.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll leave you two alone.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll call you a bitch.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How dare you!

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're so mean!

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
How dare you talk to a customer like that?

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You're so mean!

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're so mean!

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How dare you!

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll beat you to death.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
How dare you talk to a customer like that?

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll beat you to death.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're so mean!

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're so arrogant!

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you think you're a government official?

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come here!

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Erniang.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Erniang.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Lu Ningxiang.

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Erniang.

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Erniang.

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My name is Lu Ningxiang.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You've got the wrong person.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're Erniang.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They know each other?

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's so hot here.

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm used to it.

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Have some water.

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why are you here?

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's my fate.

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Where's Xiao Wu?

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know.

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If I need money to pay you back,

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
what did you say?

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm taking you away from here.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why should I leave?

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This is a fire pit.

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't be so dramatic.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You think this is a fire pit?

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I think it's very good.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't have to work in the field.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I eat well every day.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I can dress up.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The wind doesn't blow me away.

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The rain doesn't rain on me.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The sun doesn't shine on me.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Look at my face.

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Really?

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
When I was at home,

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
my father beat me every day.

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But when I was at home,

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
you were at least a person.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're still a person here.

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Come in.

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Young Mistress.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Just look at it.

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't you want to know

230
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
why I'm here?

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Before Xiao Wu and I came to Beijing,

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
we made a bet at home.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
When we just arrived in Beijing,

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
we had a bet.

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But it was over soon.

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I asked him to go out to work.

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He was tired.

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He thought it was easy for Du Bo to come.

239
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Can Du Bo win?

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't say that.

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He really won at first.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But he didn't win.

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He was so nervous.

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't say that.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He really won at first.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But the further he went,

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
the worse he lost.

248
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He was caught in the last minute.

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The gang chased him.

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He sold me out.

251
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Where is he now?

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know.

253
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
At first, he told me

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
he was coming to count me.

255
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But then I never saw him again.

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He is my son.

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Erniu,

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
don't worry.

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I will take you with me.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Shuanghua,

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
with your words,

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
it's not a good idea for us to make a deal.

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But I'm not going out.

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why?

265
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I've been ruined.

266
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
My body is already dirty.

267
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm done with this life.

268
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,240
No.

269
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,840
Leave me alone.

270
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,840
Let me rot in this Linfang Building.

271
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,760
It's good.

272
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,240
No.

273
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
I never thought I'd see you again.

274
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,320
But seeing you today,

275
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm so happy.

276
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
I'm really happy for you.

277
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,320
But in the future,

278
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,480
let's not see each other again.

279
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,840
No.

280
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,640
It's not up to you.

281
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,440
No.

282
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,840
Promise me.

283
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm leaving.

284
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,880
Erning.

285
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,360
Erning.

286
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,120
Erning.

287
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,280
Even if you give up on yourself,

288
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,640
I won't give up on you.

289
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,880
I'll come to you.

290
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Young Mistress Chen.

291
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,360
Lu Ningxiang asked me to tell you something.

292
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,960
Don't come here again.

293
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,000
Even if you come here again,

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,200
she won't see you again.

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Then tell her

296
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,800
that we grew up together.

297
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,080
She should know

298
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,440
what kind of temper I have.

299
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,280
You're quite fresh.

300
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,800
Has she left?

301
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Who are you asking?

302
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,680
Young Mistress Chen or Zhou Yiyuan?

303
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,760
Young Mistress Chen.

304
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,160
She's gone.

305
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,320
She won't come again.

306
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,760
Zhou Yiyuan won't come either.

307
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,120
That's good.

308
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,840
I'll make a quiet place.

309
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,680
Chunhua Food Shop,

310
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,920
please come to the room.

311
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,880
Boss Chen,

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,080
please welcome Miss Lu Ningxiang.

313
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Alright.

314
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
Pack up quickly.

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,200
Business is coming.

316
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,480
Don't give me any more trouble.

317
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,960
Don't bother me.

318
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,560
Boss Chen.

319
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,440
I told you

320
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,440
not to see me again.

321
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,080
Why are you back?

322
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,800
Do you remember when we were kids,

323
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,480
we went to the riverside to wash clothes together?

324
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,480
I went to get clothes for you.

325
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,560
I accidentally fell into the river.

326
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,800
Luckily, you were fast.

327
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
You held me tight.

328
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,960
But we were too young

329
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,160
and didn't have enough strength.

330
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,720
You couldn't hold me tight either.

331
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
I was too young.

332
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,480
I couldn't hold you tight.

333
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,920
You pulled me into the river.

334
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,160
We were holding on to each other.

335
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
I told you,

336
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,440
let go.

337
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,480
Otherwise,

338
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,480
you would be dragged into the river.

339
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,480
But you just didn't let go.

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,480
You just held me tight.

341
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,760
You insisted on

342
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,280
having someone to save us.

343
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,120
You didn't let go back then.

344
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,760
I won't let go now.

345
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,080
Don't mention the past.

346
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,320
Even if you save me now,

347
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,920
I'm already dead.

348
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,360
I can't go back.

349
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,280
An Ning.

350
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm sorry.

351
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,100
An Ning,

352
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,160
do you remember this?

353
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:03,880
When we were kids,

354
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,040
there was a JJonak Alle second hand store.

355
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,080
We were always short on pay

356
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,200
to buy this.

357
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,680
Although it was short,

358
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,400
just a few bucks,

359
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
but that moment,

360
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,160
you would stand on top of it

361
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,120
and feel great.

362
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,160
To me,

363
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,040
this red bean thread is the greatest thing.

364
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,640
You're the most beautiful one

365
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,960
in this qizhou.

366
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,880
I was happy.

367
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,040
But the red thread

368
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,120
is lost.

369
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,440
You can keep it.

370
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,080
It's okay if it's lost.

371
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,240
But mine is still here.

372
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,320
I give it to you.

373
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
It's yours.

374
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,000
You were the most beautiful girl

375
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,200
in the qizhou.

376
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Now,

377
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,040
as long as you tie it up,

378
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,520
you'll always be the same.

379
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,320
Forever.

380
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,040
I don't deserve it.

381
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,520
It's just a talk.

382
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,600
It's just a storm.

383
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,000
No matter what you've been through,

384
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,400
you're always the most beautiful girl in my heart.

385
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Who said you can't go back?

386
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,120
As long as you don't fall,

387
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,400
you can always come back.

388
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
Do you think

389
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,920
I can come back?

390
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
Absolutely.

391
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I can.

392
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
As long as you want to do it,

393
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
there's nothing you can't do.

394
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,400
Three thousand silver dollars.

395
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,800
What?

396
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,800
How much?

397
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,000
And

398
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,400
your clothes and jewelry.

399
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll give you

400
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,200
three thousand.

401
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I'll give you three thousand.

402
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
Your clothes and jewelry.

403
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,200
And the furniture in this room.

404
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
I'll keep them all.

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
You're so greedy.

406
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,600
When I sold my clothes to you,

407
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I only sold two hundred silver dollars.

408
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,800
All these years,

409
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
I've made you a fortune.

410
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,600
I've made a fortune.

411
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
You've made a fortune long ago.

412
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Why don't you count?

413
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,400
How much did I spend on you?

414
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
You eat and drink a lot.

415
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
You wear clothes,

416
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,600
wipe your face,

417
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,200
paint your lips,

418
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,000
and wear a bag on your head.

419
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,800
I asked someone to teach you to play the zither,

420
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,600
sing and play the qizhou,

421
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
and learn from men.

422
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
I'm not an old woman.

423
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
I want to spend money on you.

424
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,400
Why are you yelling at me?

425
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,000
You're so mean.

426
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,800
Mom.

427
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,400
You're so stubborn, aren't you?

428
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,000
Okay.

429
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
I'll go back and discuss with my family.

430
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Xiao Xiao fell asleep?

431
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,600
Yes.

432
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,400
What's wrong?

433
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
Something wrong?

434
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400
I want

435
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
to borrow some money from you.

436
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
Do we need to borrow money?

437
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,200
How much do you want?

438
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I want the money first.

439
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,800
Why do you want so much money?

440
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,000
I met Erniu today.

441
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
He's still in Lingfang Restaurant.

442
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
I want to count him out.

443
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Wait a minute.

444
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,600
Erniu?

445
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
My best friend.

446
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,400
Lingfang Restaurant?

447
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
He was tricked there.

448
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,200
What?

449
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,800
That old man

450
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
asked for 3000 silver dollars

451
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,800
at the first time.

452
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,800
I have to get him out.

453
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,600
Shao Hua.

454
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,200
Do you know how much 3000 silver dollars

455
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,800
is a big sum of money?

456
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,800
I know.

457
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,200
But

458
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
I've been thinking about it

459
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
and I can only ask you.

460
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,400
There's no other way.

461
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Shao Hua.

462
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,800
Since I was 15 years old

463
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
and followed my father to do business,

464
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,400
I've collected

465
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,800
more than 200 silver dollars.

466
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I gave you some

467
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,800
and your brother some.

468
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Now I have only 100 silver dollars.

469
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,000
But what about Erniu?

470
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,800
You can only get 100 silver dollars?

471
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,400
What about me?

472
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,800
What about

473
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,400
you?

474
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
And the year?

475
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,200
A year?

476
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,400
Yes.

477
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,000
You mean

478
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
I can stay here

479
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,800
and be ruined by those men for a year?

480
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
But actually,

481
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,600
it's only a year.

482
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Only a year?

483
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Why don't you stay here?

484
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,000
We can change.

485
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,000
No need to stay here for a year.

486
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
One night.

487
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Erniu, I...

488
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Shao Hua,

489
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,800
I've told you

490
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,200
that you'll die in this house.

491
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,400
Why do you care about me?

492
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm desperate.

493
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why do you give me hope?

494
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,600
Now you're telling me

495
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,800
that you don't have enough money.

496
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
What about me?

497
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm dying.

498
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You don't have to save me.

499
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,800
But can you stop

500
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
making me so desperate?

501
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,600
Erniu,

502
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,400
I promise you

503
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,200
that I'll get the money

504
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
and get you out of here in a year.

505
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Mom!

506
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
The flowers are so familiar.

507
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
Wu said it before.

508
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,000
Mr. Wang said it before.

509
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Even Zhou Yi Yuan

510
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
said it before.

511
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
I've seen you clearly.

512
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,800
You're the same as those men.

513
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,600
Erniu, I'm not like that.

514
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,400
Get out.

515
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,800
Go!

516
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,400
Do you know how much money

517
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
I've got?

518
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,800
Didn't Chen Family

519
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,200
open a pharmacy in the capital?

520
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
Didn't they do a big business?

521
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,400
Business is a big deal.

522
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
His father didn't do a big deal.

523
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,600
It's all excuses.

524
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,000
You all have money.

525
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400
But no one is willing to save me.

526
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm telling the truth.

527
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,600
It's fake.

528
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,000
It's all fake.

529
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,800
Zhu Shao Hua, you're lying.

530
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,400
You don't know it.

531
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
It's fake to be close to your sister.

532
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,200
It's also fake to save me.

533
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
You're lying to me.

534
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
It's all fake.

535
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,600
Erniu,

536
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
you know it.

537
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
I don't want to see you.

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,600
You insisted on running away with Wu.

539
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,000
I've told you before.

540
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
You're so useless

541
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,200
to have this day.

542
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
Zhu Shao Hua, listen to me.

543
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
The person I hate the most

544
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
is not Wu.

545
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
It's you.

546
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,200
He just threw me into the water.

547
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
You pulled me up from the water

548
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
and let me breathe.

549
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,000
You pushed me down.

550
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,000
You're much, much worse than them.

551
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,400
Fine.

552
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,600
If that's the case,

553
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,800
I'll never

554
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,800
see you again.

555
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,000
I'll never forgive you.

556
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,200
Get lost!

557
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
I won't

558
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,400
interfere with Lu Ning Xiang's business anymore.

559
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,200
Young Mistress Chen,

560
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,200
take care.

561
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Have a seat.

562
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,400
Thank you.

563
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
This is quite good.

564
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
In my opinion,

565
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,000
it's more sweet than sale.

566
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:37,400
Master smallesty,

567
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,040
Madam Yan.

568
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,400
Madam Yan.

569
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,640
Long time no see.

570
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,880
You're here to see a doctor too?

571
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,640
Look at what you said.

572
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,960
I said it.

573
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,400
I'm talking business with Shen Yi Zhang.

574
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,360
What's the matter?

575
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,640
What a coincidence.

576
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,640
Young Mistress.

577
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,160
I'm also having business

578
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,960
to talk to you.

579
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,160
Let's talk in private.

580
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,040
Is there any leak

581
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,400
in Little Stone recently?

582
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,400
It has nothing to do with Little Stone.

583
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
Then it's still the powder that makes you unsatisfied.

584
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,840
Look.

585
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,120
The powder is quite useful.

586
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,440
What's the matter?

587
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,800
Go ahead.

588
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,320
Young Mistress.

589
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Are you going to

590
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,360
redeem Lu Ning Xiang?

591
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,520
Don't mention him.

592
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,840
I helped him before.

593
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,640
But I ended up being a stranger.

594
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,000
He's just confused.

595
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,880
Don't affect your sisterhood.

596
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,320
My surname is Chu.

597
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,160
His surname is Kang.

598
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
We're not sisters.

599
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,840
You're going to redeem him.

600
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,440
He's not a shallow person.

601
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,240
He's just begging.

602
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,640
I think he's doing a good thing

603
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,840
for the sake of Tong Xiang.

604
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,080
I thought he was just a few silver dollars.

605
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,600
Who would have thought he was so rich?

606
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,360
Young Mistress.

607
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,520
If you still want to redeem him,

608
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,520
just give him 2000 silver dollars.

609
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,080
I've told you before.

610
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,760
I don't care about his business.

611
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,560
Madam Yan.

612
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,440
If you have nothing else,

613
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,400
I'll leave first.

614
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,520
I have to go to another house.

615
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,240
No, no, no.

616
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,080
1500.

617
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,960
1000.

618
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,440
Madam Yan.

619
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,040
Let me tell you something.

620
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,880
I was willing to help him

621
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,280
because I had a debt.

622
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,720
My brother was a fool.

623
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,040
A decent girl wouldn't marry.

624
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,760
I thought

625
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,480
I'd spend 180 silver dollars

626
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,840
to redeem Lu Ning Xiang.

627
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,320
It's like marrying my brother.

628
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,000
I can handle the debt.

629
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,320
But if you say it's 1000 silver dollars,

630
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,600
it won't work.

631
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,400
Then...

632
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,800
How much can you pay?

633
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,720
800,000.

634
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,640
I have to save some money

635
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,040
to get them married.

636
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,360
Young Mistress.

637
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,800
If you do this,

638
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,240
you can't do business.

639
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,760
I've paid the money.

640
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,480
Why don't you pay it too?

641
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,400
500 silver dollars.

642
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,240
500 silver dollars?

643
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
If you can't even pay 500,

644
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,680
I'll go to another buyer.

645
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,760
I don't believe

646
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,800
that Lu Ning Xiang

647
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,240
can't even pay 500.

648
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,280
500 silver dollars.

649
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,960
I really have to go back.

650
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,440
It's settled then.

651
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,480
Tomorrow, before sunset,

652
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,240
you can come to Linfang House with the money.

653
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,160
We'll pay the money and the people.

654
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
No, you...

655
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,680
It's settled then.

656
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,640
You're too impatient.

657
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,720
This is the account from Qingya Primary School.

658
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,800
Have you seen it?

659
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,080
You're here to pay the bill?

660
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,960
I've been busy with business.

661
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
I can't do anything.

662
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
By the way, Mrs. Tang.

663
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
I have a friend.

664
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,720
He seems to have fallen in love

665
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,960
with Lu Ning Xiang from Linfang House.

666
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,040
He wants to be her friend.

667
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,880
How much do you think it's worth?

668
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Lu Ning Xiang?

669
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,800
You don't know?

670
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,440
Know what?

671
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,360
He's dying.

672
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,920
Boss Zhao, thank you for your concern.

673
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,560
Thank you, Mrs. Yan.

674
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Mrs. Yan.

675
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,840
Lu Ning Xiang

676
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,840
has 500 silver dollars.

677
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,920
But I don't want 50 silver dollars.

678
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,280
I don't want the money.

679
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,560
What do you mean?

680
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,520
I just find it strange.

681
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,560
Before, I had 3,000 silver dollars.

682
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,800
But I suddenly have 500 silver dollars.

683
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
It turns out that Lu Ning Xiang got infected,

684
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,040
got sick, and his whole body is rotten.

685
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,960
He's so smelly.

686
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,920
Even the medical record is out of control.

687
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,680
You even asked me to bring the money here tomorrow.

688
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,320
You're afraid that one day,

689
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,800
Lu Ning Xiang will die in your hands, right?

690
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,800
Who told you that?

691
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,360
Don't care who told me.

692
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,680
Anyway, I don't want him.

693
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,440
Whoever wants him, he wants him.

694
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Wait.

695
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,960
Why are you so arrogant?

696
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,400
I have to get him.

697
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,720
I have to get him.

698
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,640
Who are you?

699
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,120
You don't even know Boss Zhao.

700
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,120
You're still doing business in this area.

701
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,720
Even if it's Boss Zhao,

702
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,920
we can't buy and sell him, right?

703
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,320
Probably someone you know.

704
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,960
What do you want?

705
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,320
Who is he?

706
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,040
Boss Zhao is a nobody.

707
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,160
Even if he's a nobody,

708
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,480
he has to get through thisJust tell me,

709
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,520
what you mean is

710
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,400
your antidote will be beans to sell, right?

711
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,480
How to sell it?

712
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,160
Then,

713
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,040
turn him into the elder brother of your parents?

714
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,320
That's right.

715
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,000
Lawyer Zhao's name is Amazing titled

716
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,600
What if it's not cured?

717
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,320
You can send it back to us.

718
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,480
Even if it can be cured,

719
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,800
I don't want this person.

720
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,440
I regret it, okay?

721
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,720
No.

722
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,200
I tell you.

723
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,880
If you dare to regret it,

724
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,760
your family

725
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,480
won't want to do business in this alley.

726
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,720
Okay.

727
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,320
I can take this person.

728
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,040
But I can't get out of this 500.

729
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,280
I'll keep 200 and buy medicine for him.

730
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,720
Then 300.

731
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,600
I have another condition.

732
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,360
Say it.

733
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
You help me find someone.

734
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,720
Who?

735
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,880
Wu.

736
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,560
Why do you look for him?

737
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,200
Then don't ask.

738
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,920
If I don't ask,

739
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,200
how can I help you find someone?

740
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,760
He is my distant relative.

741
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,800
It's someone in their family who wants to find him.

742
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,200
I'll help you ask.

743
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,560
I haven't seen that boy for a long time.

744
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,040
I don't know where he is.

745
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,920
You are the famous Boss Zhao.

746
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,600
You have so many brothers.

747
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,800
If you want to do something,

748
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
you can definitely find him.

749
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
I'll give you 300.

750
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,000
Take this incense back.

751
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,760
At most, it's a lucky chance.

752
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,400
And the only condition

753
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,240
is to let you help me find Wu

754
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,640
and give it to me.

755
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,560
You see.

756
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,000
I promise you.

757
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,680
But I also have a condition.

758
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,560
If Lu Lingxiang dies here,

759
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,440
I'll recognize him.

760
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,280
If he dies in your house,

761
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,280
don't come to me.

762
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,040
Okay.

763
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,120
Okay.

764
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,040
Do you know someone called Wu?

765
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,720
Wu?

766
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,560
Yes, he's from Qizhou.

767
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,680
I don't know him.

768
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,880
Thank you.

769
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,480
Okay.

770
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,880
Let's go.

771
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,120
Boss.

772
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,360
What did the woman ask you?

773
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,960
Let's go.

774
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,920
She went to many places along the way.

775
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,400
She went to the casino, the restaurant,

776
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,160
the hotel and other places.

777
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,760
She asked all of them.

778
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,560
Just to find Wu?

779
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,080
Yes.

780
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,080
Did she say

781
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,000
why she was in such a hurry to find Wu?

782
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,240
She said Wu was her brother.

783
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,480
Her mother was dying.

784
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,160
She wanted to see her brother for the last time.

785
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,760
She said Wu was her brother-in-law.

786
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,160
Her sister was dying.

787
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,200
She wanted to see her brother-in-law for the last time.

788
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,360
She didn't say a word.

789
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,560
She didn't say a word.

790
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,520
Right.

791
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,680
But she told Li Xiazi the truth.

792
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,640
She went to Li Xiazi?

793
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,240
Yes.

794
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,640
She asked Li Xiazi to help her.

795
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,840
Where is Wu now?

796
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,400
Li Xiazi said you have to tell me

797
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,200
why you went to her.

798
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,360
I can't tell you.

799
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,760
So she told the truth.

800
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,040
What did they say?

801
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,760
Wu and she have Lu Ningxiang.

802
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,120
They are from the same hometown.

803
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,800
When Wu took Lu Ningxiang

804
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,160
out of the hometown,

805
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,640
she took money from the owner.

806
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,360
And there was a...

807
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,440
A bodyguard.

808
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,560
The owner raised 5000 silver units

809
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,800
for the bodyguard to be killed.

810
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
5000 silver units?

811
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,640
Right.

812
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,320
That's what I'm talking about.

813
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,560
You know Lu Ningxiang is dying.

814
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,280
She will sell us again.

815
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,960
I'm sure something is up.

816
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,160
We won't have the time to waste.

817
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,120
Support 3000 silver units with 5000.

818
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,040
You can count her.

819
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,920
Playing with me,

820
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,040
she is a little bit tired.

821
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,560
Put it down.

822
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,000
Make all the brothers get up.

823
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,760
Get me Xiaowu for sure.

824
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,560
I, Boss Zhao, have faith in Yan'er.

825
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,240
Wu can be his wife.

826
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
But he's dead.

827
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,560
If he's not happy,

828
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
he'll be mine.

829
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,800
Go.

830
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,360
Yes.

831
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
103 cases in total.

832
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,400
197 cases are missing.

833
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,800
I'm thinking about

834
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,080
how to get the money.

835
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,560
How about

836
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,720
borrowing some from your parents?

837
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,840
My father

838
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,360
will never do anything

839
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,560
that's not right for him.

840
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,360
As for my mother...

841
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,240
Okay, I know.

842
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,880
Yes, you know it.

843
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,520
What should we do?

844
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,280
I have a few business partners

845
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,920
to ask them to help me.

846
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,120
But you'll need the money tomorrow afternoon.

847
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,080
It's too late.

848
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,600
Do I have to do it tomorrow?

849
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm afraid that Ye Chang might be too busy.

850
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,240
With the current situation,

851
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,600
it'll be safer

852
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,400
to save him as soon as possible.

853
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,440
Okay.

854
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,040
I'll get you the money tomorrow morning.

855
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,640
How?

856
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,920
Don't worry.

857
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,840
I have a plan.

858
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,480
Dashun.

859
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,280
Thank you.

860
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,600
You still want to say that?

861
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,680
I'll keep the money.

862
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,560
Okay.

863
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,200
Godmother,

864
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,360
Godmother said

865
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,240
you can't buy this fate in cavers.

866
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,360
Young Mistress,

867
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,360
can you see that

868
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,160
this person

869
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,880
still exists?

870
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,960
Where's Xiaowu?

871
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Brother Zhao is looking for him.

872
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,920
Don't worry.

873
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,600
He'll fo tiny money

874
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,760
within three days.

875
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
There's nothing

876
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,160
I'm worried about.

877
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,520
Take a look.

878
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,540
But the great leader of the family

879
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,420
has been exposed

880
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,940
I said, nobody's safe

881
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,960
But nobody's safe

882
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,160
His opinion was clear

883
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,780
Birthday

884
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,060
So great

885
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,980
Butorial

886
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,160
I think

887
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,420
someone will want to fight

888
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,040
I don't know where the King of Gods is.

889
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Where is he?

890
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Let me ask you again.

891
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,840
Xiaowu.

892
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,880
Xiaowu.

893
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,160
Where is the King of Gods?

894
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,760
I really don't know where he is.

895
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,200
I don't know.

896
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,360
Beat him.

897
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Have you washed up?

898
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,920
The meal is ready.

899
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,600
I'm free.

900
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,960
You're free.

901
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,320
Why?

902
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,640
You eat...

903
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,400
You eat on the morning in the morning.

904
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,040
The healthy body is above all else.

905
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,960
You're ugly.

906
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,200
Most people don't dare to go to the front office to see you.

907
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,720
They don't dare to touch you.

908
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,120
Besides,

909
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,320
from now on,

910
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,080
you should eat less and less every day.

911
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,280
You'll look like

912
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,760
you're getting thinner day by day.

913
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,280
Your face and head

914
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,440
will get better and better.

915
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,240
You'll be less and less.

916
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,400
You'll be more and more.

917
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,160
Your mother will definitely admit

918
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,120
that you're sick and in a panic.

919
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,520
You have no medicine.

920
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,080
How did you come up with this idea?

921
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,360
Don't forget

922
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,520
how my father died.

923
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,680
I'm sorry.

924
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,680
It's okay.

925
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,000
Are you ready?

926
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,720
You can take out a hundred big sheep?

927
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,000
Mrs. Yan asked me to

928
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,040
see Lu Ningxiang for a doctor yesterday.

929
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,120
According to your order,

930
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
I told her

931
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,360
Ningxiang got the most dangerous black sheep in the sheep's brain.

932
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,440
And it's the last stage.

933
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,640
She also said

934
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,840
we'd better get rid of it quickly.

935
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,480
Otherwise,

936
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,360
everyone will be infected.

937
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,040
Here you are.

938
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,400
Thank you, Young Mistress.

939
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,160
If you have a job to earn money,

940
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,120
just call me.

941
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,480
You can try selling this.

942
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,560
It's more likely to earn more than

943
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,720
those flowers and cakes you sell.

944
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,520
Okay.

945
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,360
Isn't this the first lady of the Chen family?

946
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,600
