1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't fall into the cage

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, you are the wind

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You can't be caught, you can't be caught

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's the knife in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world doesn't want to, then let it go

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My bitter pain, my pain

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Will finally turn around

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am me

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The biggest night is me

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I am the one who doesn't want to

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Go through it

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hurry up and sign this. I'm using it early.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, I know.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hurry up.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Madam, I'm here to congratulate you.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You've worked hard.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You've worked hard today.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Congratulations, congratulations.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Madam, today is the day to celebrate.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes, this reward should be doubled.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Reward reward

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This meat is so big.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can see it without my eyes.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Cut it a little bit.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, wait a minute.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A little bit smaller, will it cut?

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Wait a minute.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Madam.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll prepare you that noodles.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Such a fine noodles.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll change it back.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have a little oil, you're all right.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not your family.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not a big hand.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Put your hands down a little bit.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Put your hands down a little bit.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Who?

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, I know.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Professor Hua is out.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
His wife is coming in soon.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're a friend, why don't you go and welcome her?

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're here, you're just talking.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It doesn't matter if you should.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It doesn't matter if you shouldn't.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Isn't it blind?

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll help you.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hurry up and go.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Go, go.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Today, the two young men of the Chen family

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's the first day to celebrate.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a good thing.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
First, bow to the heaven and earth.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Second, bow to the high pagoda.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Husband and wife bow to each other.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Child, give it to me.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Congratulations.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thanks.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Cheers.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Brother.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All right, don't move.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't move.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just look at one eye.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Just look at one eye.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Just look at one eye.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Just look at one eye.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Just look at one eye.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Good.

79
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,960
Good.

80
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
Oh my god.

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,040
Thank you.

82
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,600
This is so beautiful.

83
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
Look.

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,000
It's so beautiful.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,640
Uncle.

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,040
Good.

87
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,280
Okay.

88
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,960
Sorry.

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,840
Get out.

90
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,720
Get out.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,720
Get out.

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,480
Thank you.

93
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:07,920
Get out.

94
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
I've seen enough.

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Get out.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,280
Sorry.

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,040
Get out.

98
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,960
Get out.

99
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
So ugly.

100
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you tired?

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,880
Have some water.

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,840
Here.

103
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,560
Is it good?

104
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,960
There is no hiking in this place.

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Uncle,

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,640
I'm exhausted.

107
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,280
Can you smell it?

108
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,920
Su cô H esas kata.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
I was a fake royal concubine.

110
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,400
You were a royal concubine's buyer?

111
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,440
Yes.

112
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,560
I regretted it very much.

113
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
I forgot

114
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,760
to ask you

115
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,760
who you were and where you lived.

116
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,520
I thought I would never see you again.

117
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,160
I didn't expect

118
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,960
you were the one who was engaged to me.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,240
I didn't expect either.

120
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,560
Don't be afraid.

121
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Don't worry.

122
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
I'll be good to you for the rest of my life.

123
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
I swear.

124
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
I swear.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,680
Mr. Cheng.

126
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,440
Hurry up.

127
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,200
What are you doing?

128
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,280
You're so idle.

129
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
You're so idle.

130
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Get out. Get out.

131
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,240
Yu Zhen.

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,880
What are you doing?

133
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
Don't be a fool.

134
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,080
Get out.

135
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,920
Go home and see your wife.

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,520
She's not our wife.

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
You've never seen a woman.

138
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,200
You're so annoying.

139
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,960
Get out.

140
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,480
You're so annoying.

141
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Go. Go.

142
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Go. Go.

143
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Go. Go.

144
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Go. Go.

145
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Go. Go.

146
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
You're the first one.

147
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,480
You've seen her before.

148
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Brother Ersheng.

149
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,480
What do you mean?

150
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,080
You're so little.

151
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,800
If you don't want to marry her, don't marry her.

152
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Who's disgusting?

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Take off your shoes.

154
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
I told you to take them off for me.

155
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
You're taking good care of yourself.

156
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Reflect on yourself.

157
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Reflect on yourself.

158
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Reflect on yourself.

159
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Reflect on yourself.

160
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Reflect on yourself.

161
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Reflect on yourself.

162
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Did you sleep well last night?

163
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Why didn't you wake me up?

164
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
I saw you were sleeping soundly.

165
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
I couldn't bear to wake you up.

166
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Drink some tea.

167
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
You're not checking the time?

168
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
How long did you wait for Master?

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Forget it.

170
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
This is the old man's house.

171
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
You can't sleep here.

172
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
You can't sleep here.

173
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
You can't sleep here.

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
You can't sleep here.

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
You can't sleep here.

176
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
You can't sleep here.

177
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
You can't sleep here.

178
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
You can't sleep here.

179
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
This is the first day

180
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
that the eldest son comes to our house.

181
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Yes, Master.

182
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
You're like this on the first day.

183
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
How are you going to live in the future?

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
The eldest son's house

185
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
is your mother's house.

186
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
It doesn't matter how you behave

187
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
or how you play.

188
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
In my house,

189
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
you can't.

190
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
This is the second son's house.

191
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Actually, we've come a step further

192
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
than my eldest brother and sister-in-law.

193
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
We've come a step further.

194
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Mom,

195
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
it's my fault.

196
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Shaohua got up early.

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
I dragged her out.

198
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
I drank too much last night.

199
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
When I woke up this morning,

200
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
my head hurt so much.

201
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
I dragged her to massage me.

202
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
But this massage

203
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
was delayed.

204
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Okay, the eldest son's house.

205
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
The second son's house.

206
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Come on, help me.

207
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Come on, come on.

208
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Come on, come on.

209
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Come with me to the kitchen.

210
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
No need.

211
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
The eldest son's house.

212
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Come on, the second son's house.

213
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Come on.

214
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Come on.

215
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
In the future,

216
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
you two will be the ones

217
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
who will eat and drink

218
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
in our family.

219
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
One person per day is fine.

220
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Who will be the first one to open the door today?

221
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
I'll do it.

222
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
I think the eldest son's house will be the first one to open the door.

223
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Okay.

224
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Come on, make breakfast.

225
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Mom, look.

226
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
My second brother and I just got married.

227
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
What's the rule of eating at home?

228
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
What's the taste of you and dad?

229
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Please give me some advice.

230
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Don't you eat breakfast in your mother's house?

231
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
But...

232
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
It's the same.

233
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Don't stand there.

234
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Burn the firewood.

235
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Go inside.

236
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
The eldest son's house.

237
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Go outside.

238
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Hold a piece of firewood.

239
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Mom,

240
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
you just said you would burn the firewood.

241
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Isn't it a rule?

242
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I told you to do it.

243
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
You did it.

244
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Take it.

245
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Go.

246
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Hurry up.

247
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Master.

248
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,680
This morning's breakfast is prepared by the eldest son.

249
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
You can try his cooking.

250
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
How is it, Master?

251
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
What's wrong?

252
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,680
You want to kill the one who sells salt?

253
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Don't make a bet with the eldest son this morning.

254
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
It's the first time.

255
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
You have to do this every day.

256
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Mom, mom, mom.

257
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Dad, it's my fault.

258
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I forgot to tell that little thing.

259
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,680
This dad has never eaten this sweet one since every morning.

260
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
I forgot it.

261
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I forgot it.

262
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Dad, actually, I haven't had time to say it.

263
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,680
I made you a sweet one.

264
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Is there more?

265
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Yes.

266
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I'll take it for you.

267
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
It's mine.

268
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
And sweet.

269
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Come on, dad.

270
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Look.

271
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Pumpkin cake.

272
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Fruit porridge.

273
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Wine-brewed balls.

274
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Red bean paste.

275
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
All for you.

276
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
All sweet.

277
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
It's delicious.

278
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
The eldest son's.

279
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
This fruit is cooked with porridge.

280
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
This is the first time I eat it.

281
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
I drank too much last night.

282
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
I drank too much that I was out of energy.

283
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Don't say that.

284
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
You're a wine-brewed ball.

285
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
It's delicious.

286
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
It's very delicious.

287
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
It's very delicious.

288
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Look.

289
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
It's good that you like it.

290
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Hurry up, eat.

291
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
Okay.

292
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
This is for you.

293
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Where did you get the sugar?

294
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
It's weird to say that.

295
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,680
I haven't found any sugar in the kitchen today.

296
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Maybe someone stole it yesterday.

297
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Yes, it must be.

298
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
It's the eldest son's.

299
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Don't say that.

300
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,680
You're really good at cooking.

301
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
You can eat it.

302
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
It's delicious.

303
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
Okay.

304
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Delicious.

305
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
He wants to cook if he can eat.

306
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,680
I think your mother is so poor because of you.

307
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Dad, try this red bean paste.

308
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I added orange peel on purpose.

309
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
It's delicious and angry.

310
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Okay.

311
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
It's delicious.

312
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
You added sugar.

313
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
You scared me.

314
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
This is specially made for dad.

315
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
I haven't eaten it for a long time.

316
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
You're not worthy of eating.

317
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
You can't grow meat without eating.

318
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
You're not a food thief.

319
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
It's okay.

320
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
There's still some in the kitchen.

321
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
I'll get it if you're not enough.

322
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
Sister-in-law, don't be busy.

323
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Hurry up and eat.

324
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,680
The chef we invited yesterday

325
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
was introduced by Lao Wei.

326
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Who knew he was not clean?

327
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
He stole the sugar.

328
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
I don't think the person who stole the sugar

329
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
will live long.

330
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Why?

331
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Haven't you heard?

332
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,680
It's better to steal gold than to steal sugar.

333
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Stealing gold is like going to jail.

334
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Stealing sugar is not good for your life.

335
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Why is it not good for my life?

336
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Because the sugar is used to suck the blood of the family.

337
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
But stealing sugar

338
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,680
sucks the blood of the family.

339
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
How long can it last?

340
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Really?

341
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Mom, do you remember Shuanzhu?

342
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,680
The one who died of bleeding 10 years ago.

343
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,680
She doesn't know what death is.

344
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
But it is said that

345
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,680
she did steal the sugar of Grandma Liu's house before she died.

346
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
What's wrong with her?

347
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Go and see.

348
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Uncle, what are you looking at?

349
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
You...

350
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,680
The boss's.

351
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Is what you just said true?

352
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
I just heard it.

353
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
It's not true.

354
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
You have no rules.

355
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Your parents are still inside.

356
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
What did you take?

357
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Look.

358
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,680
So you are the one who stole the sugar.

359
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
I didn't steal it.

360
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,680
You took it with you to our family, right?

361
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
You gave your family 40 silver coins.

362
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Can't you buy the sugar?

363
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
I didn't steal it.

364
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Mom gave it to me.

365
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,680
You are talking nonsense.

366
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
I really want to beat you up.

367
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Stop.

368
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
I beg you.

369
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Go back to your room.

370
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
I didn't steal it.

371
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Dad, don't be angry.

372
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Master.

373
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Master.

374
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
I won't eat you.

375
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
I will drink.

376
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Don't cry.

377
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Don't cry.

378
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,680
This second son must be drinking again.

379
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Or you go tell him.

380
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
This second son,

381
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
he only got married for a few days.

382
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Now he's going to be a wife.

383
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,680
If Zuo Lin heard,

384
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
he would be very shocked.

385
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,360
Yes.

386
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,560
The second daughter-in-law is also a big-time fan.

387
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,760
She just came in for a few days.

388
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,200
She burnt my pot,

389
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,320
broke three bowls,

390
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,200
and a gold-plated one.

391
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,800
Today she dropped a bottle of oil.

392
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,760
At least half a gold.

393
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
She spilled it all on the floor.

394
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,200
You picked her

395
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,680
yourself.

396
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,000
She's your niece.

397
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,640
I…

398
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,680
I tried.

399
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,720
But I didn't know

400
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,160
she was so stupid.

401
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,360
If she dares to hit you again,

402
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,960
you'll hit her back.

403
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,760
I can't beat her.

404
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,280
You'll get a knife, right?

405
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,960
I dare not.

406
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,840
Then run.

407
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,880
Where should I run?

408
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,800
Run to my room.

409
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,520
You…

410
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,400
You wanted to suppress me, right?

411
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Who said that?

412
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,360
Mom said that.

413
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,360
Song Ping.

414
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,120
We didn't know each other before.

415
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,000
But we were in the same house.

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
It's like we're sisters.

417
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
The most important thing

418
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,640
between sisters

419
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,240
is to love and care for each other.

420
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,080
You don't need to

421
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,200
be in the same boat.

422
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,320
Do you understand?

423
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,320
I do.

424
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,200
Don't worry. Go back.

425
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I just said that.

426
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,840
Thank you, brother.

427
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,240
Thank you, sister-in-law.

428
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,000
This is a gift

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
for you and your father

430
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,840
for each of you.

431
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,120
It's a gift for you.

432
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,920
It's the same.

433
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,520
Take it home and give it to your family.

434
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,080
It's a gift for you and your father.

435
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,640
Thank you, mom.

436
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,120
Sister-in-law, here.

437
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,280
Sister-in-law, here.

438
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,200
This is for you.

439
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,960
It's the same.

440
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,240
Thank you.

441
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,800
Take it.

442
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,440
All right.

443
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,240
Go back early.

444
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,800
Dad, mom.

445
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,360
We'll go now.

446
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
Go back and give it to your family.

447
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,080
Thank you, dad.

448
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,800
Dad, we're going to the village.

449
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,400
Dad, we're going now.

450
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,200
Mom, we're going now.

451
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,680
Dad, mom, we're going now.

452
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,760
What's inside?

453
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,560
Open it and let me see.

454
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Good luck.

455
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,600
What are you thinking?

456
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,960
Give me this box.

457
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
Didn't you say

458
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,560
we should love each other?

459
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,680
You're my sister-in-law.

460
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,800
Of course I should give you first.

461
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,480
Is that so?

462
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,440
Yes.

463
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,160
Don't touch those new cases.

464
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
She's just a poor mother.

465
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,480
It's a waste to give her good things.

466
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,760
Your family has it.

467
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,120
Look at the little dowry

468
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,280
your family has.

469
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm embarrassed to say it.

470
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,600
Mom, where's brother?

471
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
Your brother went to buy seeds.

472
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,120
He'll be back soon.

473
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,760
Seeds?

474
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,800
We don't have any field.

475
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,240
What seeds can we buy?

476
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,760
You don't know?

477
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,520
Da Shun helped

478
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
to get your brother's land back.

479
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,880
Mr. Gu, have some water.

480
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,320
Sit down.

481
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,960
Thank you, sister-in-law.

482
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,560
No problem.

483
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,800
Mr. Gu and Shaohua are back.

484
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,160
Brother.

485
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,600
Brother, you're back.

486
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
When did you arrive?

487
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,720
Just now.

488
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,520
Sit down.

489
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,080
How's the journey?

490
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,920
It's going well.

491
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,240
That's good.

492
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,880
Mr. Gu, I heard your Chen family's business

493
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,040
is getting bigger.

494
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
It's just a small business.

495
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
You're so modest.

496
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,600
Your business is just a small business.

497
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,080
You've shared your family's business with us.

498
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
It's enough for us to eat for a year.

499
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,760
Da Shun.

500
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,080
You haven't introduced

501
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,280
the origin of the dessert to me, right?

502
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Introduce it to me.

503
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,480
Yes.

504
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,000
Mom.

505
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
I brought this dessert for you.

506
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
This is a proof.

507
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,800
It was made for His Majesty.

508
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,440
Mr. Gu.

509
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,680
I heard your family

510
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
and Han口's medicine shop

511
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,320
are in a deal, right?

512
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,600
Mom.

513
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,520
Try this Satchimo first.

514
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,200
It's so beautiful.

515
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,720
Yes.

516
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,680
Brother.

517
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,560
It's true.

518
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,240
Well,

519
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,520
can we take part in it?

520
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,880
Yes.

521
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,920
Is it good?

522
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,840
Well,

523
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,440
we can discuss it.

524
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
I think it's best

525
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,000
to go with you.

526
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,880
I want to see

527
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,600
how to do business with Hubei people.

528
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,400
Yes.

529
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,800
I wonder

530
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,400
how many books you want to record.

531
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,520
I plan to...

532
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,800
Well,

533
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,080
Mr. Gu.

534
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,360
Our family was framed by the crook.

535
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,920
We suffered heavy losses.

536
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,160
Then,

537
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,480
he made a wedding for us

538
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,320
and emptied our house completely.

539
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,280
So we can't

540
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,240
make money in the first half of the year.

541
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,040
But we think

542
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,600
we can do this, Mr. Gu.

543
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,280
You can help us

544
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,720
to put the books on the table.

545
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,360
But in the future,

546
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,400
we'll make money

547
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,320
and return the books to you.

548
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,720
I don't think it's reasonable.

549
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,800
You want to let Dashun take you

550
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,440
and make Dashun record the books.

551
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,480
What do you think Dashun is?

552
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,800
Well...

553
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,480
Shaohua.

554
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,760
Mr. Gu didn't say anything, right?

555
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,320
Yes.

556
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,720
As the saying goes,

557
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,640
the more you think, the more you will be.

558
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,400
If you don't have money,

559
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
you can quit your business.

560
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,600
Sister, you're right.

561
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,920
We don't have money.

562
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,240
But we have you.

563
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,120
You can't be so scheming

564
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,320
with me.

565
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No, I...

566
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,440
Well...

567
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,320
Why are you scheming?

568
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,160
You still...

569
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,200
It's okay.

570
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,360
My brother and sister-in-law

571
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,560
don't see me as an outsider.

572
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,240
It's okay.

573
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Mr. Gu is so generous, right?

574
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,640
No, no.

575
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,080
You two talk.

576
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,120
I'll go boil some water for you.

577
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,200
Shaohua.

578
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Help me.

579
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

580
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,520
Come on.

581
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,240
I'll tell you

582
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
what I think.

583
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
I won't do it.

584
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,280
How much did you give my brother?

585
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,480
Six silver dollars.

586
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,200
You're innocent.

587
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,600
Why did you give him so much money?

588
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,680
He's your brother.

589
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,600
Then why didn't you tell me

590
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
about the matter of

591
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
counting the fields for my family?

592
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,560
It's my duty.

593
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
I have nothing to say.

594
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,840
How much did you spend on it?

595
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,720
I don't know.

596
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,400
Uncle.

597
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,520
Why did you

598
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,560
treat my family so well?

599
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,240
I thought

600
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
if your family

601
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,040
lived a life of peace and quiet,

602
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,480
you wouldn't be happy.

603
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
They had a good life.

604
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,080
You'd feel better.

605
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:37,880
Thank you.

606
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,240
It sounds kinda期待ware to me.

607
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,400
It's quite a family.

608
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,480
By the way,

609
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,440
my brother

610
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,280
told him to borrow money

611
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,560
to make a business at a respectable早代賬店.

612
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,400
Don't匯錢給他.

613
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,320
He even said it.

614
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,400
If we manage to help our own family,

615
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
it would become a big opera.

616
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
We can help them

617
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
That's not the point

618
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Luo, there are bandits. Hurry up

619
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
Luo, hurry up

620
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Hurry up

621
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Hurry up

622
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Hurry up

623
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Hurry up, Luo

624
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
What are you looking at?

625
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Get off the car and rob

626
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Don't shoot

627
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Hurry up

628
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,640
Dad, I drive

629
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
I have no money

630
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
I have nothing

631
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
You are a coward

632
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Da Sheng

633
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Buddy

634
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,240
I can give you all the valuable things.

635
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,040
I just beg you not to hurt my wife.

636
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,240
It depends on how much you give me.

637
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,440
I'll give you everything.

638
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,680
It's gone?

639
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,880
It's gone.

640
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,600
Eat.

641
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,960
Hey, don't move.

642
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,120
Where's yours?

643
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
We're robbing, not robbing.

644
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,360
You don't respect the bandits.

645
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,920
It's gone?

646
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,160
It's gone.

647
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,960
It's really gone.

648
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,760
You can give it to us.

649
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,280
It's gone.

650
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,000
Okay.

651
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,720
Boss.

652
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,080
You're the woman.

653
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,400
Thank you, brother.

654
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,320
Brother, we've agreed not to hurt my wife.

655
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,160
Brother.

656
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,000
Little woman.

657
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
Let me take care of you.

658
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,080
Don't move.

659
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,040
Go.

660
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,680
Uncle.

661
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,120
Don't hurt my wife.

662
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,480
Uncle.

663
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,880
Uncle.

664
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,680
Uncle, stop fighting.

665
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,720
Don't hurt my wife.

666
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,520
Uncle.

667
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,240
Uncle.

668
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,040
Uncle.

669
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,840
Uncle.

670
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,160
Don't hit him.

671
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,480
Stop fighting.

672
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,120
Uncle, don't hit him.

673
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Don't hit him.

674
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,120
Don't hit him.

675
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,240
Uncle.

676
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,840
Don't hit him.

677
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,760
Don't move.

678
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Let go of my man.

679
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,560
Don't move.

680
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,240
Let them put down their guns.

681
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Put down your guns.

682
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,240
Put down your guns.

683
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,760
Boss.

684
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,960
Take Uncle to the car.

685
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,960
Okay.

686
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,720
Young Master.

687
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,600
Hurry.

688
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,320
Hurry.

689
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,840
Go.

690
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,560
Go.

691
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,880
Don't move.

692
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,800
He's fine.

693
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,600
Shut up.

694
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,200
Young Master.

695
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,280
Get in the car.

696
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Let your men

697
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,920
let him go.

698
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,520
Let him go.

699
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,160
Let him go.

700
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,560
Let him go.

701
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,960
Let him go.

702
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,160
Get in the car with me.

703
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,760
Get in.

704
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,120
Get out.

705
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,280
Don't keep staring at me.

706
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,880
Luo.

707
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,760
Go.

708
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,840
Young Master.

709
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,720
Hold on.

710
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
The war is coming.

711
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,520
Luo, hurry.

712
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,280
Okay.

713
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,280
Young Master.

714
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,800
Luo, slow down.

715
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,720
Da Shun.

716
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,200
Brother.

717
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,720
What's wrong?

718
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,280
Da Shun.

719
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
What's wrong with you?

720
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,640
Why are you like this?

721
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,960
Slow down.

722
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,560
Slow down.

723
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,360
Old Master.

724
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,080
Old Master.

725
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,040
What's wrong with you?

726
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,920
Hold him.

727
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,600
Old Master.

728
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,920
Be careful.

729
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,360
God bless me, Da Shun.

730
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,160
God bless me.

731
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,880
I'm fine.

732
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,360
Brother, are you okay?

733
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,440
Are you itchy?

734
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,040
Don't shout.

735
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,480
Old Master.

736
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,920
How are you?

737
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,480
Don't worry.

738
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,360
I'm much better.

739
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,320
I just woke up.

740
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,600
I talked to myself.

741
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,680
I fell asleep again.

742
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Doctor, you're tired.

743
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
How are you?

744
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,120
Young Master is badly injured.

745
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,680
But he's still alive.

746
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,120
Just follow my prescription

747
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,080
and take good care of him.

748
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
And take good care of him.

749
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,880
I promise you

750
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,760
will recover.

751
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,400
Thank you, Doctor.

752
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,520
Thank you, Doctor.

753
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,240
I'll leave now.

754
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,920
Thank you.

755
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,240
Come on.

756
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,480
Take him away.

757
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,120
Okay.

758
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,080
What happened to him?

759
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,480
What happened?

760
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,440
On the way back,

761
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,280
he met Sanshou Gang.

762
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,640
Sanshou Gang?

763
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,280
Yes.

764
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,760
He even escaped from the Gang?

765
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,280
Da Shun said

766
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,440
it's lucky that he's smooth and not in a mess.

767
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,040
He kidnapped the gang leader.

768
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,360
That's why they escaped.

769
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,000
Otherwise, they wouldn't have escaped.

770
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,360
You kidnapped the gang leader.

771
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,200
You're bold.

772
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,560
Indeed.

773
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,160
I'm bold.

774
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,320
You're praising him.

775
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,440
If he hadn't

776
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,960
gone back to the Nian family,

777
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,080
I wouldn't have suffered this.

778
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,280
Listen.

779
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,200
If it wasn't for him,

780
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,840
your son

781
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,760
would have been gone.

782
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,600
Do you know that?

783
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,640
If you beat the bandits away,

784
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,440
you would have been beaten to death.

785
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,480
Sanshou Gang

786
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,880
is nothing to us.

787
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,960
If they keep an eye on us,

788
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,000
we'll have a hard time.

789
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,600
What should we do?

790
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,120
What should we do?

791
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,200
Listen.

792
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,240
You can't

793
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,720
tell anyone about this.

794
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,880
Understand?

795
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,760
Especially you.

796
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,560
Yes.

797
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,160
Where's Ma Feng?

798
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,080
He's waiting at the door.

799
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,360
Take care of him.

800
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,320
You're still here?

801
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,120
Okay.

802
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,760
Okay.

803
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,400
It's okay.

804
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,320
Let's go.

805
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,360
Okay.

806
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,040
Shouhe.

807
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,840
Run.

808
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
Run.

809
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,960
Run.

810
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,840
Shouhe.

811
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,360
Shouhe.

812
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,520
It's okay.

813
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,000
We've run out.

814
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,080
We've run out.

815
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,920
We've run out.

816
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,320
No.

817
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,760
Let's take him home.

818
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,720
Let's go.

819
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,800
I'm waiting.

820
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,640
olsun.

821
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
What's the matter?

822
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,760
Dad, nothing.

823
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,560
Last time, I gave the car owner

824
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,360
three big sheep

825
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,200
and told him about

826
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,320
Qi's strong relationship.

827
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,560
He promised

828
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,640
he would never tell the big brother

829
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,040
about the bandits.

830
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
It seems

831
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,360
we can set off on the eighth day.

832
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,720
Tell your mother to prepare the luggage.

833
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,560
When I go to Beijing,

834
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,680
I must make money

835
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,280
and buy everything

836
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,600
you want.

837
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,360
Will you give me

838
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,840
everything I want?

839
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,040
Yes.

840
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,360
I'll do everything

841
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,320
you want,

842
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,240
whether it's flying,

843
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
climbing,

844
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,000
or travelling.

845
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
What if

846
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,000
I want to

847
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
leave here

848
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,080
and go to see

849
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
the world outside?

850
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,680
The world outside?

851
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,160
Don't you want

852
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,080
to make jewelry

853
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,040
with the rouge?

854
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,680
I really want to do it.

855
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,080
What can you do?

856
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,160
I can do what men can do.

857
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,960
I can do great things.

858
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,160
Dashun,

859
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,440
you...

860
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,040
How do you feel?

861
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,120
I'm fine.

862
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
You're fine?

863
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,920
It's not good.

864
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,000
Dad,

865
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,360
I'm getting busy

866
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,640
after I go back to Beijing.

867
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,160
I'm afraid

868
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
some of my work

869
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,000
can't be done.

870
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Well,

871
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,360
can you let Shaohua

872
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,520
go with you?

873
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,760
What can she do?

874
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,920
She can do many things.

875
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,760
Look,

876
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,120
my father and I

877
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,680
are taken care of.

878
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,640
Besides,

879
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,720
my father and I

880
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,280
were busy in the store.

881
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,000
We had to do the housework

882
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,920
and the shopkeeper

883
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,360
and the waitress

884
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,360
were all taken care of by the landlord.

885
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,080
Shaohua went there

886
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,800
and saved a lot of money.

887
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,680
Well.

888
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,320
No.

889
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
I haven't learned

890
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
the rules of the house yet.

891
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
It's embarrassing

892
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,760
to go to Beijing.

893
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,480
If you can't,

894
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,600
then go with your family.

895
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,520
All of us?

896
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes.

897
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,600
All of us?

898
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,920
That's a big expense.

899
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,320
We planned to

900
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
go to Beijing with all of us.

901
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,560
This time,

902
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
we'll move there together.

903
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,560
It's good.

904
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,440
It's a good chance.

905
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,840
What chance?

906
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,440
What's wrong?

907
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
What chance?

908
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,760
Sanshou Gang

909
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,360
is in the hands of

910
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,680
Dashun and Shaohua.

911
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,760
They have a big track.

912
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,880
Do you think

913
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,160
they won't take revenge?

914
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,080
What should we do?

915
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,400
What should we do?

916
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,240
Now we can go to Pinglang Jing

917
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,360
but we can't go to Budongfeng.

918
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,800
If these bandits

919
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,640
find out anything

920
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,240
and come to us,

921
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
by then,

922
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,880
we'll be

923
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
doomed.

924
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,280
That's true.

925
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,000
Master, let's go.

926
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,520
Let's go

927
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,520
with the whole family.

928
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,600
What? Now?

929
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,720
You don't want to eat?

930
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,760
It's too soon.

931
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,040
You'll wake the snake up.

932
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,280
You need to be steady.

933
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,640
Sister-in-law,

934
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,120
are you going out?

935
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,480
Sister-in-law, where are you going?

936
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,640
I'm going to Beijing.

937
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,440
I can finally

938
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,720
see the world outside.

939
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,040
The past

940
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,640
is all in the past.

941
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,240
I'm going to Beijing.

942
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,120
I'll be back soon.

943
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,920
I'll be back soon.

944
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,720
I'll be back soon.

945
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,480
I'll be back soon.

946
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,280
I'll be back soon.

947
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
I'll be back soon.

948
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
I'll be back soon.

949
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
I'll be back soon.

950
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
I'll be back soon.

951
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
I'll be back soon.

952
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
I'll be back soon.

953
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
I'll be back soon.

954
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I'll be back soon.

955
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
I'll be back soon.

956
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I'll be back soon.

957
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
I'll be back soon.

958
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I'll be back soon.

959
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
I'll be back soon.

960
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
I'll be back soon.

961
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
I'll be back soon.

962
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
I'll be back soon.

963
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
I'll be back soon.

964
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
I'll be back soon.

965
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
I'll be back soon.

966
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
I'll be back soon.

967
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
I'll be back soon.

968
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Shaohua.

969
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
You're still alive.

970
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
I can hear your voice.

971
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,280
It's like a wish.

972
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,280
The photos we met.

973
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Are you okay?

974
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
There's a little bit of longing.

975
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Next year,

976
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
I'll be able to go to the same place.

977
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,280
I'll be able to go to the same place.

978
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,280
I'll be able to go to the same place.

979
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
I'm cold.

980
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
Why?

981
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
You've changed a little bit.

982
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I'm married.

983
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
His name is Dashun.

984
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
He's very kind to me.

985
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
That's good.

986
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,280
In ordinary times,

987
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
That's my comrade-in-arms,

988
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Lao Nie.

989
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
The day he committed suicide,

990
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
I saw him in his clothes.

991
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
I gave him my coat.

992
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
The bomb exploded in advance.

993
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
In that coat,

994
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,280
There's a star and a bill that says my name.

995
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Everyone thought it was me.

996
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
It's like this.

997
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
It's like this.

998
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
I'm going to Beijing.

999
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
I just want to ask him.

1000
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
Does he still have a mother-in-law in his eyes?

1001
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
If he doesn't know,

1002
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
I'll be the one who's going to ask him.

1003
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm going to ask him.

1004
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
Does he still have a mother-in-law in his eyes?

1005
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
If he doesn't strengthen his management skills,

1006
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,280
I've never seen such a wild wife in the whole Chen Village.

1007
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
This is not Beijing.

1008
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
If he enters Beijing one day,

1009
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,280
He won't be able to get out of the big building.

1010
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Sister-in-law is back.

1011
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
You're back.

1012
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
Where did you go?

1013
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Where did you go?

1014
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
You see, your hands are so cold.

1015
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
You said you went out for so long.

1016
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Why don't you wear more?

1017
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
What if you freeze yourself?

1018
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
My parents will definitely ask you later.

1019
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Don't say anything.

1020
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
You remember to give it to me.

1021
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Go.

1022
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
Come.

1023
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Mom, dad.

1024
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Dad, mom.

1025
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
You even know to come back.

1026
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Mom, dad.

1027
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
We all wronged Shao Hua.

1028
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
She didn't go back to her mother's house on her own.

1029
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
She helped me run her legs.

1030
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Didn't you ask me to sort out the accounts?

1031
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
I suddenly found that this treasure house

1032
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
had a problem with the account.

1033
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
But I can't walk away.

1034
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
My waist and legs are inconvenient.

1035
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,280
So I asked Shao Hua to help me run.

1036
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
I'm sorry.

1037
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
I'm sorry.

1038
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
I'm sorry.

1039
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Shao Hua helped me run.

1040
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,280
You dare not lie.

1041
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,280
No.

1042
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
I asked you where she went before.

1043
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Didn't you say you didn't know?

1044
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
I was up early in the morning

1045
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
and forgot about this.

1046
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
When Shao Hua came back just now

1047
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
and took the return order of the treasure house,

1048
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
I remembered this.

1049
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Look, dad.

1050
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
So this is really the case.

1051
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Okay, I know.

1052
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
Go out.

1053
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Wait.

1054
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Master, is this the end?

1055
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
Go to ask Lao Er.

1056
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Have you booked the car bank?

1057
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
What?

1058
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Go.

1059
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Dad, we'll go back to pack up.

1060
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Da Shun, wait a minute.

1061
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Shao Hua, you go.

1062
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Go.

1063
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Go.

1064
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Sister-in-law.

1065
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Try the soup I made.

1066
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
You made it?

1067
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
I cooked it according to your recipe.

1068
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
I don't know if it tastes good.

1069
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Sit down.

1070
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,280
How beautiful a couple is.

1071
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
This is a good thing.

1072
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
But everything has to be done in a certain way.

1073
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Too much oil is not enough.

1074
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
Understand?

1075
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Yes.

1076
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Shao Hua is capable.

1077
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,280
This is also the point I valued him at the beginning.

1078
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,280
But the capable person is too proud.

1079
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
As a man,

1080
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
it is a duty to love your wife.

1081
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
But to be able to marry her,

1082
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
this is your ability.

1083
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,280
I'm not willing to let her say winter is short.

1084
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,280
The eternal edge is looking at her.

1085
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
Day by day,

1086
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
I am close to her,

1087
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
night by night,

1088
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
I have regrets.

1089
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Day by day,

1090
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,280
I am not lonely anymore.

1091
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
The wind blows,

1092
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
the moon shines,

1093
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
and I am desperate.

1094
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,280
I will fight for you.

1095
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,280
The green green grass is green.

1096
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:24,280
The eternal edge in the heart.

1097
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
Day by day,

1098
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
I am close to her,

1099
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
night by night,

1100
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
I have regrets.

1101
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
Day by day,

1102
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,280
I am not lonely anymore.

1103
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,280
The wind blows,

1104
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,280
the moon shines,

1105
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,280
and I am desperate.

1106
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,280
I will fight for you.

1107
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,280
The green green grass is green.

1108
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,280
The eternal edge in the heart.

1109
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,280
The green green grass is green.

1110
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,280
The eternal edge in the heart.

1111
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,280
The green green grass is green.

1112
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:18,280
The eternal edge in the heart.
