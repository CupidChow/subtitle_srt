Timing & subitles brought to you by 中剧独播

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I heard the wind from the sky above the sea

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That is not the wind, that is not the wind

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the sharpness in my eyes

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not easy, then let's break it

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My bitter pain, my pain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I finally turn around

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the wildest night

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to break the world

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Be me

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Snow

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
White snow in the cold night

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Where is the end

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is the way to the sky or the abyss

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The person who is the specific person

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The light following

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,360
But the

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How to judge the heart

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If the heart is broken, where to find the answer

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Black night, white dust

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The moon is turning

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The fire in the heart

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Will be used to cry

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The wind is blowing

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mom, I can sing English songs

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mom, don't work too hard

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mom, I love you

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't kick my mom

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Mom

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Take the snow to France

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let her experience the most advanced scientific technology since childhood

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Feel more diverse civilization

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A world with a broader range

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I am the wildest night

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't want to break the world

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The world is not easy, then let's break it

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The person who is the specific person

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The light following

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But the heart is broken, where to find the answer

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Black night, white dust

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The moon is turning

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The fire in the heart

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Will be used to cry

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The wind is blowing

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The wind is blowing

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The dust of the night

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In the desert

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The wind is blowing

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The dust of the night

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
In the desert

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In the desert

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The wind is blowing

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is Shanghai

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's great

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Firework

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Firework

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Firework

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Firework

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Firework

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Firework

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Firework

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,760
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,480
Sister,

70
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,320
if you have no place to go,

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,200
you can go to the sand field with me.

72
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,680
Sand field?

73
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,280
The treasure sand field in Yangshupuru.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,480
My cousin works there.

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,320
She said if she did well,

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,200
she could get more than ten yuan a month.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,120
If she is not good at it,

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,560
she could get four or five yuan.

79
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,040
But I'm interested in finding my sister.

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,720
Okay, then.

81
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,960
Thank you.

82
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Goodbye.

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,120
Sister,

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,960
your sand field is ready.

85
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,560
Come to me if you want to.

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,280
Okay.

87
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Your letter.

88
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,560
It's from Shanghai.

89
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,920
It must be written by Erniu.

90
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,440
Senior Bai.

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,640
Erniu.

92
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,360
Erniu.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,840
What are you doing here?

94
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,560
I...

95
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,440
I want to find Erniu.

96
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,000
I know him.

97
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
Why do you want to find Erniu?

98
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,920
I have a sister.

99
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,720
She wrote me a letter before.

100
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,200
The address she wrote

101
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,120
is No. 89.

102
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,480
She said the one who works here

103
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,080
is called Erniu.

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,240
Why are you so happy?

105
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,840
I really don't understand

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
what you are talking about.

108
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm asking you

109
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,360
when did this happen?

110
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Four years ago.

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
Why did you

112
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,120
move out of the house

113
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,080
just now?

114
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,640
Just now...

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
I just moved in.

116
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Where are the previous tenants?

117
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,640
Where did they move to?

118
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,560
Do you know?

119
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,440
Wait a minute.

120
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
My mom is alive.

121
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,880
I fell asleep in Qin Zhengyue's dead body.

122
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
I just know it.

123
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
Em overwhelming.

124
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm so happy you are alive.

125
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,640
I know.

126
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,080
Good!

127
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,000
Mister Jin.

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,800
Please follow the number you have dialed.

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Boss.

130
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Mr. Wen, what do you want to eat today?

131
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,200
The same.

132
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,200
Okay.

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,800
Here.

134
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Slaughter and capture.

135
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,600
Your age?

136
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm twenty-two.

137
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,400
You're here at the right time.

138
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
You've been doing a lot of capture in the past two days.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,800
You're the best.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
I was able to get a job yesterday.

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't want people over forty.

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Don't say anything I ask you later.

143
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Listen to me.

144
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Come here.

145
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200

Line up.

150
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,000
Sit down.

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,600
Your age?

152
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm twenty-two.

153
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Manager Huang.

154
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Do you think it's enough?

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Almost.

156
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
What do you mean almost?

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Next one.

158
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Listen to me.

159
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
If there's not enough people,

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,400
the company will drive us out.

161
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Let the boss pay for it.

162
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,200
Yes.

163
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,600
We can't live well.

164
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,600
Don't worry.

165
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,200
Next one.

166
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,200
Look at my old man.

167
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Hurry up.

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,800

Line up.

172
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,800
No.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,400
Okay.

174
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Twenty-four.

175
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,000
This is the job recruitment.

176
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
The number is limited.

177
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Hurry up and line up.

178
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,200
Next one.

179
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,000
We're not allowed to do it.

180
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,600
Qingming.

181
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,400
Yes.

182
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,200
Thirty-three.

183
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Do you have any work experience?

184
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,200
Yes.

185
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Come on.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Hurry up.

187
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
We're in a big factory.

188
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,400
The food is good.

189
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Hurry up.

190
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,000

Name.

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,600
What's your name?

197
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Zhu Sha.

198
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,200
Age?

199
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Eighteen.

200
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Age?

201
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Luo Cuiying, Bingtiao Workshop.

202
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Do you have any work experience?

203
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,600
Yes.

204
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,600
I used to work in Qingdao Sand Factory.

205
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm also a Bingtiao.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,800
Then go to the Bingtiao Workshop directly.

207
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,200
Okay. Thank you.

208
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you.

209
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,600
Next one.

210
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,200
Thank you.

211
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,600
Okay.

212
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,200
Thank you.

213
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I've done.

214
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,200
Over there.

215
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Cuiying.

216
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm not eighteen.

217
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I know.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
But the older and younger

219
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,400
will be sent to the workshop to do the scissors.

220
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
It's a whole day.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,800
That's the most tiring.

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
But I've never been in Qingdao Sand Factory.

223
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,600
I know.

224
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
But I can go to the workshop by hand.

225
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,000
I can earn more.

226
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,400
But I have to work

227
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,800
and I can't do it.

228
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,600
It's okay.

229
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
I'll teach you.

230
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,400
Thank you, Cuiying.

231
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,000
Go.

232
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Go.

233
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Hurry up.

234
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
So noisy.

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Follow me.

236
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
The bell is our destiny.

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,800
When we get here,

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
we'll go to the workshop.

239
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
After he finishes the first round,

240
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
we can go to the workshop.

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Remember to take the sign last time.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
If you waste too much time,

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
you'll get hit.

244
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
We three will guard this machine.

245
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Life is not difficult.

246
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
We just have to be careful and fast.

247
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,400
Like this.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,200
Combine the cotton swabs together.

249
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
The cotton swabs after the combination

250
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
are the same in weight.

251
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Okay.

252
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
The fiber is also arranged neatly.

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,600
By the way,

254
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,600
at the beginning,

255
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,600
you'd better be slow.

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Slow is the most important.

257
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,800
You'll get hit.

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But if you make a mistake,

259
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
you'll get hit

260
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,800
and you'll deduct your salary.

261
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Do you often get hit

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
and deduct your salary here?

263
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,600
I'm used to it.

264
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
You three.

265
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,800
What are you doing?

266
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Do you want to go down and chat with you?

267
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Let's work.

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,200
Call me if you need anything.

269
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,000
Hurry up.

270
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
Wash your hands.

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,400
Don't rub it.

272
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,800
Oh!

273
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,580
Why does it sit in the toilet?

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,860
What does this have to do with me?

275
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,780
Life isn't so complicated

276
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,140
But what is fake?

277
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,980
Actually it's a fake

278
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,540
Give me a house

279
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,640
You cut any attached Car enduring

280
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
I'm here to see you

281
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
What?

282
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
No

283
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Go away

284
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Go away

285
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Forgive me

286
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
I'm here to see you

287
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
I can't let you go

288
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,640
I'm never lazy

289
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Get out

290
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
What are you looking at?

291
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Get to work

292
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Get to work

293
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,640
This is the usual meal

294
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Just get used to it

295
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
It's okay

296
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
This

297
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Looks good

298
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Embarrassed

299
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Don't look at them

300
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Don't look at them

301
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
I'll cook for you

302
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
You don't even know Brother Gui

303
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
He's new

304
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
I've never seen him

305
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Not bad

306
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Try it

307
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Be careful

308
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Sister

309
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
My name is Gui

310
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,640
I have to take care of everyone who comes

311
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,640
I'll take you to a small restaurant

312
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
You're skinny

313
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
You're skinny

314
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
How pitiful you are to eat this

315
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
I've thought about it

316
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
This Donger

317
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
They're from the Qing Gang

318
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
We can't afford to give them up

319
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Brother Gui

320
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
I've thought about it

321
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Eat

322
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Zhu

323
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
You haven't finished your meal yet

324
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I'm not as tired as yesterday

325
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
You two are so funny

326
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Little bastard, stop

327
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
You dare to hit me

328
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
I'll beat you to death today

329
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
I'll show you

330
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Stop

331
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
You stop

332
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Youzhou, don't run

333
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Did you see this little bastard?

334
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
I saw

335
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
I saw it

336
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I saw it

337
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
I saw it

338
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I saw it

339
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
I saw it

340
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
I saw it

341
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
I saw it

342
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
I saw it

343
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
I saw it

344
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
You hit my back and ran away

345
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Where did you run away?

346
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Over there

347
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Go

348
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Zhu is so awesome

349
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
The door is broken

350
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Can't close it

351
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I'll light it for you

352
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
A'Zhu

353
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
A'Zhu, come

354
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
You're late

355
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Only the upper floor is left

356
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
You sleep here

357
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I'll be opposite you

358
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Cuiying

359
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
How long have you been here?

360
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Two years

361
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,640
You've been living here for two years

362
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,640
It's better than living on the street

363
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
But this door is broken too

364
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
The window is broken

365
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
No one helps to fix it?

366
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
I'm used to it

367
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Why?

368
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
It can be changed

369
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
What?

370
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
When we first came here

371
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
They told us

372
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
we worked for twelve hours a day

373
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
But now

374
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,640
we work for more than twelve hours

375
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
We have to be beaten and deducted

376
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
And we have to be fired by those men

377
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Don't you think it's a little too much?

378
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
It's the life

379
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
We all live like this

380
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
What's wrong with it?

381
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
But we are human

382
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
We are not animals

383
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
Even if we are animals

384
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
The owner has to feed us

385
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Look what we eat

386
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Even if we are animals

387
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
The owner has to

388
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
have a shelter

389
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
to watch us sleep

390
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
The construction of the Shanghai construction site

391
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
is not good

392
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
It's not good

393
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
It's not good

394
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
The construction of the Shanghai construction site is like this

395
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
We can't be like this

396
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
because of the construction of the Shanghai construction site

397
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
We will die

398
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
But if we don't die

399
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
What better way can we have?

400
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Of course

401
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
We can all unite together

402
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
and talk to the construction site

403
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
about better conditions

404
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
What is unity?

405
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Unity is

406
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,640
we stand together

407
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
like a rope

408
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
We stand together

409
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
and think in one direction

410
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
and use the other direction

411
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Then you, me, him, him, him

412
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
We can all agree on the conditions

413
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
And then?

414
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Enough, it's late

415
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Go to sleep

416
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
We have to go to the morning work tomorrow

417
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Stop looking

418
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Go to sleep

419
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Go to sleep

420
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Slow down, slow down, kid

421
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
This way

422
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
This way

423
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Don't bully my mom

424
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
Let go of me

425
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Let go of me

426
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
I'm your uncle

427
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Let go

428
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Stop crying

429
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Stop crying

430
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Girls

431
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Miss me

432
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Miss me

433
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
I won

434
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Don't come over

435
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Do you want to see me?

436
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Don't come over

437
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
What are you doing?

438
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
What are you doing?

439
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Sister Liao

440
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Sister Liao

441
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Don't come over

442
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm coming

443
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Sister Liao

444
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Don't come over

445
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
Don't come over

446
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Sister Liao

447
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Don't come over

448
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Lie down

449
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Don't come over

450
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Let go

451
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Let go

452
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Let go

453
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Let go

454
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Don't shout

455
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Be careful

456
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
I'll kill you every day

457
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't come over

458
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Do you want to see me?

459
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
I'm not a beast

460
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Do you want to see me?

461
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
I'm not a beast

462
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
I'm not a beast

463
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Come on, don't talk

464
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Let go of her

465
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Brother

466
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Dare to slap me

467
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
You bitch

468
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Shameless

469
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
I won't look at you

470
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
I won't look at you

471
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
I won't look at you

472
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Hit them

473
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
You bitch

474
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
I won't look at you

475
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
I won't look at you

476
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Hit me

477
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
You bitch

478
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
You bitch

479
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,640
Stop fighting

480
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
I beg on you

481
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
I won't look at you

482
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
You bitch

483
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
I beg on you

484
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
Stop it!

485
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,840
Stop it!

486
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,040
Shuren lied to us!

487
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,640
You're still lying to us, you bitch!

488
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,840
I'll fight you!

489
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,640
You scared me!

490
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
We'll fight you!

491
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,440
You can't fight!

492
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,040
Stop it!

493
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,440
Stop it!

494
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,240
Stop it!

495
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,840
Stop it!

496
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,440
Stop it!

497
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,040
Beat him!

498
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,240
What's going on?

499
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,840
What are you doing?

500
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
What are you doing?

501
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,640
Stop it!

502
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,040
Get out of the way!

503
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,640
You're so ridiculous!

504
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,840
How dare you fight in the factory?

505
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
I'll fire you all!

506
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
They broke in and played tricks on us!

507
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,440
You... you... you little bitch!

508
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
She seduced me all day!

509
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,240
I don't care!

510
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,040
Look at you!

511
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Look at how you've beaten them!

512
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,640
It's your fault!

513
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,240
Everyone in the factory

514
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,840
will be deducted half of this month's salary!

515
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,840
They started it first!

516
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,040
I'll deduct whoever I want!

517
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,040
I'll deduct whatever I want!

518
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,640
If anyone dares to say another word,

519
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,040
I'll fire you!

520
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,440
Sleep!

521
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,640
Start working tomorrow!

522
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,440
Hurry up!

523
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,840
You little bitch!

524
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,040
Wait for me!

525
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Wait for me!

526
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,640
Let me wait!

527
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
Let's go!

528
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,240
Why?

529
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
How could this happen?

530
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
This is too much!

531
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
Old Zhong and Luo A'gui are on the same side!

532
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Sisters,

533
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,440
you saw it just now.

534
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,040
Luo A'gui was beaten so hard by us.

535
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
What does this mean?

536
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,640
It means that as long as we unite,

537
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,040
no one dares to bully us.

538
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,440
Luo A'gui can't do it.

539
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,640
Neither can Old Zhong!

540
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Right!

541
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,440
But we can't beat Old Zhong.

542
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,840
He can't deduct our salary!

543
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,440
No need.

544
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
We'll get out of the factory.

545
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,040
Get out of the factory?

546
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,240
From tomorrow,

547
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,040
we won't leave the factory!

548
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,440
But if we don't leave the factory,

549
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,840
we won't have money to get it.

550
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,640
If we don't leave the factory,

551
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,240
we'll be beaten by them.

552
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,040
We'll get out of the factory

553
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,640
to fight for the love of our country.

554
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,840
To fight for more salary,

555
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,240
better food,

556
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
and safer factories.

557
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,040
Can you agree?

558
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Boss will fire us.

559
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,240
Then we'll lose our jobs.

560
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,840
We'll have no money to live.

561
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,240
Trust me.

562
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Boss won't fire us.

563
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,440
Why?

564
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,240
Because they have a batch of goods

565
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
to deliver.

566
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,840
If we can't deliver them on time,

567
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,640
they'll lose money.

568
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,840
If they fire us now,

569
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,640
they won't find a way to get it.

570
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,040
We can't delay the supply.

571
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Right.

572
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
It'll take at least a week

573
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
to train a hand.

574
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,440
So they won't fire us now.

575
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,040
As long as we persist,

576
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
they'll agree to our conditions.

577
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,840
But the premise is

578
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,640
we must unite

579
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
and persist until the end.

580
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,440
We'll listen to Sister Zhu Sha.

581
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,640
Some time ago,

582
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,040
the workers of the first, second, and third mills

583
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,440
chose to quit the job

584
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,840
to increase their salary.

585
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
They persisted for 13 days.

586
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,240
In the end,

587
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,040
they agreed to their requirements.

588
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,840
So we can also follow their orders.

589
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,040
It's time to quit the job.

590
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Sister Zhu Sha,

591
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,040
I want to quit the job.

592
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,640
I don't want to be bullied by Lu A Gui.

593
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,240
I want to quit too.

594
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:38,040
I want to quit too.

595
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,820
Tongced flour

596
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,680
OhhDOH

597
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,640
Yea?

598
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,320
Tong Chuan

599
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,920
Tong Chuan

600
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,440
Tong Chuan

601
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,080
Tong Chuan

602
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,760
Tong Chuan

603
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Tong Chuan

604
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,400
Tong Chuan

605
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,560
Go over these bull coffee farmers around.

606
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,480
Go.

607
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,520
Where are they?

608
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,080
What are you doing?

609
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,160
Get back to work!

610
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,720
Zhong, from today on,

611
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,160
1056 female workers of Baoxing Sand Factory

612
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,280
will start working.

613
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm the representative of this job.

614
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,120
I'm going to talk about the conditions of the job.

615
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,440
Are you trying to rebel?

616
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,440
First,

617
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,120
take back your punishment last night

618
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,840
and don't deduct any salary of the female workers.

619
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,880
Second,

620
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,520
fire Lu A'gui,

621
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,760
Jiang Dachang,

622
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
Mao Wangcai,

623
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,440
and three Zhao's hooligans.

624
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,480
Third,

625
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,360
you can't work for more than 12 hours

626
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,320
in a day.

627
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,400
You can't increase the time at will.

628
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,680
Fourth,

629
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,480
you can't scold the female workers,

630
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,600
especially you.

631
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,320
Bullshit!

632
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,760
How can you

633
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,680
talk to me about the conditions?

634
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,120
Please listen to me carefully.

635
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
I won't repeat myself.

636
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,880
Fifth,

637
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,640
improve the living environment of the female workers,

638
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,680
including the safety of the workshop

639
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,800
and the quality of the food.

640
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,720
You have the right to

641
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,080
take the leave of the female workers.

642
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
Impossible!

643
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,040
If you want us to relinquish the job,

644
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,480
all the five conditions

645
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,720
must be met.

646
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,800
You can't be absent-minded.

647
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,040
We won't do it

648
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,480
until we reach our goal!

649
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,320
We won't do it until we reach our goal!

650
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,360
We won't do it until we reach our goal!

651
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,800
We won't do it until we reach our goal!

652
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,520
We won't do it until we reach our goal!

653
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
I'll kill you.

654
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,960
He must have gone to help.

655
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,720
Don't be afraid.

656
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,440
If they dare to fight with us,

657
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,240
we'll do as we discussed yesterday.

658
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,480
Are you ready?

659
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,120
We're ready.

660
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,080
Don't be angry.

661
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,640
Sisters,

662
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,960
let's fight.

663
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm warning you.

664
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,840
Get to work now.

665
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,640
Or I'll beat you to death.

666
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,840
Don't drink and eat.

667
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,920
I'll say it again.

668
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,240
Get back to the city.

669
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,960
Zhong,

670
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,080
you have more than 20 people in your hands.

671
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,200
But we have more than 1,000 people.

672
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,680
If you don't fight,

673
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,040
we'll never fight.

674
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,960
But if you dare to fight,

675
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,760
you know the consequences.

676
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,520
You...

677
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,280
You're wrong.

678
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,720
Don't mess around.

679
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,320
If you come back,

680
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,120
I'll...

681
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,560
I'll beat you to death.

682
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Keep your specks for a reason to each other.

683
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:52,560
Keep your specks for a reason to each other.

684
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,600
What do you want from me?

685
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,640
Keep your specks for a reason to each other.

686
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,920
Keep your specks for a reason to each other.

687
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,880
chief enemies.

688
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,120
Sister, don't run.

689
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,360
Keep your specks for a reason to each other.

690
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,720
You know, if someone gives aylais the goods,

691
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,320
I'll lose my sheep.

692
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,600
Boss,

693
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,120
don't be mad at me.

694
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,680
This is when Lao Zhou was recruited.

695
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,800
Enough.

696
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,040
Within two hours,

697
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,400
if you still can't help,

698
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,320
you're fired.

699
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,040
Understood, Boss.

700
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,000
Wait a bit longer. It's okay.

701
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,560
Come.

702
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,000
Lao Zhou is here again.

703
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
Sisters, you must be hungry.

704
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,960
It's time to eat.

705
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Today's food is very fragrant.

706
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
There are shredded pork,

707
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
meat slices,

708
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
and meat soup and rice.

709
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,560
As long as you agree to start working,

710
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,960
today's meat,

711
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
food,

712
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,960
and rice will be enough.

713
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Sisters,

714
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,560
don't be bribed by his meal.

715
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,960
As long as we hold on for two more days,

716
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,960
we can cook some meat in the future.

717
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
How fragrant it is!

718
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Can you smell it?

719
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Come, smell it.

720
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Sister, how fragrant it is!

721
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Look at this meat.

722
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
The meat is so thick.

723
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,960
One bite, one bite.

724
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Try it.

725
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Come, try it.

726
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
You...

727
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
If you don't agree to start working,

728
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
you will never be able to work.

729
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:45,960
We will never give up.

730
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
You...

731
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
You stole my rice bowl.

732
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Listen,

733
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
if you don't agree to our request,

734
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,960
we will not only steal your rice bowl,

735
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
but also destroy it.

736
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm sorry.

737
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Dear sisters,

738
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
I'm late.

739
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,960
I've made you suffer.

740
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,960
I just realized

741
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,960
that Lu A'gui is so bad.

742
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
But don't worry.

743
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,960
We will definitely punish him severely.

744
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
How about this?

745
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
You can resume your work first.

746
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
If there is anything,

747
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
we can discuss it later.

748
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
Manager Huang,

749
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,960
it's okay to let us resume our work.

750
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
We can do it anytime.

751
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,960
But the factory must first agree to our request.

752
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,960
That's easy to say.

753
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Miss Zhu, you've lost weight.

754
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Miss Zhu,

755
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
please come to my office.

756
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
We can talk slowly.

757
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
No need.

758
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
If you have anything to say,

759
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
you can say it in front of the sisters.

760
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Yes, yes, yes.

761
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
Okay, okay.

762
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
It's like this.

763
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
You can only ask the boss

764
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
to give you a heads-up.

765
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,960
But the boss is not in the factory these days.

766
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Look at this.

767
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
You can resume your work first.

768
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
In a few days,

769
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
I'll talk to the boss.

770
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Don't worry, okay?

771
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
We are not at ease.

772
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
This...

773
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
I'll use my personality to guarantee it.

774
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Manager Huang,

775
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
I'll use my personality to guarantee it too.

776
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
If you don't agree to our conditions,

777
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
we will never resume our work.

778
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,960
We will never resume our work.

779
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
We will never resume our work.

780
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
We will never resume our work.

781
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Go.

782
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
We will never resume our work.

783
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Move back.

784
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Go.

785
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Promise them.

786
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Promise them.

787
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
There's meat today.

788
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,960
Yes.

789
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I'm so happy.

790
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Sister Zhousha,

791
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
it's all because of you

792
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
that we can eat meat.

793
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
This first piece is for you.

794
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
You're welcome.

795
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Mei is right.

796
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
You have to eat more.

797
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Yes, you are a public official.

798
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Eat more.

799
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
No need.

800
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
That's enough.

801
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Yes, we have to thank you.

802
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Everyone, eat more.

803
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
You're so kind.

804
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
You're so kind.

805
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Yes.

806
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Delicious.

807
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Zhousha.

808
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Zhousha.

809
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
The manager wants you to go to his office.

810
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
It's okay.

811
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
Take care.

812
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,960
The manager just made a decision.

813
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
From today onwards,

814
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Baoxin Sand Factory

815
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
will no longer hire you.

816
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Later,

817
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
go to the financial department

818
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
and pay the salary.

819
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
You can leave.

820
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
I didn't expect you to be so impatient.

821
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
What are you talking about?

822
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
It's obvious that you didn't pass the test.

823
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Look for yourself.

824
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Don't think that you can get away

825
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
with everything if you fire me.

826
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
After going through this job,

827
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
those female workers

828
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
already know how to protect themselves.

829
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
But your previous plan

830
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
is already not working.

831
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Miss Zhousha,

832
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
before you left,

833
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
you didn't even tell me

834
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
that you were going to leave.

835
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
I'll give you a word before I leave.

836
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
If you don't want to leave,

837
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,960
you'll be the one who will suffer.

838
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Then I'll give you a word too.

839
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
If you want to make a living,

840
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
then treat those female workers

841
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
better.

842
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
How could you not pass the test?

843
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Except for Cuiying,

844
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
you're the best

845
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:21,000
in the whole Bingtiao

846
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
I'm not going to let you go.

847
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
I'm going to fire you.

848
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Then I'll hire someone else.

849
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Then...

850
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Then you're just going to leave?

851
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
What else can I do?

852
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm not the boss.

853
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Miss Zhousha,

854
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
I don't want you to go.

855
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Don't be so sad.

856
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Everyone is in Shanghai.

857
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
In the future,

858
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
we'll meet sooner or later.

859
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
I'm leaving.

860
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Zhousha.

861
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Cuiying,

862
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
you can't get used to it.

863
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
You must change.

864
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
As long as everyone is united,

865
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
there's nothing to be afraid of.

866
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
Then have you decided where to go?

867
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
I don't know either.

868
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
But I believe

869
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
I can find a place to be.

870
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
I also believe

871
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
my future will be better than now.

872
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
I'm leaving.

873
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Sisters,

874
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
see you later.

875
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Thank you.

876
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Thank you.

877
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Sister.

878
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Why are you here?

879
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
You quit.

880
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
I quit too.

881
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Why?

882
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Boss is too mean.

883
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Which factory is not like this?

884
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
But I don't believe

885
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
your reason.

886
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
I...

887
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
I'm afraid that

888
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
Luo A'gui and the others

889
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
will come to us again.

890
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
So I'm here waiting for you.

891
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
But even if they come to me,

892
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
what can a little devil do?

893
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm not a little devil.

894
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
I'm nine years old.

895
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
You're nine years old?

896
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
I'm a baby.

897
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Don't look down on me.

898
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
No, no.

899
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Let me ask you.

900
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Do you have a place to go now?

901
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
I don't have one.

902
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Then follow me.

903
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Where?

904
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
You'll know when you get there.

905
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Follow me.

906
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm leaving.

907
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
I'm leaving.

908
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
Azu found a job in a tobacco factory

909
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
a few days ago.

910
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
They're selling vegetables.

911
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
The house is empty.

912
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm sorry.

913
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,000
What are you laughing at?

914
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,600
We're almost there.

915
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,720
Monkey.

916
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,720
Monkey.

917
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,680
What's wrong?

918
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,600
Get up. Get up.

919
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,200
Water in the back.

920
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,960
Go. Go. Go.

921
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,840
You guys just hold on for now.

922
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,800
I'll find you a bed later.

923
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,120
Thank you.

924
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,200
For what?

925
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
Wang and I are friends.

926
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,400
I'm going back now.

927
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,520
I'll find you tomorrow.

928
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,680
Take care.

929
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,120
Sister.

930
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,480
I'll go find a grass suit.

931
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,960
It's so late. Where are you going?

932
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,280
Where did you find so many things?

933
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,960
I found them for my friends.

934
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,200
Do you have many friends here?

935
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,960
I grew up here.

936
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,240
Cheng Hui.

937
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
Where are your parents?

938
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,200
They died early.

939
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,320
Sister.

940
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,440
You sleep in the bed tonight.

941
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,400
I'll sleep here.

942
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,440
No.

943
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,680
You sleep in the bed.

944
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,720
I'll sleep here.

945
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,800
I'll sleep here.

946
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,840
I'll sleep here.

947
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,920
I'll sleep here.

948
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,960
I'll sleep here.

949
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,240
You sleep in the bed.

950
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,200
I'll sleep in the hall.

951
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,000
It's okay.

952
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,000
Just listen to me.

953
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,360
I'm used to it.

954
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,760
Sister.

955
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,560
I'm not drinking.

956
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,520
What are you doing?

957
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,920
I want to see how much money I have left.

958
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,720
It's enough to support us for a few days.

959
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,640
Let's make it clear first.

960
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,120
I don't want you.

961
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,240
The pen of hatred is looking at it again.

962
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,480
Day by day, night by night, there is regret.

963
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,760
Day by day, night by night, I'm not lonely anymore.

964
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,120
The light of despair breaks the distance.

965
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,360
I give up my life for you.

966
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,200
I want to reach eternity in my heart.

967
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,280
Day by day, night by night, there is regret.

968
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,360
Day by day, night by night, I'm not lonely anymore.

969
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,840
The light of despair breaks the distance.

970
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,120
I give up my life for you.

971
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,800
I give up my life for you.

972
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,080
I give up my life for you.
