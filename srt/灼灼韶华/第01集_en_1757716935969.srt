00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,500
The blade of the sword, this world is unbearable, so let's break it

3
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,000
My bitter pain, my pain, I finally turned around

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,500
I am me, the biggest night star

5
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,500
My world is unbearable, I will break through it

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Become me

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Wow, this year, the three-lilies mother can change into a couple

9
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Shang Huan, there are performers over there

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Let's go

11
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Boss Xia is here

12
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Who is this? Boss Xia, you know him?

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The one who is doing business in Xizhou is definitely Boss Xia

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If one day, I can be as great as Boss Xia, that would be great

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hello, Boss Xia

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Erniu

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Erniu

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The horse is awake

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Be careful

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Erniu

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Are you okay?

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Are you okay?

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you, thank you sister

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's okay

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll go

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll go

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Let me help you

30
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Thank you

31
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Thank you

32
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Thank you

33
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Thank you

34
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Thank you

35
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Thank you

36
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Thanks

37
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I'll pay first

38
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,880
Please send this goods to Tongfu

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,500
No, brother

40
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
We have a rule

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,000
We always pay all the money before we send it

42
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Don't worry

43
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
We are from the Kwantung Gang

44
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
We never send goods

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
It's not right

46
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,000
Fine

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,500
Okay

48
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Pay inside

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll pay after I see the store

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I've seen several stores

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Boss Tang's goods are good

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The price is fair

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,500
No

55
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,000
It's okay

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why are you hiding?

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are so bad-tempered

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's this?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Who are you scolding?

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm scolding you

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You are a bad-tempered woman

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How dare you disturb my business?

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Enough, enough

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You sell fake yellow flag, you have a reason?

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You are lying

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Look

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The pattern on the surface

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
is dyed with yellow dye

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Although the pattern is dyed with gold

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
it's not colored

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Look at the line

73
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
It's not cracked

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
You are from the Qizhou Gang

75
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Listen

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,000
We never make a fake

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,500
Yes

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
The Qizhou Gang can't do business with us

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
They are full of gossip

80
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
I'll kill you today

81
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,000
I...

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't, don't

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Boss Tang

84
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
You don't sell yellow flag

85
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
You sell the wooden flag

86
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
You sell the golden flag

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You sell the golden flag

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You sell the wooden flag

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Impossible

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Absolutely impossible

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll show you

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This, this, this

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You framed me again

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You framed me

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Madam

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to ask

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Did you see a girl

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
who is about the same height as me

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
wearing a rough dress?

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I didn't see

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You didn't see

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,760
Shaohua

105
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,000
Erniu

106
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
Where did you go?

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've been looking for you for a long time

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I was looking for you too

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,500
What happened to your face?

110
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Nothing

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Here

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Eat it. It's going to get cold

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I especially kept it for you

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What a pity

115
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Where did you get the money

116
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
to buy such an expensive food?

117
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Don't ask

118
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Eat it

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you have business?

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
You must have business

122
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,900
I'll tell you in two days.

123
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,700
I have something to do, too.

124
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,860
I'll tell you in two days.

125
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,260
You have something to do, too.

126
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,540
Brother.

127
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,660
Why did you enter so many yellow flags?

128
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,340
It's cheap.

129
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,940
What's going on?

130
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,940
The seller was in a hurry to go home.

131
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,140
He sold all of them to me.

132
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,660
I just finished making the spiritual eggs.

133
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,660
Did you pay for it?

134
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,100
I've already delivered the goods.

135
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,140
How can I not pay?

136
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,220
How can I not pay?

137
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,300
Is there a trap?

138
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,900
Don't buy fake goods.

139
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,820
I've checked all the goods

140
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,260
in person.

141
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,180
They're all real.

142
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,380
If you don't believe me,

143
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,300
take a look.

144
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,380
How is it?

145
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,020
Is it right?

146
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,460
But you...

147
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
You've made the spiritual eggs.

148
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,740
It's enough for one egg.

149
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,980
Why did you buy so many?

150
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,140
The seller said

151
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,740
if I could eat all the goods

152
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,100
he had,

153
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,700
he would give me 50 big eggs.

154
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,500
I thought about it.

155
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I can just take them all.

156
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,220
Four big eggs?

157
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,620
Where did you get so much money?

158
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,740
I've made some money

159
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,860
from our accounts.

160
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,380
It's good.

161
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,660
Then you've found

162
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,900
An Ke Tang's economy, right?

163
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,580
You're silly.

164
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,580
Our buyers and sellers

165
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,020
have made their own money.

166
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,100
Why should I

167
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,020
spend two hours

168
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,460
to pay An Ke Tang's people?

169
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,180
Besides,

170
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,620
even if I want to spend

171
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,660
money like this,

172
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,900
the seller may not be willing to...

173
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,140
What if An Ke Tang

174
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,420
makes a mistake?

175
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,780
The royal flag is here.

176
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,700
What else can happen?

177
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,820
You're still not telling the truth?

178
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,940
I...

179
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,260
I don't know.

180
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,700
You're the one who made the fake ones.

181
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,660
If I make a mistake,

182
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,620
I, Tang Youqi,

183
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,220
will be hit to death

184
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,220
when I go out.

185
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,860
Master,

186
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,740
Tang was wronged.

187
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,060
Our royal flags

188
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,140
were packed outside the Pass

189
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,260
before they were shipped to Qizhou.

190
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,700
There are our official seal on the sack.

191
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,740
Look.

192
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
The seal on the sack

193
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,940
is rough and rough.

194
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,860
It's obviously forged.

195
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,740
It's forged.

196
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,140
Did someone

197
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,540
transfer our royal flags?

198
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,220
Qizhou Gang.

199
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,820
Qizhou Gang.

200
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,140
Tang Youqi,

201
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,780
you're a chicken.

202
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,460
You sell fake goods.

203
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,740
Now all the merchants

204
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,140
are afraid of you.

205
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,220
If we don't do business for you,

206
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,780
what's the use of us?

207
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,260
You're a chicken.

208
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,180
You're the ones who did that.

209
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,500
You think I don't know?

210
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,900
Come on.

211
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,180
Play.

212
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
Kill them.

213
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,180
Kill them.

214
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,340
Beat them.

215
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,620
Beat them.

216
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,380
Who's so arrogant here?

217
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,900
Master.

218
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,980
Master.

219
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,500
Master.

220
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,340
Master.

221
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,780
It's Boss Xia.

222
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,060
Since Boss Xia is here,

223
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,900
I'll accompany Boss Xia

224
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,780
to settle the past accounts.

225
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,140
It seems that you

226
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,740
have some misunderstanding about me.

227
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,180
It's not you.

228
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,380
You transferred Tang's royal flags

229
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,020
and smashed our Guandong Gang's sign.

230
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,020
I didn't do that.

231
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,580
Who took it?

232
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,940
It seems to be the people of Qizhou Gang.

233
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,660
Why?

234
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,380
Why did you say that

235
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,620
you transferred the real royal flags

236
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,420
with fake royal flags?

237
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,660
How is that possible?

238
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,260
No.

239
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,460
Shaozhong was caught.

240
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,740
What should we do?

241
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,980
About the sale of fake royal flags in Guandong Gang,

242
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,020
you think

243
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,140
it's the people of Qizhou Gang who did it.

244
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,500
So,

245
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,140
I sent someone to release a message

246
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,740
that I want to charge a high price for the royal flags.

247
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,580
Look.

248
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,300
Chu is in trouble.

249
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,940
When we delivered the goods today,

250
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,220
he was in a bad state.

251
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,500
Boss Xia.

252
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,020
I spent 400 silver dollars to buy the royal flags.

253
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,140
Yes.

254
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,100
He didn't admit it.

255
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,140
I think

256
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,540
there are many doubts about it.

257
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,660
But anyway,

258
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,940
the name of Guandong Gang

259
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,380
and your third master Yang

260
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,300
are kept.

261
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,860
Today, the goods are all yours.

262
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,340
You can deal with them as you like.

263
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,220
Brother Meng.

264
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,740
Did you see my brother?

265
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,220
Your brother was tied up in the temple of the devil.

266
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,060
Go and have a look.

267
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,620
Okay.

268
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,580
It's real.

269
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,420
Yeah.

270
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,260
It's real.

271
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,420
Who sold it?

272
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,460
It's real.

273
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,580
Who sold it?

274
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,500
It's real.

275
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,420
It's real.

276
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,740
Move.

277
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,220
Stop it.

278
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,340
Stop it.

279
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,540
Stop it.

280
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,660
Stop it.

281
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,020
Shaohua.

282
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,660
Brother.

283
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,500
Help me.

284
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,100
What's going on?

285
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,660
The third master of Guandong Gang

286
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,540
wants to tie me up here

287
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
and punish me for three days.

288
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,900
Then he wants to execute me.

289
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,140
What?

290
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,100
Go and prove it to me.

291
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,340
I didn't take their royal flag.

292
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,220
If I knew it was a dirty word,

293
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,780
I wouldn't dare to buy it even if I were beaten to death.

294
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,580
Brother.

295
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,860
I will save you.

296
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,620
The third master doesn't want to see you.

297
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,260
Please go back.

298
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,340
I just want to say something for my brother.

299
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,860
What else can you say?

300
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,060
Your brother is a fake.

301
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,740
He is a criminal.

302
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,340
No.

303
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,020
There are royal flags in every house.

304
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,660
Why do you say my brother has royal flags

305
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,700
in your Guandong Gang?

306
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,580
Is it possible that the royal flags in your Guandong Gang

307
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,580
are engraved on it?

308
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,380
Although there are no engravings on the royal flags,

309
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,380
there are our Guandong Gang's

310
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,900
secret marks on the sack.

311
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,300
Get out of the way.

312
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,700
Who sold you the royal flags?

313
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,300
A boss named Huang from the northwest.

314
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,220
He...

315
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,140
He lives in the Yunlai Inn.

316
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,580
Boss Huang from the northwest?

317
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,420
He left early.

318
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,620
When did he leave?

319
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,980
He left for several days.

320
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,140
Who sent the royal flags?

321
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,740
He sent them to the carer.

322
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,060
What does the carer look like?

323
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,820
He has a mole on his mouth.

324
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,380
There is a mole on his chest.

325
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,260
The Chichun Hall?

326
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,780
Yes.

327
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,180
There are eight royal flags in total.

328
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,260
Yes.

329
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
There is such a thing.

330
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,220
Who hired you?

331
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,100
A boss named Huang.

332
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,860
Where is he?

333
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,900
I don't know.

334
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,460
I sent the goods and paid the bill.

335
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,020
I haven't seen him since then.

336
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,940
Where did the royal flags

337
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,020
get to the Chichun Hall?

338
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,460
It's far away.

339
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,180
From here to the south,

340
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,340
there is a village called Ma Liu.

341
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,820
There is a household in the east of the village.

342
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,140
It's there.

343
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,900
Boss Tang is here.

344
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,740
Is Master 3 up?

345
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,380
He's up early.

346
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,020
Hurry up.

347
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,820
Master 3.

348
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,420
You can't go in.

349
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,260
Master 3.

350
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,540
The person who transferred the royal flags

351
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,300
to the Guandong Gang

352
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,420
is definitely not Chu Chaozhong.

353
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,100
Where did you get this wild girl?

354
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,220
How dare you be so impudent in front of me?

355
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,260
Get out.

356
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,660
Let's go.

357
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,140
I...

358
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,300
They all said that Master 3

359
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,420
is good at naming his country

360
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,900
and he can name right and wrong.

361
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,620
I didn't expect you to be deceived by others.

362
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,540
Wait.

363
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,540
You are the one who sent the royal flags

364
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
to the Guandong Gang.

365
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,820
I'm Chu Chaozhong's sister,

366
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,060
Chu Chaohua.

367
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,980
I know you.

368
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,900
Master 3.

369
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,060
It's this woman

370
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,380
who said that I sold fake royal flags

371
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,300
and even hit people.

372
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,780
Thank you for recognizing me, Boss Tang.

373
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,900
You're welcome.

374
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,700
If Chu Chaozhong

375
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,180
really transferred the royal flags,

376
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,700
then as his sister,

377
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,820
shouldn't I

378
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,060
be rich and rich?

379
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,180
I exposed that Boss Tang's royal flags were fake.

380
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,860
Isn't that a warning for you?

381
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,660
Maybe you don't even know

382
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,140
that your brother did it.

383
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,780
If you talk too much,

384
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,700
it will ruin your brother's good deed.

385
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,540
It makes sense.

386
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,540
But I found

387
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,300
the place where the fake royal flags were made.

388
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,900
How did you find it?

389
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Although the western boss

390
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,340
who sold my brother's royal flags

391
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,820
is missing,

392
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,700
I found a 50-mile

393
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,660
out of the village

394
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:54,740
through the car service assistant of the car company.

395
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,780
There is a yard there.

396
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,460
The person who lives in that yard has left.

397
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,900
But there are some wooden sticks,

398
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,500
dye and tools left in the yard.

399
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,820
All of these can prove

400
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,340
that the yard is where the fake royal flags were made.

401
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,860
Your brother is a fake.

402
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,700
How can you not know where he made it?

403
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,060
You don't need a car service assistant to check it.

404
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,060
I asked the landlord of that yard.

405
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,820
He said the person who rented his yard

406
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,740
is a northwest person,

407
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,220
not Chu Chaozhong.

408
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,740
What if your brother hired a northwest person

409
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,580
to rent that little yard?

410
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,380
Okay.

411
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,300
Then how can you explain this?

412
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,100
What do you mean?

413
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,900
I found this in the yard.

414
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,020
It's a fake royal flag.

415
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,580
It's said that there is a secret mark

416
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,820
on the official flag of your Kwantung Gang.

417
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,660
There is also a secret mark on this flag.

418
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,620
At first glance,

419
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,460
it's a half of your secret mark.

420
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,180
But if you look closely,

421
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,660
you can see the end.

422
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,660
Third Master, look.

423
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,860
The secret mark on the flag is rough

424
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,940
and the one from the Tang family

425
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,580
should be made by the same person.

426
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,940
What's so strange about this?

427
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,260
Since your brother wants to make a fake royal flag,

428
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,100
the secret mark must be forged.

429
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,180
Since my brother wants to forge the secret mark,

430
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,420
he must first know

431
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,620
that there is a secret mark on the official flag of the Kwantung Gang.

432
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,300
Then why didn't he change the official flag

433
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,060
when he sold the royal flag?

434
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,580
Then...

435
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,700
Who knows?

436
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,700
Third Master Yang,

437
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,660
my brother indeed received the thief's seal.

438
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,140
But he did it unintentionally.

439
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,540
But if you think

440
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,300
he is the one who took the package of medicine,

441
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,980
then you let the real murderer go.

442
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,940
It's all the fault of that Mr. Huang.

443
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,020
If I see him again,

444
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,380
I can't forgive him.

445
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,020
It's a pity that my 400 silver dollars

446
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,060
are gone in vain.

447
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,100
Then just take it as a lesson.

448
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,260
In the future,

449
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,740
if there is a case of a cake falling from the sky,

450
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,820
we must keep an eye on it.

451
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,100
It's a good thing that we have a spring candy.

452
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,700
Let's make it little by little.

453
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,340
Let's fill the gap first.

454
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,180
Business will get better and better in the future.

455
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,500
Shaohua,

456
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,380
there is actually one more thing I want to tell you.

457
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,460
Brother! Brother!

458
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,060
What are you doing?

459
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,340
Brother! Brother!

460
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,460
What are you doing?

461
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,380
Shaohua!

462
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,140
What are you doing?

463
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,220
Don't move!

464
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,620
Let me go!

465
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,460
Why do you arrest me?

466
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,580
Let me go!

467
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,260
Let me go!

468
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,340
Go upstairs!

469
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
Let me go!

470
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,980
Shaohua!

471
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,780
Brother!

472
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,300
Brother!

473
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,380
Brother!

474
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,020
Didn't you say that

475
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,940
the Guangdong Gang agreed to let him go?

476
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,540
The one who caught him was the one who put the money in the bank.

477
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,300
He...

478
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,060
How did he get the money in the bank?

479
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,820
Brother,

480
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,140
he spent 400 silver dollars on those yellow flags.

481
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,700
The 360 silver dollars

482
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,620
were borrowed from the money.

483
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,620
The account period is half a month.

484
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,860
The interest is strong.

485
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,460
The account period of half a month

486
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,660
has been more than three days.

487
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,420
According to their rules,

488
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,780
if it's more than three days,

489
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,300
they will cut off one hand.

490
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,260
But don't worry.

491
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,700
I can talk about it.

492
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,540
They said that they could delay the three days.

493
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,180
But after three days,

494
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,460
they must pay the interest in full.

495
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,380
Plus the penalty,

496
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,820
there are 390 silver dollars in total.

497
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,340
They must send them there.

498
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,220
Otherwise,

499
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,900
they will cut off one hand and one foot of my brother.

500
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,500
Can he still live?

501
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,940
390 silver dollars!

502
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,140
Now, the most valuable thing in the family

503
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,300
is the land and this yard.

504
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,820
I've already gone to the bank.

505
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,780
Besides,

506
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,940
I've already opened the four-star hotel.

507
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,860
I think we can get more than 100 silver dollars

508
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,820
if we can get the land and this yard.

509
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,060
If my son can't live,

510
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,620
why should I live?

511
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,420
Mom,

512
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,820
take out all the money you've saved.

513
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,140
I don't have money.

514
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,900
No.

515
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,740
You still need to buy some jewelry.

516
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,620
It's not worth it.

517
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,420
Look at it.

518
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,140
No.

519
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,540
Stop pushing me.

520
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,620
If he really has money,

521
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,300
he will put it in this house.

522
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,820
What about you?

523
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,540
You don't have money?

524
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,420
What do you mean?

525
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,100
Let me see what else I can sell.

526
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,580
Sell Chichun Hall if you want to.

527
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,300
What?

528
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,820
I've heard from your brother.

529
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,500
Someone wants to sell 200 big sheep

530
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,100
to buy our brand.

531
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,900
Chichun Hall can't be sold.

532
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,740
If you don't sell it, your brother can't come back.

533
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,220
That's the brand

534
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,620
of the three generations of our family.

535
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,420
I'll see who dares to sell it.

536
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,420
No one is here.

537
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,820
What's the use of getting the brand?

538
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,980
Sell it.

539
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,540
As long as the wound can come back safely,

540
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,060
I don't care if it's real or not.

541
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,860
Sell it.

542
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,140
Sell it all.

543
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
I'll sell it tomorrow.

544
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,180
This is the recipe

545
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,420
of our Chu family's treasure, Wanling Pill.

546
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,620
I want to learn it.

547
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,340
But I want to

548
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,540
tell you something.

549
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,820
The sword of the sky

550
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,820
is strong enough to be used by a gentleman.

551
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,300
Grandpa, I'm a woman, not a gentleman.

552
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,740
You are a man of the country.

553
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,580
You are kind to people.

554
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,300
You are bright.

555
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,820
Everyone can be a gentleman.

556
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,940
Grandpa, I want to be a gentleman, too.

557
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,620
I want to do great things.

558
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,540
Chichun Hall.

559
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,540
Chichun Hall.

560
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,620
Uncle Wang, thank you.

561
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,980
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

562
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,340
You're welcome.

563
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,380
But I'm not good at it.

564
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,300
I can only help you a little.

565
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,300
I'm sorry.

566
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,820
Don't say that.

567
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,420
I'm so grateful

568
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,180
that you can help us.

569
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,620
Madam Chu.

570
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,860
Madam Chu, are you home?

571
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,340
Madam San.

572
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,980
I came to say something to you.

573
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
My grandson went to the pharmacy this morning.

574
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,180
Guess what?

575
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,100
He met the old master of Chen family.

576
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,900
He asked my grandson to say something to you.

577
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,980
He said he would bring the old master of Chen family

578
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,660
to visit you tomorrow.

579
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,300
Chen family?

580
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,460
Is...

581
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,020
Is he going to marry the old master of Chen family?

582
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,340
It's not him.

583
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,900
You should get ready.

584
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,260
Don't wait for him to come tomorrow.

585
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,140
There's nothing.

586
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,580
I'm going home to cook.

587
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,620
I know.

588
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,380
Take care, Madam San.

589
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,020
She said the old master of Chen family would come tomorrow.

590
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,180
Well...

591
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,460
Mom,

592
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,740
we have a solution.

593
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,860
What do you mean?

594
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,900
Think about it.

595
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,580
The Chen family will propose a marriage.

596
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,100
They have to give a wedding gift.

597
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
Do we have a solution?

598
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,820
If we can do that,

599
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,300
that would be great.

600
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,780
Yes.

601
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,420
But...

602
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,540
But the Chen family has not been in touch with us for years.

603
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,060
I heard from Shaohua that

604
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,740
they might have other plans.

605
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,860
No.

606
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,300
No matter what happens tomorrow,

607
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
we have to settle this marriage.

608
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,980
Look.

609
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,620
It's suitable.

610
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,180
It's so beautiful.

611
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,780
Come on.

612
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,180
Be good.

613
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,420
Sit down.

614
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,580
Sit down.

615
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
Come on.

616
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,420
This is the wedding gift

617
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,020
that the old master of Chen family gave to you.

618
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,660
I don't want it.

619
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,140
Come on.

620
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,980
Be good.

621
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,060
Be good.

622
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,260
It's so nice.

623
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,940
Put it on.

624
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,660
Mom,

625
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,220
go to the door and welcome Mr. Chen.

626
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,340
Okay.

627
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,740
Here.

628
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,540
My mom's lipstick.

629
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,700
Little Su.

630
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,140
What are you doing?

631
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,260
Don't put it on my face.

632
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,420
Be good.

633
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,980
Come on.

634
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Don't move.

635
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,260
Mrs. Chu.

636
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,340
We haven't seen each other for more than ten years.

637
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,260
Yes.

638
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,980
Didn't you say you would come to the wedding?

639
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,260
It's so early.

640
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,500
Today is a very important day.

641
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,180
We have to leave early.

642
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,300
Okay.

643
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,940
Mr. Chen,

644
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,140
this is Mrs. Chu.

645
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,220
Mrs. Chu.

646
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,420
Okay.

647
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,020
Please.

648
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,380
Please.

649
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,820
Let's go.

650
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,700
Come on.

651
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Shaohua.

652
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,820
Oh my god.

653
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,060
Why are you here?

654
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,260
What are you doing?

655
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,060
They are here.

656
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,500
Do you want them to see your face?

657
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,940
I'm telling you, Xu Shaohua.

658
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,820
You have to take Chen Danshui with you today.

659
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,700
Otherwise, your brother's hands and feet

660
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,860
will be lost.

661
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
Do you hear me?

662
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,740
Zhou Ying.

663
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
Hurry up.

664
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,020
Let's go.

665
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,100
They are here.

666
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,380
Let's go. Hurry up.

667
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,060
Is this Mr. Chen?

668
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,460
This...

669
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,020
Daughter-in-law.

670
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,220
Brother.

671
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,340
If I were you,

672
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,460
I would visit more shops

673
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,420
and pay more.

674
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,260
Mrs. Zhao.

675
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,020
Hello.

676
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,900
Zhou Ying.

677
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,700
Is this Mr. Chen?

678
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,660
Oh my god.

679
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,340
He is so talented.

680
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,500
Sister.

681
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,260
Mr. Chen.

682
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,820
Uncle Chen.

683
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,260
Uncle Chen.

684
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,780
Aunt.

685
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,540
Brother Chen.

686
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,220
No.

687
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,620
Shaohua.

688
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,300
Mrs. Chu.

689
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,180
Yes, Shaohua.

690
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,020
Why is the yellow so big?

691
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,980
Let me do it.

692
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,460
Give it to me.

693
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,780
Sit in the room, Uncle Chen.

694
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,140
Aunt.

695
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,220
OK.

696
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,060
Please.

697
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,420
Uncle Chen, please.

698
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,140
OK.

699
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,100
Mom.

700
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,940
Hurry up.

701
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,140
Sister, hurry up.

702
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,460
Sit down, Uncle Chen.

703
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,020
Sit down, Uncle Chen.

704
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,700
Sit down.

705
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,500
Sister.

706
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,140
I should have come to visit you earlier.

707
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,740
But...

708
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,180
The business is too busy these years.

709
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,500
Dachun and I

710
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,220
can't get rid of it.

711
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,180
It's been delayed

712
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,060
for a year.

713
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,860
It's OK, Uncle Chen.

714
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,300
Good things are not in the way.

715
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,700
Sister.

716
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm here today

717
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,220
for Dachun

718
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,220
and Miss Chu.

719
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,620
Yes, Uncle Chen.

720
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,220
Look.

721
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,340
Our Grandpa Guo and Shaohua

722
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,860
are not young anymore.

723
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,460
It's time to do it.

724
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,380
Well,

725
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,100
to be honest,

726
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,340
it was me and your

727
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,940
Mr. Chu

728
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,140
who said it.

729
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,220
Look.

730
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,420
Yes, Uncle Chen.

731
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,980
But, Uncle Chen, look.

732
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,260
You are a famous

733
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,500
and famous person

734
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,260
in this area.

735
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,980
Although I've never seen you before,

736
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,860
you are

737
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,500
a famous person.

738
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,140
You two

739
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,700
have said it together.

740
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,980
Even if it's a joke,

741
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,060
it's still a good joke.

742
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,420
Now,

743
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,460
it's a country of the people.

744
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,700
Young people

745
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,340
are also free and free.

746
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,340
They can't accept

747
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,700
the words of the beautiful girl

748
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,340
and the life of the parents.

749
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,860
Uncle Chen, listen to me.

750
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,340
Dachun must be satisfied

751
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,140
with Shaohua.

752
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,340
Right?

753
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,420
Grandpa Guo, are you satisfied?

754
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,740
Mom, look.

755
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,980
What is a good fate?

756
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,500
This is a good fate.

757
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,860
Grandpa Guo is satisfied with our Shaohua.

758
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,460
Yes.

759
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,260
Uncle, come on.

760
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,820
Have some tea.

761
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,340
To be honest, Uncle Chen,

762
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,380
many people came to us

763
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,380
to talk about it

764
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,580
a few years ago.

765
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,420
Back then,

766
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,500
the Chen family came to marry.

767
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,980
The master is

768
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,460
the Sheng Jing of the Chu family.

769
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,700
Now, the Chu family

770
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,100
is not as good as before.

771
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,300
But the Chen family

772
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,180
is developing day by day.

773
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,780
They said the Chen family

774
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,100
must come to regret.

775
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,940
I was so anxious with them.

776
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,940
You don't talk nonsense.

777
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,980
Uncle Chen is not that kind of person.

778
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,020
Uncle Chen, have some tea.

779
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,660
Grandpa Guo, have some tea.

780
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,500
Uncle Chen,

781
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,340
how about we

782
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,980
settle the matter today?

783
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,660
Mom, I checked the royal order.

784
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,780
May 18th and June 20th

785
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,540
are good days.

786
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,780
Mom.

787
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,380
This is a big deal.

788
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,660
Let's make a long-term plan.

789
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,540
Sister-in-law.

790
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,700
Uncle,

791
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,380
you've seen our Shaohua.

792
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,620
Grandpa Guo is so generous.

793
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,140
What's the point of making a long-term plan?

794
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,300
Really.

795
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,740
It's late.

796
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,260
Dachun and I

797
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,380
have to go back to business.

798
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,300
Let's stop here today.

799
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,940
No.

800
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,620
Uncle, the royal order

801
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,100
hasn't been made yet.

802
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,740
Let's make it another day.

803
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,500
Sister-in-law,

804
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,900
I'm leaving.

805
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,340
Dachun.

806
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:28,740
Dad.

807
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,660
Let's go.

808
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,900
No.

809
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,980
Uncle Chen.

810
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,820
Aunt Chu, I'm leaving.

811
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,580
Chen Zhi.

812
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,660
Uncle Chen.

813
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,940
Mom.

814
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,460
Uncle Chen.

815
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,220
Young Mistress.

816
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,740
You're pregnant. Don't see me off.

817
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,300
No.

818
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,180
Uncle Chen.

819
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,940
Listen to me.

820
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,420
No.

821
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,940
Uncle Chen.

822
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,980
Stay.

823
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,460
Uncle Chen.

824
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,780
Listen to me.

825
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,420
I'm leaving.

826
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,540
No need.

827
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,700
I mean

828
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
you understand.

829
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,460
I understand what you mean.

830
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,620
Let's

831
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,740
settle the matter

832
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,540
later,

833
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,100
OK?

834
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,260
I have no time to settle it.

835
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,940
Uncle, I mean

836
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,540
Grandpa Guo is here.

837
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,700
Let's settle the matter.

838
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,540
Young Mistress.

839
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,340
You said

840
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,140
the matter is not urgent.

841
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,020
If it's settled,

842
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,700
it won't be urgent for a few days.

843
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,660
If it's not,

844
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,340
it'll be even more urgent.

845
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,620
See you.

846
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,580
No.

847
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,900
Uncle Chen.

848
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,060
Grandpa Guo.

849
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,460
Uncle Chen.

850
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,020
Shaohua, come out and see me off.

851
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,300
Grandpa Guo and Uncle Chen are leaving.

852
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,820
Shaohua.

853
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,100
Uncle Chen.

854
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,580
Shaohua.

855
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,820
Chu Shaohua, come out.

856
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,020
Chu Shaohua.

857
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,900
What on earth did you say?

858
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,420
Chen family is not getting married.

859
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,180
They don't want your daughter.

860
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,580
Shaozhong is gone.

861
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,620
Chu Shaohua.

862
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,660
What should I do with Shaozhong?

863
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,340
Come out.

864
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Chu Shaohua.

865
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,260
They are all here.

866
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,700
Why did you

867
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,140
come out?

868
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,540
Why didn't you say hello?

869
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,340
You want to

870
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,580
ruin their marriage, right?

871
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,540
I don't want to marry Chen Dashun.

872
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,340
If you don't marry him, your brother will die.

873
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,660
They don't want to marry me.

874
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,220
No.

875
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,940
My god.

876
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,260
My god.

877
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,900
Fine.

878
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,540
Even if you don't want to marry your brother,

879
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,340
think for yourself, okay?

880
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,660
Chu Shaohua, let me tell you.

881
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,860
You are so handsome

882
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,140
that you can be a part of Chen family.

883
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,860
You are so handsome.

884
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,060
What are you doing?

885
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,180
You don't want to marry him, right?

886
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
You are living in this house.

887
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,260
You are eating the food of the house.

888
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,900
You are so cruel to your brother.

889
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,980
You are so cruel.

890
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,900
You always think about your sister.

891
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,300
Now your brother is in such a big trouble.

892
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,020
You are so cruel.

893
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,380
Take it.

894
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,980
Buy whatever you want.

895
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,460
No, brother.

896
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,300
Take it.

897
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,180
Don't tell your sister-in-law.

898
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,500
You are so eager to force your brother to die.

899
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,780
If there are two or three wars in the country,

900
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:18,500
what should I do with my baby?

901
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,300
Mom.

902
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,780
My daughter.

903
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,260
Is it so selfish?

904
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,020
Shaohua.

905
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,220
I beg you.

906
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,980
You have to help your brother.

907
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,020
He has loved you since he was a child.

908
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,780
You can't just let him die.

909
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,500
You have to help him.

910
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,780
I beg you.

911
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:46,940
I will never come back.

912
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,420
Dad.

913
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,620
You recognize the fake yellow flag in the key.

914
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,020
The girl who saved us from great loss.

915
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,460
It's Shaohua.

916
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
Are you sure?

917
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,660
I remember her clearly.

918
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:18,940
Send some shoes back.

919
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,300
Dad.

920
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,820
What about my marriage with Shaohua?

921
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,100
Continue to drag.

922
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,500
If we can drag for a year and a half,

923
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,500
they will definitely come after us to cancel the marriage.

924
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,540
I think Shaohua is pretty good.

925
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,260
I didn't say Shaohua is bad.

926
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,420
Even if Shaohua has some points to be taken,

927
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,740
but what her family looks like,

928
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,980
you can see it with your own eyes.

929
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,820
If you marry her,

930
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,500
there will be trouble in the future.

931
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,300
It's better to cut the horse quickly,

932
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,900
so as not to be dragged in the future.

933
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,740
Dad.

934
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,620
Why did you come to us?

935
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,100
I ran from the village to the road.

936
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,180
Miss Gu.

937
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,180
Anything else?

938
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Uncle Chen.

939
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,220
I'm here to return this to you.

940
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,060
Our family's marriage

941
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,540
will be a father from now on.

942
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,060
No.

943
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,980
It's a good marriage.

944
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,940
Why do you say it's a father?

945
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,100
Miss Chu.

946
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,060
Have you thought it over?

947
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
Since we got married,

948
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,780
we have been very careful about the family.

949
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,940
Now,

950
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,700
no matter what our family looks like,

951
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,380
it's all in front of us.

952
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,740
It's not a ceremony.

953
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,620
I know.

954
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,700
This is a human nature.

955
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,780
Besides,

956
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,020
if I really marry Chen family as a wife,

957
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,060
you will definitely have a problem.

958
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,260
So I'd rather be a father.

959
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,900
What about your mother and your sister-in-law?

960
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,220
They are them.

961
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,300
I'm me.

962
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,740
Even if my father is there,

963
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,420
I can deal with him as I want.

964
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,500
Dad.

965
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,620
I told you.

966
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,780
Hua is much more handsome than her family.

967
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,340
OK.

968
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,540
Since you've thought it over,

969
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,380
I'll help you.

970
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,620
Dad.

971
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,060
From now on,

972
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,780
you and Shun

973
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,300
are husband and wife.

974
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,700
I don't want to do it anymore.

975
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,300
Dad.

976
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,660
That's great.

977
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,500
Uncle Chen, Brother Chen.

978
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,540
I'll go now.

979
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,660
You can go back slowly.

980
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,180
I'm leaving.

981
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,460
Hua.

982
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,140
Hua.

983
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,940
Dad.

984
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,260
What are you doing, dad?

985
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,380
Dad.

986
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,380
By the way, Uncle Chen.

987
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,060
Although we can cancel the marriage today,

988
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,060
if my brother and sister-in-law

989
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,100
know about it,

990
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,140
they will definitely make some unresolved demands.

991
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,260
You don't have to mind it.

992
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,180
I'll take the initiative to cancel the marriage.

993
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,860
Well,

994
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,860
you don't have to pay compensation.

995
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,700
It's already a lot.

996
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,100
If they still don't stop,

997
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,860
please find someone to give me a message.

998
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,020
I'll figure out a way

999
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,300
to get them to stop thinking about it.

1000
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,260
Kid.

1001
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,340
I can have some money

1002
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,780
to help you.

1003
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,540
Please, dad.

1004
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,300
My father lost the family

1005
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,900
because

1006
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,700
it was too easy for him to come here.

1007
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,460
My brother got into trouble

1008
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
because he always thought

1009
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,340
that he could get a good chance.

1010
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,300
So I couldn't

1011
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,340
take the credit

1012
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,020
and do nothing.

1013
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,340
Dad, look.

1014
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,220
You're really tough.

1015
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,620
But...

1016
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,020
But what?

1017
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,060
Uncle Chen,

1018
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,340
if you really can remember

1019
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,260
the love you showed me

1020
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,580
to my grandfather

1021
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,340
and are willing to help me,

1022
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,140
can you do something for me?

1023
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,620
You're a little girl.

1024
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,060
What can you do?

1025
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,660
I'll plan.

1026
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,940
I'll count.

1027
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,780
I can also write.

1028
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,820
I know a little

1029
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,060
about medicine.

1030
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,860
Miss Chu,

1031
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,380
your family

1032
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,020
has decided

1033
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,140
to marry you.

1034
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,420
Go back and tell your mother.

1035
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,740
May 18th.

1036
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,980
It's a good day.

1037
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,140
Uncle Chen,

1038
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,100
why don't you think about it again?

1039
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,700
I've thought about it.

1040
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Go back.

1041
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,540
Don't let your mother worry.

1042
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,380
Daxun, let's go.

1043
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,220
Go back.

1044
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,420
I'm so happy.

1045
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,900
Yes, mom.

1046
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,540
It's been a long time

1047
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,660
since Xiao Zhong came back safely.

1048
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,460
Let's celebrate it.

1049
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,420
Tomorrow, we'll

1050
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,740
buy a piece of meat on the market.

1051
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,380
How much is it?

1052
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,300
Mom,

1053
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,620
look at what Xiao Zhong ate.

1054
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,740
Mom,

1055
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,380
I have to eat some meat to replenish.

1056
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,940
I've saved a lot of money.

1057
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,020
Okay.

1058
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,620
Okay.

1059
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,940
Shaohua,

1060
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,820
it's so late.

1061
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,060
Why are you still awake?

1062
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,540
Let's go.

1063
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,180
Where are you going?

1064
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,140
Beijing.

1065
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,380
Beijing?

1066
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,180
You always tell me

1067
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,340
Beijing is good here

1068
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,700
and Beijing is good there.

1069
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,180
I can finally go there.

1070
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,940
Beijing is big.

1071
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,060
You're going alone?

1072
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,660
Who else?

1073
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,180
Xiao Wu.

1074
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,940
Who is Xiao Wu?

1075
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,580
Her family is in Daxing Village.

1076
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,500
She worked at the first-class waist dress shop.

1077
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,420
So she suddenly disappeared

1078
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,820
in the waist dress shop that day.

1079
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,700
Actually, she went to see him.

1080
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,420
How long have you two been together?

1081
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,980
A month.

1082
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,180
Only a month?

1083
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,300
You dare to go with her in a month?

1084
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,860
She's nice to me.

1085
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,500
No.

1086
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,060
Erniu, you can't go.

1087
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,780
Why?

1088
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,660
What if she betrays you?

1089
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,500
Shaohua,

1090
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,100
in this world,

1091
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,060
you're the best person for me.

1092
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,300
And it's Xiao Wu.

1093
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,180
She won't betray me.

1094
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,060
I still think

1095
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,980
it's too risky for you to do this.

1096
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,380
Even if it's risky,

1097
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,260
I'll leave.

1098
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,340
Shaohua, you told me

1099
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,940
you're afraid of being trapped here forever.

1100
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,740
Actually, I'm afraid too.

1101
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,660
If I stay here any longer,

1102
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,220
I'll be beaten to death by my father.

1103
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,380
Otherwise, I'll be sold

1104
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,260
to be a housekeeper for my father.

1105
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,660
It's my only chance

1106
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,940
to leave with Xiao Wu.

1107
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,620
I'm leaving.

1108
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,860
Erniu.

1109
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,260
Xinlong is here.

1110
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,340
Xinlong is here.

1111
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,620
Xinlong is here.

1112
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,260
Xinlong is here.

1113
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,100
Xinlong is here.

1114
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:46,100
Dr. Han,

1115
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:56,900
Doctor.

1116
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,500
How much is theytes?

1117
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,860
You are bandits or bandits?

1118
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,860
We are not bandits.

1119
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,660
Shaohua,

1120
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,260
you are smart and brave.

1121
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,860
As long as you are willing to go out,

1122
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,260
you can do great things.

1123
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,060
When I come back,

1124
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,860
I'll show you the world outside.

1125
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,860
Okay?

1126
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,460
Okay.

1127
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
It's a deal.

1128
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,660
It's a deal.

1129
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,660
Wait for me.

1130
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,860
The season is changing.

1131
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,060
Shaohua,

1132
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,060
it's time to go to the battle.

1133
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,860
The road is full of mistakes.

1134
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,660
Let me tell you.

1135
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,660
I heard that Mr. Xia is a revolutionary.

1136
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,660
Revolutionary?

1137
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,460
He killed a first-class maid

1138
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,260
by throwing a bomb.

1139
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,660
But he accidentally killed himself.

1140
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,660
He said he was blinded by blood.

1141
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,860
But my heart

1142
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,860
won't close the door.

1143
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,860
I went through all the hardships

1144
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,660
but I didn't give up.

1145
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,460
I'll light up

1146
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,460
the bright future

1147
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,460
forever.

1148
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,860
The little peony

1149
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,460
lying on the snow,

1150
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:15,460
melting a little bit.

1151
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,860
The snow is so lovely.

1152
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,860
It's the eyes in your heart.

1153
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,660
The little wind

1154
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,060
is so sweet.

1155
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,060
The little peony

1156
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,660
hiding in his heart

1157
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:41,660
is warming his heart.

1158
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,860
He is saying that he is not willing to part with you.

1159
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,260
He said winter is short.

1160
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,860
The eternal love

1161
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,260
is calling him.

1162
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,460
Day by day,

1163
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,060
night by night,

1164
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,660
there is regret.

1165
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,860
Day by day,

1166
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,460
night by night,

1167
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,660
he is not lonely anymore.

1168
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,060
The wind blows away the hope and lights up the despair.

1169
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,260
I'll fight for you.

1170
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,060
I'll fight with all my might

1171
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:23,860
for the eternal love in my heart.

1172
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,060
Day by day,

1173
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,060
night by night,

1174
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,460
there is regret.

1175
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,460
Day by day,

1176
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,460
night by night,

1177
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,460
he is not lonely anymore.

1178
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:50,060
The wind blows away the hope and lights up the despair.

1179
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,060
I'll fight for you.

1180
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,460
I'll fight with all my might for the eternal love in my heart.

1181
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,460
Day by day,

1182
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,460
night by night,

1183
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,060
there is regret.

1184
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,260
I'll fight for you.

1185
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:17,460
I'll fight with all my might for the eternal love in my heart.
