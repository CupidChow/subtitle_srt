2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I heard the wind from the sky above the sea

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That is not the wind, that is not the wind

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the sharpness in my eyes

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not easy, then let's break it

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My bitter pain, my pain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I finally turn around

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the wildest night

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to break the world

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is the one for me

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the eyes of many people, we are always the lower class

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No matter what we do, they will look down on us

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Fortunately, we don't have to care about them

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We are happy

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I don't want you to be digested by others because of me

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you laugh at me behind my back, I will pretend not to hear

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you laugh at me in person, I will kill her

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Laomu

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There has never been a man who treated me like this

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There has never been a woman who made me so relaxed

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I will not let you down

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will not let you down

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No matter what happens in the future, I will recognize you

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bingxin, as long as you are by my side

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will be better and better

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Believe me

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No matter what happens in the future, I will be better and better

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I came to see you

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How is it going?

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All is ready

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How about this

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I go with you

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I will announce to them that Bai Bingxin is my Mu Ziru's woman

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I believe the reporters will be a little scared

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
Today's stage should only belong to her.

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
She is Bai Pingxin,

46
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,960
not anyone's woman.

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
What she should get today

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,080
is everyone's understanding and respect,

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,040
not for others.

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,120
It's almost time.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
It's time to go.

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,520
You are the most beautiful and the strongest.

53
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,280
Miss Bai is here.

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,800
Coming.

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,040
Coming.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,160
I am Bai Pingxin.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,240
Many years ago,

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
when I was still at home,

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
my name was Kang Erniu.

60
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,880
Other than that,

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
I do have another name.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,440
Lu Ningxiang.

63
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,040
I am Lu Ningxiang.

64
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,400
Lu Ningxiang.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,880
When I was still Kang Erniu,

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,080
I fell in love with a man.

67
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,400
Although he didn't have much money,

68
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,200
as long as I could be with him,

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,200
even if it was for the rest of my life,

70
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,440
I would be willing to.

71
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
Later,

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
I went to Beijing with him.

73
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,400
I gave myself to him.

74
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,280
But in order to pay off his gambling debt,

75
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,560
he sold me to Linfang Restaurant,

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,400
which is a brothel.

77
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,720
There,

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,360
I had Lu Ningxiang.

79
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
The name of the brothel.

80
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,120
When I was desperate

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
and dying,

82
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,480
a friend of mine saved me.

83
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,360
Under his help,

84
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,640
I escaped from Linfang Restaurant

85
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,960
and hid my name.

86
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I came to Shanghai.

87
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,400
Gradually,

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,360
I became the Bai Bingxin I am today.

89
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,760
That's all

90
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,840
for my experience.

91
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,320
Miss Bai,

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,920
do you know what it means

93
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
to admit that you were a prostitute?

94
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,320
I know.

95
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,040
But I think

96
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,400
if I can use my experience

97
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,680
to make more people

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,560
pay attention to the women who were swallowed by the dark forces,

99
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,160
and exchange for the conscience of society,

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,520
even if I lose my reputation

101
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,680
and become a prostitute,

102
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,360
I will lose everything.

103
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,800
I think it's worth it.

104
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
Miss Bai, I admire you.

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,560
Miss Bai,

106
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,120
is the man who cheated you

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Xiao Wu?

108
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,960
Yes.

109
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,160
When he sold you to the brothel,

110
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,640
why didn't you commit suicide

111
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
and prove your innocence?

112
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
May I ask which newspaper you are from?

113
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,600
The Little Phoenix, Lai Zhiming.

114
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,400
The fifth and important reporter

115
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
is Lai Zhiming from the Little Phoenix.

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,320
This person

117
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,280
is always very strict.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
But we can

119
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,840
use our own strength

120
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,600
to fight back.

121
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,320
Hello, reporter Lai.

122
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,600
I read an article about you

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,680
about when you were a kid.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In the private library,

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,280
a classmate lost money.

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
At that time,

127
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,200
your family was the poorest.

128
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,400
Everyone thought

129
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,880
you stole the money.

130
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,040
This article

131
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
is about you.

132
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
You stole the money.

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,440
You were hurt by this.

134
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,440
I want to ask reporter Lai,

135
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,680
why didn't you jump into the river

136
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,840
and prove your innocence?

137
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,480
Because I didn't steal money.

138
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,440
If I jumped into the river,

139
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,640
wouldn't I die?

140
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,800
What did I do wrong?

141
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
You died because you wanted to die.

142
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,520
Is Miss Bai's death

143
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,680
what you deserve?

144
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
That's right.

145
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,520
That's right.

146
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
That's right.

147
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,440
Miss Bai,

148
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,600
may I ask you

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,960
what you said to Xiao Wu

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and what you think?

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
There will be a reporter

152
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,640
asking you

153
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,320
how you think about what Xiao Wu said.

154
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,320
I think you can answer like this.

155
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,560
What did Xiao Wu say?

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm not interested.

157
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,720
But there's one thing

158
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
I really don't understand.

159
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,560
A bad person like Xiao Wu

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
who lost everything.

161
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
Why didn't he get sued?

162
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,520
Why didn't he get punished?

163
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,440
He can even

164
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,520
be interviewed

165
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,800
like a celebrity.

166
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
I don't understand.

167
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,360
Is this a natural law?

168
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,400
Bai Bing Xin,

169
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,040
you're a prostitute.

170
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,240
You're even showing up everywhere

171
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,160
and making films.

172
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,440
Don't you feel ashamed?

173
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,120
Among all the reporters,

174
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,840
the top one is the Haisang newspaper.

175
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
You're a reporter from Haisang, right?

176
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
During this period,

177
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,440
you've been interviewing Xiao Wu,

178
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
prostitutes,

179
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,120
old ladies,

180
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
and pious guests.

181
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,240
You've also made up

182
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,960
a lot of

183
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,440
bad stories about me.

184
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
You're good at everything.

185
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,440
You're doing this for your own interests.

186
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
The one who has a good reputation

187
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,960
is me

188
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,000
or someone like you?

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
Bai Bing Xin, shut up!

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,840
Sit down!

191
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,880
Exactly.

192
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,480
Someone like you

193
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,960
doesn't deserve to be a reporter.

194
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,160
Who are you?

195
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
You're shameless.

196
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,920
Shameless.

197
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,040
Xia Sun.

198
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm Sun Longyin, a reporter from Xintian News.

199
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,880
Let me say something.

200
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,120
I think Miss Bai's past

201
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,720
is not her fault.

202
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,360
After she has been through darkness,

203
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
she didn't choose to give up on herself.

204
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
Instead, she's been working hard

205
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,160
and doing everything she can

206
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,440
to bring us

207
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,160
so many beautiful images.

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,360
In my opinion,

209
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Miss Bai

210
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
is a strong,

211
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,480
beautiful,

212
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,240
kind and great woman.

213
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,040
Good.

214
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,720
Good.

215
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,360
Good.

216
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,040
Good.

217
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,880
Good.

218
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,360
Dear journalists,

219
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,320
we have a new news

220
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,680
about Miss Bai Bing Xin

221
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,280
to announce.

222
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,120
Please welcome the representative of the Bureau.

223
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,320
I, on behalf of the Bureau, announce

224
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,040
that the Bureau officially invites

225
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,200
Miss Bai Bing Xin

226
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
to be the representative of our new ice cream.

227
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,440
Good.

228
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,160
Good.

229
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,960
Good.

230
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,040
May I ask,

231
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,400
what is the reason

232
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,200
for the Bureau

233
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,320
to let Miss Bai Bing Xin be the representative?

234
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
You asked a good question.

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,800
First of all,

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,440
Miss Bai Bing Xin's name

237
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
and ice cream are very close.

238
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,320
Second,

239
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,000
Miss Bai Bing Xin's appearance is not ordinary

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,080
and elegant.

241
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,200
She is also very compatible

242
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,120
with the high-end position of ice cream.

243
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,440
Most importantly,

244
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,760
Miss Bai Bing Xin

245
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
is a kind and kind girl.

246
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
She is a high-quality girl.

247
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,720
All the employees of the Bureau

248
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,800
admire her.

249
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,560
So,

250
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,760
we express our support

251
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,120
to Miss Bai Bing Xin in this way.

252
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,120
Thank you.

253
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,040
Good.

254
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,200
On behalf of the Newspaper,

255
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,840
I, on behalf of all the journalists,

256
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
support Miss Bai Bing Xin

257
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,440
to fight against the vicious flow

258
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,600
of Xiaowu.

259
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,360
Good.

260
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,400
We are the Big Seller.

261
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
On behalf of the Big Seller,

262
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,280
I announce that

263
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,560
we will fight for justice.

264
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,000
Good.

265
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,680
Miss Bai,

266
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,520
you don't have to be afraid of them.

267
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,440
We support you.

268
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,120
Yes.

269
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,920
We support you.

270
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,800
We support you.

271
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,680
We support you.

272
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
Thank you.

273
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,200
I want to thank you all.

274
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,720
Before today,

275
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,640
I was afraid

276
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,000
to be found by Xiaowu

277
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,680
every day.

278
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,120
I was afraid that I would be recognized

279
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
by the old and the poor.

280
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,760
But what I was worried about

281
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,720
still happened.

282
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm not afraid of everyone's jokes.

283
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,480
A few days ago,

284
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,280
I wanted to die.

285
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,280
Because I was poisoned to death.

286
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,400
I wanted to die.

287
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,080
I really don't know

288
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,280
how to escape.

289
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
But today,

290
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,240
it's really different.

291
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,560
Thank you.

292
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,280
Good.

293
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
Because of everyone's support,

294
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,680
because of you,

295
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not the kind of girl

296
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,240
who is bullied

297
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,720
and bullied by others.

298
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,160
I'm not that kind of girl.

299
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm bullied by others.

300
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,040
I dare not resist.

301
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,840
I'm not a girl.

302
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,840
I'm standing here now.

303
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,120
I won't hide.

304
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
I won't be afraid.

305
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,440
If there's any dirt,

306
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,520
just splash it over.

307
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm not afraid anymore.

308
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,120
I will never fall down.

309
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,400
Good.

310
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,360
Good.

311
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,760
Good.

312
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,280
Success.

313
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,400
You did a good job.

314
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,960
What's going on?

315
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,920
Not bad 만들ings.

316
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,960
Keep it.

317
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,360
Why are the newspapers talking about Bai Bing Xin?

318
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,240
I heard that Bai Bing Xin held a press conference yesterday.

319
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,560
She suddenly turned the news around.

320
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Is that so?

321
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,920
Good morning, Boss.

322
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,600
I've cleaned up the side of the room.

323
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
Good morning, Boss.

324
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,160
Did you know that Bai Bing Xin is more popular than Liang Shan Shan?

325
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,000
Did you read today's newspaper?

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,440
It says that the movie company is going to make three movies for her.

327
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,320
Three movies?

328
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,280
Yes, three movies.

329
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,640
It's a pity that the second young master broke up with her.

330
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,560
Otherwise, we could still see her face.

331
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,280
That's right.

332
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,240
What are you talking about?

333
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,880
What are you talking about?

334
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,440
When you should be working, you shouldn't.

335
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,000
If the guests come later and you haven't cleaned up,

336
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll clean up one by one.

337
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
You're stupid and lazy.

338
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,600
Mind your mouth.

339
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,120
Come.

340
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,480
Throw away all these waste paper.

341
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,760
These are all the new newspapers today.

342
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,440
Throw them away.

343
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,000
But we have to prepare newspapers for our guests every day.

344
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,200
I told you to throw them away. Why are you keeping them?

345
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay, okay. Throw them away.

346
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
Did you hear me? Throw them away.

347
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,200
Where's Xiao Wu?

348
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,400
She's still at Tongjiang Inn. Xiao Yi is with her.

349
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Hurry and give her a reply.

350
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Boss, did you promise to give her another sum of money?

351
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,400
Are you still going to give it to her?

352
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
Give it to her.

353
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Give her your salary for the second half of the year.

354
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
No, no.

355
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,400
Hey.

356
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll only pay the bill for the inn until today.

357
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,200
If you want to continue living, you have to pay for it yourself.

358
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,600
What do you mean?

359
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
I'm just trying to get a job.

360
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Whatever you think.

361
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
My job is over here anyway.

362
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,200
Okay.

363
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,200
Let me work.

364
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,600
Take the money.

365
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,400
You didn't think of giving me the bill. If you give me more money,

366
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,600
if you give me this amount of money, I'll immediately do it.

367
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
If things are done like this,

368
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,800
you still have the nerve to ask for money?

369
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,600
What does the business of selling the inn have to do with me?

370
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,000
If you don't let me sell the inn, I'll do it all.

371
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,600
You...

372
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
are just too determined to ask for money.

373
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,000
You don't have the heart to ask for money, right?

374
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
Fine.

375
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,200
I won't look for it then.

376
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
Xiao Wu,

377
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
if it were me,

378
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,400
before Boss Tian gets angry,

379
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I'll quickly pack up and leave.

380
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
If he changes his mind

381
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,200
and asks you to spit out everything you ate before,

382
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,400
you'll be in big trouble.

383
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Look at the flowers.

384
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,820
And now I'm Hasbro Berlin's

385
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,880
Onlooker with the Grim Reapers of Shanghai

386
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,560
Maisonutt,

387
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,200
His Majesty 2001

388
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Is there?

389
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
You don't know?

390
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Now, we've already opened a ship from Shanghai to Tianjin.

391
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
It will arrive in three or four days.

392
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,200
And the fare is much cheaper than the train ticket.

393
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Is it available every day?

394
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Yes, it is available today.

395
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
How about I send you to the dock?

396
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Dock! Dock!

397
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Okay, then you can sit tight.

398
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Zheng Wu, why are you standing there?

399
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
What are you doing?

400
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Don't ruin my work!

401
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Brother.

402
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Have you done it?

403
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Yes, everything is done.

404
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Everything is here.

405
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Sister Tian, be careful.

406
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Be careful, everyone.

407
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Friends who want to interview Miss Bai Bingxing

408
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
can come to my place to register later.

409
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
And today, we have prepared

410
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
a ice cream for you

411
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
which Miss Bai Bingxing has recommended.

412
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I hope you will like it.

413
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
When will we confess?

414
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
What are you talking about?

415
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
You are still hiding it from me.

416
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
It's unnecessary, right?

417
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
It's our businessmen's basic job to know the truth.

418
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm just curious.

419
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Why haven't you confessed yet?

420
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Do you think the ice cream is enough?

421
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
So many people came.

422
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Is it because of Miss Chu's past?

423
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
It shouldn't be.

424
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
You are so generous.

425
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Maybe she still has someone in her heart.

426
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
But love is like the market.

427
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Even if someone is more advanced than you

428
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
and has the majority of market share,

429
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
as long as you take the initiative,

430
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
you will have a chance.

431
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Boss Xia, there is something

432
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
I need your help with.

433
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
It seems you are going to take the initiative.

434
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Shou Jin...

435
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Shaohua, what are these two characters?

436
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Shou Jin?

437
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Yes, Qilin.

438
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Shou Jin, Qilin.

439
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
A strong and unyielding white ice heart.

440
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
It's a modern woman's...

441
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Modification.

442
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
What does it mean?

443
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
It's a model.

444
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
They are too high up.

445
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Shouldn't they?

446
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Shaohua.

447
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Thank you.

448
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
If it weren't for you and Wen Zhiqiu,

449
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I would have died.

450
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
You should be the one to thank me.

451
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
You are the one who held on.

452
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
What about you?

453
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Me?

454
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Wen Zhiqiu said

455
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
we didn't have the right to be together.

456
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
We didn't do anything wrong.

457
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
We don't need to blame ourselves.

458
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
We don't need to feel ashamed.

459
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
We don't need to carry the burden for the rest of our lives.

460
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
So don't feel dirty anymore.

461
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Don't feel inferior.

462
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Shaohua,

463
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I have already got over it.

464
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I really hope

465
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
you can let it go.

466
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Erniu,

467
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
I am different from you.

468
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I killed someone.

469
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
But you killed bad people.

470
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
And Guangfu has also closed the case.

471
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
It was the bandits.

472
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
It has nothing to do with you.

473
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
But I will carry this burden

474
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
for the rest of my life.

475
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Shaohua,

476
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
don't worry.

477
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Even if I have to carry this burden for the rest of my life,

478
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I will keep moving forward.

479
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I will go further and further.

480
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
That old woman,

481
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,200
she bought a new house.

482
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,200
She wants me to move in with her.

483
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
What do you think?

484
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Among all the men,

485
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,200
she is the one who treats me the most sincerely.

486
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
So I also plan

487
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
to treat her with sincerity.

488
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
But her profession,

489
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
I don't look down on her.

490
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I am just afraid that you will follow her.

491
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I am worried.

492
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Don't worry.

493
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I am living with her.

494
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I am not married to her.

495
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I am afraid that you will get hurt.

496
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Shaohua,

497
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
the most painful injury

498
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
in human history

499
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
we have all been hurt.

500
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
We have been beaten.

501
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
What kind of injury

502
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
can really hurt us?

503
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
But we still have to learn to protect ourselves.

504
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
I know.

505
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I will not give myself to her.

506
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
No matter what, it is a good thing.

507
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Shaohua, congratulations.

508
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Shaohua,

509
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
no matter where I go,

510
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,200
no matter who I am with,

511
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,200
you will always be my closest sister.

512
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Cut.

513
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Okay, cut.

514
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Ready for the next scene.

515
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Boss Wen,

516
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
why are you here?

517
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I want to ask you a favor.

518
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Okay, go ahead.

519
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Do you all have

520
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
the props master in your movie?

521
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
I want to ask you to introduce me to someone

522
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
and ask him to do something for me.

523
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Okay.

524
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
I will go to the movie theater.

525
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
I want to ask him to do something for me.

526
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
No problem.

527
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
What do you want to do?

528
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I want to ask him to make a few house models

529
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
for me.

530
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Okay,

531
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
this should be possible.

532
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Why are you doing this?

533
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Confession.

534
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Confession of whom?

535
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Bai.

536
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Chu Shaohua.

537
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Don't you like money?

538
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Money is a good thing.

539
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
But Shaohua is not good.

540
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
I am serious.

541
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
I have to tell you something.

542
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Shaohua,

543
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
she has a past.

544
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Who doesn't have a past?

545
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
No matter she...

546
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Miss Bai, it's your turn.

547
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Shaohua,

548
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
no matter what her past is,

549
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
you can accept it.

550
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Okay.

551
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
If what you did

552
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
is really the same as what you said,

553
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I will support you.

554
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Go to work.

555
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Sign.

556
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Don't worry.

557
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Why are you still not packing?

558
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Mu Ziru is almost here.

559
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Shaohua,

560
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
find yourself a man.

561
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Why?

562
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Yes.

563
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
I know you can do it.

564
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
You don't need them.

565
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
But sometimes,

566
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
you can lean on a shoulder.

567
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
It's good.

568
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
I don't even have a woman's style.

569
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Who would like it?

570
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
You.

571
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't have a woman's style.

572
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Who would like me?

573
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Who says you don't have a woman's style?

574
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Wen Zhiqiu.

575
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Okay.

576
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Why are you laughing like this?

577
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Nothing.

578
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Shaohua,

579
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
I have a feeling

580
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
that the man you are destined to be

581
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
will appear soon.

582
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
I hope so.

583
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
When he appears,

584
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
don't resist.

585
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Let's go.

586
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I'll walk you out.

587
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
You should

588
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
keep these words in mind.

589
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Okay.

590
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Do you have anything else to bring?

591
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Not far.

592
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Come back and get it.

593
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Come.

594
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Don't leave me again.

595
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
I didn't go far this time.

596
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm still in Shanghai.

597
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
I'll miss you.

598
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Call me if you miss me.

599
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I'll appear immediately.

600
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Okay.

601
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I'll wait for your good news.

602
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
I'm leaving.

603
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Get in.

604
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Okay.

605
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I'll wait for you.

606
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
I'll wait for you.

607
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Okay.

608
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
I'll wait for you.

609
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,200
I've made up my mind.

610
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,200
How can I leave you?

611
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I've never loved anyone in my life.

612
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
This day,

613
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I've seen the fate coming back.

614
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm destined to have you in my life.

615
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Master.

616
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Look who's back.

617
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
He's thin.

618
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Xia Chu.

619
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Brother.

620
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I'm back.

621
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Come back.

622
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Come back.

623
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Come back.

624
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Brother brought my books and items

625
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
to Shanghai.

626
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
I brought everything I could.

627
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Your books,

628
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
our toys

629
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
that we threw away when we were kids.

630
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Oh, right.

631
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,200
And your favorite quilt and pillow.

632
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
When I miss you,

633
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I'll come here alone.

634
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I've never missed you and mom

635
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
in France.

636
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
You're so sweet.

637
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
If you really miss us,

638
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
you should come back.

639
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm back.

640
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
You're leaving?

641
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
No.

642
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
I'm a professor at Shanghai University.

643
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Shanghai University?

644
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
That's great.

645
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
It's not far from home.

646
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
It's convenient to work.

647
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
But I won't stay at home.

648
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
The school has arranged a dormitory for me.

649
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Besides, I have some work to do.

650
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,200
It's convenient to go to the dormitory.

651
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Work?

652
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
It's just an excuse.

653
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Listen, Xia Chu.

654
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
What you told me

655
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,200
was all false.

656
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Only the business at home is true.

657
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
That's because

658
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
you don't really know

659
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Marxism.

660
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I don't know.

661
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
I only know that

662
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
the city was named Lu last month.

663
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
This month, it's Qi.

664
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I don't know what's going on.

665
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
But gold is still gold.

666
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
The big Yang is still the big Yang.

667
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Money can bring people a sense of security.

668
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,200
But there are still some things

669
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
that are beyond money.

670
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Tell me. What are they?

671
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
The righteousness of the people for the country.

672
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
The truth of saving the country and its people.

673
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Here we go again.

674
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Xia Chu.

675
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
I thought you would change

676
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
if you went to France.

677
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
I have changed.

678
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I became more determined.

679
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Yes.

680
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
I can't compete with you.

681
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I won't compete with you.

682
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Rest early.

683
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Manager Chu.

684
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
Boss Wen called just now.

685
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
He said that at 3 p.m.

686
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
he would invite you to

687
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
the model hall of the tea ceremony restaurant.

688
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
He has something important to discuss.

689
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
What is it?

690
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
It's about the company's development.

691
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
I'm busy right now.

692
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I can't talk to him.

693
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Where is he now?

694
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
I don't know.

695
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I haven't seen him for a day today.

696
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
But Boss Wen called

697
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
and asked you to be on time.

698
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
But you don't have to go early.

699
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Okay, I got it.

700
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Okay, I got it.

701
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
I don't know when you will go early.

702
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
There are more and more things to do.

703
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Your props master's skills

704
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
are too good.

705
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
It completely

706
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
re-created all my imagination.

707
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
You are going to

708
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
confess here?

709
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Yes.

710
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Don't you think

711
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
it's a little simpler?

712
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
You don't want to write something

713
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
and put some color on it.

714
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Please.

715
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Be gentle.

716
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Thank you.

717
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
It's not a press conference.

718
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
What should I write?

719
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Feicui.

720
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Diamond.

721
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Are you ready?

722
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
He is not interested in these.

723
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Even if he is not interested in these things,

724
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
he should have something expensive.

725
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
I gave him a gift.

726
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
What about the flowers?

727
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
You don't have

728
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
a bunch of roses, do you?

729
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
That can't touch him.

730
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
I tried.

731
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Okay.

732
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I want to hear you say

733
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
how you are going to touch him.

734
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Just these little things.

735
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Just these little things?

736
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
This is the future of

737
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
me and him.

738
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
You are not

739
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
better at these little props.

740
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
If I add

741
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
the shares of the five-cent shares of

742
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
my Wen's Big House,

743
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
you will get half of it.

744
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Wen Zhiqiu.

745
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
I really didn't realize

746
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
that you are a real man.

747
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Why haven't you hung up

748
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
these two brands?

749
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
I want to wait for him to hang up.

750
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Chichun sugar.

751
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Chichun sugar.

752
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
I know this is

753
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
his dream.

754
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
I want to

755
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
achieve it for him

756
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
in five years.

757
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,200
What is this?

758
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
This is where

759
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
we will live in the future.

760
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
The house is designed.

761
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
That is...

762
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I actually know

763
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Shaohua's past.

764
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
I also know that

765
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
she didn't let go.

766
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
So I want to tell her

767
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
that we can find

768
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
what we lost.

769
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Thank you, Wen Zhiqiu.

770
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Thank you for

771
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
being so considerate of Shaohua.

772
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
After all this time,

773
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
someone finally

774
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
cares about Shaohua

775
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
and cares about her.

776
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
You have to

777
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
behave yourself later.

778
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Although Shaohua is

779
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
very independent,

780
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I am still relieved

781
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
to have you

782
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
by her side.

783
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Sure. I know.

784
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Thank you.

785
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Thank you.

786
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Try it.

787
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Shaohua.

788
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
It's really you.

789
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
It's me.

790
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
You're still alive.

791
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
I'm still alive.

792
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
That's great.

793
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
You've always been

794
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
so good to me.

795
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
I'm so happy

796
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
to see you.

797
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
I'm so happy

798
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
to see you.

799
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
I'm so happy

800
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
to see you.

801
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm so happy

802
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
to see you.

803
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
What about you?

804
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
I...

805
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
I'm fine.

806
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
That's good.

807
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
You...

808
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
This is...

809
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Chu Shaohua.

810
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Hello, I'm Jackie.

811
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I'm Zhou Jieru,

812
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Xia Chu's girlfriend.

813
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Why am I late?

814
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
I didn't expect to meet a friend.

815
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Who are you?

816
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I'm Mr. Xia Chu.

817
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
I'm Miss Zhou.

818
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
You're Xia Chu?

819
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
You know me?

820
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
I saw your photo

821
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
at your brother's house.

822
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
You're my brother's friend?

823
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
This is Wen Zhichao.

824
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
He's my fiance.

825
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Okay.

826
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Fiance?

827
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Nice to meet you.

828
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Nice to meet you.

829
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Nice to meet you.

830
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
I didn't know

831
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
you knew each other.

832
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Mr. Xia is my

833
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
long-time friend.

834
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Yes.

835
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
We're old friends.

836
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
It feels like

837
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
the last time we met

838
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
was in the past.

839
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
I'm sorry.

840
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
I have something

841
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
to do with Zhichao.

842
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
How about

843
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
we talk next time?

844
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
We haven't met for a long time.

845
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
How about we have a cup of coffee?

846
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Didn't you say

847
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
you had something to talk to me?

848
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
It's a waste of time.

849
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Goodbye.

850
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
We should go now.

851
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
Let's go.

852
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Let's go.

853
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Are you okay?

854
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I'm fine.

855
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Let's not talk today.

856
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
I'm fine.

857
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm fine.

858
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
I'm fine.

859
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
You...

860
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
What's your future plan?

861
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Let's start.

862
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
This is

863
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
our future studio.

864
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
This is

865
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Shanghai本店.

866
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Guangzhou, Xi'an, Beijing.

867
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Kunming.

868
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
I'm fine.

869
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
I'm fine.

870
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
I'm fine.

871
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,200
It's good.

872
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
It's big and beautiful.

873
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
What about these two?

874
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Why don't you

875
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
hang the sign?

876
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
I made a mistake.

877
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I thought I lost it.

878
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
It's a pity.

879
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Let's put it here first.

880
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Where?

881
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
That's it.

882
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
It's gone.

883
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
That's it?

884
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Then these

885
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
can be told to me in the office.

886
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Why do you have to let me come here?

887
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
You want our small office

888
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
to be able to install these houses?

889
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
So you're going to rent

890
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
the most expensive exhibition hall

891
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
in a best hotel in Shanghai

892
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,200
and show me all these models?

893
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Yes.

894
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
I made money from the studio.

895
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
I want to make a fortune.

896
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Okay.

897
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
And

898
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
why did I wear your fiancé?

899
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Because

900
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
you were the only one who checked it.

901
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
And only you

902
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
are the most impossible.

903
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
That's it.

904
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
And if

905
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
I see him again,

906
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
can you continue

907
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
to dress up as my fiancé?

908
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,200
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,200
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,200
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
I'm sorry.

917
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,200
I'm sorry.

918
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I'm sorry.

919
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm sorry.

920
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
I'm sorry.

921
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I'm sorry.

922
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
I'm sorry.

923
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
I'm sorry.

924
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,200
I'm sorry.

925
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
I'm sorry.

926
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
I'm sorry.

927
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I'm sorry.

928
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm sorry.

929
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I'm sorry.

930
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
I'm sorry.

931
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm sorry.

932
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
I'm sorry.

933
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
I'm sorry.

934
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
I'm sorry.

935
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm sorry.

936
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm sorry.

937
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Day by day,

938
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
night by night,

939
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,200
there is regret.

940
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Day by day,

941
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
night by night,

942
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm not lonely anymore.

943
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
The wind blows away the hope,

944
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
brightening up the despair.

945
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,200
I give my life to fight for you.

946
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,200
I'm covered in gray and gray.

947
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,200
The eternal peace in my heart.

948
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Ah.

949
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
Day by day,

950
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
night by night,

951
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
there is regret.

952
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Day by day,

953
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
night by night,

954
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,200
I'm not lonely anymore.

955
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
The wind blows away the hope,

956
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
brightening up the despair.

957
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,200
I give my life to fight for you.

958
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
I'm covered in gray and gray.

959
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:17,200
The eternal peace in my heart.
