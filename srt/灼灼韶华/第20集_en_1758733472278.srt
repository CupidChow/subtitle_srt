1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
Let us kill him.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,080
tworhe.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,200
Yes...

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,200
Don't move!

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,120
Don't move!

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,280
Don't move!

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,760
Nothing will happen.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,000
YinThe Ocean.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,160
Just stay down.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,840
Yes.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,560
YinTheGe.

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,120
YinTheGe.

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,200
Is she still alive?

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,080
She's still alive!

15
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,640
My sincere heart

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
Can't buy a house

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,040
I have to be honest

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,520
I have to be honest

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,040
But I heard the wind

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
From the deep sea and sky

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,680
He said don't bow down

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,640
Don't bow down

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,480
You are the sea

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,320
You are the wind

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,440
How can you be wrong

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,680
You can't be convinced

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
You can't be held

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,480
Is the sharpness in my eyes

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,280
This world is not easy

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,400
Then break it

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,200
My bitter pain

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,040
My pain

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,440
I will turn around

34
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,640
I am me

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,200
The biggest wild man

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,480
I don't want to

37
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,280
Break through the world

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Be me

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,320
But before the negotiation begins

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,520
We have to admit one thing first

43
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,760
Although your lawyer said

44
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,680
He took out two printed ad lists

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640
In fact, there are four printed ad lists

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,720
Missed out

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,960
True

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,720
Real

49
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,320
Real

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,720
It's our fault

51
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,080
Right and wrong

52
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Isn't it wrong??

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,560
reality

54
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,880
Really reality

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,880
Mr. too

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
Take a look

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,780
This is the원이 wine event

58
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,680
Thank you

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,800
Is there any printedel

60
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,480
Do you want to pass it to me

61
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,080
The same

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Isn't there any

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,680
We don't want to take responsibility for this.

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
We just want to say that

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
printing these ads

66
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,400
is a work of the heartless.

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,200
We didn't mean to do this.

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
But no matter what,

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,600
this matter has caused

70
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,200
your loss of your rights.

71
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,360
So we're here to

72
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,760
apologize to Mr. Tian and Professor Claudia

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
for our greatest mistake.

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,880
That's it?

75
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,960
What's the matter?

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
We'll also

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
make an official apology

78
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
to the newspaper.

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,120
Of course,

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
we'll also compensate

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
for the loss

82
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,680
caused by this incident.

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
How much?

84
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
5,000 yuan.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,880
Brother, I think...

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
How many times have I told you?

87
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,800
I'll call you Mr. Tian.

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,440
Okay.

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,240
Call me Mr. Tian.

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,560
Mr. Tian,

91
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
I think

92
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,080
we can consider it.

93
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,760
Since you're so honest,

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,800
I'll tell you the truth.

95
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
Even if you go out

96
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,200
and fart,

97
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,880
it's not because you want to,

98
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,440
but because you smell, right?

99
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
But after you

100
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,160
put out the ad,

101
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,960
you don't even want to.

102
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,680
It's worse than farting, right?

103
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,600
Mr. Tian, you're right.

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,560
Since you didn't hurt me,

105
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,800
it's not a loss.

106
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,120
The reason why I

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
went to court for you

108
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,400
is to kill you.

109
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,200
You don't sell

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,760
the East's brain pills

111
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,440
better than the Western's, right?

112
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,560
Mr. Tian, you're honest.

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,960
Business

115
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,520
should be done with honesty.

116
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,760
But seeing how you

117
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,520
were humble and humble,

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm very satisfied with you.

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,800
I've decided

120
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,800
to give you no compensation.

121
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,160
And I don't want you to apologize.

122
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,720
Okay.

123
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Then...

124
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm willing to give you a chance

125
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
to cooperate with me.

126
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,680
Then...

127
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,560
Then how?

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,200
First of all,

129
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,800
your East's brain pills

130
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,280
must be taken from the Bureau of Police.

131
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,880
All raw materials

132
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,440
must be bought from Mr. Tian.

133
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,440
Well...

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,680
We've already

135
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,520
signed a contract with Mr. Xia.

136
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,320
What?

137
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,720
A broken contract?

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,480
A broken contract?

139
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,600
The amount of broken contract...

140
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,240
I'll give you the amount you need.

141
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,000
It's not about money.

142
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
Business?

143
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,200
Money can't decide everything.

144
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,800
Right.

145
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,760
One more thing.

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,600
You must go to the National Medicine Conference

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
and tell them

148
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,400
that the first round of medicine

149
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,040
is to improve the acupuncture points.

150
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,640
Mr. Tian.

151
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,560
You want us to be in a mess?

152
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,320
It's a case of revenge.

153
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,680
It's better than

154
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm fighting against you in court

155
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,120
and you're losing your reputation

156
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,200
and losing your family, right?

157
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,280
But we don't have

158
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,760
any fame or property.

159
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,000
You're not in my team.

160
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,040
What do you think?

161
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
Will you follow me

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,040
or face me?

163
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
Honey.

164
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,640
Have you decided?

165
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,360
Say something.

166
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,360
Mr. Tian.

167
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
The medical room of our Wen's

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,400
is a small one.

169
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,320
But we're

170
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,640
doing business.

171
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,240
So I think

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
it's better for us

173
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,560
to work with you.

174
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,520
You're shameless.

175
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
It's not a favor.

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
Mr. Tian.

177
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,760
You don't deserve to be a favor.

178
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,720
In terms of medicine,

179
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
our Eastern tonic

180
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
is far more than your Western tonic.

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,720
We're cheaper than you.

182
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,840
In terms of sales strategy,

183
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,280
we're more flexible than you.

184
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
In terms of trend,

185
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,840
we're more than you.

186
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,560
We can take it.

187
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,520
Do you understand?

188
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,520
Well...

189
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,840
Let's go, honey.

190
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,520
You...

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Mr. Tian.

192
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,320
Mr. Tian.

193
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,240
See you in court.

194
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,400
You...

195
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,360
Tong Xin.

196
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,600
Brother.

197
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Are they here to piss me off?

198
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,920
Well...

199
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,840
Calm down, brother.

200
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,720
Boss Wen.

201
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,480
Mr. Tang is waiting for you.

202
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Mr. Tang.

203
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,840
What brings you here?

204
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,720
Mr. Xia asked me

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,960
to deliver two things to you.

206
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,080
He knows you've invested

207
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,320
all your money in business.

208
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,040
But it's a waste of money

209
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,320
to go to court.

210
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,720
So he asked me

211
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,880
to deliver some money to you.

212
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,680
He also said

213
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,800
if you don't have enough money,

214
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
just tell us.

215
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
As long as you win the case,

216
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,200
money is not a problem.

217
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,320
Well...

218
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
I'll leave you to it.

219
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,280
Thank you.

220
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,400
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

221
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

222
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,720
Besides, this is

223
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,280
a business card of

224
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,320
Mr. Lin Chunbai.

225
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,160
Mr. Xia has arranged it.

226
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,720
He'll help you

227
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,120
to go to court.

228
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,200
Mr. Lin?

229
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,920
Yes.

230
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,240
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.

231
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,600
Mr. Lin will be waiting for you

232
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,920
at his lawyer's office.

233
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,280
Be on time.

234
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,200
I will.

235
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,760
Thank you.

236
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,880
I'll leave you to it.

237
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,880
See you.

238
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,920
Mr. Lin.

239
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,640
Mr. Lin.

240
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,240
Mr. Lin.

241
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Mr. Lin.

242
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
See you.

243
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,600
Okay.

244
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,520
See you.

245
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,720
How is it?

246
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,400
Do you have confidence

247
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,320
in this case?

248
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,240
We can't win.

249
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,000
But

250
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,200
it doesn't mean we lose.

251
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,160
How?

252
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Because what we have to win

253
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,640
is not the case,

254
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,560
but the market.

255
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,480
In fact, if we want to win this case,

256
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
we have a chance.

257
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,200
Really?

258
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,640
We've been ignoring someone.

259
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,880
Who?

260
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,520
Professor Ke Laodi.

261
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,320
Professor.

262
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,840
Well...

263
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,040
You can't drink anymore.

264
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,120
You've drunk too much.

265
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,000
At that time...

266
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,080
We have something tomorrow morning.

267
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
We have a meeting with the lawyer.

268
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,000
Have you forgotten?

269
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,720
I'm thirsty.

270
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,160
I don't dare to drink.

271
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,720
When are you thirsty?

272
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,200
Let's have the last drink, okay?

273
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,960
The last one.

274
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I don't like to drink.

275
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,920
Hurry up.

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,240
Sir, excuse me.

277
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,040
Is Mr. Huang from No. 11, Tian's?

278
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,520
Not bad.

279
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,360
Your phone is here.

280
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
Yes, over there.

281
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,040
Please.

282
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,920
San Nian.

283
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,000
You can't even hear my voice?

284
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,360
Little Rascal?

285
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,040
You only think about him.

286
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,000
Li Ling?

287
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,880
Do you have a small one?

288
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,920
Give me a cup.

289
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,200
Sorry, sir.

290
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
We don't have this wine here.

291
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,920
Impossible.

292
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,800
Every wine house in Northeast China

293
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,560
has a small one.

294
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,400
Sir, this is Shanghai.

295
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,080
I forgot again.

296
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
This is Shanghai, not Northeast.

297
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
You like to burn knives?

298
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
No.

299
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,320
But only burning knives

300
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,080
can make me forget

301
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
the pain of the separation of Natascha.

302
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,280
Who is Natascha?

303
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,320
Give him another cup.

304
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,040
Who are you?

305
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Professor Crowdy.

306
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,120
I'm Wen Zhi Qiu from Wen's Pharmacy.

307
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Nice.

308
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,640
Hello?

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,520
If you don't say your name,

310
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,560
I'll hang up.

311
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,640
No.

312
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,720
You...

313
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,920
Think about it.

314
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,560
Liu Wan?

315
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,640
Maybe...

316
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,280
How dare you call me?

317
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,320
I'm telling you.

318
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,640
I won't fall for your trick again.

319
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
That's what happened.

320
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,720
So I'm here

321
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,120
sincerely

322
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,200
hoping

323
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,520
you can forgive us.

324
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
I forgive you.

325
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,840
Thank you.

326
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,360
I'm so happy for you.

327
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,960
You're the most beautiful knife in the world.

328
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,080
Sir.

329
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,480
Here.

330
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
You understand?

331
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,360
Understand what?

332
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,760
You...

333
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,080
Sleep.

334
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,320
Sleep.

335
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,680
Sleep.

336
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Sleep.

337
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,720
Sleep.

338
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,320
Sleep.

339
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,440
What are you doing?

340
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm telling you.

341
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,640
Don't come to me again.

342
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,360
We'll never break our promise.

343
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,520
If you really push me away,

344
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,680
I'll go to your husband.

345
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,280
At worst, we'll die together.

346
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Oh...

347
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
You're drinking alone.

348
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,840
Cheers!

349
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,920
اجVI VJ

350
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,920
Marco Macrame

351
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,080
means

352
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,240
sin is also like

353

ассgiage

354
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,320
means

355
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,160
still

356
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,960
White Car bearings,

357
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,900
they can let you rest Van Chanel,

358
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,260
we don't want hurt,

359
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,860
tuck up your jeans,

360
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
you are Ciao отлич.

361
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,600
Zhao Qingliang,

362
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,440
Mr Shi,

363
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:32,460
HAMF's

364
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,520
Well,

365
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,760
is not enough time?

366
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,720
But I have tried my best.

367
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,440
Do we have to think of other ways?

368
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,960
There's something I don't understand.

369
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,960
What is it?

370
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,000
Professor Claudi is a well-known American scholar.

371
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,440
Why does he speak Russian when he's drunk

372
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,640
and sing Russian songs?

373
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,560
I'm sorry.

374
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,800
This way.

375
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,320
This is your first time here.

376
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,040
Let me introduce you to some friends.

377
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,760
Okay.

378
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,240
Come.

379
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,200
You guys are having a good chat.

380
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Mrs. Yuan.

381
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,600
This is Mrs. Gu.

382
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
Hello, Mrs. Gu.

383
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
This is Mrs. Zhou.

384
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,800
Hello.

385
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,760
Miss Yan.

386
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
Thank you, Miss Yan.

387
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,640
This is Miss Bai.

388
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,840
She's Tong Xin's friend.

389
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,600
She's the movie star, right?

390
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,480
Yes, it is.

391
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,760
She's prettier than the screen.

392
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,200
She's prettier than the poster.

393
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,080
Thank you.

394
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,880
How did you make that movie?

395
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,800
If you're interested,

396
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,920
I'll take you to the set

397
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,400
if you have time.

398
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,200
Great.

399
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
By the way, Cai Yun.

400
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,880
When did you go to America?

401
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,960
I'm a graduate.

402
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,200
You went to Columbia University?

403
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,400
Yes.

404
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,440
What did you study?

405
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,280
Chemistry.

406
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,400
Chemistry is good.

407
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,920
Chemistry is very delicious.

408
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,480
I'll go to the bathroom.

409
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
Chemistry?

410
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,240
Go to the first floor.

411
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,760
This is not good.

412
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,400
It's more crowded abroad.

413
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,680
When will you come back?

414
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,120
You...

415
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,320
What are you doing?

416
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,360
I told you to keep an eye on Wen Zhiqiao

417
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,560
and keep quiet.

418
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:22,840
No.

419
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,760
What are you doing?

420
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,320
How did they get in and out of the room?

421
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,280
I...

422
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,000
I was sleeping.

423
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,280
I was just walking for a minute.

424
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,920
One minute?

425
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,360
They kept quiet in one minute?

426
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,080
You stay here.

427
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,640
Go away.

428
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,160
Go away.

429
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,920
Bastard.

430
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,760
One minute.

431
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,640
Boss.

432
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,360
One minute.

433
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,160
You...

434
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,080
It's like this.

435
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,600
I promise.

436
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,280
He and Wen Zhiqiao

437
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,600
didn't say a word.

438
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,520
How do you know?

439
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,680
Didn't you leave?

440
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:45,960
He...

441
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,040
He was drunk.

442
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,440
He was singing.

443
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
What was he singing?

444
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,360
I'll think about it.

445
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,520
No.

446
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,000
It's not because of him.

447
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,960
It's not because of him.

448
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,520
Really.

449
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,400
It's not because of him.

450
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,160
You think you're a suspect?

451
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,200
It's not because of him.

452
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,840
Boss.

453
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm sorry.

454
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,760
Don't be like this.

455
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,520
You're a fool.

456
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,160
I'm sorry.

457
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,520
Look at this.

458
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,320
I'm rolling the bed.

459
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Get out.

460
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm sorry.

461
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,880
I...

462
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,040
I'll solve it.

463
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,520
I'll solve it.

464
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,160
Come on.

465
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,560
Stand here.

466
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,280
Stand here.

467
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,240
I won't hit you.

468
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,640
Get out.

469
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,840
I won't hit you.

470
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,480
I won't hit you.

471
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,960
Stand here.

472
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,480
I won't hit you.

473
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,200
Boss.

474
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,840
I won't solve it.

475
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,160
Wen Zhiqiao.

476
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,840
I won't hit you.

477
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Get out.

478
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,240
You're a fool.

479
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,360
You can't do such a small thing.

480
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,960
Why don't you go to die?

481
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,680
You're back.

482
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,240
You haven't eaten yet, right?

483
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,200
I made a fish today.

484
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,120
I left half for you.

485
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,720
It's very fresh.

486
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,200
You left me food again?

487
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,760
What's wrong?

488
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,680
You ate it?

489
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,040
I just went to the Tian family.

490
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,880
Did you suffer?

491
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,480
No.

492
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,080
If they look down on you,

493
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,200
I'll scold them.

494
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,080
Don't worry.

495
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,760
I won't make myself feel so bad.

496
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,000
What are you doing?

497
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm sorting out

498
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,400
the materials Mr. Lin wants tomorrow.

499
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,160
You helped me to pay off

500
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,840
the money for the silk shop

501
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,600
and the tailor shop?

502
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
And the rent for next quarter.

503
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
I paid it together.

504
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,760
Shaohua.

505
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,640
When I pay the salary next month,

506
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,240
I'll pay you back.

507
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,640
You...

508
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,400
You don't have much salary.

509
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Save it for the hard work.

510
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,040
And

511
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
don't separate us

512
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,240
so clearly.

513
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,360
Let's eat.

514
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,640
Shaohua.

515
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,200
I heard something

516
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
at the Tian family today.

517
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Yang Zeyi.

518
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,880
Please.

519
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,280
Okay.

520
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,760
Mr. Shao.

521
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Mr. Xia Yuan.

522
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,040
You're here so quickly.

523
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I felt so excited

524
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,040
when I received your telegram.

525
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
You must have had a hard time.

526
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,480
No, I didn't.

527
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,360
You've arranged

528
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,720
a good trip.

529
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,600
I didn't feel so tired.

530
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
That's good.

531
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,880
Come on.

532
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,360
Please come in.

533
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,840
Okay.

534
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,280
Please.

535
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,800
Come in.

536
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,840
Please have a seat.

537
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,360
Okay.

538
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,560
Mr. Shao.

539
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,840
I'll propose a toast to you.

540
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,800
If I remember correctly,

541
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
Mr. Shao, we met last time

542
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,840
in Qizhou three years ago.

543
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Mr. Xia Yuan.

544
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,440
We're brothers.

545
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,920
We don't need to be polite.

546
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Let's get down to business.

547
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,560
After we're done,

548
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,160
we can

549
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
be friends again.

550
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,680
You're still

551
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,200
as good as before.

552
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,920
You're in such a hurry to see me.

553
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,440
Something must have happened.

554
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,240
To be honest,

555
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm here to ask you

556
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,600
to help me identify someone.

557
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,600
Who?

558
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,720
I heard he's lived in the Northeast.

559
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,960
He loves to drink and burn knives.

560
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,480
Look.

561
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
Does he look like

562
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,480
Uncle Ge Lie?

563
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,160
He is Uncle Ge Lie.

564
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,880
Uncle Ge Lie?

565
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,800
Who is Uncle Ge Lie?

566
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,040
He's a white goose

567
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,320
who runs a clinic in Shenyang.

568
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,720
He's Russian.

569
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,040
He was a military doctor.

570
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,520
He was in the Ming Dynasty

571
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,120
during the 7th year of the Ming Dynasty.

572
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
He opened a small clinic

573
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,440
in Shenyang.

574
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,120
He's very good at business.

575
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,120
He recruited some Chinese customers

576
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,760
and sent them to me

577
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,280
to purchase herbs.

578
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,640
Everyone under me knows him.

579
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
What about now?

580
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,240
Now?

581
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,680
I don't know.

582
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,480
I haven't contacted him for years.

583
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,440
I heard

584
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
his daughter ran away with a Chinese.

585
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,320
He closed the clinic

586
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,600
to find his daughter

587
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,680
and came to Shanghai.

588
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,200
We asked Mr. Yang to testify in court

589
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,960
to prove that Professor Crowdy

590
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,720
is a fake.

591
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,080
If so,

592
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,600
the lawsuit won't go on.

593
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,880
Even Mr. Tian's

594
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,720
Western Brain Pill

595
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,960
can't be sold.

596
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,480
But Mr. Yang is

597
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,000
Mr. Xia's partner.

598
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Mr. Xia is also

599
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,480
the shareholder of Wen's Pharmacy.

600
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,400
So, Mr. Zhu

601
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,240
won't believe his testimony.

602
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
What if someone goes to the U.S. to get the evidence?

603
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,600
It's too late.

604
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,960
The court will be held next week.

605
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,600
If we ask the person who owns the company

606
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,360
to testify,

607
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,920
will Mr. Zhu believe it?

608
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
Why would the person

609
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,080
who owns the company

610
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,240
testify for us?

611
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,240
Didn't you say

612
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,880
Mr. Tian fired

613
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,320
Glau'Gi's assistant?

614
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,080
Maybe we can use that person.

615
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,520
That's a good idea.

616
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,040
I know you.

617
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,080
It's because of you

618
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,360
that I lost my job.

619
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm sorry.

620
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm the younger one.

621
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,120
I've been working hard.

622
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,320
I've been working hard.

623
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Now,

624
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,320
Mr. Tian fired me.

625
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,920
How can we live?

626
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
I can help you.

627
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,520
I can help you.

628
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
I can help you.

629
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
I can help you.

630
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I can help you.

631
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
I can help you.

632
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
I can help you.

633
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
I can help you.

634
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How can you help me?

635
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,320
Money.

636
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Or

637
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,280
you want a job

638
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,680
that's better than before?

639
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,040
What do you mean?

640
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,000
As long as you testify.

641
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

642
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,080
It's not a secret anymore.

643
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,480
I already know

644
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,040
his name is Glau'Gi.

645
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,280
He's a white military doctor.

646
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,880
How do you know?

647
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,840
Sit down.

648
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Come on.

649
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,680
As long as you testify,

650
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,320
your family's life

651
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
will be fine.

652
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Boss.

653
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Boss.

654
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
They broke up.

655
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm going to interview you.

656
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Sit down.

657
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Mr. Tian.

658
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Is it Mr. Tian?

659
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,320
Mr. Tian.

660
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,920
Is it Mr. Tian?

661
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Yes.

662
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,280
Mr. Tian.

663
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,120
Are you confident

664
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,720
about the lawsuit?

665
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,120
Mr. Tian.

666
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,800
Mr. Tian.

667
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,320
I'm sorry,

668
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,920
dear journalists.

669
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,520
Mr. Tian, say something.

670
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,920
Mr. Tian doesn't accept any interview.

671
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,520
This way, please.

672
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,120
Come on.

673
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Okay.

674
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,920
Did you find these people?

675
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I think so.

676
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,920
Too few.

677
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,120
Find more people.

678
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,000
Don't be afraid of spending money.

679
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,320
Make it bigger.

680
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Mr. Tian.

681
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
I didn't find

682
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Professor Claudi anywhere.

683
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Where did you find him?

684
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
We've searched the hotel.

685
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
But we couldn't find him.

686
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Then find him

687
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,320
under the bed behind the door.

688
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,120
Under the table.

689
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,720
Go find him.

690
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,320
Okay.

691
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,920
Brother.

692
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
The court will be held soon.

693
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,920
Professor Claudi is still not here.

694
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,320
How can we get him to court?

695
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Is the law in place?

696
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Is the lawyer in place?

697
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,320
He can get him to court.

698
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Mr. Tian.

699
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,520
Hello.

700
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,120
Why isn't Wen Zhi Qiu here?

701
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,920
He has something else to do.

702
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
He can't come.

703
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,720
I won't come even if I were him.

704
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
How embarrassing!

705
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Mr. Tian.

706
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,320
After the trial,

707
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,920
you'll know who is the most embarrassing.

708
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Yes.

709
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,720
After the trial,

710
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,320
you'll be the losers.

711
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,920
It's daytime.

712
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,520
Why do you say something strange?

713
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
You little girl.

714
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,120
Why can't you see if he isn't here?

715
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
– Miss. – Who is he?

716
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,220
Are you yours?

717
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,920
Then also yours.

718
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,520
No one else should be here.

719
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,720
Get out.

720
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Professor Klaudi

721
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,560
may not be able to come to the court in person,

722
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
but he entrusted me

723
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,400
to hand over the evidence to the court.

724
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,000
This is the supplementary element

725
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
that Professor Klaudi invented himself.

726
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,280
Transfer to the transfer contract

727
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,600
of the Tian Group's drug brand.

728
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,560
Professor Klaudi

729
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,440
allowed Tian Group's drug brand

730
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,000
to use its copyrighted authorization.

731
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,160
And this is a protest letter

732
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,520
written by Professor Klaudi himself.

733
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,760
He strongly demanded

734
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,280
the copyright of the Wen's Pharmacy.

735
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,400
Mr. Beg,

736
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,960
do you have anything to say

737
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,960
about the information provided by the plaintiff?

738
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,920
Yes.

739
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,080
Your Honor,

740
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,360
we have no doubt about the principle of the

741
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
written evidence provided by the plaintiff.

742
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,160
But we have no doubt about the principle of the

743
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,800
written evidence provided by the plaintiff.

744
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,000
Go ahead.

745
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,960
Your Honor,

746
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,280
is Professor Klaudi

747
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,320
really Professor Klaudi?

748
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,960
What's your question?

749
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,080
Your Honor,

750
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,480
Your Honor,

751
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,800
I have another question.

752
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,680
Is Professor Klaudi

753
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,680
really Klaudi?

754
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,840
Is he really a professor in the United States?

755
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,320
Did he really invent

756
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,800
the so-called brain-filling element?

757
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,080
Excuse me. Excuse me.

758
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Mr. Beg,

759
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,520
do you have any evidence to prove it?

760
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,400
Your Honor,

761
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,000
yes.

762
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,920
We request to summon the witness,

763
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,480
Huang Deming, to testify in court.

764
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,000
Objection.

765
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,800
Your Honor,

766
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,720
the testimony of witness Huang Deming

767
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,720
is closely related to the identity of

768
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,480
Professor Klaudi.

769
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,320
Summon the witness, Huang Deming, to the court.

770
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,240
Mr. Huang.

771
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,680
Mr. Huang,

772
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,560
please introduce yourself to the court.

773
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,040
Your Honor,

774
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,360
my name is Huang Deming.

775
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,520
I've been the assistant of Professor Klaudi

776
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,040
for the past year.

777
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,520
Your Honor,

778
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,160
Mr. Huang has been the assistant of

779
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,400
Professor Klaudi for a year.

780
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,520
I'm sure you know

781
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,880
Professor Klaudi very well.

782
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,160
You can say that.

783
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,400
In this world,

784
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,520
except for Professor Klaudi,

785
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
I know him best.

786
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,640
Then please

787
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
introduce to the court

788
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,480
the real name

789
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,200
and real identity

790
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,080
of Professor Klaudi.

791
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,400
Your Honor,

792
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,920
Professor Klaudi's real name is

793
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,200
Claudius Viter.

794
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
He is a professor

795
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
of the US Institute of Urology.

796
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,880
He is also the president of

797
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
the US Institute of Pharmacy.

798
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,520
No, Mr. Huang.

799
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,400
I mean, please

800
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
introduce to the court

801
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,400
the real name and real identity

802
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,480
of Professor Klaudi.

803
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Your Honor,

804
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,040
I studied at the US Institute of Urology.

805
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,320
This is my graduation certificate.

806
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,840
I hereby declare

807
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,760
that Professor Klaudi

808
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,120
is an American

809
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,000
who is a man of great status.

810
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,200
And he is a very

811
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,400
respected and respected

812
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
scientist.

813
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,840
He has many inventions.

814
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,400
The most important one

815
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,120
is brain-reducing.

816
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,200
Mr. Huang, let me remind you.

817
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,960
He is in the court now.

818
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,400
Deceiving the court is a serious crime.

819
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,600
I know, Mr. Lin.

820
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,200
I know.

821
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,800
I know.

822
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,520
I know.

823
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,200
I know.

824
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,800
I know.

825
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,400
I know.

826
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,000
I know.

827
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,600
I know.

828
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,360
Mr. Lin,

829
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,800
deceiving the court is a serious crime.

830
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,840
So,

831
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,440
I can't lie

832
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
when I stand here today.

833
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,760
Your Honor,

834
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,760
everything I said

835
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,600
is true.

836
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,120
What's going on?

837
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,720
Why did the defendant

838
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,760
speak for the plaintiff?

839
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,680
Police.

840
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,800
Lawyer Yuan Gaolv.

841
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,280
Do you have anything else

842
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,040
to ask?

843
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,480
Your Honor,

844
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,560
the defendant

845
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,760
has made it clear.

846
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,280
We have nothing to ask.

847
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,000
That's all for today.

848
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,480
Court is closed.

849
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,600
Mr. Qin,

850
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,400
please predict

851
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
the final verdict.

852
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,480
It's obvious.

853
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,120
Although there is no final judgment,

854
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,840
the final result

855
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,200
can be predicted clearly.

856
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,560
It's that our Tian's Pharmacy

857
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,640
will win.

858
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,560
Wen's Pharmacy

859
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,440
is a thief.

860
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,960
The people from Wen's Pharmacy are here.

861
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,760
Don't worry.

862
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,160
Ask one by one.

863
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,320
Well.

864
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600
Wen's Pharmacy

865
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
is still tough.

866
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,520
Mr. Tian,

867
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,080
you're really amazing.

868
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,840
You've achieved

869
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,720
the position of Professor Claudi.

870
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,400
I was about to beat you down

871
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,040
so that you couldn't turn over.

872
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,160
Dear journalists,

873
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,960
Wen's Pharmacy and Professor Claudi

874
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,760
are going to hold

875
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,800
a press conference.

876
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,600
About today's case

877
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,400
and the follow-up of the Eastern Cure,

878
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,000
we'll have the first news

879
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,720
and announce that

880
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,000
the location is

881
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Xinhui Hotel on Zhejiang Road.

882
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,360
If you're interested,

883
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,480
you can go there.

884
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,440
Hurry up. Go and check it out.

885
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,240
Go.

886
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,680
Go and check it out.

887
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,360
There must be big news.

888
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,880
Yes, there must be big news.

889
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,120
How did they get together

890
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,920
with Professor Claudi?

891
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,400
I don't know.

892
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,160
Bin Xin.

893
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,040
Second.

894
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,400
You're here, too?

895
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,160
Second, get in the car.

896
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,920
Don't let any woman

897
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,760
get in your way.

898
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,800
Brother, is this Bin Xin?

899
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,720
I know.

900
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
That's her.

901
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,760
Pharmacy Wen Xi Dayao Fan

902
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,840
and me

903
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,920
definitely get reached understanding.

904
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,680
Professor Claudi has already

905
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,280
reached an understanding

906
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,320
with our Wen's Dayao Fan.

907
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,320
I decide not to appeal again.

908
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,840
And I also decide not to appeal again.

909
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
As you all know,

910
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm the professor

911
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,400
of Philadelphia College of Pharmacy,

912
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,480
honorary president of Pharmaceutical Research

913
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,680
and Manufacturers of America.

914
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,600
As you all know,

915
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,160
Professor is also

916
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,160
the president of the American Pharmaceutical College

917
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,000
and the president of the Pharmacy Association.

918
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,520
But actually,

919
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
the efficacy of a new medicine

920
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,400
is more important than the identity of its inventor.

921
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,200
Professor also believes

922
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,240
it doesn't matter who invented this medicine.

923
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,440
What matters is the effect of this medicine.

924
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
That's why

925
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,760
I want everybody to pay attention

926
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
to the new drug,

927
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,080
the Eastern Pusheen.

928
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,480
Professor also hopes that

929
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,720
everyone can focus their focus

930
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,960
on the Eastern Pusheen

931
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,720
once again.

932
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,680
I've tried it myself.

933
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,520
The efficacy of this drug

934
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,040
is significant.

935
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,920
Professor personally verified

936
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,520
that the effect of this medicine

937
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,640
is a good drug.

938
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,520
Thank you.

939
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,800
Thank you very much.

940
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,920
Do you think they're hooked?

941
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,000
Are they hooked or am I hooked?

942
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,480
Boss, I don't know.

943
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,800
You're a fool.

944
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,600
You can't even tell?

945
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,520
I'm hooked.

946
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,080
I'm hooked.

947
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,960
You've just met a professor.

948
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,840
But you're speaking for them.

949
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,960
Am I that stupid?

950
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,560
No.

951
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,000
Am I that stupid?

952
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,360
Am I the kind of person

953
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,960
who does the fake medicine for others?

954
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,280
I'm really...

955
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,400
All right, brother.

956
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,720
Don't be too angry.

957
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,040
Come in.

958
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,960
I'll go to the newspaper now

959
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,920
and remove the cover of the white goose refugees.

960
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,920
Tong Xin,

961
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,680
you're really stupid.

962
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,240
You removed his cover.

963
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,160
Will our medicine still be sold?

964
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,440
Will we still have to sell our faces?

965
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,840
Yes.

966
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,880
What should we do, brother?

967
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,760
Who are you asking?

968
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,480
Can I know if you don't know?

969
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,200
You can't even handle a little star.

970
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,240
You'll be played by him.

971
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,520
You can't even tell me after you play.

972
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,960
Brother, what are you talking about?

973
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,440
Who's being played by a little star?

974
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,840
Tong Xin,

975
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,040
can I ask you for a favor?

976
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,640
Don't be a womanizer.

977
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,440
Your brain is full of rouge and water.

978
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,800
You're the second person who's addicted to medicine.

979
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,640
I think you're a stupid idiot.

980
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,680
No, you're not even a stupid idiot.

981
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,080
Who is that, brother?

982
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
I...

983
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,600
If it weren't for you,

984
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,280
I wouldn't have been able to find my Natasha.

985
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,480
Thank you.

986
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,720
Thank you, too.

987
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,240
You've played a role with us.

988
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,040
I've been acting since I got to Shanghai.

989
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,960
This story is not in the script.

990
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,160
Uncle Ge Li,

991
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,000
we should get on the bus.

992
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,520
I want to see my Natasha.

993
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,600
I wish you and your father a good reunion.

994
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,840
Finally,

995
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,040
I can return to my homeland.

996
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,320
I can now live under the name of Gleb.

997
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,400
Goodbye.

998
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,080
Goodbye.

999
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,000
Have a safe trip, Third Master.

1000
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Please.

1001
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
You can still speak Russian?

1002
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,720
I don't understand.

1003
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,000
I can just type it anyway.

1004
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,680
A mistake there...

1005
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,480
is the mistake in the speed impressed by the departed.

1006
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,480
I can make a great contribution

1007
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
if I manage to defeat Dashang.

1008
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,440
You're here to하겠습니다?

1009
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,360
What should I pay you?

1010
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,520
Boss Wen,

1011
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,040
how are you planning to reward me?

1012
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,200
What do you want?

1013
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
I want to get a promotion.

1014
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,680
And I don't want to be an ordinary manager.

1015
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,960
I want to be a vice manager.

1016
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,120
Vice manager?

1017
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
How long have you been here?

1018
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,880
I want you to turn my Yicheng Deep Valley

1019
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,920
into a silver valley.

1020
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,520
You can discuss about the promotion.

1021
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,520
The silver valley...

1022
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,200
But I think my ability

1023
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,520
is worthy of being a vice manager.

1024
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,280
And I'm also worth

1025
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,000
a silver valley for the contribution of Wen's Big Apartment.

1026
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,800
Enough.

1027
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,600
How about this?

1028
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,640
I'll help you with the promotion and pay you extra.

1029
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,640
But about the silver valley,

1030
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,120
we'll talk about it later.

1031
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,000
I'll leave first.

1032
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,120
I think

1033
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,800
after what happened to Tian Dashao,

1034
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,200
many drug dealers in Shanghai

1035
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,440
want to take me.

1036
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,040
You don't trust me?

1037
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,080
No.

1038
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,480
Fine.

1039
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,440
If you want to turn your deep valley into a silver valley,

1040
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
I can't pay you extra.

1041
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,800
And

1042
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,440
you want to be a vice manager?

1043
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,080
And

1044
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,920
you want to do the work of a vice manager

1045
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,600
and earn money from a regular manager?

1046
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,640
Can you do that?

1047
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,040
Deal.

1048
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,720
You have to treat me to a meal.

1049
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,880
Just one meal?

1050
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,560
I'll choose the restaurant.

1051
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,480
I'll order the dishes.

1052
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,520
You pay for the wine.

1053
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,560
Xiao Fei, it's on you.

1054
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,000
You're calculating women.

1055
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,040
What?

1056
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,360
I mean I'm good at calculating.

1057
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,840
You said I'm a woman who can calculate.

1058
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,840
No.

1059
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,560
We're the same, Boss Wen.

1060
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,240
You're here.

1061
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,920
Why didn't you turn on the light?

1062
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,680
What's wrong?

1063
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,160
I just found out

1064
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
that Tian family didn't take me in.

1065
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,920
They just want to use me

1066
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,560
to deal with you.

1067
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,720
They invited me to attend the wedding.

1068
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,920
They invited me to have afternoon tea.

1069
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,560
They asked me to listen to Huang Deming's words.

1070
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,720
Everything is arranged.

1071
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,360
Yes.

1072
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,960
Tian Dashao is a big deal.

1073
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,840
You'll definitely report to me.

1074
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,000
So he set a trap for us.

1075
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,960
I'm glad

1076
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,680
you didn't get hurt.

1077
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,320
Otherwise,

1078
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,000
I'd hate myself.

1079
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
How did you know it was a trap?

1080
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,360
Do you remember

1081
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,640
when I first came to the Wen's Pharmacy?

1082
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,680
You introduced me

1083
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,560
to Tian's Pharmacy to talk about cooperation.

1084
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,400
I remember

1085
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,280
when I came back,

1086
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,800
you only said you didn't get it done that day.

1087
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,320
You only said you didn't get it done that day.

1088
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,120
Not only that,

1089
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,600
I was humiliated by Tian Dashao for a long time.

1090
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,840
Oh my god.

1091
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,240
But from his

1092
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,880
attitude to me,

1093
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,560
I think

1094
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,080
the Tian family is very dissatisfied with you.

1095
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,680
But at that time,

1096
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,400
you were having a crush on Tian Dashao.

1097
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,080
I didn't want to break your heart.

1098
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
So I didn't tell you.

1099
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,240
I'm sorry, Shao Wan.

1100
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,680
Later,

1101
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,320
Tian Dashao sued Wen's Pharmacy.

1102
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,640
And at that moment,

1103
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,040
the Tian family suddenly accepted you.

1104
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,600
It doesn't fit

1105
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,440
the style of Dr. Ke and Tian Dashao.

1106
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,440
I had to doubt

1107
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,400
their intention to accept you.

1108
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,080
Later,

1109
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,080
at the most critical moment of the lawsuit,

1110
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,960
they let you, who was the first to come,

1111
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,800
hear such a private conversation.

1112
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,360
I was more suspicious.

1113
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Didn't your friend say

1114
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,800
Tian Dashao fired Claudia's assistant?

1115
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,120
Maybe we can use that person.

1116
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,320
Is that a trap?

1117
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,720
It may not be a trap.

1118
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,040
It's a trap.

1119
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,040
Why?

1120
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,280
My intuition.

1121
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,800
Your intuition counts.

1122
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,000
I believe in Miss Chu's intuition.

1123
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,920
I'm so stupid.

1124
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,200
You're not stupid.

1125
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,000
You're just worried about the mess.

1126
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,840
And

1127
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,800
you want to marry Tian Dashao so much.

1128
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,720
When we were against the Tian family,

1129
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,240
you were willing to help me.

1130
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,080
Although the news was fake,

1131
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,480
you really care about us.

1132
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,280
So I should thank you.

1133
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,000
But my concern

1134
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,400
almost hurt you.

1135
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,560
On the contrary,

1136
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,680
your concern helped us.

1137
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,800
Because we found out that Tian Dashao used you

1138
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
to set up a trap for us,

1139
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,320
we came up with a way to deal with him.

1140
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,680
I'm thinking

1141
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,040
if Tian Dashao fired Huang Deming

1142
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,120
to make a play for us,

1143
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,240
what's the purpose of the play?

1144
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,960
He must also think

1145
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,200
we're suspecting Professor Claudi.

1146
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,120
So we won't let him

1147
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,320
be exposed in court.

1148
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,960
If he pushes Huang Deming to us,

1149
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,000
he'll be destroying us

1150
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,560
with his name.

1151
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,880
That makes sense.

1152
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,640
No matter how they act,

1153
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,840
ignore them.

1154
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,800
Let Mr. Yang find more people

1155
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,520
to testify in court.

1156
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,200
I don't believe

1157
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,480
the judge doesn't believe us.

1158
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,400
Right.

1159
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,600
Talk to Huang.

1160
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,080
As long as he pays enough,

1161
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,840
I believe he'll change his mind.

1162
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,680
Why don't we

1163
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,200
do what we should do?

1164
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,280
Mr. Ge Lie

1165
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,720
looks like a scholar.

1166
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,920
He speaks English

1167
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
and knows some medical skills.

1168
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,320
That's why

1169
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,600
Tian Dashao likes him

1170
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,400
and made him pretend to be a professor in the US.

1171
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
In the past two years,

1172
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,640
he spent a lot of money

1173
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,920
to raise the fame of Claudi.

1174
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,800
Why do we have to

1175
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,160
expose him now?

1176
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,320
We can let him use us.

1177
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,040
You're exposing him to win the lawsuit?

1178
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,800
We don't want to win the lawsuit.

1179
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,160
We want the market.

1180
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,440
If he can use us,

1181
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
the market and the lawsuit

1182
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,640
will be a win-win situation.

1183
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,240
Right.

1184
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,640
Instead of buying Huang Deming,

1185
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,120
we should buy Mr. Ge Lie.

1186
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,440
How much will it cost?

1187
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,240
I don't think it's necessary.

1188
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,280
Mr. Ge Lie

1189
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,040
has a daughter named Natasha.

1190
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,960
She can tell that she loves her daughter.

1191
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,480
Otherwise, she wouldn't

1192
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,720
close her clinic.

1193
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,440
She came to Shanghai

1194
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,720
to find her daughter.

1195
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Day by day, I am quiet

1196
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Yeah yeah yeah

1197
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Day by day, I am quiet

1198
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Yeah yeah, I am not lonely anymore

1199
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,120
The wind blows, the moon shines, and the despair is gone

1200
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,320
I will fight for you

1201
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,120
I am covered in green and gray

1202
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:24,120
There is a good peace in my heart

1203
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Day by day, I am quiet

1204
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,120
Yeah yeah, I am not lonely anymore

1205
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,120
Day by day, I am quiet

1206
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,120
Yeah yeah, I am not lonely anymore

1207
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,120
The wind blows, the moon shines, and the despair is gone

1208
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,120
I will fight for you

1209
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,120
I am covered in green and gray

1210
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,120
There is a good peace in my heart

1211
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Day by day, I am quiet
