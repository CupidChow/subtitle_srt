1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sea and the sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't fall into the cage

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That is not enough, it is not enough

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the sharpness in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not enough, then let's break it

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, finally turn around

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am my greatest night star

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't let the world break through it

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is the one for me

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Shaohua, how can I repay you?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Live happily, live beautifully, live in a good state

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, I will

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are your plans in the future?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to go to Shanghai

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Shanghai?

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why do you want to go to Shanghai?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have some Shanghai guests who told me

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Shanghai is more prosperous than Beijing

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There are more opportunities than here

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I want to go to Chuanchuan

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
By the way, before you leave

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You have one more thing to do

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Get out

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Young grandma, I am sorry

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Although it's delayed a few days

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I finished what you said

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you, boss Zhao

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't say

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I, boss Zhao, have traveled the world for so many years

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I saw such a hard work for the first time

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Really?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All right, I'll send it to you

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What about us

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
As for how to deal with it,

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
you decide.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
See you later.

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,440
See you.

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,520
I don't know.

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,480
I don't know what happened.

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
I didn't see it.

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,840
I found the wrong person.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,000
I really don't know what happened.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
You really don't know.

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,240
Who are you?

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
It doesn't matter who I am.

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,880
Look at who he is.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,560
I know.

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,880
Uncle,

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
you really don't know.

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,360
I just cré 제일

57
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,400
I just know.

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,440
Here.

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,920
Great.

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,320
A smallrot.

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,620
Dec 처음.

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,760
Then here.

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,960
Erniu?

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,360
I'm lost.

65
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,760
No way, get away first.

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,000
You...

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,520
get away quickly.

68
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,000
The call�를

69
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,200
I have.

70
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Erniu, I can see you again.

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm dying without a trace.

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
I didn't expect to see you again.

73
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Erniu.

74
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Erniu.

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I've let you down.

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm not a human.

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Now you know you're not a human.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,200
After you left, I was in pain and regret tomorrow.

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
I wanted to kill myself.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
You were crying in the living room.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I was out there...

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I was out there suffering!

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,200
But what's the point of saying this now?

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
I don't know. It's useless.

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I just want you to give me a chance.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Let me make up for my mistakes.

88
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
How do you want to make up for it?

89
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Before I die, I'll be with you.

90
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I'll be good to you.

91
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I won't do anything. I'll only be good to you.

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I want to be with you.

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Be with you?

94
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Yes. Be with you.

95
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Erniu, do you remember?

96
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I was free that year.

97
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I came to see you.

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I'll buy whatever you want to eat and send it to you.

99
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Even if it's the last penny,

100
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll spend it on you.

101
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,200
You were really good to me that year.

102
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I'll continue to be good to you.

103
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I'll be good to you.

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
After all these years,

105
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I've realized that

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,200
whether I'm poor, cheated, or beaten,

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I can't stand the pain of losing you.

108
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,200
I only know how important you are to me now.

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
You know?

110
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I know. Erniu, you're the best person

111
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
in this world.

112
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,200
I can't lose you.

113
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Are you telling the truth?

114
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm telling the truth.

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Stick out your tongue.

116
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
I want to see

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
what your tongue looks like.

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
How can you say such a thing?

119
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Stick out your tongue.

120
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Dad.

121
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Do you remember?

122
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
A few days ago,

123
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I went to the bank with Young Mistress.

124
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,200
I met Young Mistress's good friend in Linfang House.

125
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I heard about it from you before.

126
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
I thought it was over.

127
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
But a few days ago,

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Young Mistress spent hundreds of silver dollars

129
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
to redeem her sister.

130
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Hundreds of silver dollars?

131
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
So, Young Mistress's friend...

132
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,200
You two... Erniu.

133
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,200
You two... Who... What sister?

134
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
We... We're talking about

135
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
the opera that Dazhuang heard yesterday.

136
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Yes, Madam.

137
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I went to the opera last night.

138
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,200
What hundreds of silver dollars?

139
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,200
In the playbook.

140
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
You went to the opera last night?

141
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Yes, I went to the opera.

142
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Shaohua.

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Erniu.

144
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
You finally arrived.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
You brought Xuanxuan here?

146
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Yes.

147
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
I brought her here

148
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
because I wanted to see her.

149
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
I wanted to say that I wanted to see her.

150
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Look, she's asleep.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
She's so cute.

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Shaohua.

153
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
I can't have my own child

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
in my life.

155
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Erniu.

156
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Xuanxuan is your daughter.

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
She's your daughter.

158
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
From now on,

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I'll take Xuanxuan to Shanghai to see you.

160
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I promise.

161
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
By the way,

162
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
take this.

163
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I'll take it all.

164
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
I have Chen's address in it.

165
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
I'm here.

166
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
When you arrive in Shanghai,

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
you must write me a letter at once.

168
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I know.

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Shaohua,

170
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I'll come back to Shanghai

171
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
with a grand return.

172
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Erniu.

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I just hope you can be safe.

174
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Don't worry.

175
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I have to go.

176
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Go.

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Be careful.

178
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Shaohua,

179
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
you must be fine.

180
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Don't worry about me.

181
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Go back.

182
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
You have to take care of yourself.

183
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Listen to me.

184
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Hundreds of tons?

185
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Tons.

186
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Which man told you?

187
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
The black and thin one.

188
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Little Stone.

189
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
He's always on a high.

190
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
He rarely talks nonsense.

191
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
I'm not talking nonsense.

192
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm talking nonsense.

193
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
I tell you

194
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
The big guy

195
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,680
He must have secretly moved the money

196
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
To his mother's house

197
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,320
I told you before

198
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,280
Can't marry a poor family

199
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,440
Don't listen

200
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,040
Hundreds of sheep

201
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,920
If you go on like this

202
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,280
It won't take a year

203
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,080
We have to move our Chenji Pharmacy to nothing

204
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,120
Say less

205
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,720
Really

206
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Sister-in-law

207
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,240
Song Ping

208
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,520
Sister-in-law, you're back

209
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,480
Something happened

210
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,480
what happened

211
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
Thank you

212
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,480
what happened

213
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,160
Dad is beating big brother

214
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,280
Big brother stole two hundred yuan from the account

215
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
Was discovered

216
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,960
Da Shun, you have to tell the truth

217
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,800
Did your wife take that money?

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,680
No

219
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,160
It has nothing to do with Shaohua

220
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,200
I took advantage of it

221
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,440
You, what did you do with that money?

222
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,400
I

223
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,360
I that

224
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,880
Drinking wine is strong

225
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,880
I

226
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,600
What are you doing

227
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,880
dad

228
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,360
Shaohua

229
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
This is nothing to you, go back to your house

230
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,360
Don't be angry, don't be angry

231
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,040
Shaohua

232
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,040
Shaohua, you tell the truth

233
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,880
What did you do

234
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,000
dad

235
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,480
That two hundred yuan was used by Da Shun

236
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,680
But he did it because of me

237
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,880
What are you doing, Shaohua

238
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,480
What did I say

239
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
What did I say

240
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,600
OK, OK, OK

241
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,840
Say it

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,480
What did you do with that money?

243
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
A sister who grew up with me

244
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
Killed by bad people

245
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
I fell into Linfang House

246
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,840
I want to redeem him

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,320
But I don't have enough money

248
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,640
Da Shun knew he wanted to help me

249
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,000
So he borrowed two hundred yuan from the account

250
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,200
What is Linfang House

251
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,720
You take the money

252
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,040
You want to redeem that kind of person

253
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,480
I can't do this kind of thing

254
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
ridiculous

255
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
dad, mom

256
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,480
Don't blame him, Shun

257
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,200
This is my business

258
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,640
I have to fight and punish

259
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,440
dad

260
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,920
I used that public money

261
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,080
Shaohua knows nothing

262
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,360
If you want to punish, punish me

263
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,760
Can you get back these two hundred yuan?

264
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,160
Mom, don't worry

265
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,600
Before the end of the year

266
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,840
I can pay back the money

267
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,680
You eat our Chen family

268
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,000
Use our Chen family

269
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,400
Live in our Chen family

270
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,680
What do you pay back

271
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
Although I live at home

272
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,880
But I have been making money for my family

273
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,600
You make that little money

274
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,160
dad

275
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,320
This year, I and Shaohua will not share the red

276
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,360
Share the red

277
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,840
You think your little share of the red money

278
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,720
Can you fill this hole?

279
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,040
Then don't need to share it tomorrow

280
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,000
When to fill

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,880
When to share

282
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,120
Then you mean

283
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,400
If you can't fill it for ten years or twenty years

284
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,040
Then this money

285
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,000
Can't be returned for ten years or twenty years

286
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,160
It won't take long

287
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,480
I said before the end of the year

288
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
I can pay back this money

289
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,920
Where is the interest?

290
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,400
Where is the penalty?

291
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,240
You say

292
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,920
Before the end of the year

293
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
I paid back two thousand yuan

294
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,720
Is that enough?

295
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,040
Shaohua, what are you talking about?

296
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,640
You said it yourself

297
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,960
Shaohua

298
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,040
What if you can't do it?

299
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Can't do it

300
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,320
I just

301
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Keep working

302
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,120
I don't want a cent

303
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,600
I don't want to share the red

304
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,040
good

305
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,840
Good

306
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,360
This is what you said

307
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,320
Get up

308
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,760
Master

309
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,800
Master

310
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
This little uncle is so

311
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,080
What are you doing?

312
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,680
Get up

313
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,640
Get up

314
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,360
Why don't you tell me?

315
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,960
It's from the factory

316
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,600
If I tell you

317
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,440
It will definitely make you embarrassed

318
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,120
Then of course I can't tell you

319
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,960
You don't have to tell me

320
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm afraid I'll break your leg

321
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
If you can't save Erniu

322
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,960
You must be sad

323
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,000
Compared to breaking your leg

324
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm afraid you will be sad

325
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,040
Dasha

326
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,760
Dasha

327
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,720
What's the matter

328
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,680
But you already praise Haikou

329
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,180
South China

330
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,280
Yes

331
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,920
How did you make money?

332
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,240
this is our

333
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,460
Oh good

334
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,800
Hey, this is our Chenji Pharmaceutical Store's initiatives

335
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,920
It's whiter and softer.

336
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,400
It's the best time

337
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,320
to get rid of the bad air.

338
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,560
It's important to protect the air

339
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,440
so we need to use

340
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,200
the five-flavor Long Yan Yangshen

341
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,520
to protect the skin.

342
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,280
Hello.

343
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,960
Please have a look at

freebie.

You can buy the medicine directly.

We also have

348

and beauty-scented salt.

350
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,520
Please understand.

351
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
If you order enough now,

352
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,840
the price will be better.

353
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,920

I also have

for your face.

357
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,880
As for the big summer,

358
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
it's called winter disease.

359
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,240
This is the best time

360
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,480
to take care of Yangshen.

361
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,480
This freebie

362
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,200
is the one you can buy

00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,160
directly from our Chen's Pharmacy.

is dedicated to the service of the patient.

are great.

369
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,920
By the way,

370
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,000
we also have

371
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,280
new powder.

372
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,480
Many girls like it now.

373
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,760
If you like it

374
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,400

Be careful.

384
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,680
I'm leaving.

385
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,360
Take care.

386
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,640
You're back.

387
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,320
Come on.

388
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,040
Are you tired?

389
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
How's your harvest today?

390
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,440
Today,

391
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,160
I went to fifteen shops

392
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,160
and bought eight new products.

393
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,900
I sold fifteen boxes of

394
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,440
oil powder and eight boxes of oil cream.

395
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,400
Can you help me?

396
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,760
How much did I earn

397
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
so far?

398
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,320
In total,

399
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,080
I earned

400
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,680
one hundred and fifty-two yuan.

401
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,760
Only one hundred and fifty-two?

402
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,440
What?

403
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't you believe my calculation?

404
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,000
Look for yourself.

405
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,560
No.

406
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,320
Oh, no.

407
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,040
Listen.

408
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,080
By the end of this year,

409
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,240
I won't be able to earn

410
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,160
the two thousand yuan.

411
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,760
It's only a year.

412
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
You're still young.

413
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,120
But I've tried all the tricks I can.

414
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
It's okay. Don't be angry.

415
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,960
Drink more.

416
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Why didn't you

417
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,440
persuade me at that time?

418
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,960
I was impulsive

419
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,200
and bragged to your father.

420
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,400
At worst,

421
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,720
you can be a servant

422
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,280
who never wants money

423
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,480
in our family.

424
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,240
No way.

425
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,640
I'll lose money.

426
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,400
We're a family.

427
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,360
We can't lose money.

428
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,160
Is the shopkeeper here?

429
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,800
Yes.

430
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,400
Hello, sir.

431
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,320
What can I do for you?

432
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,600
I'm Gao Qianyi,

433
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,640
the shopkeeper in Beijing.

434
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,400
Mr. Gao?

435
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,640
So many people.

436
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,560
How are you today?

437
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,360
What's going on?

438
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,720
What's going on?

439
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,520
Let go.

440
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,880
Boss.

441
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,240
Take it.

442
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,720
Take it.

443
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,880
Go buy some good food.

444
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Thank you, sir.

445
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm sorry.

446
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,840
I'm sorry.

447
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,760
Don't mention it.

448
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,120
I'm also sorry

449
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,520
for the reputation of

450
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
Yulong powder in Chenji Pharmacy.

451
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,680
Today,

452
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,880
I'm here to collect the money.

453
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
Mr. Gao, you're so kind.

454
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,640
Come on. This way, please.

455
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,480
Please.

456
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,000
Come on.

457
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
Are they all my daughters-in-law?

458
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,440
They're all her daughters-in-law.

459
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,400
They're all

460
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,200
the daughters-in-law's daughters.

461
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,240
They're all her daughters-in-law's.

462
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,000
So, Mr. Gao,

463
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,520
I really don't know

464
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,640
what you're talking about.

465
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,240
All right.

466
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,600
Hua.

467
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,880
I'll call you.

468
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,400
Dad.

469
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,280
Dad.

470
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,400
Great.

471
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,160
Then,

472
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,600
let me,

473
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,000
give you a detailed answer.

474
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,200
Come on.

475
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,680
Greetings, Mr. Gao.

476
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,160
Thank you, Young Mistress.

477
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,480
What do you want to know?

478
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,160
As far as I know,

479
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,840
Chenji Yulong powder

480
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
is very popular

481
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,040
in the market.

482
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
I found out this time

483
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
that in addition to Yulong powder,

484
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
we also launched

485
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,720
Yurong Double, Yurong Leaf,

486
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,520
Yurong High,

487
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,880
and Yurong Mimou High.

488
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,360
I wonder

489
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,800
what they are for.

490
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,040
This Yurong Leaf

491
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,720
is used to wash your face.

492
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,360
After washing your face,

493
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
use this Yurong Double to apply

494
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,560
Yurong powder.

495
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,280
The effect is better than

496
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,480
applying Yurong powder directly.

497
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,360
If you hold it in a straight line,

498
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,160
your skin can be long-lasting

499
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,480
and white.

500
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,080
So annoying.

501
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,440
You love beauty.

502
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,520
Everyone has a quality.

503
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,680
Why are you so annoying?

504
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,320
In my original calculation,

505
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,120
if there is one tenth of

506
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,040
the rich people in Beijing

507
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,320
use this Yurong powder,

508
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,640
it can be used for a month.

509
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,520
Then the profit of Chenji Pharmacy

510
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,160
will be quite considerable.

511
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,240
But now,

512
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,960
Young Mistress

513
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,240
has added Yurong Double

514
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,840
and Yurong Leaf

515
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,720
on this Yurong powder.

516
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,560
This profit

517
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,680
is several times that of before.

518
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,760
That's right.

519
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,080
If I'm not mistaken,

520
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,040
Yurong is a famous dog.

521
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,160
It's a name for its four wings.

522
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,440
It's used around the eyes.

523
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,200
That's right.

524
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,800
Then,

525
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
what about Meng Tianlu?

526
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,400
This is

527
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,320
specially applied before going to bed.

528
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,440
It allows women to

529
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,280
nourish their skin

530
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,640
in their sleep.

531
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,800
After waking up,

532
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,160
it will be glowing.

533
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,720
You still have that?

534
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,200
Manager Gao,

535
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,000
take one bottle back

536
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,680
and try it on for Madam.

537
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,920
Thank you, Young Mistress.

538
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,560
The beauty formula is well-known

539
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,600
and not rare.

540
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,360
But Young Mistress

541
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,600
has been able to develop it.

542
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,520
I admire you.

543
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,800
Manager Gao, you flatter me.

544
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,520
My original intention

545
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,560
is just to

546
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,640
increase some customers

547
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,280
for Chenji Pharmacy.

548
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,000
I can see

549
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,040
Young Mistress's ambition

550
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,680
is not that great.

551
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
Manager Gao, why do you say that?

552
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,080
If it's just to expand

553
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,960
Chenji Pharmacy's customers,

554
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,640
why would Young Mistress

555
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,720
buy off the image of a woman?

556
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,760
Why would she

557
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,360
make a good impression

558
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,200
on Chenji Pharmacy?

559
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,560
Boss Zhao,

560
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,240
if Chenji Pharmacy

561
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,040
wants to expand

562
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,200
the Yurong powder series,

563
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,760
we are willing to help

564
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,680
with the first-round medicine store.

565
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,280
Manager Gao,

566
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,200
you mean

567
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
our two families

568
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,400
will jointly develop

569
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,080
and sell the Yurong powder.

570
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,840
I wonder

571
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,240
what Boss Chen thinks.

572
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,160
Manager Gao,

573
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,280
the first-round medicine store

574
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,160
is the current national medicine market.

575
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,640
The first and second medicine stores

576
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,080
can cooperate with you.

577
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,000
It's the honor

578
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,440
of Chenji Pharmacy.

579
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,400
Boss Chen, you flatter me.

580
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,240
Our first-round medicine store

581
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,960
is just a small business

582
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,320
in the north and south of the Yangtze River.

583
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,000
If we

584
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,280
jointly develop the Yurong powder,

585
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,680
I dare not say anything else.

586
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,800
All the medicine stores

587
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,960
under our first-round medicine store

588
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,560
and hundreds of drug stores

589
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,880
will do their best.

590
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,360
Manager Gao,

591
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,000
that's great.

592
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,960
Thanks to Boss Chen's kindness,

593
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,920
I'll set up a banquet

594
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,200
at the Six Hotel.

595
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,080
Boss Chen,

596
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,160
Young Master,

597
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,840
please give us a reward.

598
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,400
We'll sit down

599
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,280
and discuss the details.

600
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,800
Six Hotel?

601
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,480
Yes.

602
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I wonder if Boss Chen

603
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,280
will be free that day.

604
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,600
Whatever.

605
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,600
It depends on Manager Gao.

606
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,520
I'm free.

607
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,720
Please set a date.

608
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,160
Okay.

609
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,560
It's better to set a date

610
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,040
tonight.

611
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,120
That's great.

612
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,920
Young Master, please come.

613
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,800
Me?

614
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,320
Yes.

615
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,400
He'll come, too.

616
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,240
I'll be at Six Hotel

617
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,400
at six tonight.

618
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,040
I'll wait for you.

619
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,000
Thank you, Manager Gao.

620
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,520
See you.

621
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,440
See you.

622
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Take care.

623
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,720
Boss Chen, please wait.

624
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,600
Take care.

625
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,480
When we were in the hometown,

626
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,680
you said you'd take me

627
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,520
to the Six Hotel

628
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
to see it.

629
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,160
I didn't expect it to be like this.

630
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,360
I heard

631
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,440
that they can afford

632
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,560
to pay a year's salary

633
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,120
for a regular person's family.

634
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,320
I also heard that

635
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,320
the people there are foreigners.

636
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,680
What's wrong?

637
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
What are you thinking about?

638
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,720
I'm thinking

639
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,800
that Shouyuan Pharmaceuticals

640
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,840
has a big business.

641
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,000
If we compare our Chenji Pharmaceuticals

642
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,280
to them, we'll be like ants and elephants.

643
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,680
Let's just forget it.

644
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,960
Since Shouyuan Pharmaceuticals

645
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
can make a big business,

646
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,160
it means they're not stupid.

647
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,280
Right?

648
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,400
They know that

649
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,200
our Chenji Pharmaceuticals

650
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
has a great ability.

651
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,480
They even took the initiative to cooperate.

652
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,600
It means

653
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,720
they like our individuality.

654
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,160
They all value us so much.

655
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,280
We have no reason

656
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,520
to underestimate ourselves.

657
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,240
You're right.

658
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,280
But I still feel

659
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,720
uncomfortable.

660
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,560
Do you think

661
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,360
that Shouyuan Pharmaceuticals' boss is Jiayuan

662
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,520
and you feel uncomfortable?

663
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,440
Yes.

664
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,800
They're both business égalites.

665
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,520
If they can't do the job,

666
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
then they want to have a grandchild.

667
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,080
that's great.

668
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
That transitioning

669
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,080
can't happenaratally.

670
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,720
But at most,

671
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,940
they can't do a

672
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,340
big business without

673
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,320
even having to earn in the Li cabec hall.

674
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,480
This is both great.

675
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,240
Even if we are in danger,

676
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,280
it's not like that.

677
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,480
My little girl was angry.

678
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Go and change your clothes.

679
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,840
Okay.

680
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,320
That black tie-up jacket.

681
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,400
What a waste.

682
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,960
Isn't it this one?

683
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,680
Six Hotel.

684
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,560
Six Hotel.

685
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,400
I asked from afar.

686
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,880
I looked at it.

687
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
I didn't dare to go in.

688
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,720
Don't worry.

689
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,720
Once the cooperation with Shouyuan Pharmaceutical Company is completed,

690
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,280
I'll take you to see it with my money.

691
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,560
No.

692
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
Let's see how it is.

693
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
I'm not going.

694
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,680
Look.

695
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,000
You have to spend money there.

696
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,480
I heard there are many foreigners there.

697
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,440
I'll save the money for him.

698
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,480
Save it.

699
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,280
You only know to save money.

700
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,880
You don't know...

701
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,480
Dad.

702
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,800
The car is here.

703
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,680
Dad.

704
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,320
Mom.

705
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,640
Okay.

706
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,360
You're dressed so gracefully.

707
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,640
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

708
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,760
Mom.

709
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,040
What kind of flower is this?

710
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,920
The more he dresses,

711
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,680
the more he will be proud of our family.

712
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Do you understand?

713
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:16,960
Let's go.

714
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,600
Wait.

715
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,640
I'll change this.

716
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,200
Take it.

717
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,200
Don't let others underestimate our Chen family.

718
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,200
Thank you, mom.

719
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,480
Don't you dare to lose it.

720
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,080
You have to return it to me when you come back.

721
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,400
Will you let him stay?

722
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,400
Yes.

723
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,200
Really.

724
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,800
Let's go.

725
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,400
Let's go.

726
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,320
Mom, we're leaving.

727
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,920
Let's go.

728
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,560
Bye.

729
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,200
Bye.

730
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,800
Bye.

731
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,400
Bye.

732
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Bye.

733
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,600
Bye.

734
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,200
Bye.

735
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,800
Bye.

736
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,400
Bye.

737
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,000
Bye.

738
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,600
Bye.

739
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,200
Bye.

740
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,800
Bye.

741
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,400
Bye.

742
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,000
Bye.

743
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,600
We're leaving.

744
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,200
Bye, mom.

745
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,600
Let's go.

746
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,400
Let's go.

747
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Boss Chen.

748
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,800
Young Master.

749
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,600
Young Mistress.

750
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,400
Manager Gao.

751
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,200
Welcome.

752
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,800
Come on.

753
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,600
This way, please.

754
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,200
You.

755
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,000
Please.

756
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
Come on, Young Master.

757
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Come on, Boss Chen.

758
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Come on, this way.

759
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,000
You should go to jail to receive him.

760
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,800
You didn't come.

761
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
You're so unlucky.

762
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Come on.

763
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Come on, Young Master.

764
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,200
Come on.

765
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Come on.

766
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,600
Come on.

767
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,200
Come on.

768
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,800
Come on.

769
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,400
Come on.

770
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Come on.

771
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,800
Come on.

772
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,600
Come on, Young Master.

773
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,300
This way.

774
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,200
You.

775
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,100
Be careful.

776
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,200
Ah...

777
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,400
Be careful, please.

778
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,200
Okay.

779
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,700
Thank you, sir.

780
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,200
Why you came with me?

781
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,800
Thank you.

782
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Thanks.

783
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,440
and the big shopkeeper

784
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,040
went to Yingzhou temporarily.

785
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,840
So tonight,

786
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,400
I'm the only one

787
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,640
who can be the host

788
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,920
of Boss Chen's family.

789
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,640
Mr. Gao, thank you.

790
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,880
You're welcome.

791
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,720
Come on.

792
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,320
Taigu Pharmaceuticals

793
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,560
are also very strong.

794
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,400
Why didn't they sell it in the local market

795
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,080
and chose to come to Beijing?

796
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,400
Young Mistress,

797
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,160
you don't know that

798
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,520
Taigu Pharmaceuticals

799
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,800
are mainly

800
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,360
from Guangbang.

801
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
They make precious medicines.

802
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,640
This time, they came to Beijing

803
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,240
to buy

804
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,120
military-medical herbs

805
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,840
that are needed in the battlefield.

806
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,760
Are they going to war?

807
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,280
The military government

808
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,080
has been established in Guangdong.

809
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,680
I'm afraid that

810
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,160
the war in the north and south

811
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,240
can't be avoided.

812
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,480
The people

813
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,360
are going to suffer again.

814
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
Young Master, you're kind and kind.

815
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,920
I admire you.

816
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,480
Come on.

817
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,280
Gao Meng,

818
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,520
a toast to you.

819
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,160
Come on.

820
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,320
Boss Gao, you're too kind.

821
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,640
Come on.

822
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
I'll have a toast, too.

823
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,920
May the world be peaceful

824
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,920
and may the people live a peaceful life.

825
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,040
You're really a match made in heaven.

826
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,080
Come on.

827
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,640
Come on.

828
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,880
Come on.

829
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,080
War is war.

830
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,880
It's war.

831
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,280
Business is business.

832
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,720
At least,

833
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,320
we can get 30,000 taels of silver.

834
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,680
That's about right.

835
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,640
The first batch of medicinal herbs

836
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,480
must be

837
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,160
the first batch of medicinal herbs.

838
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,440
Boss Chen, you're so kind.

839
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
To be honest,

840
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,040
the top ten medicinal herbs

841
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,240
in China at the moment

842
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,960
are all looking at this fat piece of meat.

843
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,720
The top ten medicinal herbs

844
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,680
are unlikely to be taken down.

845
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,680
Boss Gao,

846
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,840
if we can't take down the top ten medicinal herbs,

847
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm afraid that

848
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,080
others can't take them down.

849
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,880
No, no, no.

850
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,920
All right, all right.

851
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,240
I'll congratulate the top ten medicinal herbs here.

852
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,680
Boss Gao,

853
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,120
I'll take Boss Chen's word as a yes.

854
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,280
I hope so.

855
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,920
Thank you.

856
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Come on, sit down.

857
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,520
We're just talking about business.

858
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,320
Let's eat.

859
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,920
All right.

860
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,640
Please.

861
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,840
Come on.

862
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,400
Please.

863
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,680
Boss Chen,

864
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,520
I'll follow what we just talked about

865
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,120
and set a contract for cooperation.

866
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,040
Please.

867
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,680
Please.

868
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,400
Are you all right?

869
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm fine.

870
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,040
Are you all right?

871
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,920
Mr. Xu,

872
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,360
you've been paid for today.

873
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,480
What are you talking about?

874
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,720
It's our honor to have you here.

875
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,640
All right, all right.

876
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,720
Thank you.

877
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,520
All right.

878
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,320
Be careful.

879
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,920
All right, see you later.

880
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,480
Send the guest to Beijing Hotel.

881
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,960
All right.

882
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,520
Mr. Xu,

883
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,680
the car is here.

884
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,440
Boss Gao,

885
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,600
I'll take my leave.

886
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,360
Boss Chen, have a safe trip.

887
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,320
See you.

888
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,920
All right.

889
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,880
Young Mistress,

890
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
please.

891
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,520
All right.

892
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,480
Thirty thousand military medicine orders.

893
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,800
How can we

894
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,840
make a profit of ten thousand?

895
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,720
Shouyue Pharmaceutical Company is very good.

896
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,680
They have their own pharmacy

897
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,160
in every medicine factory.

898
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,240
I'm afraid it's not worth it.

899
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,120
What if I do it?

900
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
What are you thinking about?

901
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,000
I want to do business.

902
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
Although we don't have

903
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,240
the cost advantage of Shouyue Pharmaceutical Company,

904
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,560
I think

905
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,320
we can make five thousand.

906
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,280
How can we

907
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,800
get the order?

908
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,640
Why not?

909
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,840
Didn't you hear Boss Gao?

910
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,440
The top ten pharmacy in China

911
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,320
is watching us.

912
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,720
Don't think about it.

913
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,840
Let's just

914
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,440
do our small business.

915
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,760
Small business is important.

916
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,120
Big business is important, too.

917
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,760
But some things are useless.

918
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,680
Dashun,

919
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,520
I think

920
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,000
we can try.

921
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,720
You can't do it?

922
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,600
What if it works?

923
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,080
Impossible.

924
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,920
Look.

925
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,760
Xuanxuan doesn't want to do it.

926
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,920
She thinks you're a big shot.

927
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,240
Thank you.

928
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,160
Hello.

929
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,680
I'm Chu Shaohua from Chenji Pharmaceutical.

930
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,600
I'm here to visit

931
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,560
the purchasing specialist of Shanxi Yandu Army.

932
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,680
And I'd like to ask you to pass on my message.

933
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,800
The specialist has sent a message.

934
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,200
The people here don't pass on the message.

935
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,160
Brother,

936
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,320
please help me.

937
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,720
I can't help you.

938
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,760
Look at these people.

939
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,320
They're all here to visit the specialist.

940
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,840
You find a place to wait.

941
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,240
Thank you.

942
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,560
In Beijing,

943
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,360
everyone knows

944
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,760
your name is Han Chun Tang.

945
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,920
You're Han Chun Tang.

946
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,960
You're Han Chun Tang.

947
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,080
You're Han Chun Tang.

948
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
You're Han Chun Tang.

949
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
You're Han Chun Tang.

950
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,400
You're Han Chun Tang.

951
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,480
I just have a name.

952
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,120
Compared to your Qingyu Pharmaceutical,

953
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
it's far worse.

954
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,920
Thank you.

955
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
Who else is here

956
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,200
besides us?

957
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,400
Master Tian is here, too.

958
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,480
Which Master Tian?

959
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,280
Master Tian of Shanghai's Tian Shi Pharmaceutical.

960
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,320
Tian Shi Pharmaceutical is here.

961
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,600
I'm afraid we have no hope.

962
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,280
Tian's family is here, too.

963
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,560
They're so famous.

964
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,400
They even have a small business with us.

965
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Master Xu is here.

966
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,080
Master Xu!

967
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,560
Master Xu!

968
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,440
Master Xu!

969
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,200
Master Xu!

970
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,400
Master Xu!

971
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,680
Master Xu!

972
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,720
Master Xu!

973
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,760
Master Xu!

974
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm the one who needs a name.

975
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,520
Master Xu!

976
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,160
Master Xu!

977
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Look at me!

978
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,200
I'm telling you, Master Xu!

979
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,440
Boss clearer

980
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,040
Ok

981
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,680
Check it

982
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,280
Ok

983
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,920
Before liquidity

984
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,200
we

985
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,880
come again

986
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:52,840
ไม่ climb

987
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
Ok

988
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,160
Did you forget the major you at cualquier corner missing?

989
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,040
What are you doing?

990
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Are you trying to scare me?

991
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,360
I'm afraid of you.

992
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Mr. Xu.

993
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,280
Don't be so mean to her.

994
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,120
You're kidding me?

995
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,960
Look who my mother is.

996
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,680
Who are you?

997
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,760
I...

998
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,920
When did you

999
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,160
have such a beautiful mother in Beijing?

1000
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,400
I've never seen you before.

1001
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,560
You're a talent.

1002
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
You're a mother now.

1003
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,240
You're a little more mature.

1004
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,000
Don't touch me.

1005
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,000
How about this?

1006
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,600
I'll take you back to Shanxi.

1007
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,000
I'll make you delicious,

1008
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,680
luxurious and rich for the rest of your life.

1009
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,400
What do you think?

1010
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,400
You're not allowed to touch this!

1011
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,160
Mr. Xu.

1012
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,040
Don't be so mean to a servant.

1013
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:52,880
Mr. Xu.

1014
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,960
Get out!

1015
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,120
Are you all right?

1016
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm fine.

1017
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,600
I was beaten by him just now.

1018
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,320
Here you are.

1019
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,200
You're bleeding.

1020
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,320
Thank you.

1021
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,400
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

1022
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,920
I...

1023
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,040
I heard

1024
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
that Hao Se

1025
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,160
is the uncle of the wife of the army.

1026
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
And that one is

1027
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,160
the cousin of Mrs. Yi.

1028
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,800
I think they're not

1029
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,080
good at fighting.

1030
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
Not only that.

1031
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,600
They always fight

1032
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,160
and almost fight several times.

1033
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,640
Why?

1034
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,120
I think it's because of the purchase.

1035
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,080
Who's to blame?

1036
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,800
By the way,

1037
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,360
who's that man in military uniform?

1038
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,640
That man is a businessman.

1039
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,920
He's a good man.

1040
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,880
But he can't say anything

1041
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,400
in front of those two people.

1042
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,600
Take this.

1043
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,680
Buy some delicious food for your mother.

1044
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,800
Sister Hua.

1045
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,480
Sister Hua.

1046
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,200
You...

1047
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,800
You helped me clean up

1048
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,280
and gave me medicine.

1049
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,120
You even bought me so many good things.

1050
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,280
How can I take your money?

1051
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,000
Take it.

1052
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,040
I'll trouble you in the future.

1053
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,840
Thank you, Sister Hua.

1054
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,960
You can borrow it.

1055
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
There's still some food left.

1056
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,800
Tell me if you're not full.

1057
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,920
Da Shun.

1058
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,600
Where have you been?

1059
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,680
Manager Gao is here.

1060
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,520
I've been here for a long time.

1061
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm talking to Father about the contract.

1062
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,240
I completely understand

1063
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,520
Boss Chen's thoughts.

1064
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,000
If you go back and work with Boss Xia,

1065
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
we can work together.

1066
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,360
Of course.

1067
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,720
If Boss Chen changes his mind,

1068
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,480
I'll wait for him at any time.

1069
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,320
Manager Gao.

1070
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,880
Thank you.

1071
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,760
Manager Gao.

1072
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,560
Young Mistress is back.

1073
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,720
Yes.

1074
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,920
I just got back.

1075
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,000
You're leaving?

1076
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,680
I have a lot of things to do.

1077
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
I'm in a hurry.

1078
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,040
Manager Gao.

1079
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,680
The order for the first-aid kit

1080
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
and the military supply order for Shanxi

1081
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,440
should be signed, right?

1082
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,720
Not yet.

1083
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,640
Don't you think

1084
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,520
Shanxi's special envoy

1085
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,720
doesn't like the first-aid kit?

1086
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,040
That's not true.

1087
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,520
Then...

1088
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,200
Then...

1089
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,520
Then why?

1090
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,520
Our Chief Manager

1091
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,640
talked to the special envoy

1092
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,680
quite well.

1093
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,560
But another drug store

1094
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,120
went the wrong way.

1095
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,800
So they created some other problems.

1096
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,400
Oh.

1097
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,080
Which drug store is this?

1098
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,440
How dare they

1099
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,760
steal the first-aid kit?

1100
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,000
Tian's in Shanghai.

1101
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,040
Boss Chen.

1102
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,280
Young Master.

1103
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,000
Young Mistress.

1104
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,480
I'll leave now.

1105
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,320
Take care.

1106
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,280
Wait. Wait.

1107
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,640
Dad.

1108
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,520
How is it?

1109
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,600
Is it a success?

1110
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
I'm afraid

1111
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,760
I can't do it.

1112
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,160
Why?

1113
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,560
They want us to hand over

1114
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,640
the formula of the bath powder.

1115
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,320
Each box

1116
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,600
of the first-aid kit

1117
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,840
will take

1118
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,440
60% of the profit.

1119
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
This bath powder is ours.

1120
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
They just help us sell it.

1121
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,320
So how should we

1122
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,520
take the big one?

1123
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,480
That's the reason.

1124
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,520
But they insist on

1125
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,920
sharing the formula

1126
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,040
and profit.

1127
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,880
It's 40% to 60%.

1128
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,040
How can I agree to it?

1129
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,200
The first-aid kit

1130
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,840
is too much.

1131
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,160
Dad.

1132
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,560
I think

1133
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,040
we can only accept

1134
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
these two conditions.

1135
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,120
Tell me.

1136
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,040
Right now,

1137
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,120
we can sell

1138
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,720
2,000 boxes every month.

1139
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,200
Each box is worth 50 cents.

1140
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,120
The profit

1141
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,080
is at most 1,000 yuan.

1142
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,320
But the first-aid kit

1143
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,280
has a number

1144
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,320
and a partner.

1145
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,240
If we join them,

1146
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,920
we can sell at least 6,000 boxes every month.

1147
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,920
Even if we give them

1148
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,960
60% of the profit,

1149
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,240
we can get 1,200 yuan

1150
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,560
in monthly income.

1151
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,520
Compared to before,

1152
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,120
we can get

1153
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,440
200 yuan in monthly profit.

1154
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,440
The formula is in our hands.

1155
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,800
But we

1156
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,880
can only increase

1157
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,520
200 yuan's income.

1158
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,360
Isn't it a big loss?

1159
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,680
The formula of the powder

1160
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,440
is not worth it.

1161
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,760
It's selling well now

1162
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,360
because we have a chance.

1163
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Day by day,

1164
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,960
night by night,

1165
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,320
there is regret.

1166
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,960
Little by little,

1167
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,560
I am not lonely anymore.

1168
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,520
When the fire burns out,

1169
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,960
the hope is bright.

1170
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,240
I will give my all for you.

1171
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,000
I will go through the hardships

1172
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,600
and reach eternity in my heart.
