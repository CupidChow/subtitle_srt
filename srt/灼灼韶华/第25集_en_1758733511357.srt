And if I see him again,

62
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,640
can you continue to dress up as my fiancé?

63
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,840
No, I won't do that.

64
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,440
I have my own way.

65
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm just borrowing your name.

66
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm not really dating you.

67
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,840
I'm just a person who doesn't sell his name.

68
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,860
Draw as Recreational President

69
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,540
school so that I can pin you.

70
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,640
Purposefully,

71
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,020
I only serve as a

72
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,040
managing director of family processing and vibes department.

73
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,040
But I'm just a point and he should have a word.

74
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,360
Passwind.

75
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,440
Insert me a reason.

76
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
Let's turn down kind-hearted Germans

77
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,940
and kill them.

78
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,180
What can I do for you?

79
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,460
What do you want?

80
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,060
The complex from Hu Guwan

81
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
will be changed next month.

82
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,020
Sure.

83
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,580
Theенный

84
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,800
MP

85
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,340
will be posterized.

86
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,260
Of course.

87
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,820
And

88
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,460
I'll pay attention to you next time.

89
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,660
Don't be so annoying.

90
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,860
I'm the boss.

91
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,500
Okay, boss.

92
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,180
I'll pay attention to you next time.

93
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,300
Okay.

94
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,820
That's all.

95
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,060
That's all?

96
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,820
Thank you, Zhi Qiu.

97
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,860
I think

98
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,340
something's wrong with you today.

99
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,980
You're the one who's wrong.

100
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,780
You're back.

101
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,380
I thought the door was locked.

102
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,460
Why are you here?

103
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,660
I was waiting for you.

104
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,740
How are you today?

105
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,820
I'm fine.

106
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,180
Guess who I met.

107
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,100
Who?

108
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,100
Xia Chu.

109
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,420
Didn't he go to France?

110
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,300
He's back.

111
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,020
He's also

112
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,100
with his girlfriend.

113
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,140
He has a girlfriend?

114
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,900
You two

115
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,740
look like a good match.

116
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,980
You're very happy.

117
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,620
Maybe this is the best chance.

118
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,260
All right.

119
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,660
Where's Wen Zhi Qiu?

120
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,340
Wen Zhi Qiu?

121
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,300
You met him too?

122
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,900
Did he tell you?

123
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,660
Did he tell you?

124
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Of course I know.

125
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,500
He said,

126
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,860
how did you reply?

127
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,580
Just a normal reply.

128
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,620
I think his idea is very good.

129
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,620
Then?

130
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,380
Let's talk about it later.

131
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
Then...

132
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,300
Then I'll keep working.

133
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,900
What did Wen Zhi Qiu

134
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,940
tell you?

135
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,340
He said that Wen Zhi Qiu

136
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,020
is the future prospect of my house.

137
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,620
And then?

138
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,020
What else can it be?

139
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,580
But this is the best result.

140
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,420
I'm still very lucky

141
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,300
to have a good sister like you

142
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,980
and my own career.

143
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,260
And a good partner like Wen Zhi Qiu.

144
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,500
Wen Zhi Qiu?

145
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,020
This wine,

146
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,180
оны sent it for you.

147
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,260
Come down

148
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,060
and try it.

149
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,540
Wait.

150
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,540
Boss.

151
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,260
They are here.

152
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,380
Huh?

153
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,820
I'm here to support you.

154
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,500
You should...

155
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,380
Congratulations.

156
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,180
Watch out.

157
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,700
I'm Chu Shaohua's

158
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,740
fiance now.

159
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,580
Shaohua told me

160
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,300
Xia Chu is back.

161
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,620
You didn't confess to her.

162
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,140
You've prepared so much.

163
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,820
Why can't you

164
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,980
fight for it?

165
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,540
You know her.

166
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,980
She's always

167
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,740
calm,

168
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,860
clear-minded

169
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,940
and...

170
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,860
sharp.

171
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,300
Yes.

172
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,180
Like a knife.

173
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,260
A knife.

174
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,380
I saw her

175
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,300
at first.

176
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,980
She's not depressed

177
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,540
but has a heart of steel.

178
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,940
I always thought

179
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,580
we grew up

180
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,900
together in two trees.

181
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,260
I know her.

182
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
But she doesn't need it.

183
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,300
What she needs is

184
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,340
to be lit.

185
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,820
Are you going to light her up

186
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,340
or leave her alone?

187
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,340
I'll go

188
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,180
to get the fire.

189
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,580
I just went.

190
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
It's complicated

191
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,940
to be in love.

192
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
Help me hold it.

193
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,180
You're good at

194
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,580
dealing with love.

195
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,180
Enough. Don't make fun of me.

196
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
Where is it?

197
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,940
Look.

198
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Look.

199
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,740
I carved it myself.

200
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Well...

201
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,260
It's a spring candy.

202
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,740
And...

203
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,580
Shaohua told me

204
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,100
seriously today

205
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,700
that you're her

206
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,020
good partner.

207
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,340
You went up?

208
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,380
Do you understand

209
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,380
what you're doing?

210
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,980
You're important.

211
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,900
Shao.

212
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,540
What happened?

213
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:46,780
I thi...

214
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,540
Shoot.

215
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,980
Love is still in my heart

216
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,580
Shaohua, let's take Xuanxuan to France together.

217
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,980
You and Xuanxuan are worth a broader world.

218
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,580
Then we'll meet in two days.

219
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,780
Wait for me.

220
00:09:59,380 --> 00:09:59,980
I'll wait for you.

221
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,980
The silent dream

222
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,580
I'll escape for you

223
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,580
If I could forget

224
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,580
I would be free from all the troubles

225
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,580
I was destined to meet you

226
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,580
How can I leave you

227
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,580
You, who I never loved

228
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,580
I'll see the clouds return to the scene

229
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,580
I'll be the one to be in the sky

230
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Morning, boss.

231
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,580
Good morning, my dear fiancee.

232
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
Let me make it clear.

233
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,580
Only in other occasions

234
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,580
is your fiancee.

235
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,580
Can't you expand the range?

236
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,580
No.

237
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,780
Why?

238
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
I'm afraid I'll damage your reputation.

239
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,380
At this time, I don't even want my life.

240
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,580
You're still worried about the reputation?

241
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,980
Life is small, but the loss is great.

242
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,180
You know the reputation is important.

243
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,980
I'm not kidding.

244
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,580
I have something important to tell you.

245
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,980
Among the members of the National Pharmaceutical Association,

246
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,380
Tian Dashao's support rate is still the highest.

247
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,180
It accounts for 30%.

248
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,980
And Mr. Xia's supporters only account for 20%.

249
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,180
What about the other 50%?

250
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,580
Wen's Big House.

251
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,380
Mr. Xia.

252
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,380
I'll discuss it with Shao Hua.

253
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,580
I see.

254
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,180
Okay, I'll reply to you later.

255
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,380
I'll go to the bathroom.

256
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,380
Okay.

257
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,180
Mr. Xia asked us for help.

258
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,180
What for?

259
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,580
He said three months ago,

260
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,380
he arranged a batch of anti-epidemic powder

261
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,580
through Mr. Lu's relationship

262
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,180
to the purchase list of this company.

263
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,780
But less than a month ago,

264
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,580
this company declared a defeat.

265
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,380
What's the price?

266
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,780
500,000 boxes.

267
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,580
If we help him sell it,

268
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
it'll be over 300 boxes a month.

269
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,580
If we add all the branches of Jujing Drugstore

270
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,580
to sell all 500,000 boxes,

271
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,780
it'll be over 20 years later.

272
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,180
But if more than 300 pharmacies in Shanghai

273
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,580
sell it together,

274
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
will it be a loss?

275
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,180
Why do they help Jujing Drugstore?

276
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
Unless they have the power to sell it,

277
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,580
and it's violent.

278
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,180
Then we'll have to lose money.

279
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,980
How about this?

280
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,780
You help me calculate

281
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
how much loss is appropriate.

282
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,980
It's a loss anyway.

283
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
I'll give you a discount.

284
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,180
Free delivery?

285
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,180
Yes.

286
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,380
Now there are 500,000 industrial workers in Shanghai.

287
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,180
It's appropriate to have one box per person.

288
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,580
Do you know

289
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,580
the value of 500,000 boxes of anti-epidemic powder?

290
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,180
It's 100,000 boxes.

291
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
But your cost is only 30,000 boxes.

292
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,380
Only?

293
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,380
Miss Chu, you're too talkative.

294
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,580
How about another way?

295
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
After a calculation,

296
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,980
if we can reduce the price of anti-epidemic powder

297
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
to 5 cents,

298
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,380
and the price is 40 cents,

299
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,180
more than 300 pharmacies in Shanghai

300
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,980
will be willing to sell it for us.

301
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,380
The customers should be willing to buy it.

302
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,180
Then in two months,

303
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,780
we can all be clear.

304
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,580
Then we'll lose money.

305
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,980
We'll lose 28,000 boxes.

306
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,780
That's too much.

307
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,780
No, no.

308
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
Absolutely no.

309
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,380
Then we have no choice.

310
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
In my opinion,

311
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,180
we should send all the goods to the north.

312
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,180
So many customers in Shouyan Pharmaceutical Store.

313
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,380
I don't believe we can't sell it.

314
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,780
This anti-epidemic powder is specially made for Zhejiang.

315
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,180
If we send it to the north,

316
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,580
it will definitely be ineffective.

317
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,780
It will affect the reputation of our bureau.

318
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,580
How about this?

319
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,380
Let's talk about the anti-epidemic powder first.

320
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,780
Let's talk about the national medicine committee election.

321
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
At present,

322
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,180
50% of the committee members

323
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,780
think that Mr. Xia is a North wind who came to Shanghai to make money.

324
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,580
They say you are ungrateful and cold.

325
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,180
So if we want to change their opinion

326
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,580
and turn the situation around in a short time,

327
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,580
we have to spend more effort

328
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,380
to change Mr. Xia's public image.

329
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,780
I probably calculated it.

330
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Journalist interviews, newspaper ads, magazine ads,

331
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,380
and leaflets and posters.

332
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:19,980
In addition...

333
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,380
In addition, we have to talk to other members of the national medicine committee

334
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,980
and make more money.

335
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,180
All these costs

336
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,980
will cost about 32,000 silver dollars.

337
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,580
This is just the base.

338
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,380
Yes.

339
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,980
We have to spend so much money?

340
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,780
We have to spend so much money here?

341
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,980
We can't lose so much money.

342
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,380
We can't send it for free.

343
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,180
Send it.

344
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,380
We have to send it.

345
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,580
All these 50,000

346
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,580
will be sent to Shanghai workers for free.

347
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,580
Boss, we will wait for your order.

348
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,580
Miss Zhou,

349
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,780
just leave this matter to the office of the literature and history.

350
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,580
No problem.

351
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,180
Xiaowei,

352
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,180
I want to ask you.

353
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,380
Is it the day off today?

354
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,180
Yes.

355
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,980
Where are the other female workers?

356
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,380
They all went to the lecture hall.

357
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,380
Thank you.

358
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,780
Who repaired the railway?

359
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,580
Who drove the train?

360
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,180
Who built the machine?

361
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,780
Aren't they all our workers?

362
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,380
We don't build houses.

363
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,780
No one can drive the train.

364
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,380
We are all workers.

365
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,580
We are all workers.

366
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,780
We are all workers.

367
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
We don't build houses.

368
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
No one can live here.

369
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,960
We don't go to the

370
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,980
We can't live without workers.

371
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,980
Aren't workers great?

372
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,580
But why are we poor?

373
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,980
Because we are poor.

374
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,180
We are poor.

375
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,780
Not because we are poor.

376
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,380
It's because we have the class and the wealth.

377
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,380
Why can capitalists be poor?

378
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,580
Because they have the power.

379
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,180
The workers are getting poorer.

380
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,780
The capitalists are getting poorer.

381
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
This is caused by the social system.

382
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,180
If workers want to be poor,

383
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,180
they have to fight for the country and the world.

384
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,980
We have to overthrow the old regime.

385
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,780
We have to build a society without class,

386
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,780
without class,

387
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,380
and everyone is equal.

388
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,180
Good.

389
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,780
Good.

390
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Good.

391
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,580
Shaohua.

392
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,980
Do you know what is the real big thing?

393
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,180
The country's great man

394
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
is for the country and the people.

395
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,780
Good.

396
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
Good.

397
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Great.

398
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,980
Shaohua.

399
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,380
Shaohua.

400
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,580
Sister.

401
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,380
Shaohua.

402
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,380
Thank you.

403
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,780
After taking the medicine you gave me last time,

404
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
I don't feel any pain at all.

405
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,780
Great.

406
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,380
I'll bring you some next time.

407
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,780
It's so expensive.

408
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
I can't let you take it.

409
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,580
It's okay.

410
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,180
Shaohua.

411
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,980
Let me introduce you to someone.

412
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,180
Who?

413
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:06,980
Let's go.

414
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,980
This is the first time I've seen you.

415
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
I've never seen you before.

416
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,380
I want to fight for equality.

417
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,980
Mr. Xia.

418
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,780
No need.

419
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,580
Mr. Xia.

420
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,180
This is Miss Chu I told you about.

421
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,980
I heard from my sister that

422
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,980
you want to give medicine to the workers in the whole city for free.

423
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,780
Yes.

424
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,380
But there are too many workers in Shanghai.

425
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
Miss Chu doesn't know where to start.

426
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
She must have no chance to get it through the Ministry of Works.

427
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,580
If she gives it through the factory,

428
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,180
the workers will be corrupt.

429
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,180
Leave it to us.

430
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,780
We have a public club.

431
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,780
The Tongzhi Club, the workers' protection club.

432
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,180
All the members of the company are workers.

433
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,780
Every factory in Shanghai

434
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
and the dock station

435
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,380
will be guaranteed to send every medicine

436
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,780
to the workers.

437
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,180
Thank you.

438
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,780
We should thank you.

439
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
I heard that

440
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,180
you've been helping these female workers

441
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,780
to give medicine for free.

442
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,980
Shaohua was the first

443
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,780
female worker here.

444
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,580
She even led us to give up our jobs.

445
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,380
But at that time,

446
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,180
she didn't even call us by that name.

447
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,580
Really?

448
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,180
Mr. Xia.

449
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,180
Can you give the workers

450
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,980
a protective umbrella

451
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,980
and send a warning that

452
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,780
we are the big house's business card?

453
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,980
No problem.

454
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,380
Besides,

455
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,380
I suggest you add a sentence

456
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,580
on the package

457
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,980
to encourage the workers to unite

458
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,380
and fight for equal treatment.

459
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,580
Mr. Xia.

460
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,380
Mr. Xia.

461
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
I'm from the private factory.

462
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,580
I want to invite you to our speech tomorrow night.

463
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,380
No problem.

464
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,380
Mr. Xia.

465
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,380
We are from the joint print press conference.

466
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,980
Do you have time on Wednesday?

467
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,780
Can you give us a class?

468
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,180
I have to go to the dock to do research on Wednesday.

469
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,980
I can do it tonight.

470
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,580
Okay.

471
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,580
I'll wait for you tonight.

472
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,380
Okay.

473
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,380
Mr. Xia.

474
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,380
I'm the representative of the Zhaoshan Bureau.

475
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,980
We also want to join the Shanghai General Assembly.

476
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,980
You're very welcome.

477
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,780
Mr. Xia.

478
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,380
There are workers waiting for you at the gate.

479
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Please contact

480
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,180
Yan Anmei for the next job.

481
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,980
I'll leave you to it.

482
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
Okay. You can go ahead.

483
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,980
Shaohua.

484
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,980
Go over there and have some water.

485
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,580
Okay.

486
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,380
Let's go.

487
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,380
Wen's Pharmacy.

488
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,780
Zheng.

489
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
I know.

490
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
Isn't that money paid next week?

491
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,180
Today is only Wednesday.

492
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,580
I'll be there.

493
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,780
I'll be there.

494
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,580
Okay.

495
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,580
I'll be there.

496
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,580
Okay.

497
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,580
Okay.

498
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,180
Shaohua.

499
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
Chu Shaohua.

500
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,980
Boss Wen.

501
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,380
Manager Chu is out.

502
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,180
Well...

503
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,780
Did you get the account for Song Jiang?

504
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,580
Yes.

505
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,380
Give it to me.

506
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,780
It's all returned to Manager Chu.

507
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,780
Where is he?

508
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,780
Xiao Cun took a leave.

509
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,780
Manager Chu replaced him to deliver the anti-epidemic umbrella.

510
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,980
Where?

511
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,380
At the dock in Zhabei.

512
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,780
Okay.

513
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,980
You can't go back.

514
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,380
Please leave.

515
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,780
Thank you.

516
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,780
Just a moment, please.

517
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,580
Okay.

518
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,580
Hello, sir.

519
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,900
Sanmaizong.

520
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,380
sauce,

521
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,320
mustard,

522
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,980
white sugar,

523
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,460
white sugar and olive oil.

524
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
The dock's capitalists took so much.

525
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,460
The merchants took so much.

526
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,860
The workers took so much.

527
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
We, the workers,

528
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,220
only have a little left.

529
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,300
We did the work.

530
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,380
But most of the money was taken away by them.

531
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,820
This is a waste.

532
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,940
If we don't want to be wasted,

533
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,980
we have to unite to form a union,

534
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,060
organize and carry out the revolution.

535
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,340
Let's get to work.

536
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,420
Get up.

537
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,980
Let's go.

538
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
You help me.

539
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,580
Mr. Wan.

540
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,700
The number of people you reported to the dock's workers union

541
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,860
was 416.

542
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,820
I happen to be the housekeeper of 416.

543
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,980
Please check it.

544
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,260
If there's no problem,

545
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,260
please sign here.

546
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,500
Why are you here?

547
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,260
Boss Zheng from Songjiang

548
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,700
said there's an emergency at home.

549
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,420
He needs money.

550
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,900
He wants to settle the bill with us next month.

551
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,740
The account book is here.

552
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,580
He's here to see you.

553
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,220
It's in the third drawer in my office.

554
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,900
You're going back with me?

555
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
I'm going to the union to collect information.

556
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,380
Help!

557
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,660
Someone's drowning!

558
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,260
Hurry!

559
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,260
Help!

560
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,500
Anyone who can swim?

561
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,100
Help!

562
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,340
Hurry!

563
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,620
Help!

564
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,180
Hurry!

565
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,980
Anyone who can swim?

566
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,380
Anyone who can swim?

567
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,780
Hurry!

568
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,740
Anyone who can swim?

569
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,380
Anyone who can swim?

570
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Stop!

571
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,340
Stop!

572
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,500
Hurry!

573
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,340
Hurry!

574
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,620
What are you doing?

575
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,500
Go back to work!

576
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,740
What are you doing?

577
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,500
What are you doing?

578
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,380
Go back to work!

579
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,500
I don't want to work!

580
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,580
Go back to work!

581
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,300
Go back to work!

582
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,340
Go back to work! Hurry!

583
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,820
This way!

584
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,740
Hurry!

585
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,780
Go back to work!

586
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,660
I'll catch you!

587
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,700
You guys!

588
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,260
Hurry!

589
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,820
Go back to work!

590
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,660
Go back to work!

591
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,380
This way!

592
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,260
This way!

593
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,940
I'll catch you!

594
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,820
Hurry!

595
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,500
Go back to work!

596
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,380
Hurry!

597
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,420
Hurry!

598
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,140
Okay, put it down first.

599
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,700
Let him stand up first.

600
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,380
Stand up.

601
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,020
Come on!

602
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,180
Come on!

603
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,780
Come on!

604
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,580
Come on!

605
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,300
Stand up!

606
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,060
Hurry!

607
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,220
Move aside.

608
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,220
Wake up.

609
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,300
Wake up!

610
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,140
Wake up!

611
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:53,860
Get up.

612
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,500
Get up.

613
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,020
Give me a hand.

614
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,020
Help him up.

615
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,340
Third Brother!

616
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,900
He's awake.

617
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,580
Third Brother!

618
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,420
Third Brother!

619
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,500
Third Brother!

620
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,180
Thank you, Mr. Xia!

621
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,180
Thank you!

622
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,580
Mr. Xia is a great benefactor!

623
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,100
It's okay.

624
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,700
Thank you, benefactor!

625
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,220
Get up.

626
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,740
Get up.

627
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,500
Thank you, benefactor!

628
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,380
Get up.

629
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
We'll listen to you

630
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,380
on the matter of the protection.

631
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,460
You can do whatever you want.

632
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
I'll do whatever you want.

633
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,220
Get up.

634
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,940
Get up.

635
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,620
Get up.

636
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,220
Get up.

637
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,820
Get up.

638
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,460
Get up.

639
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,220
Get up.

640
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,060
Get up.

641
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,140
Do whatever you want.

642
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,620
Yes.

643
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,460
We'll listen to you.

644
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,140
We'll listen to you.

645
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,660
We'll listen to you.

646
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,660
We'll listen to you.

647
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,180
Okay.

648
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,060
Okay.

649
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,700
Hurry.

650
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,620
Find a doctor for him.

651
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,220
Hurry.

652
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,060
Be careful.

653
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,180
Third Brother.

654
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,500
Let's go.

655
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,100
Hurry.

656
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,300
Be careful.

657
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,980
Let's go.

658
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,180
You've known each other for a long time.

659
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,540
I'm going to the ocean park.

660
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,620
Can you give me a ride?

661
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,340
Okay.

662
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,860
Let's go.

663
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,460
By the way,

664
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,660
I'm not your fiance anymore.

665
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,460
Why?

666
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,260
I don't have to.

667
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,380
If you feel awkward,

668
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,580
I won't force you.

669
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,340
You're the one who feels awkward.

670
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,620
Me?

671
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,300
What do you mean?

672
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,980
Why didn't you let him know you were single?

673
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,860
Or you've been

674
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
thinking about him all the time?

675
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,020
Wen Zhi Qiu.

676
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,180
You're here today

677
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,300
for him, right?

678
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,820
Why didn't you talk to him when you saw him?

679
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,500
You're thinking too narrowly.

680
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,020
You don't know anything.

681
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,860
Yes.

682
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,340
I don't know anything.

683
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,300
I don't know

684
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,860
a person with such a ambition.

685
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,540
He's so obvious

686
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,100
in everything he wants.

687
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,580
Why is he so different now?

688
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,740
If you keep talking,

689
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,300
I'll push you into the river.

690
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,780
I'm very disappointed in you.

691
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,900
Shou Hua.

692
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,100
This is our living room.

693
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,460
I hired a musician

694
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,260
for that stage.

695
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,500
There will be music in the future.

696
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,940
Look at this bar.

697
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,500
I designed it myself.

698
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,540
It's really nice.

699
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,660
And the mirror over there.

700
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,700
I really like it.

701
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,100
The second floor is all bathrooms.

702
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,900
I'll show you around.

703
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,580
Okay.

704
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,020
There are seven bathrooms

705
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,860
upstairs.

706
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,820
I'll show you around.

707
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,500
Okay.

708
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,340
I'll show you around.

709
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,940
Okay.

710
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,180
This is the bathroom.

711
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,420
This is the biggest one.

712
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,380
Isn't the light beautiful?

713
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,460
Yes.

714
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,260
I asked a friend

715
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,380
to buy it from France.

716
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,580
This is a tablecloth.

717
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,420
It's Italian.

718
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,060
There's a small bathroom

719
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,820
in here.

720
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,700
It's very private.

721
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,100
Ernie.

722
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,180
At first glance,

723
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,980
you must have put a lot of effort into it.

724
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,540
But these things

725
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,900
must be very expensive.

726
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,980
It's all good.

727
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,380
It's all from Lao Mu.

728
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,340
He's a big shareholder.

729
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,540
By the way,

730
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,060
I have to take you to another place.

731
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,580
I'm leaving.

732
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,100
Okay.

733
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,820
I've told everyone.

734
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,100
This stage

735
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
will only belong to the two of us.

736
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,620
It only belongs to the two of us?

737
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,300
Yes.

738
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,860
Do you want to

739
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,020
make films in the future?

740
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,780
I'm sure I want to make films.

741
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,780
Although Lao Mu is nice to me now,

742
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,900
in the future,

743
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,180
no one can be sure.

744
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,620
I have to leave a way for myself.

745
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,780
That's great.

746
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,660
You're finally not

747
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,580
overwhelmed by love.

748
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,500
After so much suffering,

749
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,420
I have to remember it.

750
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,140
What about you?

751
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,220
Me?

752
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,100
Me what?

753
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,940
Do you really plan to

754
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,860
live alone for the rest of your life?

755
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,220
Live alone for the rest of your life?

756
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,820
I think it's not bad.

757
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,780
How lonely you are.

758
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,940
I have a career.

759
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,100
It's not too lonely

760
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,540
to have a career.

761
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,380
That's right.

762
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,060
You're rich.

763
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,260
You're not lonely.

764
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,620
Erniu,

765
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,060
have you ever thought

766
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,420
that apart from making money,

767
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,060
what else

768
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,180
you can do in the future?

769
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,940
For example?

770
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,740
For example?

771
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,900
I don't know.

772
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,500
I've seen him

773
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,540
recently.

774
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,940
Xia Chu,

775
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,900
do you still love him?

776
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,140
If you love him,

777
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,460
go find him.

778
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,780
But maybe he doesn't

779
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,580
love me anymore.

780
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,660
If you don't ask him,

781
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,220
how do you know?

782
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,580
He has a girlfriend.

783
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,220
He has started

784
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
a new life.

785
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,660
Dad!

786
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,620
Dad!

787
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,420
Dad!

788
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Dad!

789
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
Dad!

790
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
Dad!

791
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,580
We go against imperialism!

792
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,420
Return foreign achievements to our country!

793
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,460
You'll see us again!

794
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,260
Shanghai is our motherland!

795
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,020
Shanghai is our motherland!

796
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,380
We go against imperialism!

797
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,980
We go against imperialism!

798
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,580
Return foreign achievements to our country!

799
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,220
You'll see us again!

800
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,180
Shanghai is our motherland!

801
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,660
Shanghai is our motherland!

802
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,380
We go against imperialism!

803
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,060
Ms. Sansha!

804
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,540
Ms. Sansha!

805
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,620
Erniu,

806
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,900
where are you going?

807
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
We're on the street in Nanjing,

808
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,580
trying to conquer playing cards.

809
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,900
It will ask for release and arrest the looters once the school receives.

810
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,340
If you didn't go to deliver the medicine,

811
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,540
I would like to join you.

812
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,300
You donated money and medicine.

813
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,420
You've supported us a lot.

814
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,140
How long will you stay there?

815
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,180
They won't let us go.

816
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
We won't leave.

817
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,180
Okay.

818
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,460
When I'm done with my work,

819
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,380
I'll deliver some food and drinks to you.

820
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,820
Okay.

821
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,580
See you later.

822
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,100
Okay.

823
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,420
Prepare steamed buns for 200 people.

824
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,660
Then make some hot soup.

825
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,060
Deliver it to the old house in Nanjing Road.

826
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,300
I'll introduce it to you later.

827
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,300
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

828
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,940
Well,

829
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,060
I'll prepare 400 servings.

830
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,380
200 is yours.

831
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,700
The other 200 is mine.

832
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,460
Erniang, thank you.

833
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,780
I'm Chinese, too.

834
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,580
Don't go out today.

835
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,660
Why?

836
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,980
I just got the news.

837
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,180
Aifu Police has transferred

838
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,460
many officers who are on the run.

839
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,580
They've arrived at the old house in Nanjing Road.

840
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,300
And all the Indian officers

841
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,100
have been granted the permission to shoot.

842
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,300
It's going to be a big deal.

843
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,340
Oh my god.

844
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,380
Mr. Zhang will be in trouble.

845
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,580
Don't go out today.

846
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,460
Don't open the door today.

847
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,220
You must.

848
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,100
I know.

849
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,180
Shaohua.

850
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,780
Shaohua, where are you going?

851
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,620
Oppose the Indian officers.

852
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,580
Oppose the Indian officers.

853
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,060
The Indian officers, unite!

854
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,660
Oppose the Indian officers.

855
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,020
Master, be faster.

856
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,700
Okay.

857
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,900
Oppose the Japanese.

858
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,060
Oppose the Japanese.

859
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,540
We Chinese have the courage

860
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,900
to oppose the 4th case.

861
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,500
We resist the Japanese.

862
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,780
We can't let the economy

863
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,300
and the poor get away with it.

864
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,460
We must drive the Japanese

865
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,260
out of Shanghai.

866
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,180
Shanghai is our China.

867
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,620
We resist the Japanese.

868
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,820
Oppose the Japanese.

869
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,060
Oppose the Japanese.

870
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,540
We must take back

871
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,660
Shanghai, China and Shanghai.

872
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,620
We must drive the Japanese out.

873
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,660
Shanghai is our China.

874
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,180
We must drive the Japanese out.

875
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,220
Shanghai, China and Shanghai.

876
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,100
We must take back the foreign power.

877
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,020
Oppose the Indian officers.

878
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,140
Oppose the Indian officers.

879
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,220
Shanghai is China's Shanghai.

880
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,180
We must drive the Japanese out.

881
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,100
We must take back the foreign power.

882
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,180
The Chinese, unite!

883
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,060
Shanghai is China's Shanghai.

884
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,140
Shanghai is Chinese' Shanghai.

885
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,860
We must take back the foreign power.

886
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,820
Shanghai is Shanghai for Chinese people.

887
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,340
Down with imperialism.

888
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,660
Take back the foreign invaders.

889
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,420
Take back the foreign invaders.

890
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,540
Shanghai is Shanghai for Chinese people.

891
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,860
Down with imperialism.

892
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,800
indistinct

893
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,740
We can't not dare exchange

894
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,800
In this black and white

895
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,220
No

896
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,220
They wanna shoot us

897
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,120
We have to fight back

898
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,460
Shoot

899
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,180
Come on

900
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,560
Shoot

901
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,140
Someone

902
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,020
Anyone

903
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,840
Anyone

904
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,060
No?

905
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,860
You're taking care of her.

906
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,900
Sure.

907
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,020
Come on, come up.

908
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,900
Careful.

909
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,460
Help!

910
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,820
Help!

911
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,700
Help!

912
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,100
Help!

913
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,940
Help!

914
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,780
Xia Chu!

915
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,820
Xia Chu!

916
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,220
You hurt me.

917
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,940
Xia...

918
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,860
Xiaohua.

919
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,580
We should never

920
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,860
be apart again.

921
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,940
Will you guys

922
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,700
save eunuch One overnight in the latrine?

923
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,300
Yes, we will.

924
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,620
How would he rest?

925
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,300
He...

926
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,580
Brother,

927
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,300
you're all here?

928
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,620
Yeah.

929
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,740
Li.

930
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,740
Boss Wen.

931
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,980
Are the brothers from the outside back?

932
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,860
They're all back.

933
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,980
Zhang Lingyi is the only one left.

934
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,340
He asked for leave for his hometown.

935
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,220
Boss Wen.

936
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,100
Miss Bai called to ask if Miss Chu

937
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,900
went back to the pharmacy.

938
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,140
Didn't Miss Chu go to Anna?

939
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,780
She said Miss Chu

940
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,700
went to Nanjing Road later.

941
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,540
What?

942
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,140
Yes.

943
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,940
Hey,

944
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,700
what's up?

945
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,860
Hey.

946
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,100
No one is allowed to leave the store

947
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,380
before the situation gets worse.

948
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,260
Okay, Boss Wen.

949
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,900
Boss Wen.

950
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,940
We can't go to Nanjing Road.

951
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,900
They're all shooting.

952
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,460
Boss Wen.

953
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,220
It's dangerous.

954
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,740
Tell me.

955
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,060
Tell me.

956
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,620
You're dead.

957
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,140
I'm dead.

958
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,900
But I'm reborn now.

959
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,020
Shaohua.

960
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,180
If I knew you were still alive,

961
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,580
I would have waited for you.

962
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,660
Even if I die,

963
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,820
I'll wait for you.

964
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,580
It's not too late, right?

965
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,140
Everything

966
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,420
will be in time, right?

967
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,620
It's in time.

968
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,980
It's in time.

969
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,260
It'll never be too late.

970
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,540
I have to go back to the command center immediately.

971
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,860
I'll come to you later.

972
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,860
I'll wait for you.

973
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,540
Time is passing by.

974
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,540
The light of the lock

975
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,500
is like a long movie.

976
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
The past is hard to forget.

977
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,460
I'm wronged and I'm looking for it.

978
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,140
It will light up forever.

979
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,940
The road I've been walking.

980
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,860
Are you okay?

981
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,580
I'm fine.

982
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,700
Are all the employees okay?

983
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,980
They're all fine.

984
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,820
Is Promisa...

985
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,420
Pawnshop did have the reward

986
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,740
for the experiment.

987
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,220
But it's not tooSOUND like we get it.

988
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,500
That he was華軒能 meuille

989
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,140
and was treated so terribly by his colleagues.

990
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,140
So you're here to do theally?

991
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,500
unable to finish this thing

992
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,460
Yes.

993
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,700
Soldiers, sell the reports.

994
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,420
Eunuch Kan will be

995
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,020
sent to the place where he died.

996
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
Soldiers, sell the reports.

997
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,100
Eunuch Kan will be

998
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,820
sent to the place where he died.

999
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,540
stolen just now.

1000
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,300
Please help him.

1001
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,780
During the Beijing Chateau twitch job

1002
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,980
where did you move in

1003
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,300
with a curry singer before?

1004
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,500
Since I was an army man,

1005
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,700
we've been working together.

1006
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,180
Thanks for your service.

1007
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,680
Years have passed.

1008
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,560
We should also stick to our branch plan.

1009
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
I went to several places these days.

1010
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,880
I went to Nanjing Road,

1011
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,320
and Wusong Road,

1012
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,760
Yan'an East Road.

1013
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,480
I think if we have any new ideas

1014
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,400
about these points...

1015
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,000
Boss,

1016
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,400
this is already after work.

1017
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,720
Since you want to treat me to dinner,

1018
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,440
can we not talk about work?

1019
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,160
I invited you to dinner to talk about work.

1020
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,600
If you don't talk about work,

1021
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,680
I won't talk about work.

1022
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,600
You can just eat.

1023
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,880
I can't talk about work.

1024
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,120
If you don't talk about work,

1025
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,000
you can treat me to dinner.

1026
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,640
Okay.

1027
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,720
You won't bargain with me?

1028
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,320
Okay.

1029
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,440
It's better to

1030
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,680
talk about love without any reason.

1031
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,320
I'm working hard on my career.

1032
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,200
I have no feelings or desires.

1033
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,160
If you're like this,

1034
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,480
why should I be at ease

1035
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,000
to give you my job?

1036
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,040
I know what you want to say.

1037
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,960
But, Boss,

1038
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,160
there are many things in this world

1039
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,360
that are more precious than money.

1040
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,680
Don't tell me it's love.

1041
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,200
Love is a kind of love.

1042
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,040
You're really

1043
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,680
confused by Xia Er Shao?

1044
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,000
Don't mention it.

1045
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,600
I haven't seen him for a long time.

1046
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,160
I thought you two

1047
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,560
were fighting over hot firewood.

1048
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,640
What's wrong?

1049
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,600
He's too busy.

1050
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,200
Since we left Nanjing Road,

1051
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,880
I haven't seen him for a long time.

1052
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,480
It's been over a month.

1053
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,680
What's he busy with?

1054
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,760
I don't know the details.

1055
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,040
He doesn't want to see you, right?

1056
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,040
He's busy with

1057
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,520
the national and national affairs.

1058
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,320
Really?

1059
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,320
It doesn't affect your relationship

1060
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,480
if you haven't seen him for a long time.

1061
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,200
No.

1062
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,360
Are you sure?

1063
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,840
Let me put it this way.

1064
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,840
He and I

1065
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,120
haven't seen each other for many years.

1066
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,840
We don't even know

1067
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,000
if he's still alive.

1068
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,520
But once we meet,

1069
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,840
nothing has changed.

1070
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,680
Are you busy?

1071
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,760
Or are you bored

1072
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,520
talking about me?

1073
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,200
I'm not bored.

1074
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,720
It's just a little busy.

1075
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,920
You know,

1076
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,880
from the time we've been together,

1077
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,560
you've already seen the watch three times.

1078
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
You must be busy.

1079
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Are you on a date?

1080
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,400
Who?

1081
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,760
Is she a girl?

1082
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,840
Is she pretty?

1083
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,920
She's prettier than you.

1084
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
How long have you known each other?

1085
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,840
I just met Shen Mei You.

1086
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,400
You look so happy

1087
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,200
and happy.

1088
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,320
I'm not happy

1089
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,440
if you're in love.

1090
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,880
No, I'm happy for you.

1091
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,840
I'm running out of time.

1092
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm leaving.

1093
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,120
Okay, go ahead.

1094
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,280
I wish you a happy relationship.

1095
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,360
I wish you a good meeting.

1096
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,280
Okay.

1097
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,840
You asked me out on a date.

1098
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,040
You even ordered so many dishes.

1099
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,680
I paid for it.

1100
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,880
The snow on the road is the night in your heart.

1101
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,720
The little wind and waves are confusing.

1102
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,280
The little horse in her heart

1103
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,600
warms her heart a little bit.

1104
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,880
She is complaining that the sky is not clear.

1105
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,160
She said winter is short.

1106
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Her permanent nose is looking at her.

1107
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,960
Day by day, night by night,

1108
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,640
there is regret.

1109
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,520
Day by day, night by night,

1110
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,760
I am not lonely anymore.

1111
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,040
The wind and waves are confusing.

1112
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,360
I will fight for you.

1113
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:23,960
The snow on the road is the night in your heart.

1114
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,040
Day by day, night by night,

1115
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,600
there is regret.

1116
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,840
Day by day, night by night,

1117
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,480
I am not lonely anymore.

1118
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,800
The wind and waves are confusing.

1119
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,800
I will fight for you.

1120
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,520
The green grass in your heart is eternal.

1121
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,680
The green grass in your heart is eternal.
