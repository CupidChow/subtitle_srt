1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
A Story of muyi

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I heard the wind from the sky above the sea

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That is not the wind, that is not the wind

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the sharpness in my eyes

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not easy, then let's break it

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My bitter pain, my pain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I finally turn around

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the wildest night

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to break the world

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is the one for me

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuan

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And every time he gets drunk

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He always calls his daughter's name

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Every parent loses their child

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's all the pain of life

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And every parent, in order to find their child

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Are willing to pay any price

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, if we can help him find his daughter

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He will definitely help us

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But China is so big

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Where can we find his daughter

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He hasn't found her for two years

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I think he should not be in Shanghai

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But if he is not in Shanghai

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He should be near the Northeast

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, Hong Nian

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Send a telegram to Sanyuan

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let him use all his strength to find that tower

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't give up on this side

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Keep searching with all your connections

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ok, ok

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Did you find the Natasha

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mr. Yang

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Qi's family has been in the Northeast for hundreds of years

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The human relations are involved in every city in the Northeast

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When he sent a telegram

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A pharmacy with no business with him

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He replied

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He said Natasha was in Qiqi Har

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He went to Qiqi Har

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He arrived in Shanghai not long

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He broke up with Guaiyou

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He didn't have the face to see his father

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So he went to Qiqi Har alone

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
To seek for a life

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It seems that this Glebov

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Found the wrong place

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
After he knew the missing news

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No hesitation

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Immediately cooperate with us

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I guess a week later

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Their parents can reunite

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
OK

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Anyway

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There is still a good result in this matter

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But after this lawsuit

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I want to have a result with Tian Shan

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think it's more difficult

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Should I

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Really retreat

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Cut

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Pass

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Airplane

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why are you here

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm here to pick you up

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Have you finished shooting

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
After shooting

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's dance

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The lawsuit is over

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have no value

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What does this have to do with the lawsuit

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Enough

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Your family already knows what I did

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I also know you didn't take me as a matter

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's dance

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you think it's interesting

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What is this

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You don't know anything

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know what you are talking about

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Also

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Such an important thing to fight a lawsuit

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Your brother won't let you know

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My brother

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He is him, I am me

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No matter how he looks at you

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Anyway, I love you, isn't this enough?

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Tong Xin

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's separate

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Ring back to you

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You are throwing me away

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can understand

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have never thrown anyone else

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No one has ever thrown me

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Young Master Tian

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Everything has its first time

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Just get used to it

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Bai Bing Xin

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Did you take the wrong medicine

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I am Tian Er Shao

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Deputy Manager of Tian's Pharmacy

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What can I do

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You will regret it

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Row

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then I will regret it for a lifetime

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I also hope you can be happy

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Didn't you say before

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I only love me in this life

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do I have to be married

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I changed my mind

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You dare to say you don't love me

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't love you

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To be honest, I have never loved

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Bai Bing Xin

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Bing Xin

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I won't separate with you

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have to be with you, Bing Xin

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Stop talking

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We will be apart in the future

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't look for me anymore

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Bing Xin

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Bing Xin

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You open the door first

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You open the door first, Bing Xin

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Bing Xin

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's talk about it

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Bing Xin

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Bing Xin

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I know

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You are angry with me

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You say what you want

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will buy it all for you

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Bing Xin

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Bing Xin, you can't do this to me

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Bing Xin

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Bing Xin

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Bing Xin

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sorry, everyone

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Sold out again

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Sold out again

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I am very sorry

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sorry, everyone

152
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Our Dongfang tonic today

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's sold out

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have been waiting for two hours

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You say this

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm so sorry

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I really sold out today

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have a feeling

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We will cooperate with Wen's Pharmacy

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We will cooperate with Wen's Pharmacy

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We will cooperate with Wen's Pharmacy

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We will supply fast

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't worry

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It will be available soon

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ok?

166
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We will come back another day

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you all

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you all

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When will this wait

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Wait slowly

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's out

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sir, madam

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't queue today

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Only two hundred boxes left

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wait until you have no medicine

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

177
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We have been waiting for more than two hours

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There is really no medicine today

179
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you have any goods tomorrow?

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you have any goods tomorrow?

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Go to the family dinner

182
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

183
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Family dinner

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Xiaoli

185
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who is in their family?

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Family

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I won't go

188
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why?

189
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I am not used to

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Go to other people's house

191
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I am especially invited

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I am not feeling well

193
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I haven't said which day

194
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I may not feel well any day

195
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You don't work overtime today?

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Miss Bai, phone

198
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Coming

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Who is looking for me?

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The one named Tian

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Tell him I am not here

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you come to me again, I will not be here

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Tian Anshang?

204
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have told him I broke up

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But he still doesn't give up

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He is still following me

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He still feels hopeful

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Tell me

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How can I let him give up completely?

211
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't know

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't know

213
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
How to let myself give up completely

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Xia~~~~

215
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,240
That's right

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
других

217
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
she still loves Huibin

218
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Jeff

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She loves you

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I am not too happy

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But no need to be in a bad mood

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Is it over?

223
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I want to spare a choice

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that is not mine

225
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
typical

226
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I know

227
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,400
As long as we work hard

228
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,560
Even if it comes out

229
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,760
He won't bother us anymore, right?

230
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
I hope so

231
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,200
Boss Xia

232
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,800
Just saw it on the newspaper

233
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,280
News of your Wen's Big Apartment

234
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,240
You are here

235
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,440
What news

236
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,440
Shanghai Ten Great National Pharmacies

237
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
Wen's Big Apartment ranks ninth

238
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
I thought I would be on the net in the second half of the year

239
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,120
Look at these reporters, so anxious

240
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
It's a good thing

241
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,320
Sit down

242
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,840
I have to thank Tian Dashao

243
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,360
If he hadn't raised Professor Claudia so high

244
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,540
Our East Bank supplementary brain

245
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,040
Can be taken out overnight

246
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,920
Still not enough

247
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,080
I also opened two more workshops

248
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
I still dare not guarantee supply and demand

249
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,160
Then Boss Wen

250
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
I have to congratulate you for your financial success

251
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,680
Boss Xia

252
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,400
Congratulations

253
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,800
You are here alone

254
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,120
Where is Shaohua

255
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,880
She said she was in a bad shape today

256
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,600
Is it serious?

257
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,560
Should be fine

258
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,520
Maybe I'm too tired these days

259
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,440
Just take a break

260
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,480
Row

261
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
Then let her rest well

262
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
Come and drink tea

263
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,560
British

264
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,360
Red tea

265
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Boss Wen, try it

266
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,840
This is my brother

267
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,520
Specially sent to me from Europe

268
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,960
You still have a brother

269
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,480
I am studying in France now

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,640
It's him

271
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,080
It looks talented

272
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,120
Yes

273
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,160
My brother is more handsome than me

274
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,720
Not only handsome

275
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Smart

276
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,280
I have been the first in all subjects since I was a child

277
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,120
Later I went to study in Japan

278
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,360
I have two majors

279
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
Also all in good health

280
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
This is not enough

281
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,200
Went to study in France again

282
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,480
This is a photo he took with his classmate in Paris

283
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,920
This sister

284
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,560
Girlfriend

285
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,680
But I guess it's about time

286
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,840
mother

287
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
This is Mr. Wen, right?

288
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,720
Mother, let me introduce you

289
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,560
This is the boss of Wen's Pharmacy

290
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,760
Wen Zhiqiu

291
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,160
Hello, old lady

292
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,280
Hello

293
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,640
I often hear Xia Yuan mention you

294
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,880
Praise you for being able to do it

295
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,680
Today

296
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,840
It's really a talent

297
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,120
Old lady, you are too much

298
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,200
Lin Lang is the dragon in the crowd

299
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,080
How can they compare with you?

300
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,720
Teacher

301
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,720
Compete with me and then compare me

302
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,160
Boss Wen is kidding

303
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,120
This is Zhuo Jin

304
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,800
Mrs. Xia

305
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Hello, Mr. Wen

306
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Let's attend

307
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,800
mother

308
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,640
Please

309
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,280
Please

310
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,400
mother

311
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,720
Boss Wen, please

312
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,040
Isn't Miss Chu coming today?

313
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,560
Miss Chu is in good health

314
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,520
Won't attend

315
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,200
I especially let the chef today

316
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,520
Made a few Qizhou dishes

317
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,120
And said to let Miss Chu

318
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,480
Taste the taste of hometown

319
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,520
Then she is too unlucky

320
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,320
Yes

321
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
How about this

322
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,880
You let the kitchen

323
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,360
Pack a few Qizhou dishes

324
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,040
Send it to Miss Chu

325
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,600
it is good

326
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,680
By the way

327
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Chief Gao brought back

328
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,080
Qizhou specialties

329
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,960
Also send it to Miss Chu

330
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,560
it is good

331
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,280
it is good

332
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,920
mother

333
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,920
I think it's better to slow down

334
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880
Talk in a few days

335
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,960
why

336
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,840
These two days

337
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,400
Isn't she not feeling well?

338
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,440
If you think about it

339
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,920
I'm afraid she remembers those past

340
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,080
I feel more uncomfortable

341
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,000
Look at me

342
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
I didn't think of this

343
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,160
This

344
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,120
Does she have any past?

345
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,160
You don't know

346
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
She never mentioned to me

347
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,240
Her past

348
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,760
Mainly Miss Chu

349
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,040
Many things back then

350
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,160
The newspaper has been published

351
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,760
I thought you knew it

352
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,400
Yes

353
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,560
When I read the newspaper back then

354
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,560
I only think Miss Chu

355
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,320
Life is bitter

356
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,520
But later Xia Yuan said

357
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,080
She went through the loss of her husband and daughter

358
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,280
The pain of breaking the family

359
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,440
She didn't feel unwell

360
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,840
But with Mr. Wen

361
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,880
So rich

362
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,160
This is also counted as

363
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,400
The hero of the Jin State of Hua Mulan City

364
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,200
I thought back then

365
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,800
mother

366
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,880
Let's start the show first

367
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,560
Good good good

368
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,080
Come

369
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,000
Boss Wen

370
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,320
Boss Xia

371
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,960
welcome

372
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,200
please

373
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,000
She went through the loss of her husband and daughter

374
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,160
The pain of breaking the family

375
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,320
She didn't feel unwell

376
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
But with Mr. Wen

377
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
So rich

378
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
This is also counted as

379
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,400
The hero of the Jin State of Hua Mulan City

380
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,880
Duan Hsu

381
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,600
Xia Er

382
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,760
what

383
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,480
Don't go

384
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:53,960
Xia Eroohai神 Hare

385
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,920
I still aren't full

386
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,960
Okay.

387
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,360
Boss,

388
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,560
one more bowl of wonton.

389
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,040
Okay.

390
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,320
By the way,

391
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
aren't you going to talk to me about something?

392
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,960
Xia Yuan said that our two companies

393
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
can cooperate in other places.

394
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
What do you think?

395
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,400
I think it's a good thing.

396
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,320
Did he specifically say

397
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,480
which side?

398
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
He didn't say it specifically.

399
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,600
Okay.

400
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm leaving now.

401
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,840
Okay.

402
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,640
Who did you meet

403
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,760
at Xia Yuan's house today?

404
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,360
His mother

405
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
and Mrs. Xia.

406
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,760
I didn't see his child.

407
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,440
It seems like he's in school.

408
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,040
I only found out today

409
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,440
that he has a brother

410
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,520
who is studying in France.

411
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,560
His brother...

412
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,440
Thank you.

413
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,600
His brother

414
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,200
is married, right?

415
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,840
Not yet.

416
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
But I heard it's soon.

417
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,360
The woman should be beautiful, too.

418
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,440
Beautiful?

419
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,280
Pretty.

420
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,720
Sorry, I'm late in getting in my car.

421
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,920
I thought you were resterabout before.

422
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,560
Actually,

423
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,720
you still have a past.

424
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,360
What past?

425
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,760
Eat. Don't talk about this.

426
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I saw it on the newspaper before, but it didn't come up.

427
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I feel that...

428
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,960
Stop talking.

429
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,560
I can't tell if you'll feel better.

430
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,160
I've let it go long ago.

431
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,960
If you don't say it, I'll forget about it.

432
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,560
You'll forget or run away?

433
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Why would I run away?

434
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,560
Why else wouldn't you dare go to Xia Yuan's house with me today?

435
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,160
I'm afraid that I'll meet an old friend and...

436
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Can you eat wontons?

437
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,160
Do you think I'm your friend?

438
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,160
No.

439
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
We're just partners.

440
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
So straightforward.

441
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,560
Xin Yue, I just hope that you can live happily and easily.

442
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,360
I'm happy.

443
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,960
I'm also very relaxed.

444
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,360
Thank you for your concern.

445
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
It doesn't look like it.

446
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,560
I really want to help you.

447
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,560
I don't need your help.

448
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,160
I don't need anyone to pity me.

449
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,960
I'm not...

450
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,760
I can't let go or forget.

451
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,160
That's my own business.

452
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,560
I just want to care about you.

453
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,760
It has nothing to do with you!

454
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
I'm not going to let go.

455
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm going to help you.

456
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
It has nothing to do with you!

457
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:56,160
Operation

458
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,360
Good afternoon, Miss Oppa.

459
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,680
I can make up for it.

460
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,240
Come in.

461
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Wu.

462
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,600
Mr. Wen, Miss Chu.

463
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm getting married next month.

464
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,240
I'd like to invite you two to my wedding.

465
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,920
Thank you.

466
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,800
You're good.

467
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
You're doing great things.

468
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,160
Who's your bride?

469
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,360
She's from my hometown.

470
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,320
We grew up together.

471
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
You're childhood friends.

472
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,680
I have another request.

473
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,880
I'd like to ask you to help me with the marriage.

474
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,000
Sure.

475
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,640
I'd also like to ask you to help me host the wedding.

476
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,400
Me?

477
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,200
She can't.

478
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,760
Why?

479
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,360
She's not good at talking.

480
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,760
Not many people can compare to Miss Chu.

481
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
I'll host it for you.

482
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,080
But you're getting married, right?

483
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
We'll host it together.

484
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,560
Can you make it?

485
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,160
Sure.

486
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
How about you hosting Miss Chu's wedding?

487
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,160
She might not have time to attend the wedding.

488
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,920
Miss Chu, you can't come.

489
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
She has a business trip.

490
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,920
That's a pity.

491
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,440
Yes, it's a pity.

492
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,040
You can postpone the business trip.

493
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,520
Wu, don't worry.

494
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,000
I'll attend your wedding.

495
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
And you can give me the hosting.

496
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,320
No problem.

497
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,560
Great.

498
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,240
The girl who came to send me the food last time

499
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,240
met Miss Chu.

500
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
She's very familiar with your talent.

501
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
She told me several times

502
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,360
that we must invite Miss Chu to our wedding.

503
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,520
Thank you.

504
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,480
Thank you, Manager Chu.

505
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
Thank you, Boss Wen.

506
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,640
Have a good marriage.

507
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,480
Thank you.

508
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,320
Thank you.

509
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,360
I know you're worried about me.

510
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,880
You're afraid I'll be stimulated by the wedding.

511
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,160
So you know someone is worried about you.

512
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,880
I was impulsive about what happened yesterday.

513
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,200
I'm sorry.

514
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
And you don't have to

515
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,240
think about my feelings

516
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,160
in the future.

517
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Because I've been

518
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,800
a little bit worried.

519
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,960
I know you're worried about me.

520
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,960
I'm very worried.

521
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,040
So I deliberately

522
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,240
hit you yesterday.

523
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,680
I need you to face yourself.

524
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,120
Let's make a cheongsam.

525
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,920
What?

526
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,400
Aren't we going to attend the wedding?

527
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,880
It's not my wedding.

528
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,320
Can you consider

529
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,480
the dignity of our Wen's Pharmacy?

530
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,320
If it's the dignity of Wen's Pharmacy,

531
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,120
I should do it.

532
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,520
But the cheongsam is free.

533
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,520
You can pay for it.

534
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,440
You're also an shareholder.

535
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,640
Why do you want me to pay for it?

536
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
I don't want to make cheongsam.

537
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,160
You asked me to make cheongsam.

538
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,840
And you're the biggest shareholder

539
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,840
of Wen's Pharmacy.

540
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,400
Okay.

541
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,240
And I think

542
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
I should change a pair of leather shoes.

543
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,160
Okay?

544
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,800
You're so modest.

545
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,160
And I think

546
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,760
I should change my bag.

547
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,840
Manager Chu.

548
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,160
Suzhou.

549
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,880
Sorry to bother you.

550
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,800
You can go on a business trip.

551
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,440
Come in.

552
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,680
Boss Wen, here's the newspaper.

553
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,080
Thank you.

554
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,240
Boss Wen,

555
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,760
then you're so kind.

556
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,160
It's a deal.

557
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,840
Erniu.

558
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,080
Erniu.

559
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,160
What's wrong?

560
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
Tian Ershou committed suicide.

561
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,480
I thought it was something serious.

562
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,200
Xiao Sun told me

563
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
that the medicine he took last night

564
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,920
was fine now.

565
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,680
But you didn't go to see him?

566
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
Why should I go to see him?

567
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,160
He committed suicide for you.

568
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,680
He took the medicine for such a small thing.

569
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
He's really despicable.

570
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,960
Guess how many did he take?

571
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,440
Three.

572
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,080
Three.

573
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Three?

574
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,280
If it wasn't for the hospital,

575
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,800
he would have woken up

576
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,160
before the wedding.

577
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,200
But I think you should go to see him.

578
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,040
After all, you two are meant to be.

579
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,520
Don't be too heartless.

580
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,720
You forgot how he treated you.

581
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,720
That's what's called heartlessness.

582
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,880
I've already treated him with all my heart.

583
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
But didn't you want to

584
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,200
marry him in a different way?

585
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,080
Why did it change so quickly?

586
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,760
I have to thank you.

587
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,800
Me?

588
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,640
If it wasn't for your lawsuit,

589
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,960
I would still be dreaming

590
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,640
of marrying the second young mistress.

591
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,240
Now I know

592
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,440
that the family

593
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,360
doesn't take me as their own person.

594
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,760
To be precise,

595
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,440
they don't take me as their own person.

596
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,040
Since I can't get through this single bridge,

597
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
I have to change my own

598
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,720
way of life.

599
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,760
It's good that you think so.

600
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,480
I'm glad to hear that.

601
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,480
Don't worry.

602
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,600
You're here.

603
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,840
Wait for me.

604
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,120
I'll get changed and come down.

605
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,600
Who is he?

606
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,280
A man.

607
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,840
Didn't you say that you wanted to

608
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,800
change your way of life?

609
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,280
His name is Mu Ziru.

610
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,960
He's the fourth person in the gang.

611
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,800
He's rich and has a good life.

612
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,040
Although he was born poor,

613
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
he's not rich.

614
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,840
Compared to Tian Ershang,

615
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
he's my way of life.

616
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,400
Erniu.

617
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,760
I'm not as rich as he is.

618
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,320
I'm just a little poor.

619
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,160
Erniu.

620
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
Are you still relying on men?

621
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,360
Who else can I rely on

622
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,560
except men?

623
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,520
Women can have their own way

624
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,760
of life without men.

625
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,960
What other way can I have?

626
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
This may be my best way of life.

627
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,120
But he's a gang member.

628
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,400
I'm afraid he'll hurt you.

629
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,920
Don't worry.

630
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,240
On this road,

631
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,800
I'm always on my own

632
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
whether there are men or not.

633
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,520
As long as there are no relatives or enemies,

634
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,280
no one can really hurt me.

635
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm leaving.

636
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,680
Bye.

637
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,360
Bye.

638
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,160
Be careful.

639
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,080
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

640
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,240
Come on in.

641
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,480
Please get in the car.

642
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,200
You are so smart to see people

643
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
You threw our Tian family's face into it

644
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,880
How did it become like this

645
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
You come here

646
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,760
You scold her for me

647
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,920
Scold her for me

648
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,640
Not Tong Xin

649
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,520
Aren't you two very romantic?

650
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
Why did you break up?

651
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,200
How do i know

652
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,600
People have been playing with her from start to finish

653
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,800
Play our Tian family

654
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,120
Dare to go against the Tian family

655
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,480
What is her backstage

656
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,760
What backstage do you care about her

657
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,720
Dare to go against us and choke her to death

658
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,840
Don't brother

659
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
No, can you be a little bit stubborn?

660
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,160
Then don't i like her

661
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,600
Tong Xin

662
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,360
Don't have to be like this

663
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,640
Miss Bai is very beautiful

664
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,160
But there are more beautiful women than her

665
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,760
It's the same as her

666
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,840
right

667
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,040
Why don't you hold Bai Bingxin?

668
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,800
I do not

669
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,760
I want her

670
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,920
No, why don't you die?

671
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,240
I was going to die

672
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,800
Didn't you save me back?

673
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,920
No no no

674
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,440
You two stop arguing, okay?

675
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,720
Old Zhou

676
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
What did you say

677
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
Said someone

678
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,320
People look exactly like that bitch Bai

679
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,760
Yes

680
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,400
I

681
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,080
I met a prostitute in Beijing before

682
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,440
That body

683
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,040
The eyebrows are not bad with Bai Bingxin

684
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,080
Prostitute

685
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
I don't believe it

686
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't let my mother know

687
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,680
You said it looks exactly the same

688
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,880
Anyway, I can't tell

689
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,360
That's impossible

690
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,920
I don't believe

691
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
Bingxin is unique

692
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
You are not my brother

693
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,040
You are my grandfather

694
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,600
Take care, brother

695
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,520
Old Zhou

696
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
The prostitute you just said

697
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,560
Where is the prostitute now?

698
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,800
you

699
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,320
Why do you ask her?

700
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,240
I want to find her out

701
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,120
I hate that bitch

702
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,520
Can't this be fun?

703
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,520
Let's just forget it

704
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,160
why

705
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,040
I really dare not

706
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,120
Connect with that kind of woman

707
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,080
Nothing

708
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,320
You just need to tell me

709
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,600
What's her name

710
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
Where are you now

711
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,360
I'll do the rest

712
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,640
Won't get you involved

713
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,160
Didn't you like it last time?

714
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,240
A bunch of fans

715
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,720
Lu Ningxiang

716
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,560
Lin Fanglu

717
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,520
What is this

718
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,920
Don't you want to host the wedding?

719
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,400
Your dark circles

720
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,000
Your face

721
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Take care of it

722
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,600
Boss Wen

723
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,200
Why did it suddenly become so generous?

724
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,160
I like you

725
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,680
Come on

726
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,800
I just want you to be willing to sell my life

727
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,840
As long as you pay enough taxes and shares

728
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,800
I will be willing to sell my life

729
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,960
What can a box of fireworks do

730
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,240
Isn't it all Shen?

731
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,920
You used to play this card

732
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,240
Awesome

733
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,760
I want the fireworks too

734
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,360
I won't be soft-handed with taxes and shares

735
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,240
You're pretty good at playing cards

736
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,920
Awesome

737
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,320
Boss Wen, Miss Chu, something happened

738
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,720
The medicine that was deducted

739
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,480
The total value is 23,500 yuan

740
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
All prepared to be sent to Hangzhou

741
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,600
You go to the police station first

742
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,080
Listen to the official statement

743
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
I'll go find a side to understand

744
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,640
it is good

745
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,720
Then you can talk to them

746
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,120
You go find them

747
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,360
Yes

748
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,660
スタ モели

749
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,440
Come

750
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,080
Come

751
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,760
what

752
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,400
Why was the deducted

753
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
Are you not clear?

754
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,360
We really don't know

755
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,520
Someone report you

756
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,920
said your Wenxiong shoulders

757
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,160
っb t assessment

758
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,840
Concerning drug life

759
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,640
Under the pretext

760
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,400
What's the matter?

761
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,920
That means

762
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,720
our goods

763
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,120
will be deducted for at least half a year

764
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,880
If we find nothing

765
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,160
we will return it immediately

766
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,280
If there's anything

767
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,520
Miss

768
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,480
just wait for the meal

769
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,040
Who reported it?

770
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
I can't tell you

771
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,840
If someone reported it

772
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
it must be some kind of rumor

773
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,640
We need some evidence

774
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,080
If someone reported it, it's evidence

775
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,400
Then according to your statement

776
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,720
if someone reported it

777
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,320
whether there's any evidence

778
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,600
whether it's empty or not

779
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,240
we can deduct the goods first

780
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
That's what I mean

781
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,360
Okay

782
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,440
Mr. Police, I want to report

783
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
What do you want to report?

784
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,400
I want to report that he

785
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,880
and Jin Han Ding and Huang Yucheng are a team

786
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,840
Miss

787
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,360
Don't say that

788
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,360
He knows where Jin Han Ding and Huang Yucheng are hiding

789
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,360
Miss

790
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,280
You will kill me if you say that

791
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,360
Arrest him first

792
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,560
and investigate him first

793
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,200
Miss

794
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,080
I'm sorry

795
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,840
I'm sorry

796
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,560
I'm sorry

797
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,440
I'm sorry

798
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm sorry

799
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,960
I'm sorry

800
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,720
I'm sorry

801
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm sorry

802
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,600
I'm sorry

803
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm sorry

804
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,240
I'm sorry

805
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm sorry

806
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Don't listen to him

807
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,160
He's talking nonsense

808
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,880
There's no evidence at all

809
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,680
Someone reported it, that's evidence

810
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,120
Miss

811
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,840
What are you doing?

812
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,960
I just want to know

813
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,040
why you are deliberately deducting our goods

814
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll tell you the truth

815
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,040
I don't know either

816
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,280
Our Manager Wang asked us to deduct

817
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,120
We just executed the order

818
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,840
We have no choice

819
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,000
Manager Wang

820
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,640
Yes

821
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,440
Manager Wang can meet you if you want to

822
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,120
I really have an emergency

823
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,600
I want to ask him for advice

824
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,400
No

825
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Please

826
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
Just tell me the truth

827
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,240
I'm busy

828
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,880
No, you...

829
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,080
Manager Wang

830
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,240
Manager Wang

831
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,960
Hello, Manager Wang

832
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,720
I'm Chu Shaohua, the general manager of the Wen's Group

833
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,840
Manager Wang

834
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,840
Your face is pale

835
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,960
Your eyes are swollen and your lips are black

836
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,640
Have you been dizzy and dizzy recently?

837
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,000
Your waist is soft and your hands and feet are cold

838
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
What are you talking about?

839
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,440
I'm always sleepy

840
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,640
I'm busy

841
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,880
I can't do anything

842
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,440
Don't talk nonsense

843
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,240
If you talk nonsense again, I'll arrest you

844
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,760
Manager Wang, don't worry

845
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,080
You have a bad luck

846
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,720
You need to take medicine to make up for it

847
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,040
The precious kidney of our Wen's Group

848
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,880
is working well for this disease

849
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
You can improve all your diseases in three days

850
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
In addition, our eastern tonic

851
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,800
can immediately relieve your headache

852
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,960
Manager Wang, try it

853
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,400
You are from the Wen's Group?

854
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,000
This is my business card

855
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,120
Manager Wang, we have a batch of medicine

856
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,560
called eastern tonic

857
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,720
It's this

858
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,680
Your subordinate took it

859
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,080
He said it was a private opium

860
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,960
It's really unjust

861
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,920
So I came here

862
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,000
to ask Manager Wang to give us a chance to appeal

863
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,680
Is it unjust?

864
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,840
We'll have a conclusion after our investigation

865
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,680
You can wait for the notice

866
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,280
How long will it take to come to a conclusion?

867
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,520
Three to five days

868
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,320
Great

869
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,240
Manager Wang, thank you for your care

870
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,560
I won't bother you

871
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:34,960
Okay

872
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
Thank you

873
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,040
Manager Wang, remember to take medicine

874
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,920
Okay

875
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,640
Goodbye

876
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,560
And tomorrow, bring him some

877
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,280
precious kidney and eastern tonic

878
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,440
and try to communicate with him

879
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
Hope there will be a change

880
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,440
It's useless

881
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,880
I got the news

882
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,320
The black hand behind the scenes is Tian Dashang

883
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,440
Tian Dashang?

884
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,680
The Tian family has a relationship with the Sun Hu Police Department

885
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,000
After Wang Guodong came on stage

886
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,600
he spent a lot of money on him

887
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,440
This is a trap

888
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,560
He must take revenge

889
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,960
What did Mr. Xia say?

890
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,080
He contacted some colleagues for us

891
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,920
But

892
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,920
they are all related to Lu Yongxiang

893
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,720
Wang Guodong is from the Go Club

894
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,160
He doesn't buy Lu Yongxiang's account

895
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,280
That's interesting

896
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,680
I also asked a friend of Wang Guodong's

897
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,520
to invite him out for dinner

898
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,920
But he is too arrogant

899
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,000
It's hard to invite him

900
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,080
Hello

901
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,360
Brother Yu Long

902
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,280
I just got your message

903
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,120
Yes

904
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,920
Okay, I got it

905
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,720
Thank you

906
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,160
Wang Guodong agreed to come out for dinner

907
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,800
Really?

908
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,400
But

909
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,440
He only asked you to accompany him

910
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,720
Me?

911
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,160
Don't say that

912
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,040
Your eastern tonic

913
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,280
is a little famous

914
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,360
Last night, I ate a bottle

915
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,800
of the medicine you gave me

916
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
I ate a bottle of the medicine you gave me

917
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,840
I'm much better now

918
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,440
That's great

919
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,880
Mr. Wang

920
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,680
To help the patient get rid of his pain

921
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,000
is the order of our Wen's

922
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,720
health and safety opening

923
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,360
Yes, since we opened the business

924
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,240
we have always

925
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,160
respected the ancestral teachings of our ancestors

926
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,240
We can't do such a dirty thing

927
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,640
Mr. Wang, have a look

928
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,400
This is the contract signed by our

929
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,680
some businessmen in Suzhou

930
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,640
and the collection of the receipts

931
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,240
and the receipts for the stock

932
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,160
and the record of our packaging

933
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,120
and the contract of the goods company

934
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,040
You can know it

935
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,880
by looking at the real thing

936
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,040
The so-called private opium

937
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,000
is only a source of empty blood

938
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,760
Just based on these empty words

939
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,360
and these receipts

940
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,920
I can trust you completely

941
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,280
No, no, no

942
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,760
I'm afraid it's impossible

943
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,640
No, no, no

944
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,080
More than twenty pharmaceutical companies

945
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,120
in Shanghai National Medicine Association

946
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,640
are willing to testify for us

947
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,120
Yes

948
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,040
It's impossible

949
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,760
Mr. Wang

950
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,320
If you say so

951
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
then our Wen's

952
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,560
can only close the door

953
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,520
Not really

954
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,800
Mr. Wang, you don't know

955
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,200
In order to open this store

956
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,480
Mr. Wen

957
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
has mortgaged all the assets

958
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,920
and borrowed a lot of money

959
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,200
It's not easy

960
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,640
to open some sales

961
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,200
in order to open some sales

962
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,040
Then

963
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,320
we suddenly encountered such a ridiculous thing

964
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,440
If we can't get back this batch of goods

965
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,800
then Mr. Wen

966
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,440
can only go to Nanjing Road for a meal

967
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,840
I

968
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,280
I will lose my job

969
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,160
You have to suffer with this

970
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,880
I won't agree to this

971
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,760
Mr. Wang

972
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,520
You are so high-ranking

973
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,560
Just sell our batch of goods

974
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,200
Miss Chu

975
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,200
I'll tell you the truth

976
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,760
You are so poor

977
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,640
and miserable

978
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,440
You want to get back this batch of goods

979
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,400
It's impossible

980
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,560
Yes, yes, I just said so

981
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,160
Yes

982
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,480
Mr. Wang finally came out

983
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
to have a meal with us

984
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,560
and talk about business

985
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,720
Mr. Wang

986
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,600
I'll toast you with this cup

987
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Brother Yunlong

988
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,560
this time

989
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,960
he couldn't come back from abroad

990
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,480
so he asked me to

991
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,120
toast you with this cup

992
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,720
Yunlong is my brother

993
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,400
Yes

994
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Then you are my brother too

995
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,520
It's easy to say

996
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,080
Have a drink

997
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,000
Thank you, Mr. Wang

998
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,840
Thank you, Mr. Wang

999
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,840
Please take care of us

1000
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,560
Yunlong and I

1001
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,600
are classmates from the Northern Police Academy

1002
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,560
He talked

1003
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,040
I can't take his face

1004
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,200
But now I think

1005
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,640
I thought about it

1006
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,240
Just because of our classmates

1007
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,080
I don't think it's enough

1008
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,920
Well

1009
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,920
What if we add this?

1010
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,920
Actually

1011
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,720
it's not that complicated

1012
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,040
You want to get back this batch of goods

1013
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Just promise me one condition

1014
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,400
Mr. Wang, please say

1015
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,520
You

1016
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,120
be my

1017
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
father and wife

1018
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,880
I'll release this batch of goods right away

1019
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,680
I

1020
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,560
Mr. Wang, please, please make a joke

1021
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,160
Mr. Wang must be joking

1022
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,360
Mr. Wang

1023
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,000
you must be punished for laughing

1024
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,680
I never joke

1025
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,080
I'm serious

1026
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
If you are serious

1027
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,840
I'll tell you seriously

1028
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,440
Impossible

1029
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,560
In my dictionary

1030
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,760
there is no

1031
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,520
impossible

1032
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,560
Yunlong

1033
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,160
Wait, wait, wait

1034
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you

1035
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,920
Mr. Wang, look at my mouse

1036
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,560
You see, his temper is not good

1037
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,560
OK

1038
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,480
Put it down

1039
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
The temper is good

1040
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,560
It tastes good

1041
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
Old man, look

1042
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,360
Stinky rascal

1043
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,560
I'll kill you

1044
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,080
Stop

1045
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,520
Stop

1046
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,040
Wait

1047
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,200
Mr. Wang

1048
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,080
You like this kind of thing

1049
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,400
I'll find you two later

1050
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,280
Both are better than this

1051
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,360
No, no, no, no

1052
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,520
I want him

1053
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,800
No, no, no, no

1054
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,400
This

1055
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,480
Married

1056
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,200
I had a baby

1057
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,160
Not good

1058
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
My brother

1059
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
To be honest

1060
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,320
The seven wives in my family

1061
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,120
have everything

1062
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,880
Female students, female stars

1063
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,040
There is no female manager

1064
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,280
No

1065
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,440
Director

1066
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,000
Get up

1067
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,680
Mr. Wang

1068
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,480
I was not good just now

1069
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,400
I was impulsive

1070
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,720
This cup of wine

1071
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,720
I'm sorry

1072
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,040
Yes, your wife

1073
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,000
Not sensible

1074
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,280
Have to be punished

1075
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,520
Right?

1076
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,440
Accompanying

1077
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,320
One cup of wine is not enough

1078
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,520
At least one bottle of wine

1079
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,640
Mr. Wang is right

1080
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,920
Have to be punished, come on

1081
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,320
I'll drink it for him

1082
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,960
Get out

1083
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,480
She

1084
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,440
Another cup of wine

1085
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,400
Not enough

1086
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,200
Drink it again

1087
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,120
Drink it again

1088
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,880
Drink it again

1089
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,880
I still need to get married

1090
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,400
Drink it

1091
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,560
This is good

1092
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,720
The better

1093
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,920
I like

1094
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,960
How about it?

1095
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,760
You married me back?

1096
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,760
Aren't you afraid that your family will be in trouble?

1097
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,120
No, no, no.

1098
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,800
The people in my family

1099
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,560
are very virtuous.

1100
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,600
They will also let you be.

1101
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,560
No.

1102
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,640
There are people who are fated to be.

1103
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,680
They have fated their lives.

1104
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,080
Their lives are too hard.

1105
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,040
If they are at home, they will kill their father.

1106
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,800
If they are married, they will kill their husband.

1107
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,680
Nice.

1108
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,520
You are fated to say that I am

1109
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,320
a man with a life.

1110
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,120
A woman

1111
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,360
can forget me

1112
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,320
when she is married.

1113
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,000
Mr. Wang.

1114
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,600
Master is here.

1115
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,160
I

1116
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,080
have a fiance.

1117
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,680
A... a fiance?

1118
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,000
Who?

1119
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,920
He...

1120
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,760
That's easy.

1121
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,640
A small collected

1122
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,560
little slide

1123
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
colleagues

1124
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,240
networking

1125
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:15,720
love

1126
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,320
love

1127
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,000
A mind

1128
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,280
Sbacks

1129
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,160
Fire

1130
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,560
The little peony hidden in her heart

1131
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,160
warms her heart a little bit

1132
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,960
She speaks out against the day

1133
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,960
She says winter is short

1134
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,960
The eternal pen is looking at her

1135
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,960
Day by day, night by night, there is regret

1136
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,960
Day by day, night by night, I am not lonely anymore

1137
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
The wind blows away the hope, the hope is gone

1138
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,960
I give up my life for you

1139
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,960
Day by day, night by night, there is regret

1140
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,960
Day by day, night by night, I am not lonely anymore

1141
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,960
The wind blows away the hope, the hope is gone

1142
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,960
I give up my life for you

1143
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,960
I will reach the endless path, the eternal in my heart

1144
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:17,960
I will reach the endless path, the eternal in my heart
