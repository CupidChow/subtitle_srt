1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Take her to her room.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I heard the wind from the sky above the sea

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That is not the wind, that is not the wind

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the sharpness in my eyes

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not easy, then let's break it

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My bitter pain, my pain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I finally turn around

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the wildest night

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to break the world

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is the one for me

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuo

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That is the double-edged sword

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Brother

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
You are on duty tonight

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't sleep too much

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's the matter with the young lady?

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You run faster

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, brother

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Come, you hold it

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sister

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why are you here again?

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mom asked me to come

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Didn't mom know you were leaving?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
She couldn't bear to leave you

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She wanted you to go back tonight

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Take her to dinner together

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a farewell

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You go back and tell mom

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm busy on the knees now

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Can't walk

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't be angry with me

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You know my temper

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You go back and tell mom

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I will go back tomorrow

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will take Wang Jiang and two gentlemen

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The police will explain the account, goods and cash in person

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Just eat

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
OK, you are stupid

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
By the way, sister

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
When I came, your brother told me

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Your brother told me when I came

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
His head hurts a little

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Is he okay?

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you want to see a doctor?

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just think

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Or you give him the medicine to cure headache

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just give him two doses

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let him drink it

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
it is good

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Zhu

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Zhu

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Jiang

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Wait a minute

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll help you

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You go back and tell my brother

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You go back and tell my brother

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is internal medicine

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This is external

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If it hurts, you can eat this

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
OK

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But if you don't see the light

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You must see a doctor

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Remembered

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will go to the hospital

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I will go to the hospital

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will go to the hospital

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will go to the hospital

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I will go to the hospital

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm leaving

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Internal medicine

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm leaving

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Sister Shuang

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sister Shuang

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Your mother just asked someone to send a letter

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Said your father fell ill

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let you go back quickly

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wasn't he fine yesterday?

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Still coming to the town to see me

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This person is old

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The illness is like a mountain

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You hurry up

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You have to walk the mountain road for two hours

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
OK

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Then I'll go and tell the young lady

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't don't

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Don't say it

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Today my father is here for you

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't say it

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't say it

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Today my father is your job

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll talk to the young lady

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You hurry up

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Row

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you brother

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then I'll go first

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm leaving

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm leaving

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why are you drinking so much wine?

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Where are you going so late?

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sleep on your feet

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Shui

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Shui

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't go

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
My mother

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Then we should go to bed, okay?

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Let me tell you again

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Can I sleep?

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Say it

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Mommy, I love you

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Good sleep

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Close your eyes

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Close your eyes

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Boss, this soup is for you

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Xuanxuan can't drink it

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why?

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
She has diarrhea

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Can't drink chicken soup

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, remember

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Remember

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Drink it at night

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Drink it

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Shuangxi

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Shuangxi

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Shuangxi

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Shuangxi

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why did you fall asleep?

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What's wrong?

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's almost time to go to the pharmacy

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why?

143
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Get the money back

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I need to get some medicine

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's wrong with you?

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I need to take the medicine

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You can't go

148
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll go

149
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You'll be here

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm not going

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't go

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't go

153
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can't go

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm trying my best

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,480
You really gave me the antidote

156
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,520
Are you crazy?

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,360
That's my sister

158
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,640
What's so good about you?

159
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,560
Go quickly

160
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Sister-in-law

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Sister-in-law

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Who is it?

163
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Who is it?

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Who is it?

165
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Sister-in-law

166
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm your brother-in-law

167
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
I finally have this day

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,800
Sister-in-law

169
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't come over

170
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Stop it

171
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Stop it

172
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,200
Let me

173
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Sister-in-law

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I really like you

175
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
You bastard

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sister-in-law

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Sister-in-law

178
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I really like you

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Sister-in-law

180
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why are you so late all day?

181
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Sister-in-law

182
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Bastard

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Sister-in-law

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You should go now

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Hurry up

187
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No

188
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If you don't go, Hua will wake up

189
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's good to wake up

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Chu Shaozhong, what are you doing?

191
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Get up

192
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Get up

193
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You have to fight with me, right?

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why are you so bad?

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Chu Shaozhong

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What kind of man are you?

197
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You are so bad

198
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are so bad

199
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You killed me

200
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They don't make a difference

201
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You dare not to tell the truth

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are a loser

203
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I have made a way for you

204
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You don't want to borrow money

205
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why are you afraid?

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Go

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Go to hell

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Ok

209
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Chu Shaozhong

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You will not go, right?

211
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,840
If you don't go, I'll take Xiaobao away.

212
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,120
Let's not go there.

213
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,880
Enough.

214
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,680
I'll go.

215
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,200
Don't bully my mom.

216
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,720
Xuanxuan, let go.

217
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,480
I'm your uncle.

218
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,120
Let go.

219
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,400
Let go.

220
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,920
Don't cry.

221
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,400
Don't cry.

222
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,240
Xuanxuan.

223
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,600
Let her go.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,680
Let her go.

225
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,240
Don't cry.

226
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
Let her go.

227
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,480
Enough.

228
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,280
No.

229
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,640
Let her go.

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,280
Let her go.

231
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,920
Let her go.

232
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,080
Let her go.

233
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,520
Xuanxuan.

234
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Xuanxuan obtain

235
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,920
Xuanxuan.

236
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
No.

237
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,520
Xuanxuan.

238
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,720
Let her go.

239
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
Let her go.

240
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,720
Let her go.

241
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,840
Let her go.

242
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,120
Let her go.

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,560
Mom.

244
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,960
Mom.

245
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,480
You don't have to worry about Chen Ershui

246
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
and the family anymore.

247
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
I'll take care of this family.

248
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,200
In the future,

249
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,600
as long as there are me and Xuanxuan,

250
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,880
you'll be the one.

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,520
You know what kind of person Ershui is.

252
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,960
You can't be fooled by his words.

253
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,440
Mom.

254
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,960
Mom.

255
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,840
No.

256
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,640
When did you get here?

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
I came in a long time ago.

258
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,280
Mom.

259
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,720
I called you for a long time but you didn't answer.

260
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,200
I thought you were sick.

261
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,360
You scared me.

262
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,600
You scared me to death.

263
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,680
Who did this to you?

264
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,880
You're a bad person.

265
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,280
What are you doing?

266
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,240
Why are you here?

267
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,080
It's so late.

268
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,720
Ershun hasn't come back yet.

269
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,160
I just want to ask him

270
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,960
if he's okay.

271
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,400
How dare you ask me?

272
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,840
You're a useless thing.

273
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,480
You're a useless snack.

274
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,320
You're a man.

275
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,240
You don't look good.

276
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,640
You even asked me.

277
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,280
You...

278
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,640
You eat and sleep all day.

279
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,600
You eat and sleep all day.

280
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,880
You're a useless thing.

281
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,480
If you could

282
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,200
give Chen a baby,

283
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,960
would I be like this now?

284
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,600
I...

285
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,360
I...

286
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,520
I'm not afraid.

287
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,840
Xianxpeng.

288
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Xing Mr. Niu.

289
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
Xing...

290
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,240
Xuan.

291
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,680
Xuan.

292
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,560
Xuan!

293
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,080
Xuan!

294
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,720
Xuan.

295
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,200
Xuan, wake up.

296
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,200
Wake up.

297
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,960
I'm here.

298
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,680
Xuan.

299
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,080
Xuan.

300
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,320
Xuan.

301
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,480
Xuan.

302
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,080
Xuan.

303
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,440
Xuan.

304
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,920
Xuan.

305
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,480
Sister-in-law.

306
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,800
Sister-in-law, I made a mistake.

307
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,400
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,320
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,080
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,920
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm sorry.

315
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,920
But I really like you.

316
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
I really want to get you, sister-in-law.

317
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,680
Just follow me, okay?

318
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,080
I'll divorce Song Ming tomorrow.

319
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
I'll marry you.

320
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,400
I'll treat you well.

321
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,440
If you like children,

322
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,880
we can have

323
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,600
one, two, three children.

324
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
You can have as many children as you want.

325
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,480
Okay, sister-in-law?

326
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
Sister-in-law, I really like you.

327
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,240
Please forgive me, okay?

328
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,920
I really didn't mean to, sister-in-law.

329
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,160
Please forgive me, okay?

330
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,240
Sister-in-law.

331
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,480
Forgive me.

332
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,680
Sister-in-law.

333
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
I beg you.

334
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,400
Sister-in-law.

335
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,720
Sister-in-law.

336
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
Sister-in-law.

337
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,400
Shhh.

338
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,160
Shhh.

339
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,040
Sister-in-law.

340
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,160
What is it?

341
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,560
Come on, wifey.

342
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,240
What is it?

343
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,960
Your broken heart.

344
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,960
Come on.

345
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,360
How's it?

346
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,760
Kill.

347
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,120
Kill me.

348
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,080
Kill me.

349
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,080
He's afraid that no matter what happens to you, you can't kill him.

350
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Shun'er!

351
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Master!

352
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Shun'er! My Shun'er!

353
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,080
You're here!

354
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,080
You're here again!

355
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Shun'er!

356
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,080
My Shun'er!

357
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,080
How could you kill him?

358
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Shun'er!

359
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,080
My Chen family is the best!

360
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Master!

361
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Hua Shun Pharmacy.

362
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
This is the place, Da He.

363
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Hua Shun Pharmacy.

364
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Grab him!

365
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Guys, grab him!

366
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Hua Shun Pharmacy.

367
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,080
My Shun'er!

368
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,080
My Shun'er!

369
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
My Shun'er!

370
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Don't shout!

371
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Little girl, it's really you.

373
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
You don't respect the bandits.

374
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Take her away.

375
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Move everything away.

376
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Here.

377
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Shut up.

378
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Go.

379
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Go.

380
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
Shaohua. Shaohua.

381
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Who is it?

382
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Go. Go.

383
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Who is it?

384
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
She ran away.

385
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Come back. Come back.

386
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Stop chasing.

387
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
We can't stay in the city.

388
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Have you packed everything?

389
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
Yes.

390
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
It's almost done. Go.

391
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
Go.

392
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Go.

393
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Hurry.

394
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,080
What's going on?

395
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Where is the young lady?

396
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Hurry.

397
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
The young lady.

398
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Did you catch her?

399
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
The young lady.

400
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
The young lady.

401
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Save her.

402
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Hurry.

403
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Hurry.

404
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Save her.

405
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
I got it.

406
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Shaohua.

407
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
I asked you for money.

408
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Shaohua.

409
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Shaohua.

410
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Sha...

411
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Shaohua.

412
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Shaohua.

413
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,080
Shaohua.

414
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Sha...

415
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
Shaohua, what's wrong?

416
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
Sha...

417
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
It's all...

418
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
It's all...

419
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
It's all...

420
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
What's wrong?

421
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
What's wrong?

422
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
Why are you so hot?

423
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
Shaohua.

424
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Sha...

425
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
What's wrong?

426
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
It's raining.

427
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Hurry.

428
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Hurry.

429
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
The young lady.

430
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
The young lady.

431
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
The young lady.

432
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Shaohua.

433
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
Shaohua.

434
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Shaohua.

435
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
Shaohua.

436
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Shaohua.

437
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Sha...

438
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
Sha...

439
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Sha...

440
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,600
Sha...

441
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Sha...

442
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,880
Sir. Sir.

443
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,040
Handgun doctor dead

444
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,080
and body's dead.

445
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Where is our young lady, exactly?

446
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,900
Why are you asking?

447
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,500
She must have been kidnapped by Sanshou Gang.

448
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,620
Sanshou Gang has always been like this.

449
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,900
Killing men to rob women,

450
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,980
robbing and burning.

451
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,140
Sir,

452
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,140
how can we

453
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,580
get our Great Madam out?

454
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,980
Women who were kidnapped by Sanshou Gang

455
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,580
can't come back alive.

456
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
What's the situation at the medicine shop?

457
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,580
All burned.

458
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,620
What a pity.

459
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,380
Where's that little widow?

460
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,300
I heard that

461
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,060
three people were found dead in the medicine shop.

462
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,620
But none of them were that dead.

463
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,700
They said that the bandit took them away.

464
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,740
They can't come back alive.

465
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,380
This is really a good story.

466
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,300
Second Young Master.

467
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,660
Second Young Master.

468
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,260
Second Young Master.

469
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,100
How much blood pressure do you have?

470
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,820
This...

471
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,980
This...

472
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,580
The body length

473
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,900
is about the same as

474
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,300
the body of a man.

475
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,620
About 3,000 yuan.

476
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,380
Give it to me.

477
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,900
Second Young Master.

478
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,540
Why do you need so much money?

479
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,620
I... I'm going to find Sanshou Gang

480
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,100
to redeem Shaohua.

481
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,700
Shaohua?

482
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,780
That little widow?

483
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,620
You're friends with her?

484
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,820
Give me the money.

485
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,900
No, no, no.

486
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,380
Second Young Master.

487
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,740
Don't be anxious.

488
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,740
This...

489
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,420
This is a lot of money.

490
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,620
I can't make decisions alone.

491
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,220
I'll explain to him.

492
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,140
You don't have to be involved.

493
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,420
No.

494
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm not that kind of person.

495
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,060
I'm not afraid of being involved.

496
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,460
Although I have more than 3,000 yuan,

497
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,740
I can't get back

498
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,980
all the money I have.

499
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,940
Then give it to me.

500
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,100
Qi Zhou.

501
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,580
There are many medicine shops.

502
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,140
You must help me

503
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,380
buy 3,000 yuan in two hours.

504
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,580
No, 5,000 yuan.

505
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,580
Okay, okay.

506
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,380
I'll help you.

507
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,580
Second Young Master.

508
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,900
I have something to tell you.

509
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,620
We must find someone

510
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,700
to tell Sanshou Gang.

511
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,540
Tell them that we're collecting money

512
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,060
to make them show mercy.

513
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,180
We must save them first.

514
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,060
Isn't that right?

515
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,180
You can contact Sanshou Gang?

516
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:20,900
Second...

517
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,380
Second Young Master.

518
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,220
You don't know that

519
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,460
in our town,

520
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,180
if there's a famous medicine shop or business,

521
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,340
we must give a ceremony to Sanshou Gang

522
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,060
every year.

523
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,820
It's no different.

524
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,980
It's for our own goods.

525
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,260
It's for our own goods.

526
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,860
Take me there.

527
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,780
Go, go, go.

528
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,820
Second Young Master, sit down first.

529
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,020
You must sit down first.

530
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,300
Listen to me.

531
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,180
The one in the middle is an old lady.

532
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,500
The thief

533
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,820
only knows her.

534
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,140
She only contacts the person she points to.

535
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,420
She may not see all the life

536
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,940
and will make you suffer.

537
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,820
Then,

538
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,740
ask someone to give it to Sanshou Gang.

539
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,300
Tell them that money is not a problem.

540
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,940
They can give you tens of thousands.

541
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,980
They can only save you.

542
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,740
Don't worry.

543
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,860
I'll borrow money from you

544
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,940
with my hard work.

545
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,900
Go.

546
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,700
Don't worry.

547
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,180
Well...

548
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,980
You guys,

549
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,500
take care of Second Young Master.

550
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,220
Old Liang,

551
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,340

552
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,140
Coming.

553
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,820
Please.

554
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,820
Young Master.

555
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,420
Congratulations.

556
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,100
You won the winner

557
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,680
a second prize.

558
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,500
It's true.

559
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,220
Wondrous,

560
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,100
you administration should learn from Ify.

561
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,220
He did well with every achievement.

562
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,020
Why are they picking on me?

563
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,740
How I am so poor.

564
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,220
Of course.

565
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,020
I am that kind.

566
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,220
It's my responsibility.

567
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,040
You are Lehrer from my studies.

568
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,020
In this backside...

569
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:58,440
In the cold snow road...

570
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:08,340
The screen Savior exist,

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,340
I can't forget her

572
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,740
A little bit

573
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,540
It rained heavily yesterday

574
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
You must be very cold

575
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
Are you scared?

576
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,340
Shui Ling

577
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,340
We are not here

578
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,340
We are not with them

579
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
I want to take you away

580
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,340
I want to take you away

581
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340

What's going on?

586
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
They said that the bandits came last night

587
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,340
They robbed the medicine shop

588
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
When they left

589
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,340
They burned everything they couldn't take away

590
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
What about Shaohua?

591
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,340
Shaohua was taken away by the bandits

592
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,340
I think it's very dangerous

593
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Where is Xuanxuan?

594
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,340
Xuanxuan is dead

595
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,340
My child

596
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,340
My Shaohua

597
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
Mother

598
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,340
If she gave all the money to Shaozhong

599
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
Then it's not a big deal

600
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,340
It's a big deal

601
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Let me go

602
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,340
My son

603
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
Shaohua

604
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Run

605
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
Shaozhong

606
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
Shaohua

607
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
Run

608
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
My son

609
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Shaohua

610
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
Mother, how is Shaozhong?

611
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
Run

612
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,340
My son

613
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,340
I gave her a medicine just now

614
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,340
Her head is not as hot as last night

615
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,340
But she said in her mouth

616
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,340
She killed someone

617
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
She killed someone

618
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
Please say something

619
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,340
My son

620
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,340
Shaozhong

621
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
Mother

622
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,340
I'm afraid she's not talking nonsense

623
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,340
What did you say?

624
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,340
Second aunt

625
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
Third aunt

626
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
She's back

627
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,340
Xuan

628
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,340
Xuan

629
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
Don't be afraid

630
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
I'm here

631
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,340
I'll be with you

632
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,420
No

633
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,840
No

634
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,840
In addition to doing business

635
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,800
the mistress has asked me to come to help

636
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,720
Alright

637
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,880
Thank you

638
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,780
I am going out

639
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,200
In honor of the interests of Master

640
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,440
Please go back without her

641
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,640
Take care

642
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,880
Has the insurgent taken danzhu back?

643
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,980
Er...

644
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
According to the rules left by ancestors,

645
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,300
these families are all Chen's.

646
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,020
They can't belong to an outsider.

647
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,460
Am I right?

648
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,700
Yes.

649
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,780
The second family

650
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,620
is really reasonable.

651
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,060
Reasonable.

652
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,180
Reasonable.

653
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,980
In that case,

654
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,460
divide the families according to the number of people.

655
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,140
Yes.

656
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,580
Divide them.

657
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,300
Okay.

658
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,140
Divide them.

659
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,740
Third Master.

660
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,260
What about me?

661
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,340
The second family

662
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,740
can go back to your mother's.

663
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,940
If you keep on being a general,

664
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,380
our Chen family

665
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,060
will not be so talkative.

666
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,300
But

667
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,340
what about the land and house you mentioned?

668
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,700
You don't have a family name

669
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,260
or a surname.

670
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,620
What about the land and house?

671
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,980
But...

672
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,660
But...

673
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,340
You just nodded.

674
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,100
But I'm also a member of the Chen family.

675
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,340
Third Master.

676
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,420
You have to help me.

677
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,900
Come on.

678
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,260
Pack the things

679
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,900
from the second family

680
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,980
and give her the things from the Song family.

681
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,340
Let her go.

682
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,420
Here.

683
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,420
I've packed your things for you.

684
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,180
It's still dark outside.

685
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,620
Go back to the Song family's house.

686
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,660
Here.

687
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,780
I won't go back.

688
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,620
I...

689
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,260
Third Master.

690
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,700
I'm begging you.

691
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,260
Let me stay.

692
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,140
If I stay like this,

693
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,220
my family won't take me.

694
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,420
I have no place to go now.

695
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,380
I can't go back.

696
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,180
Go.

697
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,820
Third Master.

698
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
Uncle Qi.

699
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Uncle Qi.

700
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,700
I'm begging you.

701
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,740
Please help me.

702
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,660
I'm begging you.

703
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,180
Please help me stay.

704
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,260
I'm begging you.

705
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,060
Go.

706
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,260
I'm begging you.

707
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,340
Don't close the door.

708
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,020
What are you doing?

709
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,580
I'm begging you.

710
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,260
I'm begging you.

711
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,020
Please help me stay.

712
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,020
Please help me stay.

713
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,020
No.

714
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,260
Third Master.

715
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Third Master.

716
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,420
A servant just came to report that

717
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,020
Chen Xuan's tomb was torn down.

718
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
He lost his hand.

719
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,940
Only a bunch of grass was left.

720
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,460
It must be done by the wild.

721
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,420
I told you you had enough money.

722
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,300
You said it's enough.

723
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
Come on.

724
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,700
Put your hands on it.

725
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,580
Okay.

726
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,820
I understand.

727
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,180
I understand.

728
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,080
Cold blade

729
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,360
Summer

730
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,740
navagre

731
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,720
Our quite some change

732
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
It seems to be here.

733
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,180
The sky is cold and the river is cold.

734
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:54,180
The eternal other side is looking at it.

735
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,180
Day by day, I am quiet and there is no regret.

736
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:07,180
Day by day, I am not lonely anymore.

737
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,180
The wind and fire are bright and the moon are bright and the desert is desolate.

738
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,180
I will fight for you.

739
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:24,180
Green and green, the eternal other side in the heart.

740
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,180
Day by day, I am quiet and there is no regret.

741
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:57,180
Day by day, I am not lonely anymore.

742
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,180
The wind and fire are bright and the moon are bright and the desert is desolate.

743
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,180
I will fight for you.

744
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,180
Green and green, the eternal other side in the heart.

745
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:19,180
Green and green, the eternal other side in the heart.
