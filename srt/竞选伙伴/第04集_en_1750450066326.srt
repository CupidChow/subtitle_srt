1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,120
Good morning, work specialists.

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,040
Here!

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,080
From today, we will arm with devenir a cool spy spirit.

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,880
Hide in the bathroom and listen to the kids' stories.

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,880
Or capture the comments from the SS company.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,980
You're doing the SS, right?

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,880
Yes, I'll do my best.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,080
I have something to do.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,480
Okay.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,880
If you can smell something hot

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,280
from the camp over there,

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,480
please hit the game board.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,880
Game board?

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,180
But isn't that game board a bit too much?

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,380
Right?

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,480
It might look a bit dirty.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,280
But if you win, it's a win-win situation.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,280
Okay, I'll do it.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm a spy.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,380
If I win, it's a win-win situation.

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,080
I'm a spy.

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,880
If I win, it's a win-win situation.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
You're all number one in the group,

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,080
so you should take care of your image.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,180
Let's do well, okay?

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,280
That's not a bad word.

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,480
Get up, Sangmin.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
Do you want to practice?

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,880
I'll do my best.

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,480
Are you going to join?

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,580
That jerk.

32
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,980
You're going to join?

33
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,280
You're dead.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Yang Wonbae.

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Yang Wonbae.

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Yang Wonbae.

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Yang Wonbae.

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Yang Wonbae.

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Yang Wonbae.

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Yang Wonbae.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Thank you so much for helping me with this election.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Let's cheer up so that we don't regret it when it's over.

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Let's go!

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's say a word.

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,680
There are a lot of friends who couldn't participate in our camp.

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
As we gathered through high competition,

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
please run hard.

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Let's go!

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Thank you again for giving me this opportunity.

51
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,680
I'll cheer up too.

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
Thank you.

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,680
The material is different.

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,680
The fabric, fit, finish, and the detail is completely new.

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Can I upload this on OOTD?

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Of course.

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Guys, we have to wear this when we're in the post-apartheid period.

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
You can't leave it at home.

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Yes!

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,680
There are some kids who always leave it at home.

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
If you want to change the main poster,

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
you can follow me.

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
The news is starting tomorrow.

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Let's have fun.

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Let's go!

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,680
And our camp leader,

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
a second grader like me,

68
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Ju Hwan-sik.

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Hwan-sik will tell you how to cheer.

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
I'll do it.

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Hi, I'm Ju Hwan-sik.

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
I'll be the cheerleader.

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Only one, only you.

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
The best choice for me.

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Only one, only you.

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
The first class, Park Sang-hyun.

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Okay?

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Okay!

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
This is our cheerleader.

80
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
I'll send you the video in the group chat room.

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Everyone, memorize it hard.

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Okay?

83
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Yes!

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Hwan-sik, you too.

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Let's cheer up!

86
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
And our cheerleader,

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Yoo Hee-joon.

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,680
This is the chant and the lyrics of the song.

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Let's memorize it hard until tomorrow.

90
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Okay.

91
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
I mean,

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
we're the chorus.

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Can we do it like this?

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Do you want to lose to the first class?

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
No!

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Then let's go!

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
The first class!

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
The first class!

99
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Wow, that team is crazy.

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Hey, Yoon-jeong.

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Do you want to go eat something?

102
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
I got allowance.

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
No.

104
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Yeah, I just said it.

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,680
I have math class in 47 minutes.

106
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Oh, really?

107
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
That's great.

108
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
47 minutes.

109
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Eat later.

110
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Okay, then.

111
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Oh, right.

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
You know,

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,680
how much is your math class?

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,680
This stop is Jinyul Arts High School.

115
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,680
The next stop is Hangang Bridge.

116
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Oh...

117
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Hey.

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Hi.

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Is it over now?

120
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Yes.

121
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Did you get home safely that day?

122
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Yes.

123
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
You were talking like you were going to call me a lot.

124
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
But you didn't call me.

125
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
What?

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Do you remember?

127
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Do you remember me?

128
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Hey, Yoon-jeong.

129
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Yes?

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,680
It's Sang-hyun's birthday party.

131
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
The thing that happened that night.

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Yes.

133
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I've never done that before.

134
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Actually, I don't remember it well.

135
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,680
We didn't do anything then.

136
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
What?

137
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Nothing happened.

138
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,680
We were so drunk that we both fell asleep.

139
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
But I'm sure we both...

140
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Don't you really remember?

141
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,680
I was helping you wash up, and you made me wet.

142
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
It's ridiculous.

143
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I see.

144
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,680
I thought we did something.

146
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
What?

147
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
What is it?

148
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Why?

149
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,680
You said you started from tomorrow, right?

150
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Yes.

151
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Good luck.

152
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,680
If you win the election, I'll be serious.

153
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,680
The first indirect kiss in my life.

154
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
It's pretty.

155
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
What?

156
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,680
It's cute.

157
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
What?

158
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,680
This is...

159
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Handsome guys.

160
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,680
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,680
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Look.

181
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Look carefully at what's up and what's wrong.

182
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
You have to check if there are two cards.

183
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
I like taking pictures.

184
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,680
You're standing still, so there's a problem.

185
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Let's go!

186
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,140
Okay, okay, okay.

187
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,660
Today is the first day of the Yuse.

188
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,640
Let's not fight and do as we prepared.

189
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes!

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,880
And if you get caught giving out goods or gift cards to the right-wingers,

191
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,160
you're out immediately.

192
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,080
Yes!

193
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,400
Let's do as we learned.

194
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,540
If anything goes wrong, ask the director.

195
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,620
Yes!

196
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,940
Let's check everything that seems to be a problem for students.

197
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,620
Okay.

198
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Okay, okay, okay, let's do this together!

199
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,100
Yes!

200
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,820
Don't get caught!

201
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,100
Yes!

202
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,020
Let's do this together!

203
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,720
Before the live show starts, let's do this together!

204
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,300
Yes!

205
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Yes!

206
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,500
Hey, Wonhae.

207
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,700
This...

208
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,820
Hey, I haven't put the sticker on yet.

209
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,020
Hey, you guys.

210
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,780
Yes, why?

211
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,980
I haven't seen this before.

212
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,060
Where's the sticker?

213
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,740
Aha!

214
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,820
Sticker!

215
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,020
The sticker must have fallen off.

216
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,900
Hey, Takjeong.

217
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,980
You're so useless to film this.

218
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,100
This...

219
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,820
Is this 400 balls?

220
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,580
Three times?

221
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,500
400 balls?

222
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,900
Hello.

223
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,340
Hey, why are you giving out expensive chocolates here?

224
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,420
What is it?

225
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,300
You're going to eat all of them by yourself?

226
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,540
Hey, you're so stubborn.

227
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,540
If you can't eat 400 balls, you're a criminal.

228
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,100
You're a victim of the criminal.

229
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,820
Hey, you're so useless to film this.

230
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,740
Hey, you're so useless to film this.

231
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,620
Let's give out the chocolates.

232
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,900
Let's give out the chocolates.

233
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,100
Hey, let's give out the chocolates.

234
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,340
Hey, let's give out the chocolates.

235
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,420
It's so delicious!

236
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,620
Let's give out the chocolates.

237
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,140
Are you sure that the chocolates are worth 300 balls?

238
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,660
I don't have that kind of expression.

239
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,380
It's okay.

240
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,700
What do you think, Takjeong?

241
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Let's go, Takjeong!

242
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,300
Let's go, Takjeong!

243
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,140
I like it.

244
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,580
Hey, let's go!

245
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,900
Hey, guys.

246
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,580
Don't get excited.

247
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,340
It's okay.

248
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,940
Don't get excited.

249
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,700
Okay.

250
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,500
But I can't see Sehun.

251
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,380
He's not here yet?

252
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,540
Oh, well...

253
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,460
He's not here yet?

254
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,100
He's not here yet?

255
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,500
The next stop is the back gate of Yeongjin High School.

256
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,880
Is it!

257
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,520
Is it him?

258
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,820
Yes, it is.

259
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,140
I'm almost there, so just hang on.

260
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
I'm almost there.

261
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,420
Going to station Station 2 is hereby實現 wishes and wishes.

262
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,540
Let's go, let's go.

263
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,320
Hey, look at the kids.

264
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,360
You should've dressed in a uniform.

265
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,460
Is that concept of yours?

266
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,860
Is the sympathy sign your strategy?

267
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,700
Rub it on your body so it doesn't smell.

268
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,860
But I wanted to dress as similar as possible.

269
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,940
But where did you get this shirt?

270
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,140
I just got it from the 1st class.

271
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,840
Hey, you've been wearing it since you entered school.

272
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,340
I'm working hard on it.

273
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,300
Hey, you can't be a perfume brand.

274
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,140
You're going to get sick if you don't change into something you like.

275
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
Shut up.

276
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,580
Hey, this really looks like a poop mark.

277
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,280
Yeah.

278
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,180
Oh, wow.

279
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,380
Hey, you're the one who's going to get hit first.

280
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,120
You idiot.

281
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
You should quit.

282
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,460
You're such an idiot.

283
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,100
Go back a little bit.

284
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,400
It's really complicated.

285
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,960
It's so hard.

286
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,940
What are you doing?

287
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,880
What are you doing?

288
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,300
What are you doing?

289
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,820
I'm going crazy.

290
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,760
Hey.

291
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,420
What's wrong?

292
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,200
I want to die.

293
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,960
What?

294
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,300
When you're feeling better.

295
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,500
Ready for departure for the first class.

296
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

297
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,120
I'm Kim Il-gun, I'm a student.

298
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,460
The leader of Youngjin High School.

299
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,800
Park, Park, Park Seo-hyun.

300
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:56,860
The adult is the human

301
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Hurry up and go in.

302
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,760
Don't cry, don't cry.

303
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,760
Let's hear what our Yang Won-dae has to say.

304
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,900
Applause.

305
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,760
Our cute number two.

306
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,960
Yes.

307
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,980
Let's go change schools.

308
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,240
Let's go.

309
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:31,740
Won-dae, are we really going on a school trip?

310
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,940
Let's go on a school trip again.

311
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,240
Yes.

312
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,380
Yes.

313
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,860
Like onions, delicious.

314
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,780
Yes.

315
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,860
Won-dae's dream.

316
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,660
Yes.

317
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,700
The pride of Youngjin High School.

318
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,240
Yang Won-dae.

319
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,360
Yes.

320
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,060
Won-dae and Youngjin.

321
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,360
Yes.

322
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Yes.

323
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Yes.

324
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Yes.

325
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Yes.

326
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Yes.

327
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Yes.

328
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Yes.

329
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Yes.

330
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Yes.

331
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Yes.

332
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes.

333
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Yes.

334
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Yes.

335
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Yes.

336
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Yes.

337
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes.

338
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Yes.

339
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Yes.

340
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Yes.

341
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Yes.

342
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
Hey, that's crazy.

343
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Read this and tell me if you need anything else.

344
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
I'll give you a high grade.

345
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
You're handsome.

346
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
I'm number one.

347
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
You're handsome.

348
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I'll take care of our class.

349
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Thank you.

350
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Thank you.

351
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
This is our pledge card.

352
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
I'd appreciate it if you could take a look.

353
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
You watch a lot of YouTube and In-gang, right?

354
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
These days, you can charge your tablet or phone on your desk.

355
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Really?

356
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
How many are there?

357
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Then can you charge wireless?

358
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Can you charge your iPhone?

359
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
I'll check that.

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,360
I'll check if my iPhone can be charged wirelessly.

361
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Do you have any more questions?

362
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Do you have any online classes?

363
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Who is Jun-seo?

364
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Number one.

365
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Who are you picking?

366
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Number one.

367
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
You look like a loser.

368
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Hey, you said you were going to be the vice president.

369
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
What's this?

370
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
I'll reflect on myself.

371
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
I'm going to cheer up.

372
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm going to cheer up.

373
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Who are you picking?

374
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
I'm going to pick number one.

375
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
You're good at it, right?

376
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh, yes.

377
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
I'll check it.

378
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
I'll check it.

379
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
I'll check it.

380
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
I'll check it.

381
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
I'll check it.

382
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
I'll check it.

383
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
I'll check it.

384
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,360
I've picked one of our representative promises as the theme.

385
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
I've picked a song by Yoon Jong-shin, who I respect.

386
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,360
As you know, during the harsh corona pandemic,

387
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
In our school,

388
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,360
A one-year-old school trip and a three-year graduation trip.

389
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
I've actually canceled it.

390
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:44,360
And the school is going to pick a school trip for the school trip.

391
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Oh, it can't be a bad thing.

392
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Now I dare to tell you.

393
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Graduation is important, of course.

394
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Our lost memories.

395
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Our students deserve a reward.

396
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Who can do that reward?

397
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
Yeo Won-dae.

398
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Yes.

399
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Yeo Won-dae.

400
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Good.

401
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Number two, number two, Yeo Won-dae.

402
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Yes, that's right.

403
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
So I'll call you.

404
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
Instinctively.

405
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,360
I'll tell you after I pick it.

406
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
After a hard high school senior year,

407
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,360
You'll feel it when you see your graduation photo.

408
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:06,360
My very strange password.

409
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I'll believe you.

410
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:17,360
The one I chose.

411
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
It's the best trip in my life.

412
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
This trip is canceled.

413
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,360
I have to pick a promise.

414
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Shall I pick it instinctively?

415
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
One more time.

416
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Wow.

417
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Thank you.

418
00:19:52,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Number two, number two, number two.

419
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
No Se-eun, what are you doing?

420
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
You're late.

421
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Follow me.

422
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
You're dead.

423
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Park Se-eun, Park Se-eun, number two.

424
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
You guys must have prepared a lot.

425
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,360
You guys did a great job.

426
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Yeo Won-dae, Yeo Won-dae, Yeo Won-dae.

427
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Hello, I'm Go Young-chan of YJBS.

428
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,360
The 75th Yeongjin High School Student Election is now six days away.

429
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Only One, Only One.

430
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,360
No. 1 of the newly-appointed candidate, Gwang Sang-hyun.

431
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,360
No. 2 of the candidate Yang Won-dae, who aims for a re-election with the reboot as a slogan.

432
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,360
There was a first-in-the-way between the two camps at the front gate this morning.

433
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Yang Camp has prepared a variety of supplies and supplies for the candidates.

434
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,360
No. 1, Gyu, who showed off his sophisticated team uniform and perfume.

435
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Most of them were formed as choir members, and Gyu was No. 2, who showed off his unique unity and energy.

436
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,360
In particular, Park Ji-hoon's live performance, which was the theme of the school trip revival, was very impressive.

437
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Let's check out the current support rate of the candidates.

438
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,360
We will introduce the results of the survey results of the Support Ratings of the Statistics Research Club until the election day.

439
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
The change in the support rate change that is dynamic.

440
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Let's join with our YJBS.

441
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Did you see it today? They're nothing.

442
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,360
They pretend to be cowardly, but they're not sincere.

443
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
They're getting a reaction.

444
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,360
They're much better at the school trip revival than changing the uniform freedom or desk.

445
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
This is?

446
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,360
If the perfume flies away, it's all trash.

447
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,360
We will compete with sincerity and practicality.

448
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
And they don't have any know-how.

449
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
They should have done something.

450
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
That's right.

451
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,360
I've been watching the school trip revival for the past year.

452
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Let's just trust me and go.

453
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
I'm going to win no matter what.

454
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Okay?

455
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Okay!

456
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Youngji University of Education!

457
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
The University of Education!

458
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,360
We will win no matter what!

459
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
We will win no matter what!

460
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
This is war.

461
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
For what?

462
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
For power.

463
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
To get power.

464
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,360
The change in the support rate change that is dynamic.

465
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
They're nothing.

466
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,360
They're just trying to get power.

467
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Power.

468
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Hey, you guys are laughing, right?

469
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,360
You're wondering why they're talking about power, right?

470
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Just win.

471
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
You'll know.

472
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,360
The people who were in your room will be exposed to the world.

473
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
That's what I'm saying.

474
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
What should I do if I want to do that?

475
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,360
I'll hang the head of the guy who doesn't lose to the head of the student committee!

476
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
You have to fight with this kind of thought.

477
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
Do you understand what I mean?

478
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Yes!

479
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
There's no need to be depressed because you were pushed back on the first day.

480
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,360
I'll plant a winning mentality in your head from now on.

481
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,360
So don't make a face like a hero and make a face like a winner.

482
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Do you understand?

483
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Yes!

484
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Eat.

485
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Eat.

486
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Eat.

487
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
It's mine.

488
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Did you figure out the anti-discrimination law?

489
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
The third grade is still figuring it out.

490
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
This is the second grade.

491
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,360
First grade?

492
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Thank you.

493
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,360
The key to war is how to plan strategies and tactics.

494
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,360
The strategy is like an overall back picture to win the final.

495
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,360
The tactics are tricks that you can win in the form of a strategy.

496
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Now, the lower and higher classes are checked here.

497
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Then where should we go first?

498
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Senior!

499
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
The support is low.

500
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Wait!

501
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
No.

502
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
You should think the other way around.

503
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,360
We should start with the people who support us.

504
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,360
In a word, make our class first.

505
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Because...

506
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Even if they have the same number of heads, their voices are much louder.

507
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,360
So, guerrilla and 유세는 must be there during the break.

508
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
We'll go to the first class who supports our class.

509
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
When we go there and talk,

510
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Who are you going to pick?

511
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Can you pick us?

512
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Not like that.

513
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Of course, you're going to pick us.

514
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Tell the others.

515
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Okay.

516
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
That's how it's going to be.

517
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
Got it?

518
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
If you're a love-hate relationship,

519
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,360
If you're a student of our school, you should pick the first class.

520
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,360
You're going to pick a bastard who's trying to get a job to go to college easily?

521
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Are you going to fall for that bastard's trick?

522
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Are you fucking crazy?

523
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Yes!

524
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
That's what I'm saying.

525
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
It's not our business.

526
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Let's make it come out of the mouths of the supporters.

527
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,360
We're just putting fire on the wolf's tail.

528
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
So!

529
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Let's go.

530
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Go and get them all to me.

531
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Not the human convenience store or something that walks around.

532
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Bring them all to me!

533
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Even if it's a little bit!

534
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
Got it?

535
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Yes!

536
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Let's go to the left and right positions.

537
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Kill them all.

538
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Just throw it away.

539
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Se-hoon, I'm going to the justice office.

540
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Yes?

541
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Would you like to talk to me?

542
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
The first class

543
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
This is still...

544
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
I know.

545
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
There are times when you get twisted like this.

546
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
It's a little bit of a mistake.

547
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
That's right.

548
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,360
This account is probably one of the Yangwon University students.

549
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Who could it be?

550
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
That's not important.

551
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,360
What's certain is that the Frame War has begun.

552
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Frame?

553
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
This.

554
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
What does this look like?

555
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Square and square.

556
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Now?

557
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Is it square again?

558
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,360
No, it's just round now.

559
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
Yes, this is the Frame.

560
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,360
I'm not interested in what you're originally.

561
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Now they're going to cut you down and cut you down the way they want.

562
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,360
In the worst way.

563
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,360
That's how you pollute the image of number one.

564
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Then what do I do now?

565
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,360
You're just talking to me.

566
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
Just a talk.

567
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
This election.

568
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,360
Maybe Se-yoon will play the biggest role in your role.

569
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,360
But among our kids, you know the best about the Yangwon University kids.

570
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
You were in the choir until recently.

571
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
You said you were close to Park Ji-hoon.

572
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Yes, that's right.

573
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Then let's solve one by one.

574
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Rumors about the kids this time?

575
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Rumors?

576
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Yes, rumors and facts are good.

577
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,360
The stories about the dogs you know well.

578
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
Yoonjung is popular.

579
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
I envy you.

580
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
I'm screwed.

581
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
It's okay.

582
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
It's better than being indifferent.

583
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Brother.

584
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
I'm here for the election.

585
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
I'm not going to avoid this.

586
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
But laugh.

587
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
The one who laughs wins.

588
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,360
In-kyung talked about winning mentality.

589
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
They were good today.

590
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Ji-hoon too.

591
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Anyway, let's do better tomorrow.

592
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Yes.

593
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
And Se-yoon.

594
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Yes, brother.

595
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Don't embarrass me again.

596
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Yes.

597
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
I'm going.

598
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
See you tomorrow.

599
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
Bye.

600
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Go.

601
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Se-yoon.

602
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
Why?

603
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Do you want to go to Olive Young?

604
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
What?

605
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Let's go to Olive Young?

606
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Are you going to buy cosmetics?

607
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Why?

608
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Can't I buy it?

609
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
You're laughing.

610
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Do you want to die?

611
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
Are you crazy?

612
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
I'll give you my hand.

613
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
No.

614
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
Don't go.

615
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
Yes.

616
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Hey, it's 40 minutes today.

617
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
Aren't you going?

618
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Hey, let's go together.

619
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
I have something to buy.

620
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
Let's go.

621
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Suddenly, female cosmetics?

622
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
What?

623
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Oh, who are you going to give it to?

624
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Who are you going to give it to?

625
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
It's a secret.

626
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
Yeah, you can.

627
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
You have to do it properly tomorrow.

628
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
Go.

629
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Huh?

630
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Aren't you going?

631
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Yeah, I'm going to go to the front.

632
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
That's right.

633
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
It's about time to pop out.

634
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
I want to look good.

635
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Yeah, get out.

636
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Yeah, you.

637
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Yeah, let's go.

638
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Hello?

639
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Is this No Se-hoon's cell phone in the fourth class of Yeongjin High School in Seoul?

640
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Yeah.

641
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
You're not burning it, are you?

642
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Yeah, that's right.

643
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
What's up?

644
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
You even transferred.

645
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Yeah, No Se-hoon.

646
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,360
I found something interesting the other day.

647
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,360
I don't know if it's interesting for you.

648
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Interesting?

649
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Yeah.

650
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
What?

651
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
I'll show you at school.

652
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Instead, I want you to ignore the fact that the source is me.

653
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,360
Okay, I'll ignore it.

654
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Yeah, let's talk about it at school.

655
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Why aren't you coming?

656
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Oh, my.

657
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Hey, No Se!

658
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Hey, Hwang Ji-young.

659
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Can I leave this to you?

660
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,360
You said you were a back-up.

661
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
How did you do that?

662
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
Did you catch him?

663
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
No, not exactly.

664
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Are you okay, No Se?

665
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Yes, brother.

666
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,360
Oh, shit.

667
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Oh, hello.

668
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
Oh, hello.

669
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
It's Jaewon.

670
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Oh, really?

671
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Is he a senior who graduated?

672
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
No, I'm not graduated yet.

673
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Oh, yeah.

674
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,360
I'll get something to drink.

675
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,360
No, it's okay, mother.

676
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
No.

677
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
No, no.

678
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Just talk to the brothers comfortably.

679
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
Thank you.

680
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,360
Oh, my God.

681
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Why are you laughing?

682
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,360
You're so polite.

683
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,360
You're going to die.

684
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Oh, my God.

685
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
So what happened?

686
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
I almost hit the scooter.

687
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
Where did you hit it?

688
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Where is it from?

689
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
I don't know.

690
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
It's just black.

691
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Did you get the number plate?

692
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,360
He said he didn't have a passcode.

693
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Oh, my God.

694
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Hey, did you break your head?

695
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
I played a game.

696
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
How many weeks did you play?

697
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
It's not a few weeks.

698
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,360
I played four games.

699
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Oh, shit.

700
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,360
I was so surprised.

701
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
But why did you get hit and fall asleep?

702
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
Hey, it's still good to get hit.

703
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
Anyway, I'm bleeding.

704
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
You're bleeding.

705
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
You're a bastard.

706
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,360
No, I'm fine.

707
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Sanghyun told me to get everything right.

708
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Yeah, he said he wouldn't get a passcode even if he died.

709
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Hey, if you wear this much, you'll get hit.

710
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

711
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,360
Anyway, I'm sorry.

712
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
I just started my second year of high school.

713
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,360
I'm the only one who's having a hard time because of me.

714
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,360
What are you talking about?

715
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,360
If your legs are fine, you should run with me.

716
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Oh, fuck.

717
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Run twice, you bastard.

718
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
It's nice to see you in pain.

719
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Excuse me, is this Youngjin High School?

720
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Yes.

721
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Yes.

722
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Yes.

723
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Thank you.

724
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,360
Senior, what are you doing here?

725
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Oh, it was you, Seyoon.

726
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
I'm glad you're okay.

727
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Did you know I was here?

728
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Yeah, my school student was hurt and was reported.

729
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Oh, yeah.

730
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Since Wondae is a civil police officer, he's reporting everything.

731
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,360
I thought you were here because of me.

732
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Yeah, that's right.

733
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,360
You're a student at our school, too.

734
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Hey, but the cops aren't busy.

735
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
Oh, my God.

736
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,360
You even contacted him like this.

737
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Well, it's just...

738
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,360
I'm the face of the school.

739
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,360
By the way, are your knees okay?

740
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,360
What?

741
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Oh, this?

742
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
I made a mistake earlier.

743
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,360
I fell down because I was in a hurry.

744
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
You came here in a hurry?

745
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,360
What did you ride?

746
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:37,360
