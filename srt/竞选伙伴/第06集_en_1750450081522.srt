1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
lively

2
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,060
I heard this earlier,

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,660
you just left,

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,660
When we had a drinking party on your birthday.

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Oh...

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,500
I didn't drink.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
So...

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,300
You went there.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,100
You had a drinking party.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Yes.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Why would you go there?

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
What are you doing?

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Aren't you going to tell me?

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,400
I think there's a misunderstanding.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Give me your phone.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
What?

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,660
Ha Yu-kyung, are you a spy?

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
I'm not.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,620
So give me your phone.

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm not.

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,920
Don't be so mean. I think I'm going to explode.

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,020
Hey!

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,020
I'll check it.

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
Untie it.

25
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,660
Untie it.

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,660
Ha Yu-kyung.

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Yes.

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Raise your head.

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,160
Ji-hoon, it's okay.

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
You know what's going on.

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,660
I won't tell you about your private life anymore.

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,160
But make sure you do it when you get elected.

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Yes.

34
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,160
Are you okay?

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,660
I couldn't help it as long as I heard it.

37
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,660
Don't be too embarrassing.

38
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
I'm not.

39
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
I'm not a spy.

40
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,660
It's just because we're all close.

41
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,660
Okay, so just pay attention to the election.

42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,660
If you get a word from school,

43
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,660
you just called me and said you were late and didn't know anything.

44
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
You're never going to hold a drinking party or anything.

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,660
Okay?

46
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
Yes.

47
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,660
From now on, I believe in you.

48
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
Okay?

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,660
Yes.

50
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,660
I'm sorry, Yu-kyung.

51
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,660
I mean it.

52
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,660
Ji-hoon, don't worry too much.

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,660
Okay.

54
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,660
Now, let's get back on our feet and cheer up.

55
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Okay.

56
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Let's go.

57
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
Let's go.

58
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Hey.

59
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,660
Yeah?

60
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,660
I captured the stupid drinking party video.

61
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
Drinking party?

62
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Look.

63
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,660
Look.

64
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Oh, what's this?

65
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
What's up with the music?

66
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
It's like a hip hop song.

67
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Is it?

68
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,660
Yes.

69
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Oh, it's like a hip hop song.

70
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
It's like a hip hop song.

71
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
Hey, can you turn up the volume a little bit?

72
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
I'll turn up the volume.

73
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
What?

75
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,660
What is this place? Where is it?

78
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,660
This is the house of that guy, Kwak Sang-hyun.

79
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,660
Didn't they say they were going to buy an apartment?

80
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,660
That's what I'm saying. They renovated everything.

81
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,660
They broke into a few apartments and did it illegally.

82
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,660
Hey, this guy is Yang Padaegari, the first-year student.

83
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
He's fighting after drinking.

84
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,660
I know.

85
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,660
He's a bad guy. He's lying.

86
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
He must have been hurt while drinking and fighting.

87
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Yang Padaegari.

88
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
I heard he fought with Sung-woo earlier.

89
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,660
You guys.

90
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
You guys are playing with each other.

91
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
You guys are really...

92
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Let's go.

93
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,660
Take a picture.

94
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
I had a birthday photo.

95
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,660
They must be the people who came that day.

96
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
It's not Young-hoon.

97
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,660
It's not?

98
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
No, I'm sure...

99
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
You have a brother, right?

100
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,660
There was a college student that day. Do you remember?

101
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
I want to transfer too.

102
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
Let's do some special effects.

103
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,660
College students are good at managing school.

104
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,660
I remember.

105
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,660
Then that brother?

106
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,660
You're a kid and you're filming a hidden camera.

107
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
What are you going to do now?

108
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
That college student?

109
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,660
What?

110
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,660
What do you mean?

111
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,660
No.

112
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,660
I think the older guys are going to get drunk.

113
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,660
Drunk?

114
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Oh, my God.

115
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Hey, Do-se.

116
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Yes?

117
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,660
I think you're thinking something wrong.

118
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
If I say this, you might hear it like a pig.

119
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
Right?

120
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,660
No matter how bad the situation is,

121
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,660
you can't act like a pig.

122
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,660
Then you'll really be in trouble.

123
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
Do you know what I mean?

124
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,660
If you make the same mistake again...

125
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
What the heck is that?

126
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
You know what I mean, right?

127
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
Let's go.

128
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
Let's eat something. I'm hungry.

129
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,660
Brother, I'm screwed.

130
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,660
Do-se.

131
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
Cut!

132
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,660
Choi Jong-soo, are you...

133
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Oh, my God. The battery.

134
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Hey, Nam Kyung-tae. Where are you?

135
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
What are you doing?

136
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Get out of here.

137
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
You're going to die.

138
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
Get out of here.

139
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
What the hell is this?

140
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
Oh, my God.

141
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Nam Kyung-tae!

142
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Hey, Nam Kyung-tae!

143
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Stop!

144
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
I've been calling you.

145
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Why?

146
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
I don't have anything to say to you.

147
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,660
It's not that.

148
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,660
I was going to ask you something, but I forgot.

149
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,660
You coward.

150
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
Don't be serious.

151
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
Let's just talk about tomorrow.

152
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
Go in.

153
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
That crazy guy.

154
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
It's ridiculous.

155
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Oh, my God.

156
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
What the hell?

157
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
What the hell?

158
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
Are you okay?

159
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
But this person...

160
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Are you okay?

161
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Thank you.

162
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Thank you.

163
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660
Did you just know?

164
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,660
What are you talking about?

165
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Is it because the building is a little old?

166
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Why does it take so long to get to someone else's house?

167
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
It's annoying.

168
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,660
Yeah, I'm sorry.

169
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Go in.

170
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,660
This guy is so suspicious.

171
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
You're suddenly calling me.

172
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
What is it?

173
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
This one in the bag?

174
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
It's so annoying.

175
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Go.

176
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,660
Mom.

177
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Hey.

178
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Are you okay?

179
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Hey, hey, hey.

180
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,660
Remove it, remove it.

181
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
Remove it, remove it.

182
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
Hey, remove it.

183
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
Bring the trash quickly.

184
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Bring the trash.

185
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Bring the trash quickly.

186
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
Okay.

187
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,660
Hey, you bastard.

188
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
I'll take care of it.

189
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I'm not holding it.

190
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
You bastard.

191
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Don't do it.

192
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Don't do it.

193
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
You bastard.

194
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,660
One, two, number two, number two, fighting.

195
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,660
You did a great job.

196
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
It's okay.

197
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,660
It's okay.

198
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Two, two, three, four.

199
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
One more, one more.

200
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,660
I'm the CEO of Yangwon.

201
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
This is it.

202
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,660
I'm the CEO.

203
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,660
I'll take care of it.

204
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,660
I'll take care of it.

205
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,660
I'll take care of it.

206
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
One minute.

207
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Fighting.

208
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Okay.

209
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
Okay.

210
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
Let's go with this.

211
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Hey, Nam Beontae and Oh Daehee.

212
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,660
I saw them fighting in front of Alpha Air yesterday.

213
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Because they were doing a shit-out.

214
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Really?

215
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Will there be a massage game soon?

216
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Massage is shit.

217
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
They shook hands and did shit at the end.

218
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
You bastard.

219
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Were you watching that?

220
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
You must have nothing to do.

221
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,660
What?

222
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,660
What did the security chief do yesterday?

223
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,660
He didn't even show his nose.

224
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,500
Did he have a

225
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
just yesterday?

226
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Just?

227
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Yes.

228
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
Hello.

229
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Hello.

230
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Are you doing well, teenagers?

231
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
Yes, I'm doing well.

232
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Follow me.

233
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,660
Why are you laughing?

234
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm not laughing.

235
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
You bastard.

236
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Do well.

237
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Yes.

238
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
I'm going.

239
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Bye.

240
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,660
Why is he wearing that even inside the school?

241
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
He's crazy.

242
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
What do you think?

243
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
It's a great snack.

244
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
You're a fool.

245
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
Does it taste good?

246
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
No.

247
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
You try it.

248
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
I'll give it to your friends.

249
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
I'll change it.

250
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,660
Taehyung's making a change.

251
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,660
Jinkong.

252
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,660
I'll give it to my friends.

253
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
I'll change it.

254
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Taehyung's making a change.

255
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Jinkong.

256
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Hey, don't throw trash.

257
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Don't throw trash.

258
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
One!

259
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
One!

260
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,660
One!

261
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
One!

262
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
One!

263
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,660
Hey, don't throw trash.

264
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,660
Don't throw trash.

265
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:33,660
Don't throw trash.

266
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,660
My friend, buy me a drink

267
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,660
Let's go to the sea together

268
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
Let's go!

269
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,660
We're the same! We're the same!

270
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Sunghee! Sunghee!

271
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,660
One, two, three! Sunghee! We love you! Sunghee!

272
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
You're on a different level. You know that, right?

273
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Yes. Sunghee, fighting!

274
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Don't be nervous.

275
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Our students are always tired.

276
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,660
When you have to come to school early in the morning,

277
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,660
When you're not in a particularly good condition,

278
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,660
For your tired body,

279
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,660
We will introduce a student-only electric bicycle rental system.

280
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,660
Students, you can't fall for the one-time pledge anymore.

281
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,660
A pledge like an electric bicycle or a smart watch is a promise that will shine and disappear for a year.

282
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Sustainability!

283
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Our second demand is to promise only what is possible.

284
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,660
Wow!

285
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Well, sustainability!

286
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,660
This is not an environmental or energy debate. Why is that term coming out?

287
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:43,660
You're a cheap populism pledge. Stop lying to the right-wingers.

288
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
What is populism?

289
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
What is populism?

290
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:56,660
You're a free teacher who makes a gym in a situation where you're not enough to keep a franchise cafe in school and a club room.

291
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
Isn't that what populism is?

292
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Roll tournament or school trip revival.

293
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
All over the school.

294
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Making it like a playground. That's what populism is.

295
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
School memories.

296
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
It's good.

297
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:31,660
I know it's good, but let's ruin the school-teacher atmosphere and go to the college together when we graduate later.

298
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
Is that what you mean?

299
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,660
I'm so glad you're here, and thank you.

300
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Thank you so much for being a student like Yoonjung, not the head of the Ministry of Education in Korea.

301
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,660
Thank you so much.

302
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Are you looking down on me now?

303
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:56,660
Do you know that it's populism to drive the atmosphere of commotion in front of the public like this?

304
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,660
Populism. You know the spelling, right?

305
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,660
Pardon?

306
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,660
F.

307
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
P.

308
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,660
P.

309
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
It's been 10 years.

310
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,660
It's nothing.

311
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
Yes.

312
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,660
Nice, Yoonjung.

313
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
I thought you were fighting.

314
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
The level is different.

315
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
Don't laugh.

317
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,660
Ha Yoonjung.

318
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
Hello, this is YJBS.

319
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,660
We're at the YJBS school board meeting.

320
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,660
There's a candidate for the first place in the school board meeting in front of me.

321
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
Let's have an interview.

322
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
Hello, Mr. President.

323
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Could you tell us what the advantage is if the first place is the student board?

324
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
We're here for the students.

325
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
Hello.

326
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,660
You just met the first candidate.

327
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Are you curious about the second place?

328
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
Shall we go now?

329
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Come on.

330
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,660
Come on.

331
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
Where's candidate Yang Wondae?

332
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
It's Yang Wondae.

333
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Then let's listen to candidate Yang Wondae.

334
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,660
What's the main promise?

335
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,660
We will revive the national sports competition and the school trip.

336
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,660
The school trip is the main promise of the second place.

337
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:09,660
The candidate for the school trip is to resign.

338
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,660
The school trip is the main promise of the second place.

339
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,660
The candidate for the school trip is to resign.

340
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
Nam Gyeontae, that bastard.

341
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
Stay still.

342
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Don't react.

343
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,660
Brother, he's now.

344
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
Just stay still.

345
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:46,660
The candidate for the school trip is to resign.

346
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,660
The candidate for the school trip is to resign.

347
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Nam Gyeontae, what are you doing?

348
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,660
Don't you talk?

349
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Resign.

350
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,660
Resign.

351
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
Nam Gyeontae.

352
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
Resign.

353
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Nam Gyeontae.

354
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
Resign.

355
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Nam Gyeontae, what are you doing?

356
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,660
The candidate for the school trip is to resign.

357
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,660
The candidate for the school trip is to resign.

358
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
They're going to resign.

359
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Come here.

360
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
It's dangerous.

361
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
Let go of me, Nam Gyeontae.

362
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,660
Hey, catch him.

363
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
The candidate for the school trip is to resign.

364
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Catch him.

365
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,660
After the party.

366
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
Drinking?

367
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,660
This is not right.

368
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,660
This is a high school party.

369
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
Drinking?

370
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,660
This is a high school party.

371
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,660
Why didn't you listen to us?

372
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
I didn't listen.

373
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Hey, No Sehun.

374
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
The candidates for the school trip are to resign.

375
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
The candidates for the school trip are to resign.

376
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,660
It was reported that the participants of the first Giyo camp

377
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
who were in the cramped area of the Giyo camp

378
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,660
had a secret drinking party.

379
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,660
For the future of our Yeongjin High School,

380
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,660
we need the firm decision of the graduates.

381
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,660
There was a fourth trend today.

382
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,660
In the speech competition between female candidates

383
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,660
that happened in the tense tension,

384
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:58,660
Shin Jung-hee announced the candidate for Ha Yu-kyung as a one-way car, but soon, the desire for a drinking party, such as the candidate for Kwak Sang-hyun, was raised, and the right-wingers fell into confusion.

385
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Now, the election that is approaching the day, YJBS will be with the right-wingers.

386
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
Hey, are you guys crazy?

387
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,660
The bastards who are going to the election are gathering together and doing this?

388
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Sunbae, I don't think they have any evidence.

389
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Can't we just ignore it?

390
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,660
Evidence?

391
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
This is the evidence.

392
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Huh?

393
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
The will to protest itself is evidence.

394
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:31,660
Don't you know that the staff is already twisted like this?

395
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Sunbaes.

396
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,660
We don't believe in fake news.

397
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
Hey!

398
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
Wait a minute.

399
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,660
I can't even understand the atmosphere.

400
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Don't die.

401
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:51,660
Don't die.

402
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Hey, Kwak Sang-hyun.

403
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,660
What are you going to do now?

404
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Hey.

405
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:10,660
It's so boring.

406
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:17,660
So did I kill or cheat?

407
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
What?

408
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:24,660
No, if you live, you drink and smoke.

409
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
What's that?

410
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
Is it a death penalty?

411
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,660
You don't even have evidence anyway.

412
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Why are you overreacting?

413
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,660
Hey, you're so short.

414
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
You're just going to go out.

415
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,660
I'll take responsibility.

416
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,660
I'll give it to you and I'll use it.

417
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,660
All the messages they sent were bullshit.

418
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,660
You took all my cell phones that day.

419
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,660
Huh?

420
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,660
Especially you.

421
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
What?

422
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Don't keep reacting in front of the kids.

423
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,660
Yes.

424
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Go ahead.

425
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,660
Are you going to keep hitting me here?

426
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Hey, don't you care about your face?

427
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,660
Let's go, guys.

428
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,660
Take good care of your face.

429
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:27,660
Let's go.

430
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Do you know why you fell off last year's election?

431
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:56,660
What?

432
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Don't they pick me?

433
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,660
I'll pick the winner.

434
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,660
What are you talking about?

435
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:13,660
I'm going to win, so be sure to do it.

436
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Don't just nag.

437
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660
Hello, we're Kim Ho-ri.

438
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
Hey, Kim Park.

439
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,660
You guys haven't left yet?

440
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,660
Hey, you said it was the Jeju Island's villa.

441
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Did you go to Jeju Island and drink?

442
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,660
It's so much pressure to watch a movie with a friend.

443
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
They're going on a trip to Jeju Island during the semester.

444
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,660
I'm going to get rid of this fucking feeling.

445
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,660
Don't say that when you don't even know.

446
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,660
I drank at the Jeju Island villa and played the king game.

447
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,660
Hey, tell Sang-hyun to come out.

448
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Don't just send it to you.

449
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,660
Sang-hyun is in the second and third grade.

450
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,660
Then you tell me.

451
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Did you drink and play the king game in Jeju Island?

452
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,660
I've never been to Jeju Island since I was born.

453
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,660
So the question of how to play the king game in Jeju Island doesn't come true.

454
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
That's right.

455
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
You're sitting there talking like you're a saint.

456
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,660
Then turn off the passport.

457
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,660
Turn off the passport.

458
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:16,660
Are you going to keep talking nonsense?

459
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,660
I've honestly had a drink of makgeolli during Chuseok.

460
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,660
That's all.

461
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,660
Have you ever done that?

462
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,660
Just once?

463
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
So it's Chuseok.

464
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
Now I can answer.

465
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,660
I know.

466
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,660
I went to Jeju Island during Chuseok and got makgeolli and played the king game.

467
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
It's so damn bad.

468
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,660
What kind of vice president is that?

469
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,660
Hey, you don't care about school problems anyway.

470
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,660
You're trying to go to college well.

471
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,660
Just resign, Yoonjung.

472
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,660
Resign.

473
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,660
Resign.

474
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,660
If you're right, I'll take responsibility and resign.

475
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
All right?

476
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,660
Hey, it's a situation.

477
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,660
I don't think so.

478
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,660
Is that a serious situation?

479
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,660
It's a serious situation.

480
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
Don't say no.

481
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,660
And you.

482
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:17,660
Who's taking the passport to Jeju Island?

483
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,660
I'll be back in a minute.

484
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:28,660
Did you order Kyungtae to do it?

485
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,660
Junha, wouldn't you just have to pay attention to what you're in charge of?

486
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,660
That's true.

487
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,660
I don't think it's right to keep going like this.

488
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,660
The school atmosphere is weird.

489
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
It's okay.

490
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,660
This is what it's supposed to be.

491
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,660
Our school election is always tough.

492
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:54,660
I don't know if this is right.

493
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Of course this is right.

494
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,660
And other kids need to know.

495
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,660
This is like our students' right to know.

496
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,660
Are you sure?

497
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
That's right.

498
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:19,660
Is it normal for a candidate to have a drinking party in the corner of the house?

499
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
It's okay.

500
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,660
Don't doubt it.

501
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:34,660
Never doubt it, Junha.

502
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,660
I'm sorry, but I haven't said a word.

503
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,660
What?

504
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,660
What you said at the birthday party that night.

505
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,660
Why are you talking about that all of a sudden?

506
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,660
Just in case, don't worry about what we said.

507
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Are you threatening me right now?

508
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
It's not fun.

509
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,660
What?

510
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,660
The election is not fun.

511
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,660
If you go back to the first time,

512
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,660
If you go back to the time when Ha Yookyung asked you to go to the election,

513
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,660
I'll never be a private.

514
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,660
I'm never going to do it.

515
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,660
Why did you say you would?

516
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,660
I thought it would be fun.

517
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:44,660
Crazy guy.

518
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Let's go eat chicken when it's all over.

519
00:32:48,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Is it over?

520
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Guys, Jungyu said he's not going to be in the office today.

521
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Fake news, fake news, fake news.

522
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Go home.

523
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
That crazy guy.

524
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Why are you risking your life like that?

525
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
I don't know.

526
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,660
You should be moderate.

527
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
Are you okay?

528
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:44,660
I'm sorry.

529
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
I'm going first.

530
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Bye.

531
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:54,660
Go.

532
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
Hey, be honest.

533
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Let us know.

534
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
I've never been to Jeju Island.

535
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
I know.

536
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Did you have a drinking party in Jeju Island?

537
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,660
I'm just curious.

538
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,660
Stop it.

539
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,660
If you keep doing that, the fake news will spread.

540
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
No Se.

541
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
I think they're in trouble this time.

542
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
What's this time?

543
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Is it a sex party?

544
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660
Are you crazy?

545
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
The anonymous bulletin board at the cafe is crazy.

546
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
What?

547
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,660
Park Jihoon's record is maintained and sold to the kids.

548
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
Even the other students.

549
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,660
That went up to the school cafe?

550
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,660
Inseong, Jongman, Kiho, and this time, no.

551
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
Park Jihoon.

552
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
Record maintenance.

553
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
Let's see the transaction.

554
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:39,660
Proof.

555
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Park Jihoon.

556
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
He's really a fake news reporter.

557
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,660
He's really a fake.

558
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,660
What?

559
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
What is it?

560
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Is it fake?

561
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:08,660
It's fake.

562
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,660
They sold it for money or a tattoo.

563
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
5,000 won for one subject.

564
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,660
They made a Word file and had it.

565
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Then 50,000 won for 10 subjects?

566
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,660
That's probably it.

567
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,660
But is that fixable?

568
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,660
But I don't know.

569
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,660
I'm sure they did something.

570
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Then where did the kids who bought the record go?

571
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,660
I think it was for the parents' eyes.

572
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
It's going to be a big deal later.

573
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
I see.

574
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,660
It's nothing.

575
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Anyway, I get it.

576
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,660
But do I have to tell you this?

577
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,660
I'm just curious.

578
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Oh, yes.

579
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:08,660
But Seyoon, you don't ask for a report, do you?

580
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,660
Of course.

581
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,660
I don't do that.

582
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:21,660
I don't know.

583
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:39,660
I'll find out and tell you.

584
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
What's up?

585
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,660
I told you to rest today.

586
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,660
Why aren't you answering the phone?

587
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,660
I kept calling.

588
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
You did it without a sound.

589
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,660
Why?

590
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,660
I told Inkyung about Jihoon on the school's anonymous bulletin board.

591
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,660
Really?

592
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,660
What did you say?

593
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,660
Don't pretend you don't know.

594
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,660
You know everything.

595
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
Didn't you ask me to do it?

596
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,660
Seyoon, you're a little too much.

597
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,660
I didn't even know you were filming a video.

598
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,660
I was so annoyed that I heard it all wrong.

599
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,660
Fuck!

600
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
You're not going to shut up?

601
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,660
You don't want to lower your voice?

602
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,660
We're in a state of emergency because of Nam Kyungtae.

603
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,660
But what if it falls down here?

604
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,660
Do you know what you're saying?

605
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,660
You've been following Jihoon from the beginning, haven't you?

606
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
I sold it.

607
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,660
Listen carefully.

608
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,660
It's already been planned from the moment Jihoon became the vice chairman candidate for the second term.

609
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,660
You know because you've been forced to be a conscience.

610
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
And Jihoon?

611
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,660
Hey, he's the same.

612
00:37:52,660 --> 00:38:00,660
If I didn't want to be awkward with you, I shouldn't have come to the election in the first place.

613
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,660
And I heard that too.

614
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,660
The voice has been altered.

615
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,660
How do you know?

616
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
First, the strong price.

617
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,660
It's a strong price.

618
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,660
Seyoon, we have one day left in the election.

619
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:26,660
The only thing you need to worry about is how we can win.

620
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,660
We have to win no matter what.

621
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:36,660
That's how we tell the truth.

622
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,660
If you win, I'll solve Jihoon's problem 100%.

623
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
You know that, right?

624
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Hey.

625
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,660
Oh, senior.

626
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,660
What are you doing here?

627
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,660
Did you come to see Jihoon?

628
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Yes.

629
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,660
How's Jihoon?

630
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,660
No Seyoon.

631
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,660
Yes.

632
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,660
You're a real bastard.

633
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Pardon?

634
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
You're the one who posted it on the school board, right?

635
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
Do you think the constable won't know?

636
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
No, I'm not.

637
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
No, it's not.

638
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Hey, honestly, I've been patient.

639
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,660
You did it when you hit my back.

640
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,660
But now you don't need friends anymore, right?

641
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,660
No.

642
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:56,660
You're a real bastard.

643
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,660
I forgot about this election.

644
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:05,660
I met other kids first, but I thought you were a real bastard.

645
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,660
Do you know how much I thought about it because you and Jihoon were close?

646
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,660
But do you know what Jihoon said?

647
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,660
No Seyoon said he'd understand everything.

648
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,660
Why?

649
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,660
Because he's so nice.

650
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
No Seyoon is so nice.

651
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,660
It's funny, right?

652
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,660
That's it.

653
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:43,660
You bastard.

654
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,660
I don't know whose account it is, but it came up a few minutes ago.

655
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,660
I don't think it's a picture, but I captured it.

656
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,660
But this bastard.

657
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,660
I think he took a hidden camera.

658
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,660
It's annoying.

659
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
Hey, Kang Jaewon.

660
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,660
What did you do with Ahn Si-kyung?

661
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:10,660
You can't even take care of your phone.

662
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,660
Did you know who would do it?

663
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,660
The kids who were invited.

664
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,660
You don't know whose account it is?

665
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,660
Yeah, I can't make a new account because of this.

666
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,660
All the posts are about this.

667
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,660
If you don't have a follower, isn't that okay?

668
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
Hey.

669
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,660
But that's the problem with this bastard putting a hashtag in his name.

670
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,660
Are you kidding me?

671
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,660
It's a matter of time before you get stuck.

672
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,660
You have to catch the bastard quickly and erase everything.

673
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:56,660
You know?

674
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,660
Hey, don't you have a company that specializes in this?

675
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:08,660
You caught the bastard who hacked Mina's Instagram last time.

676
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:14,660
Okay, I'll ask.

677
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:28,660
I'm not smoking.

678
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:40,660
I opened it earlier.

679
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:47,660
I'm coming.

680
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Fuck.

681
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,660
Hyunjin.

682
00:42:50,660 --> 00:43:00,660
Hey, we're in trouble if we get caught.
