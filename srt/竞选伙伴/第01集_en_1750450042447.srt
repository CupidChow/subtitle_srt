00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If you are curious about reciprocation areas, I have a lot of questions to ask below!

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You two tell the people around you.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll take it.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll take it.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll take it.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll take it.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll take it.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll take it.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll take it.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll take it.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll take it.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll take it.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll take it.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll take it.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll take it.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll take it.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll take it.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll take it.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll take it.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll take it.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll take it.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll take it.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll take it.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll take it.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll take it.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll take it.

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,000
много

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
what

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
hel basketball

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's文 Nobody

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hey, do you like

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is being

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,980
a

41
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,980
a

42
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,460
Korean

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,000
Korean

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Korean

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
k It's demos.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
k Korean

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,980
k k

48
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:19,980
Everyone is wearing the same clothes, but their roles and roles are exactly divided.

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
Hey, you're looking for something?

50
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
So this bastard is just...

51
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,980
No, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,980
villain

53
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,980
I said I couldn't this week.

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,980
I can.

55
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,980
You can?

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,980
I have to go.

57
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,980
Main stream

58
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,980
I...

59
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,980
What?

60
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,980
Hey, no, I'm sure I'll go. I got all the reservations.

61
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,980
So what I want to do is...

62
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,980
non-mainstream

63
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,980
This public is also in great danger in Korea.

64
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Especially in the field of pure science,

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,980
New paradigm must be re-set without the relationship between academic achievement in the past.

66
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,980
unique guy

67
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,980
Oh, my God.

68
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,980
Oh, my God.

69
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,980
What kind of person is this?

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm not doing it.

71
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,980
crazy guy

72
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,980
What are you doing?

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,980
Oh, my God. Where's the 3rd and 4th?

74
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,980
And it's me.

75
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,980
Human No Se-hoon

76
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,980
The grades are in the top class.

77
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,980
It doesn't belong to the mainstream or non-mainstream.

78
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
I didn't want to stand out.

79
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,980
I wanted to be appropriate.

80
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,980
What are you doing?

81
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,980
What? Is it a porn?

82
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,980
But recently, I got a nickname.

83
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,980
Let's see our Taeyong's flower.

84
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
Look at it.

85
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Oh, it's still before the dawn.

86
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Don't do it.

87
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,980
Oh, this bastard's face is like a pig.

88
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,980
You're playing a joke, you bastard.

89
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,980
Can't you play a joke with your friends?

90
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,980
It's about a bright man in public.

91
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,980
bright man

92
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
bright man

93
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,980
bright man No Se-hoon

94
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,980
I'll say it again.

95
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
That was an accident.

96
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
Fuck.

97
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
What's this?

98
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,980
Hey, are you a pervert?

99
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
What?

100
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,980
You!

101
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,980
No Se-hoon!

102
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,980
What are you doing?

103
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,980
Are you crazy?

104
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
What's this?

105
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,980
Oh, this isn't it.

106
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,980
What's this?

107
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,980
My dad's trunk panties that I borrowed in the morning.

108
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
That's the beginning of the story.

109
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,980
So I...

110
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,980
I couldn't tell anyone.

111
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Like famous people who got into trouble.

112
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
I went into the self-sufficiency camp.

113
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,980
Hey, No Se-hoon.

114
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,980
The picture came out well.

115
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
Park Ji-hoon.

116
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Enfp's chicken addict.

117
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
Are you okay with the slap?

118
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
He's my kindergarten colleague.

119
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,980
Get rid of it.

120
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
I don't understand.

121
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,980
If you wear panties,

122
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,980
You fix your body like this.

123
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,980
But that's what happened.

124
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980
That's...

125
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,980
You just came out of the panties.

126
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Stop it. I'll report it.

127
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
If that's not it...

128
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
No panties?

129
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Park Ji-hoon, you're crazy.

130
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
You're the most annoying.

131
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Hey!

132
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
Are you okay?

133
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
Sorry.

134
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,980
Sorry.

135
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
No, it's okay.

136
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
Are you really okay with this?

137
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,980
Who is he?

138
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
Is he Ha Yu-kyung's boyfriend?

139
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
I don't think so.

140
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
How do you know this?

141
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,980
There's a rumor that he's dating a college student.

142
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
Really?

143
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,980
Really.

144
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
Ha Yu-kyung is good for college students.

145
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,980
So you need to study your charm.

146
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
I'm going to be a girl.

147
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Look at that posture.

148
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
That's a considerate posture.

149
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
Come to think of it...

150
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Isn't my lips okay?

151
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
Look.

152
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,980
You scared me.

153
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Touch it.

154
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Get lost. You look like a monster.

155
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
You crazy bastard.

156
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
Get lost.

157
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Get lost!

158
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Two times a week.

159
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,980
There's a practice session in the music room.

160
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,980
This is the only time for me to be healed.

161
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,980
Yes.

162
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,980
I don't have any more image loss.

163
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Like Park Ji-hoon said,

164
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Should I study my own charm?

165
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
But...

166
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
What should I start with?

167
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
I'm going to be a girl.

168
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
I'm going to be a girl.

169
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
I'm going to be a girl.

170
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,980
I'm going to be a girl.

171
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,980
I'm going to be a girl.

172
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
I'm going to be a girl.

173
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,980
I'm going to be a girl.

174
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
What should I start with?

175
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,980
It's much better.

176
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,980
Let's stop here.

177
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Good job, everyone.

178
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Thank you.

179
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Good job.

180
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Let's go home.

181
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Good job.

182
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,980
Good job.

183
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Go home.

184
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Thank you.

185
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,980
Se-hoon.

186
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,980
Yes?

187
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
I have a few things to talk to you.

188
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Yes.

189
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Good job.

190
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Good job.

191
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
We're eating together?

192
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,980
Did I do something wrong?

193
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I'm going to be drunk.

194
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Se-hoon,

195
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Are you okay with your acting?

196
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
You knew about it, too?

197
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
Yes, Kyung-tae showed me.

198
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
You were photographed a lot.

199
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,980
It's okay.

200
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Men know each other.

201
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
Don't worry too much.

202
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,980
I'll forget about the baby soon.

203
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,980
Se-hoon, I heard you were the president of the school in elementary school.

204
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Is that right?

205
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
Yes.

206
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
How didn't I know that?

207
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
I'm sorry I didn't know.

208
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,980
No, it's when I was young.

209
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
I know.

210
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,980
You were popular when you were young.

211
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
No, just a little bit.

212
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
But how did you get so crumpled up?

213
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
What?

214
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,980
Do you want to do it again?

215
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
What?

216
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
School Student Council.

217
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,980
With me?

218
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Yes.

219
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
Let's go to the election with me.

220
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
I'm the president, you're the vice president.

221
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,980
At this point, let's improve our image.

222
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
But why are you suddenly voting with me?

223
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,980
Hey, I'm so sorry.

224
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,980
Hey, who am I going out with?

226
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,980
I'm from the same school, I was the president of elementary school, and I'm good at studying.

227
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,980
It's good for your health.

228
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,980
No, it's not.

229
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Se-hoon, do you know what you don't know?

230
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,980
You come first every time you practice in the school, so you clean up, right?

231
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
Yes.

232
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,980
Who else is as sincere and reliable as you?

233
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
Hey, don't you want to do it?

234
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Don't you like to fight with your brother?

235
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
No, that's not it.

236
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,980
Can I do it well?

237
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,980
It's been a long time since I've done this.

238
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
Oh, my God.

239
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Hey, No Se-hoon.

240
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,980
What are you scared of?

241
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
You just follow me.

242
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,980
You're the current vice president, okay?

243
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,980
Then I understand.

244
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,980
You're doing it.

245
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,980
Yes, senior.

246
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Hey, to be honest, I don't know about other kids, and I saw the possibility from you.

247
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
Possibility?

248
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
Yes.

249
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Even if you're a little buried now, the cotton is eventually going to come out through your pocket.

250
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,980
Nang-jung.

251
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,980
Kichu.

252
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,980
That's right.

253
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
That's it.

254
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,980
You know, the ones who talk to you about something?

255
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
If you become the vice president, chew it all up.

256
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Okay?

257
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Yes.

258
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,980
Hey, you.

259
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Hey, you.

260
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Wait a minute.

261
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
Thank you.

262
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,980
It's a lot of fun to be recognized by someone.

263
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:39,980
Last night, I made a plan.

264
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,980
First, I'll be the vice president of the school and I'll catch the school's start and confess to Ha Yu-kyung.

265
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Yes, perfect.

266
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Hey, red tree.

267
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Red tree, look at this.

268
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,100
This is a

269
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
This is a price.

270
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,980
Give it to me.

271
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
Give it to me.

272
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
Hey.

273
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,980
Why are you so talkative?

274
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,980
What?

275
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,980
What?

276
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Two trees.

277
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
Give it to me quickly.

278
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
Quickly, I'm going to the store.

279
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,980
Hey, are you going to show people the picture of you being slapped?

280
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Of course.

281
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
What are you going to do?

282
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
It's wrong to be photographed like that.

283
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Look, what's going on.

284
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,980
Why are you acting so serious?

285
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
Annoying.

286
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,980
Hold it well.

287
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
Are you two still doing that?

288
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Hey.

289
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Yes, senior.

290
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,980
Sehun, we need to talk about our promise.

291
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Right?

292
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,980
Let's go out and talk.

293
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,980
Finish up and go.

294
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
Yes.

295
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
I'm going.

296
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
Oh, my.

297
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,980
Hey, red tree.

298
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
Red tree.

299
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
It's shining.

300
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,980
I heard that you're going to the election with the choir leader.

301
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Wondae, Eongha.

302
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
Is it already famous?

303
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Yes, it's famous.

304
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
The election is going to be about a bright man.

305
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,980
Why are you so noisy?

306
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
Oh, my.

307
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Student.

308
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,980
But is it good to do that?

309
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,980
I think it's going to be a bother.

310
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Is there anything good and clear?

311
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,980
Wondae said he wanted to go out with me.

312
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
That's why he's going out.

313
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,980
Well, you have experience in elementary school.

314
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Yes.

315
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,980
Hey, let me give you a seat, too.

316
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
You can't.

317
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
There's a lot of corruption.

318
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
You're talking like a corruption.

319
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,980
Hey, you're a corruptor if I open my mouth.

320
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,980
I don't know if I'm corrupt or not.

321
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,980
I haven't even voted yet.

322
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
Hey, there's a lot.

323
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,980
He's a fucking insider.

324
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
He's popular with teachers.

325
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,980
I heard that the principal's family meeting was at his pig's feet restaurant.

326
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
It's a fucking good restaurant.

327
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,980
How do you know that kind of rumor?

328
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,980
Hey, I'm only going to eat a group chat.

329
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,980
Hey, congratulations.

330
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:50,980
Wow, but aren't you going to have a girlfriend these days?

331
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,980
If you win?

332
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,980
Then you and Ha Yu-kyung?

333
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
Watch your mouth, you idiot.

334
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,980
Don't make a scandal for nothing.

335
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,980
Scandal?

336
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Where are you a celeb?

337
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,980
You're a bright man.

338
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Why?

339
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
A bright man acts like a celeb?

340
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,980
Hello, senior.

341
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
Hi.

342
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,980
You're the famous No Se-hoon.

343
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Kwak Sang-hyun.

344
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
The most popular insider in my neighborhood.

345
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
A walking human boutique.

346
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Did you play around?

347
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
Yes, we go to Jeongyong.

348
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,980
I guess he knows me because of that picture.

349
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Did you eat something?

350
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980
Is this dinner?

351
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,980
Is this enough?

352
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Do you like chicken?

353
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
We like chicken.

354
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
Great, senior.

355
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,980
Let's go.

356
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
I know a chicken restaurant.

357
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
Chicken?

358
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
Chicken?

359
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Handsome people like chicken.

360
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
Hi.

361
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
He's pretending to be close.

362
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,980
He must have heard about my new place.

363
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
Don't be fooled by chicken.

364
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Especially free chicken is dangerous.

365
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
The moment you bite it,

366
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
you'll be asked to do something you can't refuse.

367
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,980
No Se-hoon, come here.

368
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,980
I'm here. Be quiet.

369
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,980
You idiot.

370
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Where are you going?

371
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,980
Gyeongcheon? BBQ? BHC?

372
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,980
BHC is a bburinkle.

373
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,980
Zico? I need to get some food.

374
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
Or Nene? Or Gunde?

375
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Gunde chili crispy?

376
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,980
You know there are so many spicy chicken in Korea.

377
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,980
Who is the first person to get spicy chicken in Korea?

378
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,980
Yoon Jong-gi from Daegu in 1980.

379
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
You know, right?

380
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
The chicken is crazy here.

381
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
Come in. Let's eat.

382
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
Come in. Let's eat.

383
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,980
Boss.

384
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Welcome.

385
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
He really likes chicken.

386
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Oh, yes.

387
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
I really like chicken.

388
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,980
What's wrong with Park Ji-hoon?

389
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
He's embarrassing me.

390
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Anyway, it's not chicken.

391
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,980
I think chicken skewers are okay.

392
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Not me. This friend.

393
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,980
Oh, you're eating so well.

394
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,980
Thank you.

395
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
Hello, bro.

396
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Hi.

397
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Hello.

398
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
Hi.

399
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
Oh, Sang-hyun.

400
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
Who are they?

401
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,980
I've never seen them before.

402
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
Wow, this is...

403
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
My brother?

404
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
My brother?

405
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
Oh, they're your friends.

406
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Hello.

407
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Oh, yeah.

408
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Boss, please give me three bottles of Melchis.

409
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
Oh, yeah.

410
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Is the new face here?

411
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
At first, I may have been a little arrogant.

412
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,980
But this senior didn't care much about that.

413
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,980
We talked about it for over an hour.

414
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,980
It was amazing that we got along.

415
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,980
Other than the same school,

416
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,980
I was a little disconnected from my seniors.

417
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,980
At some point, I was a nuclear insider, and my brother was there.

418
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Are you going?

419
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Yeah, I'll go. See you next time.

420
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
Yeah, I hope you buy a lot.

421
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Bye.

422
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Bye.

423
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Did you eat well?

424
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
Yes, I ate well.

425
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Oh, right.

426
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
You guys are in the same class as Jung-young.

427
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
If you want to hear something else, meet the head teacher.

428
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,980
I'll take out the popular special lecture if I tell you.

429
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,980
Yes, senior.

430
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,980
And Ji-hoon, don't take out the lecture for nothing near here.

431
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
Especially near the academy.

432
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Oh.

433
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,980
Shin Joong-kyu said that he made a short-cut meal with the joint venture.

434
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
Yes.

435
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,980
Okay, I'm going. See you again.

436
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
I ate well, senior.

437
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,980
You like human food.

438
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
You call people and feed them this?

439
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,980
Isn't that too good for that?

440
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
My brother?

441
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
You're pretending to be close.

442
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
But this is okay, right?

443
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
What?

444
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,980
Don't you have something like Kim Young-ran's law?

445
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,980
What are you talking about, you idiot?

446
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,980
You're talking nonsense.

447
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Stop eating.

448
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
Get ready for the swimming test.

449
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
Now, bye.

450
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Good job.

451
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
I'm going to your friend's house.

452
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
What's wrong?

453
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,980
You don't have to advertise even for pooping.

454
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
What?

455
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
What are you doing here?

456
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,980
No, I need to go to the bathroom.

457
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Hey, who is it?

458
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
No, it's nothing.

459
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,980
This bastard is nothing.

460
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,980
Nothing?

461
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Hey, go somewhere else.

462
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,980
Don't be a nuisance here.

463
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
Choi Jong-soo.

464
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,980
To be honest, he was shorter than me when I was in elementary school.

465
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,980
Now he's ignoring me.

466
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
I can't.

467
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,980
I need to share a plan to deal with those bastards at once.

468
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Huh?

469
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
I'm sorry.

470
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,980
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,980
I told you a few times.

474
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
What's this in front of the kids?

475
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
It's embarrassing.

476
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
Okay, I'll be careful.

477
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,980
I'm not saying you should be careful.

478
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,980
I'm telling you not to pee in school.

479
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,980
Hey, don't get the mood like a bully.

480
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,980
I'm sorry.

481
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
What the hell is this?

482
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Se-hoon, what are you doing there?

483
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Hello, senior.

484
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
What are you doing here?

485
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
I have something to see.

486
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
Well,

487
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,980
This bathroom is really quiet.

488
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
What's next?

489
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
Math.

490
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Oh, Jeong-hwan.

491
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,980
What the hell is this?

492
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,980
Oh, right.

493
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
You're going to the election?

494
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
With Yang Wondae?

495
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
With Yang Wondae?

496
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
Yes.

497
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,980
You had that ambition.

498
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
No, no.

499
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,980
It's not ambition.

500
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,980
I'm in the same choir as Wondae.

501
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,980
So let's unite like this and represent the school.

502
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Something like that?

503
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,980
Representing the school?

504
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
Yang Wondae?

505
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Yes?

506
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
Come on.

507
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Let's go.

508
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,980
The election

509
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
Just because I'm going to the election,

510
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,980
My connections have started to change.

511
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,980
Thanks to Wondae's choice,

512
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,980
I started to shine in my school life.

513
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,980
Songgot is also going to come out of his pocket.

514
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,980
Did you fail the exam?

515
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,980
You advertised that this exam was so easy.

516
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
Who advertised?

517
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
What should I do?

518
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,980
I don't have time to study with the vice president.

519
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
I'm screwed.

520
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
I'm going to be a rich kid.

521
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Hey, what the hell are you talking about?

522
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,980
You're annoying.

523
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
You crazy bastard.

524
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Why are you talking about it as a joke?

525
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,980
You're so stupid to study.

526
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,980
Hey, if you become the vice president, you'll get hit.

527
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,980
Hey, hey, what's wrong with you?

528
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,980
You're so stupid.

529
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,980
You're so fucking pissed off.

530
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,980
What's wrong with him?

531
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
I don't know.

532
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
He's a bastard.

533
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,980
That's amazing.

534
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
How did you get 12th place in the whole school?

535
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Not even half of 12th place.

536
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Try 12th place in class.

537
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,980
You might get killed by your mom.

538
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
What should I do?

539
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
Then I'll help you.

540
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,980
What?

541
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Did you get on this time?

542
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
No.

543
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,980
I changed this part.

544
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
I just changed the numbers.

545
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Hey, this is the balance of grades.

546
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
What balance?

547
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
It's a kind of insurance.

548
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,980
We have a second or third grade.

549
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,980
You can do well next time.

550
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,980
Wow, it's the same.

551
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,980
What should I do?

552
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,980
Do you want one?

553
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,980
I envy you.

554
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,980
You play with everything you want.

555
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,980
You're a good son.

556
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,980
No, I'm not.

557
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm always heavy-hearted.

558
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,980
Forget it.

559
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
Are you really not going?

560
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,980
I introduced you to Kwak Sang-hyun.

561
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,980
No, I'm not going.

562
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,980
I can't believe I can take Kevin's class in 10 seconds.

563
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Kwak Sang-hyun is really good.

564
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
Here.

565
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,980
I didn't have a T.O.

566
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Sang-hwan told me.

567
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,980
Don't tell anyone else.

568
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,980
You know what I mean, right?

569
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Yes.

570
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,980
I'll pay for the class with this.

571
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
The class fee?

572
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Yeah, I have to leave my role.

573
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Take this home.

574
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,980
Take the textbook.

575
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
Pardon?

576
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
It's okay. Sang-hyun's younger brother.

577
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
I'll go to the classroom.

578
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Thank you.

579
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,980
Jung-hee, come on in.

580
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,980
What's with the glasses?

581
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,980
Nice to meet you.

582
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,980
Yes.

583
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,980
Today, you and I are going to meet.

584
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,980
It's the beginning of change.

585
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
What?

586
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
It's the beginning of change.

587
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Very good.

588
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
Let's see if you're ready.

589
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Do you want a chance to change the world?

590
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
Yes.

591
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,980
You're ready.

592
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,980
Do you want a chance to change the world?

593
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,980
Of course.

594
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Living 17 years until now,

595
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:50,980
I think it's unfair and totally a lonely life to be on top all by myself.

596
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,980
So I think changing the whole system of this country will be the answer.

597
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,980
To do this, I've always been on top in school.

598
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,980
And one day, I will be the leader of this country and change everything.

599
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,980
Oh my god.

600
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,980
You've prepared a lot.

601
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,980
That's nice answer.

602
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,980
Did you understand everything?

603
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
That's great.

604
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,980
No way.

605
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
My shoulders are起 sprite.

606
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
And how many times has he done to burst out laughing?

607
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Of course part of it.

608
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
How are you going to burst out laughing this time?

609
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
That's a bad comment.

610
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,980
You're very funny.

611
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
Heh.

612
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
He's not starting to start acting.

613
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Men of all ages feel less and Tommy.

614
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Is this in that title of the earth quiz next to you?

615
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,980
Pork rib soup soup...

616
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
St 만들 الس seguirSSDC

617
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Does profit not by you?

618
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,880
You can make mistakes in life, right?

619
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,860
From now on,

620
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,320
sleep well.

621
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Okay.

622
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,700
That's how you do it.

623
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,200
Eat one each when you're tired.

624
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,200
At Maengmo?

625
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Yes.

626
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,680
I joined Maengmo today.

627
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,240
I got a call from the president of the parents' school.

628
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,640
Why do you ask that?

629
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,020
Well...

630
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,580
It's not that.

631
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Well...

632
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,120
About Sanghyeon,

633
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,300
how is she compared to the original pig's feet restaurant?

634
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,620
What?

635
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,000
I heard that Sanghyeon is going to the election this time.

636
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,060
The president of the parents' school.

637
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,260
What do you mean?

638
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,660
Is the son of the president of the parents' school

639
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Sanghyeon?

640
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,100
If you're going to the election,

641
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,400
it's better to pretend to be advantageous.

642
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,140
Wouldn't the son of the president of the parents' school be better than the pig's feet restaurant?

643
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,240
So...

644
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,900
I've talked to Wondae.

645
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,200
You want me to betray you now?

646
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,940
Who told you to betray me?

647
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,440
I'm just asking.

648
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,840
You still have time.

649
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,820
It's good to be careful.

650
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,220
I don't know.

651
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,560
How much Wondae wanted me.

652
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,660
How loyal I am.

653
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,360
You're really the same.

654
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,460
Hey, Noh Se.

655
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,260
What are you doing here?

656
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,700
I came out to get my hair done.

657
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,700
Shouldn't you do it after you've done your hair?

658
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,740
I've done a lot of hair today.

659
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,940
Hey, Park Jihoon.

660
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,740
Yeah.

661
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Okay.

662
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,200
Hey, be careful where you go.

663
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,840
You know?

664
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,880
Okay.

665
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,220
Don't worry.

666
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,020
Bye.

667
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
Bye.

668
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,280
Are you doing it for other kids?

669
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
Results?

670
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,920
I told you not to live like that.

671
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,200
Yes, sir.

672
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,700
Yes, right in front of you.

673
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,660
Yes.

674
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,300
Where are you going?

675
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
I'm going somewhere.

676
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,240
Hey, Park Jihoon.

677
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,640
Stop that.

678
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,540
Wizone.

679
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,580
And stop that.

680
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,540
Okay, don't worry.

681
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,040
You're nagging me.

682
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,240
I enjoyed your plans.

683
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,520
Is it because you have experience in elementary school?

684
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,720
I like your ideas.

685
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,020
But what is it?

686
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,460
Student participation disciplinary committee?

687
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,160
Is it like a system of betrayal?

688
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,660
Yes, it's similar.

689
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,460
You're not doing this because of your friends, right?

690
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,120
Yes, never.

691
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Let's think about it.

692
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,820
Have you thought about the female vice president?

693
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,660
I think Ha Yu-kyung will be fine.

694
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,260
If it's not, we can do it in the choir.

695
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Right.

696
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,400
You think the same.

697
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,360
Then I'll talk to Yu-kyung.

698
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,440
Let's register for the candidates after the first class.

699
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,200
You have to do this on the spot.

700
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Yes, sir.

701
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
Coke, please!

702
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,660
Sehun.

703
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,760
Can you...

704
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,800
do this with me?

705
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,460
Do what?

706
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Let's go to the vice president together.

707
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,460
I wanted to do it with you from the beginning.

708
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
Yes, I like it.

709
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
I wish I could.

710
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,460
What is this guy doing in the morning?

711
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
He's smiling like my son.

712
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
What is it, Baik In-ha?

713
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
Why are you so excited in the morning?

714
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
Haha.

715
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
Today is my birthday!

716
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
It's not your birthday.

717
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Birthday bread?

718
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
Birthday bread?

719
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
I love you.

720
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,460
I love you.

721
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
No, no, no.

722
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,460
No, it's not my birthday.

723
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
Isn't it your birthday?

724
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,460
I'm sorry.

725
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
What is it?

726
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,460
Why are you so excited?

727
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Student participation disciplinary committee.

728
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,460
We're going to punish these guys with our hands.

729
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
Oh, my God.

730
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
Hey, Do-se.

731
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
I don't want anything else.

732
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
Can't you just give me 30 minutes for the cut?

733
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,460
What authority do you use to change that?

734
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,460
If you're the vice president, you should have that power.

735
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,460
Should I?

736
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
Should I make a real pledge?

737
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
Isn't it okay?

738
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
You guys are so annoying.

739
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
It's 10 in the morning.

740
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,460
Hey, isn't it funny that the vice president is vice president?

741
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Who would think he's the vice president of Samsung?

742
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
Hey, that bastard is doing that because of you.

743
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
Why?

744
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
He's been doing the new song in the choir.

745
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
I did everything I could to get Won Dae-young's right arm.

746
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,460
I did everything I could to get Won Dae-young's right arm.

747
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,460
I'm so pissed off that I'm going to the election with you.

748
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
What is it?

749
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Are you going to the election or something?

750
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

751
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,460
Yeah?

752
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
He asked me, too.

753
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,460
Is he Yang Won-dae?

754
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,460
Don't be ridiculous.

755
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
Why would I ask you?

756
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
Do Se-hoon?

757
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Shall we take a look?

758
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
Here we go.

759
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Come on.

760
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,460
It's real.

761
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,460
He asked me to go to the election.

762
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
So why would I ask you?

763
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,460
I think it's to raise the average value of the president's group, which lacks performance.

764
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,460
The problem is that I'm not interested in it at all.

765
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,460
That's not a sidecar position.

766
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,460
What is it?

767
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,460
It's real.

768
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
You know you're in charge of the election, right?

769
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Yes, I heard.

770
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
I talked to the vice president yesterday.

771
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
Se-hoon talked about you very well.

772
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
He said that?

773
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,460
When you see people who study, they're good at pretending to be good.

774
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
What do you mean, humble?

775
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
He's a junior, but he feels like a brother.

776
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,460
He said that.

777
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
That's why he said he regretted it.

778
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
I missed you.

779
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,460
What?

780
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Isn't it about Won-dae?

781
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,460
Se-hoon, do you know the difference between need and want?

782
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Need is needed.

783
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
Want is wanted?

784
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,460
Yes, need is a necessity.

785
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,460
Want is like a necessity.

786
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,460
Oh, a necessity is like water.

787
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,460
A necessity is like alcohol.

788
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
If there's no water, it's not alcohol, right?

789
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Yes.

790
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
Se-hoon, you weren't in the first place, right?

791
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,460
Yes?

792
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
What?

793
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,460
Oh, you didn't know.

794
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,460
Won-dae didn't tell you.

795
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
At first, I thought you were a bully.

796
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
I didn't know.

797
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,460
At first, I came to you because you were going to choose a vice president.

798
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,460
I heard you wanted to know the grades of the first-year students.

799
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460
Actually, I shouldn't show you that.

800
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,460
There are some students who are model students.

801
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,460
You have to be in the right color.

802
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,460
Oh, so I've been looking at the grades of this exam.

803
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,460
From the first place.

804
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,460
But I don't think I've talked to the top students.

805
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,460
Yes.

806
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,460
I was 12th place in this midterm.

807
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
That means...

808
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:55,460
Se-hoon, you must have been the 10th place candidate for vice president.

809
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,460
Hey, who else am I going out with?

810
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,460
I'm from the same school, I was the president of elementary school, and I'm good at studying.

811
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,460
Who else is as sincere and reliable as you?

812
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,460
grades?

813
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Current recognition?

814
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,460
I don't judge people by this.

815
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,460
You're looking at potential possibilities, truthfulness.

816
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,460
Actually, I talked to the second-year student, Sang-hyun.

817
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,460
You complimented me a lot, and you said it was a waste to miss it.

818
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,460
I really needed a vice president like you.

819
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,460
So, Se-hoon.

820
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Let me ask you one last thing.

821
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:47,460
Do you want to be someone else's memory or someone's life?

822
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Hello.

823
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Where's Se-hoon?

824
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,460
Se-hoon? Se-hoon called me.

825
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,460
It was a lie.

826
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:29,460
I asked the students to get together, and I asked them to do something. It was all a lie.

827
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,460
I said I couldn't do it if it wasn't for me.

828
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,460
I was just the 12th candidate.

829
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,460
I'm sorry.

830
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,460
Wondae, you're right.

831
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:27,460
Somgut will come out of his pocket one day.

832
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,460
And thank you.

833
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,460
I'm not just your 12th candidate.

834
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,460
I'm glad you realized that I'm Songgot.

835
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,460
I'm sorry.

836
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,460
I'm sorry.

837
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,460
I'm sorry.

838
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,460
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,460
I'm sorry.

840
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,460
I'm sorry.

841
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,460
I'm sorry.

842
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,460
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,460
I'm sorry.

844
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,460
I'm sorry.

845
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,460
I'm sorry.

846
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,460
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,460
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,460
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,460
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,460
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,460
I'm sorry.

852
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,460
I'm sorry.

853
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,460
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,460
I'm sorry.
