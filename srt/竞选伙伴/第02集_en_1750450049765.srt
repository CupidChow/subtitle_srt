1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,300
P opinions

2
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:57,420
,

3
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,420
What happened? You said you were going out with Wondae.

4
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,420
How did you know?

5
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,420
Of course I know. There's a rumor.

6
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,420
Did you talk to each other?

7
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,420
Without any misunderstandings?

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,420
What misunderstanding? It's probably the difference in position.

9
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,420
The difference in position? What's your position?

10
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,420
Forget it. There's something I can't express in words.

11
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,420
I'm not going to tell you.

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,420
Then what are you going to do with the chorus?

13
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,420
I don't know.

14
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,420
Are you eating now?

15
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,420
Yes, sir. I was doing something.

16
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,420
Yeah? If you need anything, tell me.

17
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
Yes.

18
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,420
Okay. See you later.

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,420
Bye.

20
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
Take care.

21
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Bye.

22
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,420
Bye.

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,420
Bye.

24
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
Bye.

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,420
Bye.

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,420
If you need anything, tell me.

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,420
Stop it.

28
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,420
It's definitely not my style.

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,420
Thanks for helping.

30
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm grateful too.

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,420
You're here.

32
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,420
Yes.

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,420
You two know each other, right?

34
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,420
We're a team now, so take care.

35
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,420
Hi.

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,420
Yeah.

37
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,420
Oh, you two look good together.

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
What?

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,420
You two look similar.

40
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,420
You two look good together.

41
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,420
Good. Let's go in.

42
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Why?

43
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,420
What?

44
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,420
I don't like you either.

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,420
What?

46
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,420
I don't like you either.

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
What?

48
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,420
I don't like you either.

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,420
What?

50
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
I don't like you either.

51
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,420
What?

52
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,420
I don't like you either.

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
You don't like me?

54
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
Huh?

55
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Just a little.

56
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,420
It's too small for you to stand there.

57
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
Sae Hoon, come here.

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,420
To the center.

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
Let's see.

60
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
Last year, the three candidates were girls,

61
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
but this time it's the opposite.

62
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,420
Here.

63
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,420
Take it and read it.

64
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,420
If you have any questions, ask me.

65
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,420
Give it to me.

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,420
You know Wondae because you did it last year, right?

67
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
Yes.

68
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,420
In the order of the president's candidate registration,

69
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,420
Sang-hyun, Jung-hee, and Sae Hoon are the first.

70
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
Yes.

71
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,420
Wondae and Yu Kyung-in will come to the vice president's candidate this week.

72
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,420
Yes.

73
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,420
What's wrong with the atmosphere?

74
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
Let's go, everyone.

75
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
One, two, three, fighting.

76
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,420
One, two, three, fighting.

77
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,420
Let's have fun and have a fair play.

78
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420
Yes.

79
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Each candidate.

80
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Let's shake hands.

81
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,420
Come on.

82
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,420
Let's give a round of applause to the other candidates.

83
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420
Shake hands.

84
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Shake hands.

85
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,420
Are you okay?

86
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
I'm fine.

87
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,420
It's panic disorder.

88
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,420
What?

89
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,420
Panic disorder.

90
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,420
What?

91
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,420
I'm going.

92
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,420
Good job, Jung-hee.

93
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,420
Let's go to the health center.

94
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,420
No.

95
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,420
I don't think I have to go.

96
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,420
That's enough.

97
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
What?

98
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,420
You scared me.

99
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,420
How do you know my nickname?

100
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Of course.

101
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
I've already checked everything.

102
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,420
Aren't you going to answer the phone?

103
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Yes.

104
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
Sunbae.

105
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
Yes.

106
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
I broke up with her.

107
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,420
Who?

108
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,420
Is she your girlfriend?

109
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
No.

110
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
I don't have a girlfriend.

111
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
Are you going to the academy later?

112
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,420
No.

113
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
I'm not going today.

114
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Then...

115
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Shall we go together?

116
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,420
Okay. Let's go together.

117
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
Where?

118
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,420
Sehun?

119
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,420
Yes.

120
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
I'm not even looking.

121
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Then...

122
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Are you two...

123
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
in a relationship?

124
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Then...

125
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
you two are dating.

126
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,420
She's so cute.

127
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
It's not like that.

128
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
You're so cute.

129
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
Sehun is so innocent.

130
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
Did you imagine that?

131
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
I can't even eat.

132
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
What?

133
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,420
You scared me.

134
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
I'm so surprised.

135
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
Where are you going?

136
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
You're taking the bus.

137
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Why?

138
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
We're going to get some fresh air. Do you want to come with us?

139
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
No. I'm busy.

140
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Let's go.

141
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Who is she?

142
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Her?

143
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
She's my friend.

144
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
She's a student, right?

145
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
I'm not good at this. I'm a bit clumsy.

146
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
You're a student?

147
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Yes.

148
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,420
Did you do this?

149
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
Like this.

150
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Like this.

151
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
Like this?

152
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
Yes.

153
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
You're a fan.

154
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
Can I give this to you?

155
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
This?

156
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
It's so cute.

157
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
Men are pink.

158
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,420
It's so cute.

159
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
One, two, three.

160
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
One, two, three.

161
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
Come on.

162
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,420
One, two, three.

163
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
You can see it so well.

164
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Look at me.

165
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
Can you see it?

166
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
I can see it so well.

167
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Sehun.

168
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
What is it?

169
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
Use this.

170
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,420
When I see the vice-president of the National Assembly, they carry this.

171
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
Thank you, senior.

172
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,420
What? You keep saying senior.

173
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
You're so cheesy.

174
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
Yeah, why do you keep calling me senior?

175
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Just call me hyung.

176
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Hyung, say it.

177
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
Yes, hyung.

178
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Did you eat well?

179
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
It was so delicious.

180
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,420
I think someone is calling.

181
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,420
Who is it?

182
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
Should I answer it?

183
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
No, no.

184
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
I should answer it.

185
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
What's wrong?

186
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
What happened?

187
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420
There's something complicated.

188
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,420
Hello?

189
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
Yes, senior.

190
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,420
Hey, Sehyung.

191
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
Why didn't you answer the phone?

192
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
Do you know how many times I called you?

193
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,420
Where are you now?

195
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,420
I went out for a while.

196
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,420
Hey, you punk.

197
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,420
How could you say that to me without saying a word to me?

198
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,420
Can you talk to me like this?

199
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
Are you not going to see me in the future?

200
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
What's the reason?

202
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
Let me hear that.

203
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,420
Huh?

204
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Aren't you going to say it?

205
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Is it a reason?

206
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
Yeah.

207
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,420
I think I can forgive you if you hear that.

208
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,420
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
Forgive me.

211
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
Yeah.

212
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,420
I really wanted to push the fire away with a scooter because I felt like it.

213
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Tell me.

214
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
What's the reason?

215
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
Were you two close?

216
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Or did I do something wrong to you?

217
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,420
Yes, that's right.

218
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,420
What?

219
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,420
Sang-hyun and I were close.

220
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,420
So he asked me to do something for him.

221
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,420
So I had no choice but to make a decision.

222
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,420
I think I saw the wrong person.

223
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,420
Anyway, the reason why I called you was to do a good job.

224
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,420
So don't avoid it.

225
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Like a rat.

226
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
Huh?

227
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,420
Yeah, it's a little embarrassing.

228
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,420
What can I do?

229
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,420
We're not going to see each other in the future.

230
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
We're in the same group.

231
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
Yes, that's right.

232
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
I know.

233
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,420
Don't avoid me in the future.

234
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,420
I'm really upset.

235
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Okay?

236
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Yes, I understand.

237
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
I'll go.

238
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Oh, go ahead.

239
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Okay.

240
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
No-se, it was fun today.

241
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
See you next time.

242
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
Yes, sister.

243
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,420
But who is that guy?

244
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,420
Min-ha's brother.

245
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
Jin's brother.

246
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Oh, Jin's brother.

247
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Did you solve the problem of Yangwon University?

248
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
Yes, just.

249
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
Okay.

250
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,420
Since it's your business, I didn't pretend to know.

251
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,420
It's hard to get in.

252
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,420
Anyway, I'll sort it out.

253
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
Get along with the guys in the group.

254
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
They're all my friends.

255
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
Yes, brother.

256
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Oh, brother.

257
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Why are you suddenly doing this?

258
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Just.

259
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
I'm sorry I couldn't buy a new one.

260
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
No, I'm fine.

261
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,420
It's initialization now, so set it up on the way.

262
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,420
I'll give you a charger or something like that tomorrow.

263
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
Thank you, brother.

264
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,420
No, I'm more grateful.

265
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
It would have been hard to decide.

266
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,420
I shouldn't have done it because of me.

267
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,420
Oh, the taxi is here.

268
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,420
Yes, brother.

269
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,420
I'll go.

270
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
Go.

271
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
I've heard somewhere.

272
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,420
Giving what you had on your body is a very special and friendly act.

273
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Maybe he's a better person than I thought.

274
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
He's so cool.

275
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,420
This guy.

276
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,420
You said you recommended me to Wondae.

277
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
Yeah.

278
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Why?

279
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,420
You're the most popular of our students.

280
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
But?

281
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,420
Did you suddenly hit your back because of the wind?

282
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,420
That's not the back of my head.

283
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Or what?

284
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,420
What are you going to do about the choir?

285
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
What?

286
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
Are you going to keep doing it?

287
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
I'm going to keep doing it.

288
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,420
You really do whatever you want.

289
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,420
The election is the election, and the club is the club.

290
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,420
Okay, do your best.

291
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,420
Hey, what are you two doing?

292
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
We're not doing anything.

293
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
I'll go.

294
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Noh Sae, that guy.

295
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,420
He must be a real pain.

296
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,420
Was he always like that?

297
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,420
Why is he so comfortable at home?

298
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
No.

299
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
Noh Sae.

300
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,420
He's so nice.

301
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,420
Why are you so nice?

302
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,420
What's that?

303
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,420
If he's nice, he's nice.

304
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,420
What's so nice about him?

305
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,420
He's nice.

306
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,420
So nice.

307
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
Oh, it's okay.

308
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Anyway, I'm so disappointed in Noh Sae.

309
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
Hey, Park Ji-hoon.

310
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,420
What are you doing?

311
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Hi, Ha-yul.

312
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Hey, how are you guys?

313
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
It's good.

314
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
It was perfect.

315
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Hey, thank you so much.

316
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
No, it's nothing.

317
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
That's right.

318
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
Let's go to the convenience store.

319
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Let's go eat chicken together.

320
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
What?

321
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,420
Chicken?

322
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,420
You have to go.

323
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
I have to go.

324
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
See you later.

325
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
Yeah, go in.

326
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,420
I have a lot of close friends.

327
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
What?

328
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Oh, well, I've lived in this neighborhood for 17 years, so that's why.

329
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,420
There are about 63 group chat rooms.

330
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Park Ji-hoon, have you ever done something like class president before?

331
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Huh?

332
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
Hey, Noh Sae.

333
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,420
You're not a member of our class because you're the vice president of the school.

334
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Yeah, that's right.

335
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:40,420
So, whether you're the vice president of the school or the president, I'm your class president.

336
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
Yeah, that's right.

337
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Always keep that in mind.

338
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
I'm the one in power in this.

339
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,420
I'll keep it in mind.

340
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,420
What are you guys doing?

341
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Are you guys dating?

342
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
Are you excited because you're going to be vice president?

343
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,420
Don't overreact, Kim Ki-jae.

344
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
Hey, what's this?

345
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
What's this?

346
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Hey, guys, gather around.

347
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Where did you get this?

348
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
This bastard, you're looking for a bracelet?

349
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,420
A handkerchief?

350
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
I just got a gift.

351
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
How much is this?

352
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
A gift?

353
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
It's probably over a million won.

354
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
Wow, this bastard got me a gift.

355
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Hey, isn't it a bribe?

356
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
Bribes?

357
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Hey, did you get a bribe?

358
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
No, I didn't.

359
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
You can't get a bribe.

360
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Hey, wait a minute.

361
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,420
Hey, this is mine.

362
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Wait a minute.

363
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
Hello.

364
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
I want to ride it.

365
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Hello.

366
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Hello.

367
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
Hello.

368
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Se-hoon, I brought this charger.

369
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Sang-min.

370
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
Hello.

371
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,420
Hi.

372
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,420
Is that yours?

373
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,420
No, I just got it.

374
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
Don't do that anymore.

375
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
What?

376
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,420
Don't do that anymore.

377
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
Not again.

378
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Oh, my.

379
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
See you later in the evening.

380
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,420
Yes, brother.

381
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
Goodbye.

382
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,420
Have a good day.

383
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
Goodbye.

384
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Have a good day today.

385
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Wow, but did you see his shoes?

386
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
How did you buy that expensive one?

387
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
Wow, it's really a fake.

388
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,420
Kim Ki-joon, don't overreact.

389
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,420
The topic of the leg is loose.

390
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,420
What are you talking about?

391
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
How much is this?

392
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,420
I want to buy it.

393
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
Are you a genius?

394
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,420
Se-hoon, I thought about it.

395
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Wouldn't it be better to see the face of the original?

396
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Let's do well.

397
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
I'm so annoyed.

398
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
I'm disappointed.

399
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,420
Forget it, brother.

400
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,420
I think it's better.

401
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
Let's just walk ahead of it.

402
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,420
If I had done it with a guy like that,

403
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
I think I would have been more annoyed later.

404
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,420
I can't forgive him no matter how much I think about it.

405
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
it's okay.

406
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,420
Now we're going to be friends.

407
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,420
I'll be right there.

408
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
I'll be right there.

409
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
I'll be right there.

410
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,420
I'll be right there.

411
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
I'll be right there.

412
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,420
I'll be right there.

413
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
I'll be right there.

414
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,420
Let's find another candidate now.

415
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,420
I thought it would be a first-born house because of me.

416
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,420
It doesn't look like it's going to hit at all.

417
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,420
Oh, then Nam Kyung-tae?

418
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,420
Kyungtae is good to me.

419
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,420
No, Kyungtae is a little bit like that.

420
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,420
I have a friend I found today.

421
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Who?

422
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
Put it here for now.

423
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
Hey, you're so funny.

424
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Isn't it amazing?

425
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
Oh, you're so funny.

426
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
Oh, that's amazing.

427
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Oh, my God.

428
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,420
Hey, Yoonjung's mom called the gym and said something.

429
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
Are you going to take responsibility for the four of us?

430
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
Why are you taking responsibility?

431
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,420
I'm so pissed off because I'm a natural athlete.

432
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,420
Hey, why are you going to the gym?

433
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
It doesn't look good on you.

434
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,420
I was standing next to Kwak Sang-in and I thought he was sitting.

435
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,420
I guess I wasn't tall because I was following my head.

436
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,420
Hey, what's the point of having a good head?

437
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Inseong is so fast.

438
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Hey, he fell off the top of the head.

439
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
Inseong medallion.

440
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
You're talking nonsense.

441
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
Why are you looking at Inseong there?

442
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
Hey, are you serious?

443
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
Are you crazy?

444
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
Really.

445
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,420
Hey, come on.

446
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Come on.

447
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Hey, it's him.

448
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
No Se-hoon?

449
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
He's a team with Yoonjung.

450
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
Really?

451
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Kwak Sang-in is great, too.

452
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,420
Where did you get the shit to stand out?

453
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
Hey, I can hear everything.

454
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,420
No Se-hoon, why are you so busy?

455
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
What are you doing?

456
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
Yeah, I went out somewhere.

457
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Where?

458
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
Hey, let's see.

459
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Why? What's up?

460
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
No, I have to meet you and talk.

461
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
Do you have time?

462
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Oh, now.

463
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
I'll call you back later.

464
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,420
When are you going to do it?

465
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
Hey, call me right away.

466
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
Hello, brother.

467
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,420
You're here.

468
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
Is this the place you run at your house?

469
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
Yeah.

470
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,420
I go to college comfortably until I graduate.

471
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Graduation from college?

472
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
There are a lot of college students here.

473
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,420
I'll go to college first.

474
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
Okay.

475
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
There's a second floor underground.

476
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
What's the big deal?

477
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,420
Here's your room.

478
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Wow, it's so nice.

479
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,420
The room is perfect.

480
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,420
You don't have to wear earphones when you're in the living room.

481
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,420
Oh, but you can't be a porn star.

482
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,420
Yes, brother.

483
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
And?

484
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Here.

485
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
It's the same as a credit card in here.

486
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
It's comfortable.

487
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Oh, right.

488
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,420
The manager and the brothers are all students from Seoul National University.

489
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
If you have any questions, ask me.

490
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
You can think of it as a lesson.

491
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
Yes.

492
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
This is you, right?

493
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,420
Huh?

494
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,420
I did take a few minutes of your allowance.

495
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,420
Isn't the setting completely cramped?

496
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,420
Let's go.

497
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Yes.

498
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Yoonjung, are you coming here too?

499
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,420
She'll only come to the meeting.

500
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
It's more comfortable to do it at home.

501
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Anyway, this is our hideout from today.

502
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Use it as you like.

503
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,420
Thank you.

504
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,420
Oh, she's here too.

505
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420
Then, since we're all here, let's get started.

506
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,420
Yes.

507
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,420
Now, from now on, you have to get along with the kids.

508
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,420
You don't fight with your friends, do you?

509
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Yes.

510
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,420
Our Jung-hee doesn't laugh well, does she?

511
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,420
She laughs when she's funny.

512
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Okay.

513
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,420
She laughs when she's funny.

514
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Okay.

515
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,420
Isn't it funny?

516
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,420
That fake laugh.

517
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Yes, it's good to see you laugh.

518
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
I'm so excited.

519
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
Okay, then.

520
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
Okay, let's look at the pledge.

521
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,420
This is the school.

522
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
The environment of the school.

523
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,420
Is it because they both study well?

524
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,420
This pledge is good.

525
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,420
Did you get the Jinhwan test well?

526
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,420
Yes, just as usual.

527
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Se-hoon?

528
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,420
I just...

529
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,420
You're totally screwed this time.

530
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Why is she doing this to me?

531
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,420
How did she know I was screwed?

532
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Huh?

533
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,420
Are you interested in me?

534
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,420
Don't be mistaken.

535
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
I'm not interested in you at all.

536
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
I just heard what the teachers said.

537
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
I didn't say anything.

538
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
I can tell by your face.

539
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
My face is like this.

540
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
I didn't ask.

541
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
You guys are so lucky.

542
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Why are you doing this to me?

543
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420
Why are you so angry?

544
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,420
I'm the one who's upset.

545
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
Let's continue.

546
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
Se-hoon,

547
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,420
here, number two and three,

548
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,420
you didn't prepare the pledge with the nursing school, did you?

549
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,420
No, it's totally different.

550
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
Totally different?

551
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,420
How is it different?

552
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,420
Oh, that's...

553
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,420
I just captured the message.

554
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Take a look.

555
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,420
I can see it as it is?

556
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Yes, wouldn't that be okay?

557
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
Okay.

558
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,420
Wondae has experience last year.

559
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
He's good.

560
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
I captured something else.

561
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
Really?

562
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
Look.

563
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,420
Is there anything uncomfortable or inappropriate

564
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,420
when you're at school?

565
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,420
I don't want to listen to lunch broadcasts.

566
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,420
That's right.

567
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
It's so loud and noisy.

568
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,420
Not only that, the dance is also below the level.

569
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,420
The atmosphere of the school is...

570
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,420
A new paradigm for lunchtime music broadcasts?

571
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,420
It's worth the title.

572
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,420
Okay. What else?

573
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Why don't we do one of these?

574
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,420
How can I do this to a regular student?

575
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,420
No, I think it's possible.

576
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,420
I'm sorry, but can you call me Senior Kwak Sang-hyun?

577
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Then you can call me Class President.

578
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
Hey, Noh Se-hye.

579
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,420
You can't miss the class meeting today.

580
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
You know you're going to pick a class president next time, right?

581
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,420
Yes.

582
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
You know, right?

583
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,420
I'll ask you to do me a favor.

584
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Push me a little bit.

585
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,420
How can I do something?

586
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,420
Just give me a recommendation.

587
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,420
Then I'll do the rest on my own.

588
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
Okay.

589
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
Noh Se-hye!

590
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,420
Hi, Tak-ji!

591
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
Hi, Jaeseok.

592
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Hi.

593
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
Hi.

594
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Hey!

595
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,420
Wow, what's wrong with him?

596
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,420
He's become an insider all of a sudden.

597
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
Hi, guys.

598
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
No, I can't say hi.

599
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,420
I need to solve this mystery.

600
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Hey, you find out.

601
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Where have you been?

602
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
It's hard to see your face.

603
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,420
So I'm going to talk to you for a second.

604
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
Huh?

605
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
What is it?

606
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
When did you buy it?

607
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Kwak Sang-hyun's vice president, Senpai,

608
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,420
gave it to me as a gift.

609
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,420
Electronic bracelet.

610
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,420
This is the best spec of the current era.

611
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
But it doesn't seem new.

612
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,420
It's exactly used.

613
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,420
But it's pretty cool.

614
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,420
So what's going on?

615
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
Oh, right.

616
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
Hey, come out for a second.

617
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,420
You bastard!

618
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
What is it?

619
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Hey!

620
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Get out of my way!

621
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
What the hell are you talking about?

622
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,420
What's going on?

623
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
What's wrong?

624
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,420
Hey, what the fuck is this?

625
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Answer me, you bastard!

626
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,420
Don't look at me like that!

627
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,420
Oh, this is...

628
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Hey, Nam Kyung-tae.

629
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,420
Are you a piece of shit?

630
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,420
Wow, this bastard always did something behind me.

631
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
I was just drawing something.

632
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,420
I knew you'd do this, you bastard.

633
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
This isn't mine.

634
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
Shut up!

635
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,420
Can't you see your name behind this?

636
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,420
Hey, what the hell is written on the back?

637
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Are they all mine?

638
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
I already took a picture of Ahyoung.

639
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,420
If you write it down, you're done.

640
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
Right?

641
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,420
Hey, why are you doing that?

642
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,420
Why are you only doing mine?

643
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,420
The kids in the music room that day.

644
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
You have to do it all!

645
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,420
It's so ridiculous.

646
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,420
But why do you think this came out of the music room?

647
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
We never said that.

648
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Oh!

649
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,420
Kyungtae is here!

650
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,420
Hey, you're fucked now, Kyungtae.

651
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,420
Why do you live like that, Kyungtae?

652
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Let's go.

653
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,420
Get a lawyer.

654
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Oh, man.

655
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,420
Hey, Noh, let's talk later.

656
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,420
I'm going to the concert after this.

657
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,420
You have to talk.

658
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Okay?

659
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,420
What are you talking about?

660
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,420
How many changes have been made?

661
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,420
Four!

662
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
Replace, add, and fail.

663
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,420
There's even a limit.

664
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,420
Nam Kyungtae, I'm glad you didn't get a disciplinary action.

665
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,420
Hanbyul.

666
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Yes?

667
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
Fill in the electronic footrests or necklaces.

668
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
I've already ordered it.

669
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,420
Noh, just give it to your friend.

670
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
Hey, it's expensive.

671
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
That's it for today's class.

672
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Get ready for the next paper test.

673
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
Yes.

674
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Good luck.

675
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Thank you.

676
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,420
Good luck.

677
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,420
Are you crazy?

678
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,420
What do I do?

679
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,420
Why do you put it in the file?

680
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,420
You did it on purpose to get me fired, right?

681
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,420
What are you talking about?

682
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,420
If it's not that, did you put it in the file on purpose?

683
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Am I crazy?

684
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
You put it in on purpose?

685
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,420
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

686
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
Fight for sure.

687
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Let's fight.

688
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,420
I forgot.

689
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
I forgot and put it in.

690
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,420
I can't believe a traitor.

691
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
What?

692
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
What did you say?

693
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,420
Did you hit your head?

694
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,420
You're a traitor.

695
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Stop it.

696
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,420
You don't even know.

697
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Yeah, stop it.

698
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,420
Hey, if you're not going to fight, quit it.

699
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
It's so much fun.

700
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Who's going to win?

701
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Who's going to win?

702
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,420
The pervert is so big, so I think we can win more.

703
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Who's going to win?

704
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
No.

705
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
He's running away.

706
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
The pervert is running away.

707
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Hey, hey, hey.

708
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Hey, stay still.

709
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Idiot.

710
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,420
The pervert is running away.

711
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,420
The pervert is running away.

712
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
The pervert is running away.

713
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,420
I'm sorry.

714
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
You have to apologize properly.

715
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,420
With sincerity.

716
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,420
I'm sorry.

717
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,420
I think I was too bad.

718
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
Okay.

719
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Okay.

720
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Hey, hey, hey, look.

721
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
Sir, hurry up.

722
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,420
I'm busy with my high school entrance exam.

723
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,420
So why are you here, Seok-young?

724
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Hey, but I have to do a party.

725
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
I'm the head of the department last year.

726
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
Really.

727
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,420
What is it?

728
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Yes.

729
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
I'm going to pick the next head of the department.

730
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
If you have a suitable one, please recommend it.

731
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,420
I think everyone is just looking at it.

732
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
Then I'll recommend it first.

733
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,420
This friend is unexpectedly very appropriate.

734
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
I've been watching this friend all the time.

735
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,420
Our gathering time, cleaning time.

736
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,420
The one who kept that promise sharp.

737
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Se-hoon.

738
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,420
This friend was the only one.

739
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,420
What's the matter?

740
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,420
But cleaning is not important.

741
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,420
I'm talking about how much we are dedicated to our club.

742
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,420
How much responsibility can be kept by making small promises?

743
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,420
I'm talking about this.

744
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,420
I think that kind of person should lead our choir.

745
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
That's all.

746
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Is there anyone else to recommend?

747
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Se-hoon was holding his hand earlier.

748
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,420
Pardon?

749
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,420
No.

750
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,420
You two are competing in the student council election, right?

751
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
Yes.

752
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
But the student council and the union are separate issues.

753
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,420
There are no other recommendations.

754
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Let's hear from Se-hoon.

755
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Pardon?

756
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,420
What are you doing, Se-hoon? Come out.

757
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
Why are you so scared?

758
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,420
It's okay, right? I forgive you.

759
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,420
Thank you.

760
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,420
I'm really embarrassed.

761
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,420
The reason why I'm embarrassed is that I wasn't the only one.

762
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,420
I'm really thankful for what Wondae said.

763
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:34,420
But if I'm recommended for that reason, I think I'll be so sorry to the other members.

764
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,420
I think it's not just me that our choir is maintained as well as it is now.

765
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,420
I think it's all thanks to everyone who has worked tirelessly in each part.

766
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:58,420
The person who organizes the music, the person who distributes the snacks, the person who manages the group messages, the person in charge of editing the video, and even the piano accompanist.

767
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,420
I don't think our club can go back just with the efforts of one or two people.

768
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:09,420
In that sense, Wondae's words are a bit disappointing.

769
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:16,420
I'm the most ferocious one.

770
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,420
So I don't fit in the position of the head of the club.

771
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,420
Instead, I'm going to recommend the most suitable one.

772
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,420
This friend sings well and is interested in music.

773
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,420
And above all, he is a friend with passion and loyalty.

774
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:46,420
I recommend Yoo Hee-jun as the head of the choir.

775
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Thank you. First of all, our God Se-hoon recommended me to this place.

776
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,420
It was a very touching and final performance.

777
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,420
If you give me a chance, I'll show you the best volunteer spirit.

778
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,420
I'm going to go to the election with Yang Wondae.

779
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,420
It's a bit sudden, but I heard it's good to go out with our leader at home.

780
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,420
Anyway, call me after it's over. Let's talk.

781
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,420
I, Yoo Hee-jun, will do my best to complete the mission of the choir.

782
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,420
I first came to the choir because there were many pretty seniors.

783
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:08,420
Although I was a bad singer, I liked it because I could see the mistakes of my voice.

784
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,420
Instead, I decided to do it alone.

785
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,420
I thought that was a little courtesy for our choir.

786
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,420
I'm glad to be praised for my little effort.

787
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,420
But now I will not be praised for my efforts anymore.

788
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,420
I'm going to leave here to clap.

789
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,420
I'm going to go to the next place.

790
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,420
I'm going to go to the next place.

791
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,420

I'm going to go to the next place.

I'm going to go to the next place.

I'm going to go to the next place.
