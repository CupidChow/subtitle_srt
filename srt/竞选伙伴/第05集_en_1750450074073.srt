00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Yeah, I didn't see him there.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
Hey! What did you do as a security guard?

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Why are you chasing him when he's not even a president?

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Yeah, he got hurt.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
Hello, sir.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Hello.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Sehun, are you okay?

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Yeah, I was a little dizzy in the morning.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,520
It looks like a fruit package.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
But it's better than yesterday.

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Sehun, I said it's okay.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,520
If you're a little weird, tell me.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,520
I told my uncle everything.

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
Did you get hurt?

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
No, I'm fine.

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Your parents like it, too.

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
What?

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Anyway, be careful until you get hurt.

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Oh, right.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
What happened to Miss Bong?

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
I don't know.

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I did put on a witness mask, but I don't think there's any special information.

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,520
But isn't there a police in your house?

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
There is.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Wait a minute.

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I'll finish up the makeup.

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Yeah, yeah, I'll take care of you.

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Yes.

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Guys, get together.

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
I need to change the concept.

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Yes.

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
I'm in charge of the iron.

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Should I put in some waves?

39
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Yeah, good, good.

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
Add some vitality.

41
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
Add some vitality.

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Oh, wait a minute.

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Stay still.

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,520
You guys stand there and stand up straight.

45
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Okay?

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm here.

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Can I wash my hair?

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Show me your hair.

49
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
I washed my hair.

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Yeah.

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Fuck, I'm so dumbfounded.

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
What's wrong?

53
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Hey, why are you so flustered with a fall?

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
I'm annoyed.

55
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Hey, since when am I more annoyed by you?

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
Hey, think about it.

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I mean, she's doing something like Miss, but if she's going to be so fine, why did she wear that head?

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
What are you talking about?

59
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
It's a very weak wound.

60
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,520
But isn't she just showing off with a gesture to get a sympathy?

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,520
She came to get a sympathy?

62
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,520
No, maybe the accident itself is a total lie.

63
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Does it make sense that there is no CCTV in the 21st century?

64
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
You're saying that the accident you're having these days is a lie?

65
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
A fake?

66
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Did you hear that?

67
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Hey, there's something going on, right?

68
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
There's something going on.

69
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
You're a fucking Miss.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Oh, this guy's been making fake house for a while.

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
It's annoying.

72
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,520
And it's not Miss, it's Misu.

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
I told you exactly that it's Miss.

74
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Misu.

75
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
What's Miss?

76
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Miss, well.

77
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Miss, Miss.

78
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Mistake.

79
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Oh, Yoonjung took off her glasses.

80
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Hello, teacher.

81
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Oh, it's Jeonghee.

82
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
What, is it Yoonjung?

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
What?

84
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
What is it?

85
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Yoonjung.

86
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
What is it?

87
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Why, are you surprised?

88
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
No.

89
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Yoonjung.

90
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Yoonjung.

91
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Yoonjung.

92
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Yoonjung.

93
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Yoonjung.

94
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Yoonjung.

95
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Yoonjung.

96
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Yoonjung.

97
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Yoonjung.

98
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Yoonjung.

99
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Yoonjung.

100
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Yoonjung.

101
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Yoonjung.

102
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Everyone, to your positions.

103
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Okay.

104
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Jeonghee, you're so pretty.

105
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Ready for the Japanese camp.

106
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Ay.

107
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Only.

108
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
One.

109
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Only.

110
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
You.

111
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Only one, only you.

112
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,520
The best choice for me.

113
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Only one, only you.

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
It's the last year to be tall.

115
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
One, two, three, four.

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Let's shoot Japanese.

117
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Let's shoot Japanese.

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Let's shoot Japanese.

119
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Let's shoot Japanese.

120
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Let's shoot Japanese.

121
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Choices for me.

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Choices for me.

123
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
So, ready.

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Let's shoot Japanese.

125
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Let's shoot Japanese.

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Let's make the school we want.

127
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Let's make it.

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,660
Traditionally,

129
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,240
Shall I learn a field?

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,600
Is there anyone interested?

131
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,080
Do not banning people.

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,160
If so,

133
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,040
Then I may learn to transcribe the lyrics.

134
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,280
Again,

135
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,260
You now hear

136
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,040
A song from the windman

137
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,060
Playing with the owner

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,420
Finally the song goes on

139
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,120
I will make sure to give you a coupon

140
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,520
that allows you to enjoy free coupons

141
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,320
for 10 coupons per month!

142
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,120
Yes!

143
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,420
I'm so excited!

144
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,020
Don't go, Manager.

145
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,420
I'm a manager too.

146
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
I'm sorry.

147
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,920
Everybody, number one!

148
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,320
Good! Good! Good!

149
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,620
Number one!

150
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,220
Everybody, number one!

151
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,720
Good! Good! Good!

152
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,320
Number one!

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
Good! Good!

154
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,620
Number one!

155
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,220
Good! Good!

156
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,020
Number one!

157
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,120
Good! Good!

158
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,620
Number one!

159
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,220
Good! Good!

160
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,120
Number one!

161
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,720
Good! Good!

162
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,220
Number one!

163
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,720
Good! Good!

164
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,420
Number one!

165
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,520
Can you please tell me your address?

166
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,720
Really?

167
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,620
Take a picture.

168
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
Be careful.

169
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,520
Is this possible?

170
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,440
Is this a

171
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
hidden camera?

172
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,640
I heard that there are 7,000 to 8,000

173
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
of them in the back.

174
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Mr. Baek Jong-won.

175
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Wow, you're so handsome.

176
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
I'm so full.

177
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm so full.

178
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Hey, Park Ji-hoon!

179
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Are you okay?

180
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm okay.

181
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:48,760
My shoes are all wet.

182
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Thank you.

183
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Daily forecast that always goes wrong.

184
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
You were in trouble because you didn't have an umbrella, right?

185
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
My precious shoes.

186
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
It's annoying when it rains.

187
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
So we

188
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
installed an umbrella shelter at the school

189
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
and put on sandals on a rainy day.

190
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
I will be a student at the school.

191
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Wow!

192
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Hello.

193
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,880
Hey, I'm Park Ji-hoon!

194
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Hey, go up here and check it out.

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
Go up there and check it out.

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
As expected, this is the best idea.

197
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
I'll go to Busan instead of the South Korean team.

198
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
If it's a first-class, we'll be in trouble.

199
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Ready for Yeongjin High School's love!

200
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Three, four!

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeongjin High School's love!

202
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeongwon University is here!

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We need it.

204
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeongwon University!

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeongwon University!

206
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeongwon University!

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeongwon University!

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeongwon University!

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm number one.

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm dying right now.

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're not having a cold?

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We're fine.

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The dryer...

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Guys, let's go.

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's go to the store.

216
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
What happened?

217
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,340
Why didn't you tell me?

218
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,960
You were playing a prank.

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
I didn't even bite him 100 times.

220
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,300
You said you can't catch the culprit.

221
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
You're a bad guy.

222
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Well...

223
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm not 100% bad.

224
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,940
I'm a little bit of a bad guy.

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm not a bad guy.

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Anyway, you have to catch the bad guy and kick him out.

227
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I hurt him. Why are you making a fuss?

228
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Then you can catch him.

229
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No, why are you so angry?

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm going.

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I think you're comfortable with No Seyeon.

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think she's the most mean to you.

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No, it's not bad.

234
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, right.

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The music room is set up.

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What time is it?

238
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's go.

239
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You have to be good.

240
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm good at everything.

241
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm good at everything.

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No Seyeon.

243
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, Tae-oh.

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, what was that yesterday?

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's not a kind of story that can be taken out of this place.

246
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Follow me.

247
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to the music room.

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I went to the music room because I had something to discuss with the music team.

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
To music?

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Our singing test.

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Singing skills are born.

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I thought it was inappropriate to score with that.

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, yeah?

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So what?

256
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll say it again, but I know I didn't mean to see it.

257
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If you didn't see my name in the first place, you wouldn't have been interested.

258
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm the most important thing.

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Huh?

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What's this?

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Who wrote down the list of people from 1st to 15th in the whole school?

262
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ahn Tae-oh.

263
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Pretty smart.

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It seems to be popular among model students.

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Huh?

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Did you?

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can say that the credibility of information is pretty high.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Then here.

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you go down for a while, you have your personality.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's the point.

271
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No Se-hoon.

272
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't recommend it because it's not good for your image these days.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,280
A

274
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What?

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Who wrote this?

276
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you.

277
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, that's right.

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The person who suggested the election and the end of the line to me just a few days ago.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It was Yangwon University.

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The next day, you said you were going to the election with him, so it was a bit absurd, but I understood.

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Anyway, that person should have a brother like us as a mascot.

282
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yangwon University.

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yangwon University.

284
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Ahn Tae-oh.

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't recommend it because it's not good for your image these days.

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
A

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
A

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A

289
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
A

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Then, the best corner of our school, self-introduction.

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
A

294
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Then, please introduce yourself from the university student.

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

297
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Wait a minute.

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Wait a minute.

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Who?

300
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Who is it?

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When did you prepare it?

302
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Newly recruited Yangwon University.

303
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can't be so difficult while shooting.

304
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Please stop.

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But what is this picture?

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I recently received a license from the civil police.

307
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How?

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I once saw a voice phishing test program.

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The mobile phone was in the car.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But it could be purely a company employee or an expert.

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So I pretended to be in a hurry and noticed.

312
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But he kept asking.

313
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Did you report it?

314
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Did you do it at the police?

315
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
When did you do it?

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's suspicious.

317
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's suspicious.

318
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's why.

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Then I reported it right away.

320
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Then, Yangwon University student, number 2, number 9.

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Please show us.

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Number 2, number 9, are you ready?

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes.

324
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yang.

325
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yang, mushroom, red pepper, green onion, green onion.

326
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Won.

327
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Won, red pepper, green onion, green onion.

328
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The love of the great friend, Yangwon University.

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yangwon.

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hello, I'm Ha Yu-kyung, who is in charge of beauty and popularity at Youngjin High School.

331
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Ha Yu-kyung.

332
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Ha Yu-kyung.

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Ha Yu-kyung.

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Ha Yu-kyung.

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Ha Yu-kyung.

336
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Ha Yu-kyung.

337
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
In my case, I'm not self-proclaimed, but other people call me an insider.

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Then, did you prepare something special for the insider class?

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes, I prepared it to show you in a short way.

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Good.

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is our Kiyo-2 camp, so if you know it, please sing along.

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Then, let's listen to it with a round of applause.

343
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's all I have to show you.

344
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Cool.

345
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey, No Se-kyung.

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Are you going to keep looking at me?

347
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Huh?

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's go.

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yangwon University.

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yangwon University.

351
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yangwon University.

352
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yangwon University.

353
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yangwon University.

354
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yangwon University.

355
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yangwon University.

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yangwon University.

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yangwon University.

358
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yangwon University.

359
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Wow.

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Wow.

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, my eyes are closed.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Sir, we're going to use this tomorrow, so please check it out.

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey, great.

364
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Huh?

365
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But who applied for the YouTube shoot?

366
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Ha Yu-kyung and her friends are working together on social media.

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Wow, Yu-kyung's connections are so good.

368
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Sir, don't follow the kids' behavior.

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, okay.

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Please take care of it.

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hey, Sang-hyun.

372
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Sir, I'm going.

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hurry up.

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You guys go ahead.

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll go.

376
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, you're having a hard time.

377
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're busy preparing for the election, right?

378
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Is it worth it?

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
How's Sang-hyun?

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are you okay?

381
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you make things like this?

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wow, Yangwon University.

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're completely out of your mind this time.

384
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But isn't that cheating?

385
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What are the camp kids doing and shooting a broadcast?

386
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Well, I think it's not cheating because the principal liked it.

387
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's cheating.

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's a complete media play.

389
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, the media play is a little too much.

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why are you so sensitive?

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Huh?

392
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Sir.

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Huh?

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If you're in charge of this sexual intercourse, you have to check this properly.

395
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

396
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, that's...

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I heard it last night, too.

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You heard it last night.

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Please take care of me from now on.

400
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'll ask you a favor.

401
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, yeah, of course.

402
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, okay.

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Of course.

404
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, okay.

405
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Brother, should we make something like that too?

406
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
No, I'm not tired of being a civilian police officer.

407
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't like it.

408
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah, I don't like it.

409
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's not a mart event.

410
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's right.

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's too fake.

412
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Ha...

413
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Should I just break it all?

414
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Pardon?

415
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Or just set it on fire.

416
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So don't just talk, but try to do it from afar.

417
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't just look around like a moron.

418
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
From earlier.

419
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What's wrong with you?

420
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm sorry.

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sorry.

434
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm sorry.

455
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

461
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000

474
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000

I'm sorry.

502
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry.

524
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm sorry.

525
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Stop coming!

535
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,580
Do you really know nothing about him?

536
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,820
I don't know.

537
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Hey.

538
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,120
I couldn't sleep for two days after hearing this.

539
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,480
Isn't this too much?

540
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,220
Sir, there are people with extreme sexual orientation in Japan.

541
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,820
One of them is...

542
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
Kim Kyungtae!

543
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,820
Don't talk nonsense.

544
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,120
What did we do? Do you have evidence?

545
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,680
You don't know, but don't talk nonsense.

546
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,220
Then, did we do that?

547
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,780
What evidence do you need?

548
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,340
Stop it, you two.

549
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,680
In other words,

550
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,140
is there anyone among you who can do something like self-sabotage

551
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,440
just to be my mom?

552
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,680
Self-sabotage? Are you crazy, No Sehun?

553
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,080
What's wrong with that?

554
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,640
You said you did something to me because you thought I was hurt

555
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,780
after the accident.

556
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,280
Do you think I don't know?

557
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,740
You said it was for the eviction of the consent form.

558
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,840
No, that's...

559
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,940
So, really?

560
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,180
No, that's...

561
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,920
Say it clearly, Nam Kyungtae.

562
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,760
There are so many people I've heard about.

563
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,820
Should I bring them all here?

564
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,020
Sir!

565
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,220
Can't you just check all the fingerprints

566
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,720
of the Japanese girls?

567
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,880
You bastards!

568
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,160
Say it clearly!

569
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,560
Both of you, be quiet!

570
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,620
You guys are really...

571
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,180
It's not just promoting sex.

572
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
It's a crime of abuse and slandering.

573
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,660
They all overworked.

574
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,820
Okay?

575
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,220
Ar Spy if they find CCTV

576
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,360
and send the evidence to the tightened passes trailer.

577
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,320
Okay?

578
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,320
I have some questions for you.

579
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,920
I think it would be good

580
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Let's do it often and slowly today.

581
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Huh?

582
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Yes.

583
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:01,920
What is on my hands?

584
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I hear a voice in my head

585
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Telling me to pay the back

586
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Hey, student.

587
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Yes.

588
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
You should do well so that you don't have any money left.

589
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Yes, go in.

590
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Go in, go in.

591
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Hey, Nam Kyungtae.

592
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Huh?

593
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Come here.

594
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Hey, can I just do what the other person does?

595
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Why?

596
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Aren't they your seniors?

597
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
That's right.

598
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
But he said he was saying that.

599
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
The teacher is in front of you.

600
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,920
No, what are you going to do?

601
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:16,920
You're so rude.

602
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
I'm sorry.

603
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
You should be careful with your words.

604
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Don't you know that your behavior like before is ruining our team's image?

605
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Hey, do what suits you.

606
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Yes.

607
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:44,920
What?

608
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Today, we have decided to keep silence for a day.

609
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Instead, we will listen to the speech of the second camp.

610
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Class 4, Nam Kyungtae.

611
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,920
I think I met him yesterday.

612
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
You're so rude.

613
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
I can't talk.

614
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Oh, my.

615
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Where did you see him?

616
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
I'm an attention seeker in your class.

617
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Me too.

618
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
You're so ridiculous.

619
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
You're so rude.

620
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Hello.

621
00:27:50,920 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm Nam Kyungtae, a first-year 4th grade student who is the bassist in the second camp, the election strategy team, and the choir.

622
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,920
I'm going to say something to the voters with a broken heart today.

623
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Our school should be led by someone with long experience and strong leadership.

624
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,920
What would you change if a person with no experience became the student president?

625
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:27,920
Wouldn't it be better to be the second candidate than a candidate who has never done it?

626
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
A candidate who has already been verified.

627
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,920
A strong candidate who does not hesitate to take a fierce terrorist act.

628
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Please push the current vice president, Yang Won-dae.

629
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,920
We will only make promises that we can keep.

630
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Let's be with Yang Won-dae, who has only three years of high school life.

631
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Let's get ready to go to the school next year.

632
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Pack your bags, everyone.

633
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Please put stickers on the school's school fees.

634
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,920
We will definitely push our second candidate.

635
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,920
It's not like they're sending it to me, but it's a real world.

636
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Did you enjoy your meal?

637
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I can't help you with your students' safety and health.

638
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:24,920
But we will support you to make this bracelet a high-end smart watch for all students.

639
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Only One Only You!

640
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,920
The school's school's school's president, Ki-ho,

641
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,920
No.1, Bicu-ri, the president of the school, Kwan-sang-yong!

642
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Thank you.

643
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Thank you.

644
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,920
The smart watch is ready.

645
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:54,920
No.1! No.1! No.1!

646
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
No.1!

647
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:15,920
We will show Ki-ho to the students.

648
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,920
We will have Kim Ki-jae's speech at the press conference.

649
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Let's go.

650
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
You can do it.

651
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
I will go.

652
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Thank you.

653
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
Good expression.

654
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Good job.

655
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,920
There was a case of embezzlement of election campaign funds and election campaign funds.

656
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,920
The victim, No.2, and the candidate for Yangwon University,

657
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:28,920
filed a civil rights lawsuit and conducted a lunchtime silence protest and a distribution center performance.

658
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Therefore, No.1, Ki-ho, was fired for his performance.

659
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,920
While some people are demanding to be rejected,

660
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,920
the election's leaders are now being watched.

661
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
No.1!

662
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Thank you.

663
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Fighting!

664
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Please.

665
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
I will vote.

666
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Thank you.

667
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
It's good.

668
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
No.1!

669
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
No.1!

670
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,920
I think I should go to the cafeteria.

671
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Why?

672
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
That bastard...

673
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,920
He is saying that he is guilty.

674
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
I should go.

675
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:31,920
I will go to the same school for the first year of the first year of the same school

676
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,640
and I was looking back at No.2 No Se-hoon and I was

677
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,920
cursing at him for being a sexual harassment.

678
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,920
I apologized to Ha Yu-kyung who came to me after knowing that,

679
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,920
but I felt guilty and I came forward to the school.

680
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,920
I ask that you forgive No Se-hoon's sexual harassment crime

681
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,920
that I and No.2 had been in a conversation.

682
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,920
I will take the blame.

683
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
I will take the blame.

684
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,920
He is so annoying.

685
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,920
He is not a bad guy.

686
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,920
I thought he was a pure bastard, but he is a dirty bastard.

687
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
Come out.

688
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
What is it?

689
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Sexual harassment?

690
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Se-hoon, what is this?

691
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Is it real?

692
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
What is this?

693
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Se-hoon.

694
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
No.

695
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
It is not real.

696
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
What happened?

697
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
What is this?

698
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Sex harassment?

699
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
It is not real.

700
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
What is this?

701
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Who wrote this?

702
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Nam Kyung-tae posted it.

703
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
This is a big deal.

704
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
No Se-hoon.

705
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
You bastard.

706
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
I will kill you.

707
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
I will kill you.

708
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Hey.

709
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
No Se-hoon.

710
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
You are here.

711
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
What should we do with that?

712
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
You bastard.

713
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Don't you want to be in trouble?

714
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
Give it to me.

715
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Go to hell.

716
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Hey, Nam Kyung-tae.

717
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Go to hell.

718
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
I will get in trouble.

719
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
If you come again, you will die.

720
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,920
You are saying that you are sexual harassment and you are guilty?

721
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

722
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
I just...

723
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
I said I was wrong because I was wrong.

724
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Didn't you get punished and it's over?

725
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Why are you bringing it up again?

726
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
That's better.

727
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
I feel heavy because of the guilt of conscience.

728
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Hey.

729
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
You are really selfish.

730
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,920
You care about your conscience and you didn't think about others?

731
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,920
I am embarrassed because of you.

732
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,920
And why do you sell the name of Oh Dae-hee or No Se-hoon?

733
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
You drew it.

734
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,920
You made it and showed it to the kids.

735
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Now you are doing it because of your conscience?

736
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
I'm sorry for you.

737
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
For me?

738
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
What do you mean?

739
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
Did you do this on purpose to make No Se-hoon feel bad?

740
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Hey, Ha Yu-kyung.

741
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,920
I will do anything if I can step on him.

742
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
So what?

743
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
He is a traitor.

744
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Did he betray you?

745
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Why are you making a fuss?

746
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,920
I hate him being successful.

747
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
You are so annoying.

748
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
You know you can get away with it.

749
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Forget it.

750
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
Is this all you can do?

751
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
There is one more thing.

752
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
I'm begging you.

753
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Please don't do this.

754
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,920
That's why they don't like you.

755
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
What is this?

756
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Oh my gosh.

757
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
You are here alone, right?

758
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Yes.

759
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
I'm here alone.

760
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
I'm here alone.

761
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
I'm here alone.

762
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
I'm here alone.

763
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
I'm here alone.

764
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
I'm here alone.

765
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm here alone.

766
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Why are you looking at me?

767
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
You always do this.

768
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Are you going to be mean to them?

769
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
No.

770
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Just leave them.

771
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
What's going on?

772
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
What's going on?

773
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Nam Kyungtae.

774
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Yes.

775
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
What did you say to Yu Gyeonghye?

776
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
She was really angry.

777
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:25,920
I think you think Kyungtae is more important than Yu Gyeonghye and Ji Hoon.

778
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Really?

779
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
They're just my backup.

780
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,920
You're different.

781
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
What's different?

782
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
You are different.

783
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
You are different.

784
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
What's different?

785
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,920
You are like my shadow.

786
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Don't ever be shaken by anything in the future.

787
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
You know what I mean, right?

788
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Oh my gosh.

789
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Oh my gosh.

790
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
You did a great job.

791
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
It's all over now.

792
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Jongsoo.

793
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Can you do something about Nam Kyungtae?

794
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
What?

795
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
What do you mean?

796
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Can you stop being so scary?

797
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Why are you asking me for that?

798
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
If you're scared, you can do it yourself.

799
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,920
I'm not asking you.

800
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
What?

801
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
I'm not asking you, Jongsoo.

802
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
I'm not asking you right now.

803
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
What's wrong with him?

804
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Hey, Choi Jongsoo.

805
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Hey, are you okay?

806
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Darn it!

807
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,920
I'm in the election, so I can't do it myself.

808
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
So you do it.

809
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
Kill half of them.

810
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Or you can ride a motorcycle.

811
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Just ride a motorcycle and die.

812
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Nam Kyungtae, you bastard.

813
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
What should I do with him?

814
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Kill him, Jongsoo.

815
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Nam Kyungtae, you crazy bastard.

816
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Are you looking down on me?

817
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
You bastard.

818
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Darn it.

819
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
Darn it.

820
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Darn it.

821
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,920
Darn it.

822
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,920
I'm sorry.

823
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
I'm sorry.

824
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
I'm sorry.

825
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
I'm sorry.

830
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,920
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,920
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,920
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
I'm sorry.

834
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm sorry.

835
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
I'm sorry.

836
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,920
I'm sorry.

837
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
I'm sorry.

838
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,920
I'm sorry.

840
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
I'm sorry.

841
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
I'm sorry.

842
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,920
I'm sorry.

843
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
I'm sorry.

844
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,920
I'm sorry.

845
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
I'm sorry.

846
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,920
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm sorry.

852
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
I'm sorry.

853
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,920
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,920
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,940
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
I'm sorry.

857
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,920
I'm sorry.

858
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,940
I'm sorry.

861
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920

I'm sorry.

864
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,940
I'm sorry.

865
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:45,800
blood is on my hands

866
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,240
blood is everywhere

867
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,100
but I do not need to say save you

868
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:13,100
But it's on my hands
