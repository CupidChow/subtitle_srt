1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first day of the first year of high school

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first day of the first year of high school

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first day of the first year of high school

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first day of the first year of high school

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first day of the first year of high school

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The first day of the first year of high school

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first day of the first year of high school

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The first day of the first year of high school

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The first day of the first year of high school

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The first day of the first year of high school

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first day of the first year of high school

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first day of the first year of high school

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The first day of the first year of high school

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The first day of the first year of high school

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first day of the first year of high school

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Do-se

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Please stop

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do we really have to talk like that?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I kept saying we should talk

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I keep saying we should talk

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Forget it. What did Yang Wondae say?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What did Yang Wondae say?

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What did Yang Wondae say?

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I did

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I did

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I did

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Wondae

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a bit embarrassing for you.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,300
Ha...

30
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,660
They don't care about their grades anymore?

31
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,100
Yeah, they're fine now.

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,600
But I don't feel very good about this.

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm not sorry at all, so don't get the mood.

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
Huh? Okay.

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,700
And your dad and mom and dad,

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,000
this is a great opportunity for me.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,900
Even if you get eliminated,

38
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,200
you can be a story of a suicide note later.

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
That's why I did it.

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,800
A person who got COVID-19 and got quarantined?

41
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000
I bought him chicken every night and gave it to him.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,300
He's hitting me in the back of the head like this.

43
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,700
What the heck?

44
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,700
It's not in the back of the head.

45
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,200
Can't I go to the election?

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Yeah, you can't.

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,600
You're a student who can't be a model for others.

48
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,200
Ha!

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,800
Anyway, I can pick you as I promised.

50
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,100
Right?

51
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,400
Then you want me to pick you?

52
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,700
Of course.

53
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,400
That's the real fair play.

54
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,600
Get lost.

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to pick myself.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,600
Oh, you're so stubborn.

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
But when you sang the chorus part,

58
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,500
you should've thought about it one more time.

59
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh...

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,900
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,400
It's okay.

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
It's because you're burdened.

63
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,800
You don't have to be sorry to me.

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,000
Anyway, I'm a little embarrassed.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,200
You're sorry for Yang Wondae.

66
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
No, I'm not.

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Why should I be sorry?

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,300
I think it's better.

69
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,500
I should've quit earlier.

70
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,000
Hello.

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
Hi.

72
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Okay.

73
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,500
Okay.

74
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,600
Oh, right.

75
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,100
I'm having a birthday party tomorrow.

76
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,800
You should come too.

77
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
A party?

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh, okay.

79
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,300
Hello.

80
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,000
Me at Sangyeon's birthday party?

81
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,300
It's an ordinary apartment.

82
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,000
We're here.

83
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,900
The walking human bootie.

84
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,500
He's the real rich guy, Sangyeon.

85
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,900
Did you think he'd be different?

86
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,100
Oh...

87
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,400
Sangyeon will pick you up.

88
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,200
Get off.

89
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,400
Okay.

90
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,400
Sehun.

91
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,600
You can't take pictures of your phone today.

92
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,700
What? Why?

93
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,100
Take out your phone.

94
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,800
Oh...

95
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,100
Okay.

96
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,400
Okay.

97
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm telling you.

98
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Take your time to take pictures.

99
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,600
Okay?

100
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,900
Okay.

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,000
What's with him?

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Look at his shoes.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's okay. You don't have to take off your shoes.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, okay.

105
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
See you later.

106
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Okay.

107
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,000
It's because of the police.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Use your phone and answer me.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
What?

110
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,600
What?

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
His phone.

112
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
What's wrong with him?

113
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,000
What's wrong with him?

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,500
What's wrong with him?

115
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,700
Oh, really?

116
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,000
Manse.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,500
Yes?

118
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Your phone.

119
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Okay.

120
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,300
I'll go up and kill you.

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,500
I'll be waiting.

122
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
What?

123
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,800
Congratulations.

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,300
It's because of the police.

125
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,700
Use your phone and answer me.

126
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,500
See you later.

127
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,900
In an ordinary apartment.

128
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,700
In an unusual world.

129
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,700
This is the real world of Gwak Sangyeon.

130
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Run it down

131
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Take my hand

132
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Run it right

133
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
You think you're the starlight

134
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Just run it down

135
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Take my hand

136
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Run it right

137
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Are you having fun?

138
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
Yes.

139
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Focus.

140
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
This is No Sehyung.

141
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Jungui, please raise your hand.

142
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Are these the guys who are going to the election with me?

143
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Hey, Park Sangyeon.

144
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
I want to transfer too.

145
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Let me vote too.

146
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,700
College students are good at managing their grades.

147
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
Don't be a kid when you're playing with kids.

148
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Let's say hello.

149
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Hello.

150
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Thank you.

151
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Cute.

152
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Cute.

153
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Hey, Park Sangyeon.

154
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Let's do a self introduction and get ready for the party.

155
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Let's get it on.

156
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Let's get it on.

157
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
Please take care of me.

158
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,700
Say hello to the people in front of you.

159
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
Hey, it's No Sehyung.

160
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Please take care of me.

161
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Minah, No Sehyung.

162
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
Of course I know Sehyung.

163
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Hello.

164
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Hello.

165
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Drink it up.

166
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Are you really going to do this?

167
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Drink it up.

168
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
Drink it up.

169
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Drink it up.

170
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Drink it up.

171
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,700
No, no, no.

172
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,700
He's on his way to the academy.

173
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
He can't smell alcohol.

174
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Hey, Park Sangyeon.

175
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
It's just a drink.

176
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
You're so stupid.

177
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,700
It's so boring.

178
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
I'm a little...

179
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Drink it up.

180
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
Hey, hey, hey.

181
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
You can't do this to your stomach.

182
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
It's okay here.

183
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Why are you drinking it?

184
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
What is this?

185
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Idiot.

186
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
Huh?

187
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
Idiot?

188
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Hey.

189
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Wow.

190
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Nice.

191
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Hey, Sehun.

192
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Are you okay?

193
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
No, no.

194
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
No, no, no.

195
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Hey, Sehun.

196
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
I didn't drink alcohol.

197
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
That's right.

198
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
What kind of a phone is this?

199
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
I'm screwed.

200
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Hey, mom. Hyunjin.

201
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Hey, turn it off.

202
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
Hey, move that.

203
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Turn it off.

204
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Hey, all of you, quiet.

205
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
Yes, mom.

206
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Happy birthday, son.

207
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
It's my birthday, but why are you two going on a trip?

208
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
What's the trip?

209
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Your dad followed me on a business trip.

210
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Hey, what are you doing?

211
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
My aunt is at the ribs restaurant.

212
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
I'm eating and resting.

213
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Yeah.

214
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
You called your friends like last time.

215
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
You can't do that.

216
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Dad, I don't have many friends.

217
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Yeah.

218
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Happy birthday.

219
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Happy birthday, my son.

220
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Yes, I love you.

221
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
What are you doing?

222
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
Be honest.

223
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
I'm scared.

224
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
I'm scared.

225
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Hey.

226
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Did some bastard laugh earlier?

227
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Yes.

228
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
It's really the beginning.

229
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Yes.

230
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Oh, shit.

231
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Where the fuck did he come from?

232
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I came here because of that asshole.

233
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I don't even know what's going on.

234
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I'm embarrassed that I can't even eat.

235
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Stop right there!

236
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Stop right there, you bastard!

237
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
What are you gonna do?

238
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
What are you doing?

239
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
You bastard.

240
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
You bastard!

241
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
You bastard!

242
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
You bastard!

243
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
What are you doing?

244
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
You bastard!

245
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Are you crazy?

246
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Fuck!

247
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
I'm fucking gonna kill you!

248
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
I'm fucking gonna kill you!

249
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Are you gonna keep doing it or die?

250
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
I'm gonna stop.

251
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
I'm gonna stop.

252
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Follow me, you bastard.

253
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Hey, let's go to the rooftop.

254
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Let's go.

255
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Follow me.

256
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Fuck.

257
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Fuck.

258
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
That bastard.

259
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Fuck.

260
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
It's so embarrassing.

261
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Hey.

262
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
What?

263
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
What the fuck?

264
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Why the fuck did you bring that bastard?

265
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
You fucking idiot.

266
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
You're talking too much.

267
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Didn't you hear me introduce him?

268
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Are you kidding me?

269
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Are you fucking kidding me?

270
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Just go home.

271
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
I don't fucking want to see you.

272
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
You bastard.

273
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Fuck.

274
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Fuck.

275
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Fuck.

276
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
What kind of crazy bastard

277
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
would punch like this?

278
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Put it in.

279
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
That's why you hit it like this.

280
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Hit it hard, you bastard.

281
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Harder.

282
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Why are you so late?

283
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Hurry up.

284
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
What are you doing?

285
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
I'm gonna punch you.

286
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
What are you doing?

287
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
What are you doing?

288
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
What are you doing?

289
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Fuck.

290
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Fuck.

291
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
There are two more

292
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
of these bastard.

293
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Fuck.

294
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
I was so surprised.

295
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Fuck.

296
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Fuck.

297
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Wait.

298
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Right.

299
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Last night.

300
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Did Mina

301
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
and I...

302
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Fuck.

303
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
He was so rude to me.

304
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
He acted like an adult.

305
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Adult?

306
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Yes.

307
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
What?

308
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
What?

309
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
Oh, Noh Se.

310
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
I think there's more

311
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
big story.

312
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
No.

313
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
There's nothing.

314
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
What is it?

315
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Nothing.

316
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Jihoon, your bill.

317
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
You two pay together.

318
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Jaehoon.

319
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Thank you.

320
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Look.

321
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Who is it?

322
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
It's Jaewon.

323
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Was he with you?

324
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Yes.

325
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
He's so nice.

326
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
What?

327
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
He's been talking about you.

328
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
You can't tell anyone.

329
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
It's a secret.

330
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Really?

331
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Come here.

332
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
You bastard.

333
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Come here.

334
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
You bastard.

335
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
No.

336
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Jihoon.

337
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Is this the poster?

338
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
Already?

339
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Yes.

340
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
It's supposed to be a secret.

341
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
How did you do that?

342
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
When did you put this on?

343
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
What time?

344
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Who wants to eat

345
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
?

346
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Me.

347
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Me.

348
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Help us.

349
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
We have to go to the choir later.

350
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Okay.

351
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Then,

352
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
let's eat a hamburger.

353
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Let's eat a hamburger.

354
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
Hamburger.

355
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Hamburger.

356
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Okay.

357
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Let's go.

358
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
This is the health room.

359
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
What?

360
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Let's go.

361
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
We're done, right?

362
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Let's go.

363
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Let's go.

364
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
Okay.

365
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Let's go.

366
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
That's it.

367
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Okay.

368
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Let's go.

369
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Let's go.

370
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Let's go.

371
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
Let's go.

372
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Let's go.

373
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Let's go.

374
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
That bastard is so annoying.

375
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Huh?

376
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Park Sanghyun.

377
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
When did you put this on?

378
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Wow.

379
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
It looks like a concert poster.

380
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
This is so cool.

381
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Is it?

382
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Is it good?

383
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
What should we do?

384
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Should we try it?

385
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Are you kidding?

386
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Let's make this?

387
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
It's not bad.

388
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
It's not even a fixed date.

389
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
We're going to the school.

390
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Let's not make eye contact with this land.

391
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
It's embarrassing.

392
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Okay.

393
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Jihoon.

394
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
What?

395
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Don't be discouraged.

396
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
This has nothing to do with the kids.

397
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
You're the vice president.

398
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Trust me.

399
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Okay.

400
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Okay.

401
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Let's go.

402
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Let's go.

403
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
I love you.

404
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
I'll do my best.

405
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
You're cute.

406
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
What's this?

407
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Let's take a picture.

408
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Let's take a picture.

409
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Come on.

410
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
What's this?

411
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Come on.

412
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Smile.

413
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Smile.

414
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Smile.

415
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Smile.

416
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
You're excited.

417
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
It's today.

418
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
You're so bright.

419
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm going to make you a high school student.

420
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
You're dead.

421
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
One, two, three.

422
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
I'm so pissed off.

423
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Stop it.

424
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
You can't do this to the vice president.

425
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Get up.

426
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
You're dead.

427
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
I guess I'm close to the others these days.

428
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
I'm not a fucking guard.

429
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
That's it.

430
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
I'm preparing to fight with you.

431
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
But you're close to the others.

432
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
You're not doing well, are you?

433
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
You're not doing well, are you?

434
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
You're not doing well, are you?

435
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Get a hold of yourself.

436
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
Stop being a little cocky.

437
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Before I push you all the way.

438
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
Before I throw you away.

439
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
But if...

440
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,700
If you really win,

441
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
What do you think will happen?

442
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Fuck!

443
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
You're a fucking bastard.

444
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
You're a fucking bastard.

445
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Is that a market?

446
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Is that the president?

447
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Hey, Mo Se.

448
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
What do you think will happen to your high school life after you graduate?

449
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Have you ever thought about that?

450
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
You're in high school, too.

451
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Are you going to bother the kids until then?

452
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Are you going to bother the kids until then?

453
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
Of course, you bastard.

454
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
We don't care about high school.

455
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Fuck.

456
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
I don't want to go to college.

457
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Don't you?

458
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
No, that's a little...

459
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
No, Jong-soo, you have to go to college.

460
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
No, I'm going to go to M.T.

461
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm going to date.

462
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
I'm going to have sex.

463
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
You bastards.

464
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Anyway, No Se.

465
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
If you want to sit down and study comfortably,

466
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
If you want to sit down and study comfortably,

467
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Think about it.

468
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Okay?

469
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Okay.

470
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I'll think about it.

471
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
Why are you so cramped?

472
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
What's going on?

473
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
No, it's nothing.

474
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
No, it's nothing.

475
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
But where are you going?

476
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
You don't know anything, you bastard.

477
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
Wait a minute.

478
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Wait a minute.

479
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
What's wrong?

480
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,700
That's right.

481
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
Who is it?

482
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
This looks like a collar.

483
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
I was playing with the kids at school.

484
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
No Se, you're playing with the collar.

485
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
No Se, you're playing with the collar.

486
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,700
You're playing with the collar.

487
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Yes.

488
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
You're kidding me.

489
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
How many times are you doing this?

490
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
I'm really fine.

491
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
I'm really fine.

492
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Do you want to be beaten like a fool by the vice president?

493
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
I'll take care of it.

494
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
You don't have to worry about it.

495
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
I'll take care of it.

496
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Hello.

497
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
I'm already tired.

498
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
Students, please pass by the car.

499
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
What's going on in the morning?

500
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
What's going on?

501
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Teacher, which building is the living guide?

502
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Teacher, which building is the living guide?

503
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
You can go to the second floor of the building in front of you.

504
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
You can go to the second floor of the building in front of you.

505
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
What's going on?

506
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
I need to check something.

507
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Good luck.

508
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
What is it?

509
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
What is it?

510
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
What's going on?

511
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,700
Y High School, 80 years old Seoul City.

512
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
It's a famous place for corruption.

513
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Isn't that right?

514
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Your face is the corruption itself.

515
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
The person who insults a person at the concert

516
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,700
is charged a fine of less than 2 million won or less than a year.

517
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
This is about you, Jo Han-byul.

518
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Oh, shut up.

519
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
Why do you memorize that?

520
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
It's not a budget thing that the police car came.

521
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Hey, Noh Se-yoon.

522
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
I'm screwed.

523
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
Wondae just got caught by the police.

524
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
What? Why is that senior?

525
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
I'm not caught.

526
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
I just took him.

527
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
No, I'm not in a bad mood.

528
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
I think something happened.

529
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,700
What the hell can't you do?

530
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Cho Jang-guk would be hit in the back of the head by his junior.

531
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
I'm sure he's in a lot of trouble.

532
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
What?

533
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
You just got caught?

534
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
Yeah.

535
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
It hasn't been long.

536
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
I don't think he's even started yet.

537
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
But why is he going there?

538
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Are you worried about him or are you going to watch him?

539
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
Hey, you should stop too.

540
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Hey, you should stop too.

541
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
It's cool, but it's too late.

542
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
What should we do now?

543
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
Get on quickly.

544
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Get on quickly.

545
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
Get on quickly.

546
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Get on quickly.

547
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,700
In-kyung, congratulations.

548
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Thank you.

549
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Good. Let's do that.

550
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Hey, guys.

551
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
Hello, Noh.

552
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,700
Senior, you're here.

553
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Oh, you know your opponent, Yangwon University?

554
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Yes.

555
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
I heard he learned police history today.

556
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
What's going on?

557
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm asking you this and that, but you don't know.

558
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Noh, do you know anything?

559
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,700
Uh...

560
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
I think I've been a little feverish since before.

561
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Yeah.

562
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Anyway, you guys take good care of your image.

563
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
You should never cause trouble.

564
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,700
Yes, sister.

565
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
But he's a little shy.

566
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
He's a little shy.

567
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
Where did you see him?

568
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Oh, yeah.

569
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Oh, I saw that.

570
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Power smashing in the bus.

571
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
You're a dog, right?

572
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
Yes, he's a dog.

573
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,700
It's okay.

574
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Yes.

575
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
I'm the vice president of our company.

577
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,700
I decided to get some help this time.

578
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Can I do that?

579
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
There's not much left of the college entrance exam.

580
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Don't worry. I don't take the college entrance exam anyway.

581
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,700
I was elected to Columbia this time.

582
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
For good.

583
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
What happened to Yangwon University?

584
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,700
Well, I don't think it's a big deal if you don't talk about it.

585
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
The police won't come even if it's not a big deal.

586
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
Let's talk about that later while washing the chicken ribs.

587
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
I'll be back from the music room.

588
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Wait, I'll be right back.

589
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
How long does it take?

590
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
About 20 to 30 minutes.

591
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
No, 40 minutes.

592
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
No, about 45 to 60 minutes?

593
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Hey, if you're going to do that, just eat it later.

594
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,700
What?

595
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
I can't do that.

596
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
I've been talking about it since the day before yesterday.

597
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
I'm into it today.

598
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Today is the day of chicken ribs.

599
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Or you can come with me. Wait a minute.

600
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Hey, what am I doing there?

601
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
It's not even the choir now.

602
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Then go to the PC room and play a game.

603
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Okay.

604
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Come on.

605
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Yes, brother.

606
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
Yes?

607
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
Today?

608
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Okay, a little louder.

609
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,700
Nice, great.

610
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,700
I'm going to bend my head a little bit and aim for 45 degrees.

611
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
Great, good.

612
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Nice.

613
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Nice, great.

614
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Okay, good girl.

615
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Nice.

616
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Confidently and confidently.

617
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Nice, go.

618
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Tonight's main character is me.

619
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
It's me.

620
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Are you nervous?

621
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,700
No, breathe.

622
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,700
Everything starts with me breathing.

623
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Are you frustrated?

624
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
You try to solve this with me.

625
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Harder, harder.

626
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
That's right, you're handsome.

627
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,700
Look ahead.

628
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,700
Good.

629
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
Confidently.

630
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,700
That's right, be more bold.

631
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,700
Hi, cue.

632
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,700
Confidently walk from today.

633
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,700
Once again.

634
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
One more time.

635
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,700
That's right, good.

636
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,700
Nice.

637
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,700
That's right, good.

638
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
You're handsome.

639
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
Good, good.

640
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
Hey, No Se.

641
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
Did you eat?

642
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Yes, I'm eating now.

643
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,700
You're eating late.

644
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,700
We finished late too.

645
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Did you shoot well?

646
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
It was hard.

647
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
What are you guys eating?

648
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,700
Do you eat chicken ribs?

649
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
No, we're at Yanggaejang's house.

650
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
Yanggaejang's house?

651
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,700
Yes.

652
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Yanggaejang's son?

653
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
Yes, there's a chicken restaurant.

654
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
Hey, Dakjun.

655
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,700
No Se.

656
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
What's that on your head?

657
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
What?

658
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,700
What?

659
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
What's that on your head?

660
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Is it chicken bone?

661
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,700
That's why.

662
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
So embarrassing.

663
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
Hey, Dakjun, get the cake.

664
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,700
That's right.

665
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Today is your birthday, right?

666
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Yes, there's only three hours left.

667
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
That's why you asked me to eat chicken ribs.

668
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
Hey, let's eat chicken ribs.

669
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Hey, you should have told me.

670
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
If you did, I would have eaten it.

671
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
Who's going to celebrate his birthday?

672
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,700
Idiot.

673
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
No Se, what are you doing?

674
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
We're not playing right now.

675
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
Come on.

676
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
Yes.

677
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
I'll go now.

678
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Anyway, let's eat later after we're done.

679
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
I'll treat you.

680
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,700
Okay.

681
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
Okay.

682
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
Buy a million won worth of chicken ribs.

683
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
You crazy bastard.

684
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Okay.

685
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
I'll go now.

686
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Go.

687
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Oh, right.

688
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
Hello?

689
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Park Jun, come on.

690
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
Happy birthday, Park Jun.

691
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
One, two, three, four.

692
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
Happy birthday.

693
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Happy birthday.

694
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,700
Happy birthday.

695
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,700
Happy birthday.

696
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
Happy birthday.

697
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,700
Happy birthday.

698
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,700
Happy birthday.

699
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Happy birthday.

700
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Happy birthday.

701
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Happy birthday.

702
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Happy birthday.

703
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
What's wrong with him?

704
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
What's wrong with him?

705
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Choi Jong-soo.

706
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
What's wrong with you?

707
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
You teased Kang Ji-won.

708
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Jong-soo was being hit on the head for three hours yesterday.

709
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Hey, you.

710
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Go away.

711
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Did you get hit by Jaewon?

712
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
No.

713
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,700
He didn't touch a hair.

714
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
Jaewon is a total dipper.

715
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
I'd rather get hit.

716
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
What's this?

717
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Oh, yeah.

718
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
We'll protect you now.

719
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,700
Protect what?

720
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
No, it's okay.

721
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,700
I'm okay.

722
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm the head of the security team now.

723
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,700
What?

724
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
What's wrong with you?

725
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Don't laugh, you bastards.

726
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Including you.

727
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
Kim Ki-jae, you too.

728
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Me?

729
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,700
What the hell is the head of the security team?

730
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,700
What?

731
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
I almost said it.

732
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
I look forward to your kind cooperation.

733
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,700
Thank you.

734
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,700
Hey, hey, hey.

735
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Good, good.

736
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
Let's go.

737
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
Let's go.

738
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Don't shout.

739
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,700
One, two, three.

740
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
Student participation in disciplinary committee?

741
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,700
I think my friends will hate this.

742
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,700
You could be assassinated by Jaewon.

743
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Jaewon is nice.

744
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:29,700
This is a collection of the promises of the 73 school presidents who won last year.

745
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,700
The presidents?

746
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Yes.

747
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,700
I haven't filled out 100 yet, but would you like to see the reference?

748
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,700
You got that?

749
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,700
How?

750
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,700
I called the school and said I wanted to benchmark, so I sent it by email.

751
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,700
Wow, Yoonjung.

752
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
You're amazing.

753
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
But will the last year's promise of other schools help?

754
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,700
I ranked the repeated ones among the school promises.

755
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,700
In a word, it's possible to analyze the trend.

756
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
That's good.

757
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Jonghee, when did you prepare all this?

758
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
Just at home?

759
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Then can you see the file you worked on?

760
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
Yes, I've already sent it by email.

761
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
What about me?

762
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
You can do something else.

763
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,700
Why are you two doing the same thing?

764
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Yeah, Seyoon.

765
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
We'll keep the promise.

766
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
You...

767
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Do you want to look around the place where the banner is?

768
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Now.

769
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
Yes.

770
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,700
That's important, too.

771
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,700
You know what I mean, right?

772
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
This is nice.

773
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,700
It's got a vibe, right?

774
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,700
It would've been less time, but it's much more luxurious than I thought.

775
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
This camp is going to be a lot of fun.

776
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
I know.

777
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
Yangwondae is in trouble, too.

778
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
Wow, that's sophisticated.

779
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
Seyoon.

780
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,700
Yes.

781
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
Hyunjin had a plan from the beginning, but he did it alone.

782
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
I guess he didn't know.

783
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
Guys.

784
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,700
Isn't this nice, too?

785
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
It's a little retro.

786
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
Seyoon made it.

787
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
Retro is not that bad.

788
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
What's that?

789
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
Are you an elementary school senior?

790
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
Who's listening to that?

791
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Hey, Seyoon.

792
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,700
Yeah.

793
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Why?

794
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,700
If you're going to do that, do it together.

795
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,700
That?

796
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
What you made yesterday.

797
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
What about you?

798
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
You made a statistics and everything.

799
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Do you want to look so good?

800
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
That's what you made.

801
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
You send me mails every day.

802
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
That's actually...

803
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
Actually what?

804
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
If you look under that table, your name is written together.

805
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
My name?

806
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Why my name?

807
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
We were going to submit it together.

808
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
If 100 are filled out.

809
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Us two?

810
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
Yeah.

811
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
You're lying.

812
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
I didn't see it at all.

813
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
I just wanted to show you what I did.

814
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
I was going to pop out.

815
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
We're talking like two people.

816
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,700
If you don't like it,

817
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
You're trying to hit me like we did together.

818
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Like a bully.

819
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Yeah, that's right.

820
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
You're more smart than I thought.

821
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Hey, you.

822
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Anyway, you.

823
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
Don't keep making me a rival.

824
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
When am I?

825
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
What do you mean when? You can see it when you see it.

826
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
It's funny.

827
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
What kind of rival?

828
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Well, the rival's own mouth itself.

829
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
I'm speechless.

830
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
You need to cut down on useless words.

831
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
Useless words?

832
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,700
Yeah, like this.

833
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
Think about it carefully before you ask.

834
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Do you like me?

835
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
Actually,

836
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
I'm sorry.

837
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
It's almost ignoring.

838
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
I'm really ridiculous.

839
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Hey!

840
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
It's an interesting story.

841
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
What is it?

842
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
That's what I'm talking about.

843
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
I'm sorry.

844
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm sorry.

845
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
I'm sorry.

846
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
What's wrong with you?

847
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
What's wrong with you?

848
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
I'm sorry.

849
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I'm sorry.

850
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
I'm sorry.

851
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
I'm sorry.

852
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
I'm sorry.

853
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
I'm sorry.

854
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
Gosh!

855
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
You are so brave.

856
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,700
Grurk.

857
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,700
The marriage certificate...

858
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
I'm going to cry when I think

859
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
there'll be Sikyo's divorce کرool.

860
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
Everyone who was on the scene

861
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
must have had a like her.

862
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
But being asked for a status

863
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
of well- dying Iranian police included

864
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,700
I'm very proud and занied-

865
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,700
It is required to fulfill the экumenic.

866
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,700
Only auberge would ;)

867
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Only auberge would ;)

868
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,700
I was worried that she really had an accident.

869
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,700
But seeing that it's finally getting better,

870
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,700
I think she might have been more comfortable in the accident.

871
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Hey.

872
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,700
She's worried for nothing.

873
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,700
I know.

874
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,700
I'm worried about her.

875
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I know.

876
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
I'm worried about her.

877
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,700
Why are you so down?

878
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,700
And the worst part is that

879
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,700
I was actually jealous of her.

880
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Oh, I'm so pissed off.

881
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
It's a mess.

882
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
You lose when you're jealous.

883
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,700
Let's go.

884
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Let's go.

885
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
Let's go.

886
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700

Let's go.

891
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Let's go.

Let's go.

902

Let's go.

904
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,700

00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,700
Let's go.

914
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,700
Let's go.

915
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,700
Let's go.

916
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,700
Let's go.

917
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
Let's go.
