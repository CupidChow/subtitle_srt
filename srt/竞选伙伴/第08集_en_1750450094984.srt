1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,500
First story

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
limited time

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Good comparative

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What happened?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You said you didn't answer my call, lawyer.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, fuck, lawyer is your business.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I just did it on my own.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah? How about the agreement? Did the agreement go well?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hey, the game fee was so expensive.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're trying to make a lot of money.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're a big bastard. You don't even know how embarrassing it is. You're telling the high schooler the game fee.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hey, how much is it? I'll send it to you this week.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll send it to you this week.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's okay.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mind your own business.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Huh?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I hit it, so I have to ask.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, it's not like I can talk at home.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You two just watched.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I hit it alone.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How do I get your money?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Isn't it?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, Kang Joong.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you have a bastard to beat up in the future, you beat him up yourself.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not going to do it anymore.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey, I think you're misunderstanding something.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What the fuck is a misunderstanding? No matter how fucking a person is.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hang up.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hang up.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Kang Joong

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Be careful.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, how much is that? I told you to be careful.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You have to prepare the right string.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How can you prepare a shoelace string, you crazy bastard?

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If the chicken is soggy, it's salty.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But it's a little salty today.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is it because I'm late for the delivery?

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, then you can order it.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The self-quarantined bastard is arguing.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hey, give me the chicken price.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll give it to you.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Just eat this.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, that crazy guy.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are you crazy?

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The results will be announced shortly, so please take a seat.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hey, Noh Se-hyung.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What was that?

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're bluffing.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Again.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Are you serious?

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, I did that on purpose to stimulate you.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Stimulate me?

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You succeeded, Noh Se-hyung.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The results will be announced shortly, so please take a seat.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's change into new clothes.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then I will announce.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The president of the 75th Yeongjin High School Student Council is.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The president of the 75th Yeongjin High School Student Council.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:46,240
..

65
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,180
I won!

66
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,080
I won Yoonjeong!

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Good job!

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You did great!

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, you did great.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You did great, too.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's okay because you did well.

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You just need to do your best.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ji-hoon, you did a great job.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's cheer up.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
My senior.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's finally over.

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Did you see it?

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I saw it. I thought I'd lose if I blinked.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Isn't he crazy?

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Guys, let's cheer up.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You did great.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You did great!

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You did great!

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You did great!

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You did great!

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Wondae,

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I hope you do well.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, congratulations.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You guys did great, too.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Wait.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You did great, Ha Yu-kyung.

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Congratulations, Jung-hee.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Congratulations, Ha Yu-kyung.

96
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Congratulations, Ha Yu-kyung.

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's congratulate them.

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah!

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
My friends,

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
this is your fourth year at the university.

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Congratulations!

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's go!

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
Now, Mr. Kim is going to come up and get the name tag.

104
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Please clean up and get ready.

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,600
He was a great player.

106
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
Please sit down.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,200
Kang Tae-hyun, talk to me.

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Okay.

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,400
Thank you.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you for your hard work.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Mr. Kim, Mr. Kim, Mr. Kim.

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hey, there's a wolf.

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey, hey, hey.

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There's a wolf.

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hey, hey, hey.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you doing?

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, hey, hey.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Everybody shout out.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

120
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Wolf, wolf, wolf.

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What is it?

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why?

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What is it?

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Look at this, Ota.

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Your clothes.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What is this?

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Are you laughing again?

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're laughing.

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No.

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Is it you?

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't like it, so shut up.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hey, vice presidents.

133
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Where are you going?

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Hey, congratulations, both of you.

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you.

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I was so excited that I was a little behind.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hey, senior.

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll give you a tie.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What do you think?

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's just go.

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
As a commemoration.

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I look forward to your continued support.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you.

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hey, Sang-hyun.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Where's Jaewon?

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What's going on?

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He's not answering the phone.

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I know.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What's wrong with Jaewon?

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, it's nothing.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Anyway, thank you for your hard work.

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll treat you to a meal on the weekend.

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's eat.

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

155
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We have somewhere to go.

156
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go.

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll go.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Congratulations.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Congratulations, senior.

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thank you.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's do well in the future.

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's over.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I feel empty.

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I know.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What are you going to do later?

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I heard that Wansik is going to buy them a Malatang.

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There's a special lecture in 53 minutes.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, is that so?

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Do you always live in a unit like this?

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Four.

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you want to drink beer after the special lecture?

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
To celebrate the winning.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I still have a few cans of beer I took on Chuseok.

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's soju.

176
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So-mak.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay?

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you want to be a victim of a drinking party?

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a seduction.

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's true.

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Mom.

182
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Mom.

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes, mom.

184
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's okay, mom.

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I won.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes?

187
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes, I see.

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You eat this.

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll go first.

190
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hey, the celebration party.

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can't help but report it.

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Two guys are taking off the scooter license plate.

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This all smells like a crime.

194
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No matter how much I think about it, it's weird.

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I went there again today.

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There's Hyun Soom-wook in the report.

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So I called him right away.

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, you did.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But I'm really busy again.

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There are so many things to do today.

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Thank you so much.

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You must be very busy.

203
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But mom.

204
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes?

205
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
When do you give me the money?

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Witness report money.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes?

208
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can do it with cash right here, right?

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's not a problem.

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll give you the money.

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can do it with cash right here, right?

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can talk about that after it's all over.

214
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No, is this the ideal type?

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The two people I saw then.

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes, the right one was driving.

217
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I think the left one was taking off the license plate together.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Really?

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes, let's take a look.

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Look.

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I thought you two were drunk because you were talking in English.

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's...

223
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Would you like to see this picture?

224
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's right.

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The guy we were with.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I told you it was me.

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's right.

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No, Seoyeon, this is...

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wait a minute.

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll call you later.

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Really?

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Is there anything wrong?

234
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes, sir.

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But what if...

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What if this reporter saw it wrong?

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What?

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Didn't you just say it was right because you were sure?

239
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's true, but...

240
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And then you saw it at night.

241
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He could be the one who was after the money.

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I thought so at first...

243
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, but Seoyeon, why did you show this picture to the reporter?

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's...

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He didn't see the accident himself.

246
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's no guarantee that the accomplice is Sangyeon.

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Seoyeon, didn't you just want it to be like that?

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What am I supposed to do with this unconfirmed thing that Kang Jung-hee was caught in the accident?

249
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Seoyeon.

250
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes, sir.

251
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Do you want to take a look at this?

252
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Come here and sit down.

253
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Do you remember this day?

254
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What?

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes, that's right.

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But when I came, there was already a trace of someone going there.

257
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And there was someone's fingerprints on it.

258
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No, I don't understand why you got rid of that evidence.

259
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't know.

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't know.

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't know.

262
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Did you get rid of that evidence?

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know.

264
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I just have to do it, Seoyeon.

265
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Seoyeon!

266
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Honestly, I think it's possible.

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
At your age, you're too competitive.

268
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The rest of the action?

269
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I think you can do it.

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's why I've been pretending not to know.

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I did.

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I won the election today.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The fact that you're looking for it now is that your president, Kwak Sang-hyun, is the accomplice of Se-hoon's unconfirmed accident.

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You just forget what you did.

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Sir!

276
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I didn't do that.

277
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Someone else came first.

278
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Then what was the one who died earlier?

279
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Aren't you going to destroy the evidence?

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's right.

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's not the evidence that I have.

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, shit.

283
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Hey.

284
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
How did you know that someone else did it and come to school in advance?

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're not getting this right.

286
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I wanted to win the election while selling my sister.

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Now you're pushing your sister to the back of the line?

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Hey, are you a psycho?

289
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Are you a psychopath?

290
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Answer me.

291
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why are you playing a game like this?

292
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The reason why you play a game like this?

293
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The reason why you play a game like this?

294
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, I'm not trying to ruin the election.

295
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm not being fooled by a fake reporter who's after the money.

296
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I just...

297
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I've been sacrificing myself for victory.

298
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The stupid, stupid, and cowardly times in the last few weeks.

299
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It was just too unfair.

300
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It wasn't easy.

301
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In order to CHRIS!

302
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I had to change the name of the channel.

303
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, god.

304
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I hope there's no more fire.

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Thank you.

306
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you.

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm not good at it.

308
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Take a picture of me.

309
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
In front of you.

310
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Promise me.

311
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm not good at it.

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll take a picture of you.

313
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm not good at it.

314
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm not good at it.

315
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm not good at it.

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm not good at it.

317
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey, Park Ji-hoon.

318
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Ji-hoon.

319
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's talk.

320
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Park Ji-hoon.

321
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh, my God.

322
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Ji-hoon.

323
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Ji-hoon.

324
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Where did it go wrong?

325
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I went back to find the answer to that question.

326
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Hey, vice president.

327
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I have something to ask you.

328
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Where are you?

329
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I have an event in my house.

330
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm here.

331
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Really?

332
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's an event.

333
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Hello?

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Who's that?

335
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
location

336
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
location

337
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
location

338
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
location

339
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
location

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
location

341
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What are you doing?

342
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Cheers.

343
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Cheers.

344
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Cheers.

345
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Drink it.

346
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Drink it.

347
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's good.

348
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's okay.

349
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Drink it alone.

350
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Just let it go.

351
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Cheers.

352
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yu-gyeong, I'm sorry.

353
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You're teasing me.

354
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's a little hard.

355
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's okay, Yu-gyeong.

356
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You bastard.

357
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You're a bastard.

358
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You bastard.

359
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You bastard.

360
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What are you going to do, mom?

361
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You bastard.

362
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You bastard.

363
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Don't go.

364
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You bastard.

365
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Dad, dad, dad.

366
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I was so surprised when you two were fighting.

367
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You're the best.

368
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You're the best.

369
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You're the best.

370
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You're the best.

371
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You're the best.

372
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's overflowing.

373
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Are you drunk?

374
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Turn it off.

375
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What are you doing?

376
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You bastard.

377
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Let go.

378
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
No.

379
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I have to take Ju-hwan to the hospital later.

380
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Okay, stop drinking.

381
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I hate drinking.

382
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Drinking?

383
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Drinking?

384
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hey, you're a bastard.

385
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What's so funny?

386
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Shut up.

387
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You bastard?

388
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What are you talking about?

389
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What are you talking about?

390
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
No.

391
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You bastard.

392
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What the hell.

393
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's right.

394
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That's right.

395
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That's right.

396
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Here we go.

397
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What is it?

398
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What is it?

399
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No-se.

400
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
No-se?

401
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Did you call him too?

402
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Identification card?

403
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
What's that?

404
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Hey, Kang Ji-won.

405
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Did you do that?

406
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Where's this bastard?

407
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
What's going on?

408
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
All of a sudden.

409
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I told you I have something to ask.

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What is it?

411
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Why are you crawling in like a thief?

412
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
In someone else's house.

413
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Why did you ask me to go to the election?

414
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Huh?

415
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Why did you seduce me?

416
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You knew you were going to go out with someone else.

417
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You bastard.

418
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What do you mean seduce?

419
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What do you mean seduce?

420
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What do you mean?

421
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Hey, Sang-hyun.

422
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Did the bastard go crazy?

423
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Don't do it.

424
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Don't do it.

425
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Come here, you bastard.

426
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Hey, you bastard.

427
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Come here.

428
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Come here, you bastard.

429
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Come here, you bastard.

430
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Come here, you bastard.

431
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That night, you two saw the hand that was taken away, right?

432
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Why?

433
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Were you embarrassed because a bastard like me told your friend to do it?

434
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh, really.

435
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Is that why you two planned it?

436
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
To make me a moron?

437
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay, get out.

438
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Conviction of identification card?

439
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What the hell are you doing?

440
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What are you going to do about it?

441
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Do you have any evidence, you bastard?

442
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Do you have any evidence?

443
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There are witnesses, you bastard.

444
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Why?

445
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Are you scared?

446
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So tell me.

447
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Why did you make the vice president when you were just studying?

448
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Huh?

449
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
What is it?

450
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Does it hurt?

451
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Hey, Park Sang-hyun.

452
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Hey, stop Ho-seok.

453
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Hey, stop.

454
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Stop it.

455
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Why?

456
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Why did you come here to ask me that?

457
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Why?

458
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's because I felt sorry for that bastard.

459
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Why?

460
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You should have been more careful and put that bastard next to you.

461
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You don't know how jealous I am of those bastards, do you?

462
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Stop it.

463
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Now I know.

464
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I didn't like or hate that bastard.

465
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I just liked him.

466
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You don't know anything.

467
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I learned a lesson.

468
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Thank you for selling your hat.

469
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
My place wasn't here in the first place.

470
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I learned a lesson.

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I guess he's taking it all.

472
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
When did you get this?

473
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You bastard.

474
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Don't do it.

475
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Hey, Kang Jae-won.

476
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What are you doing?

477
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Please wake up now.

478
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's stop.

479
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Are you okay?

480
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah.

481
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Can you stand up?

482
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Shit!

486
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What should we do?

487
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What should we do?

488
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What should we do?

489
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What should we do?

490
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What should we do?

491
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
What should we do?

492
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What are you doing?

493
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Please let me call you.

494
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Please.

495
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Please.

496
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Hey.

497
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm gonna go by myself, okay?

498
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Jae-won.

499
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
What happened?

500
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What should we do?

501
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Hey, Kang Jae-won.

502
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
What are you doing?

503
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Kang Jae-won.

504
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Hey, Kang Jae-won.

505
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'll call you later.

506
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Wait a minute, okay?

507
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Hurry up.

508
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I was not confident enough to go back to the past.

509
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I was confident enough to go back to myself before the election.

510
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I was confident enough to go back to myself,

511
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
who was talking and laughing with friends.

512
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I was confident enough to go back to myself,

513
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
who was just holding back even though I was embarrassed and unfair.

514
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I was not confident enough to go back to myself like I was.

515
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I decided to leave school.

516
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Everyone, stay healthy.

517
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Good-bye, sir.

518
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Happy birthday, dad.

519
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Happy birthday, dad.

520
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Call you later.

521
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Take it.

522
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Take it.

523
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Take it.

524
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Take it.

525
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I told you not to kick them.

526
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh, my.

527
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Jae-hoon.

528
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah.

529
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm rooting for you.

530
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Me too.

531
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Dong-tae.

532
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
What?

533
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:04,000
What?

534
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh.

535
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh.

536
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Goodbye, Noh.

537
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Oh.

538
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Go, Noh!

539
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Call me.

540
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'll give you a return card.

541
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But you're going to play.

542
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't break it. Goodbye.

543
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Goodbye, Na-rae.

544
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Be healthy.

545
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Okay, you punk.

546
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Bye.

547
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Bye.

548
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh.

549
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh, my.

550
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh, my God.

551
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh, my God.

552
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Hey, Noh Se-hyeon.

553
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Hey, you're not riding a motorcycle anymore?

554
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Hey, riding a motorcycle is dangerous.

555
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Get on it.

556
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Wow, you're a golden welcome.

557
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What?

558
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Welcome.

559
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Get on it.

560
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
But you don't even know glasses.

561
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hey, hey.

562
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You're an intellectual image.

563
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
How much is this car?

564
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's expensive.

565
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
What about your test result?

566
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Next week.

567
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Is it worth it?

568
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
How's work?

569
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm just in good shape.

570
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Do you want to go in?

571
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Should I?

572
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yoonjung.

573
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Anteo.

574
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Nam Kyungtae.

575
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Why?

576
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Do you want to go back to school?

577
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Don't you regret it?

578
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's better to make money than to go once a week.

579
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's not a church without a school.

580
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Well, that could be better for you.

581
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You punk.

582
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Wait a minute.

583
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Two cell phones?

584
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yes, sir.

585
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh, cancel?

586
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yes, sir.

587
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Do you need anything?

588
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Three kimchi dumplings, four meat dumplings, and pickled radish.

589
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes, sir.

590
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'll buy it on the way.

591
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
No, it's right in front of you.

592
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Hey, I've never seen you on the phone with a celebrity.

593
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What did you say?

594
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It's canceled like a movie.

595
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm going to buy dumplings for dinner.

596
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Dumplings?

597
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
These days, our Choe Byung-nim is into dumplings.

598
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Hey, I'm going to Incheon to buy dumplings.

599
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
How are you all doing?

600
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Everyone?

601
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I don't know.

602
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

603
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That punk went to the U.S. in winter.

604
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The U.S.?

605
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I was hit by a punk like you.

606
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Would you be embarrassed to go to school?

607
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
By the way, how's your friend doing?

608
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That punk.

609
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That punk?

610
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't know.

611
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm sure you're doing well.

612
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Anyway, let's go together to buy dumplings.

613
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Let's talk about future plans on the way.

614
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Plans?

615
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Of course, punk.

616
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Shouldn't there be something when you're leaving?

617
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I haven't really thought about it yet.

618
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm going to Incheon.

619
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm going to Incheon.

620
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm going to Incheon.

621
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm going to Incheon.

622
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm going to Incheon.

623
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm going to Incheon.

624
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm going to Incheon.

625
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm going to Incheon.

626
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm going to Incheon.

627
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Hey, No Se-hong!

628
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Come out of someone else's school.

629
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You're not going to sleep, are you?

630
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Let's go together.

631
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hey, run!

632
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh, my God.

633
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh, my God.

634
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, my God.

635
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh, my God.

636
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Follow me.

637
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Hey, let's go together.

638
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm really going.

639
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Hey, what if I really go?

640
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Hey, I'm going to sleep.

641
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Hey, No Se-hong!

642
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Let's go together.

643
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Let's go together.

644
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Let's go together.

645
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Let's go together.

646
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Let's go together.

647
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Let's go together.

648
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Let's go together.

649
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Let's go together.

650
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Let's go together.

651
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Let's go together.

652
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Let's go together.

653
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Let's go together.

Let's go together.

659
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Let's go together.
