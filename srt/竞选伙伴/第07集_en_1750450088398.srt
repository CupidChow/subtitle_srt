00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
A'tå…¥Jim Min-geum vs Tae-il Jang

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,640
olor

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,360
Fucking hit you

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,420
iff you are crazy

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,040
You can't be caught

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,680
Pull up

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,980
Why

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,980
Hey, you're a penalty.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,980
What?

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,280
You're a loser.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,580
Let go of me.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,780
Seriously.

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,880
You'll be eliminated from K-League right away.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,580
You know that?

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,380
Okay, I'll stop.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,780
You bastard.

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,980
The Yangwon University's personality controversy.

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,480
The views have gone up.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,780
This is worse than Park Jihoon's.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,480
Park Jihoon's low score is not a big problem.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,680
He has only 3-character ID, so he doesn't have any water proof.

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,480
But Yangwon University's case is a little different.

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,680
It's directly related to the disliked.

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,480
He had a personality controversy last year.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,680
That's right.

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,980
The camp atmosphere over there is broken.

27
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,680
That's right.

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,480
This is how you react right away.

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,680
You crazy bastard.

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Did you think about it enough?

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Yes.

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,680
I thought about it all day yesterday.

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Yeah?

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,680
I knew you two were close.

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,680
Is it because of that?

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
No.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,680
It has nothing to do with that.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,680
I'm not going to help them even if I go out.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Whether you help or not, it's your decision, not mine.

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,680
You're doing this on the day of the vote, aren't you?

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm sorry, but I don't think it's right for me to swear at each other and fight like this.

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Hey!

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Who do you like?

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Who do you like?

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:28,680
There are things to do even if you don't like it when you vote.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,680
I see.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Don't shake up other kids and get out quietly.

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:47,680
But, actually, other than me...

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Yeah.

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Yeah.

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
Everyone worked hard.

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,680
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Go.

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Let's go.

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,680
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Did you check what you sent in the group chat?

60
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Everyone doesn't have time to guess today, so get a hold of yourself.

61
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Smile, smile.

62
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Put on your tie.

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
No, this...

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Check the clothes of the person next to you.

65
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Be sure to do it.

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Let's guess the choreography.

67
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Ready, set, go.

68
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Youngji.

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Half of Yoo Hee-jun and Hapcheongbu are out of the post.

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
Why?

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Isn't it a principle?

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,680
They're tired of it because they keep pretending to be old.

73
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
That's good.

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,680
I was going to do that because I was ahead of Nam Kyungtae, but in the end...

75
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
No, how about Park Jihoon?

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Have you met him?

77
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
No.

78
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,680
I saw it earlier, and it was caught on the map.

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Oh, my God.

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
From the right.

81
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Ready, set, go.

82
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Youngjin's pride.

83
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Jang Won-tae.

84
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
You know all the text messages I got yesterday are nonsense, right?

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes.

86
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Yeah.

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Anyway, it's going.

88
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,680
I was so happy to be with you for a few days.

89
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,680
I've never been this happy in my 18 years of life.

90
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
What?

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,680
Thank you.

92
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Oh, my God.

93
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

95
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Why are you crying?

96
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Anyway.

97
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
If you have a voice, you're going to die.

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Okay?

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Yes.

100
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm going to lead the cheering today, so don't look so tired.

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Jihoon will be here soon, so don't worry too much.

102
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Yes.

103
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Let's go to my house and eat jokbal after we're done.

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Yes.

105
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Let's cheer up.

106
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Let's cheer up.

107
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm going to go.

108
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Kiho, Kiho, Jang Won-tae, Youngjin's representative.

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Kiho, Kiho, Jang Won-tae, Jang Won-tae is the best.

110
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Youngjin's pride.

111
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Jang Won-tae.

112
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Youngjin's representative.

113
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Jang Won-tae.

114
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Haejangdae's love.

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Jang Won-tae.

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
The one to be chosen.

117
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Kiho, Kiho, Jang Won-tae.

118
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
The end.

119
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Thank you.

120
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
I'll do my best.

121
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
I'll do my best.

122
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,680
We only think about the future of our fans.

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,680
You know that marriage is a fight over the butt, right?

124
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Yes.

125
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:53,520
Let's go,

126
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,680
Vice Chairman candidate, No Se-hoon.

127
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Are you ready to give this once for school?

128
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Yes.

129
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,680
I played a game, is the ice bucket okay?

130
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Yes, it's okay.

131
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,680
I'll finish this and go back to the game.

132
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Let's all together.

133
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:24,680
One, two, three.

134
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,680
This has been Running Man's No Se-hoon.

135
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Please pick one.

136
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,680
You come here.

137
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:55,680
If you sit down quickly, we'll go again.

138
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,680
I'm going to die.

139
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Kang Ji-won.

140
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Kang Ji-won, say a word.

141
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Say a word.

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:35,680
If you don't pick number one, I'll kill you.

143
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,680
From some point, the club's activities have been cut off

144
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,680
as an extension of the school's plan.

145
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,680
School, academy, revenge room.

146
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Our students who are only playing with the school's books.

147
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,680
We couldn't stand it any longer.

148
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
That's right.

149
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
For a healthy hobby and entertainment culture,

150
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
our second?

151
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,680
We will support the school to establish a variety of clubs

152
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,680
and support the operating costs.

153
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Let's show that people who play well are good at studying.

154
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Let's show it.

155
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Ha Yu-kyung, academy.

156
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Let's all together.

157
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,680
One, two, three.

158
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Let's all cheer up.

159
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,680
One, two, three.

160
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Let's all cheer up.

161
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,680
One, two, three.

162
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Let's all cheer up.

163
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:10,680
Let's all cheer up.

164
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Let's all cheer up.

165
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Hey, Park Ji-woong.

166
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
What happened?

167
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Nothing, right?

168
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,680
They told me to come back after the election.

169
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Did you get rid of it?

170
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Yeah.

171
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Don't worry.

172
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,680
It's not like they care about it.

173
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Really?

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Of course.

175
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
They don't have any other choice.

176
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Who would believe that?

177
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,680
What are you doing?

178
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Didn't you get a penalty for not being able to go to the election?

179
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Fuck.

180
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Yu Yu-jin said he got out of it.

181
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Why would he be doing that?

182
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Yeah.

183
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Hey, Park Ji-woong.

184
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Just trust Won Dae-young and go.

185
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Won Dae-young will sort everything out when it's over.

186
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Yeah.

187
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Stop being down.

188
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Hey, listen.

189
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Yeah, okay.

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Let's go, fuck.

191
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Yeah, let's go.

192
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,680
What is this?

193
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Yeah.

194
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
This is it.

195
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:54,680
Let's go.

196
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Come here.

197
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Stop it.

198
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Hey, you.

199
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Don't come.

200
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Don't come.

201
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
Hey, you.

202
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Don't come.

203
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Hey, you.

204
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Don't come.

205
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Hey, you.

206
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Don't come.

207
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Hey, you.

208
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
Don't come.

209
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Hey, you.

210
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Don't come.

211
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Hey, you.

212
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Don't come.

213
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Hey, you.

214
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Don't come.

215
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Hey, Park Ji-won.

216
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
You guys are like a cafe.

217
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Hey, why do you keep touching them?

218
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
They're so sensitive.

219
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
You guys are sensitive.

220
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
We're sensitive too.

221
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Hey, let's stop.

222
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Stop it, you guys.

223
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Hey, let's just stay still.

224
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Don't keep bothering me.

225
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
Hey, you guys are just being nice.

226
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,680
Is this a court?

227
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Hey, who are you to be sensitive?

228
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,680
Can't you see we're hurt?

229
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,680
You guys are just fighting.

230
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
You guys are fighting.

231
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
You guys are the ones who threw the ice cream.

232
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
It's not a fight, it's a mistake.

233
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Tell me if you know what it is.

234
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Stop, stop.

235
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
I told you to stop, stop.

236
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Hey, what are you doing?

237
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Hey, stop it.

238
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Hey, hey.

239
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
You are my dream.

240
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
I want to be your dream.

241
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Hey, you guys are really.

242
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
What are you doing?

243
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
Hey, stop fighting.

244
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Stop it.

245
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Hey, hey, hey.

246
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Stop it!

247
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Hey, stop it!

248
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Hey, stop it!

249
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Stop it!

250
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Stop it!

251
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
I'm going crazy.

252
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
It doesn't matter.

253
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Stop it!

254
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
What are you doing?

255
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Yes, Seoyeon!

256
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Seoyeon!

257
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Yes, Lee Minho!

258
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
It's a party, you punk!

259
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Hey, Park Geunjae!

260
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,680
You're dead today.

261
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Hey, you go.

262
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Are you crazy?

263
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,680
You're not even up there, you punk!

264
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
Catch him.

265
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Hey, stop it!

266
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,680
We've entered this war for our own various reasons,

267
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
but the election final,

268
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,680
the reason is not that important anymore.

269
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
We had to win no matter what,

270
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,680
and in order to do that,

271
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
we had to die in this battlefield,

272
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,680
and we couldn't even give up.

273
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Yes, the election D-Day, the last round has ended.

274
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,680
The two camps, which have deepened their emotional ties,

275
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,680
have finally reached a physical conflict.

276
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
With the introduction of the election committee,

277
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,680
they were able to avoid a dangerous situation.

278
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
At the end of the election,

279
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
seeing various personal attacks and rumours,

280
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,680
and fake news,

281
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
among the six students,

282
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
the movement that rejects the vote,

283
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
namely, the students of the party,

284
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
is increasing again.

285
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Now, we'll meet at the polling station.

286
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I was Go Youngchan of YJBS.

287
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Good job.

288
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Guys, let's walk on the silence.

289
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
Good job.

290
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Who told you that you wanted to be a school teacher?

291
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
Me.

292
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Jungah?

293
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Yes.

294
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Never.

295
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Never be a school teacher.

296
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Learn the skills, Jungah.

297
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Yes.

298
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Oh, teacher.

299
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Yes.

300
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Isn't that a police car?

301
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Yes.

302
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
Good job, Yoon Soyoung.

303
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
Good job.

304
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Give me your ID.

305
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
It's a resident report.

306
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
What is it?

307
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Look.

308
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Oh, it's a police car.

309
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
What is it?

310
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Oh, you came because of the resident report, right?

311
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
No, we're all done now.

312
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
No, it's not that.

313
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
With the right to attack.

314
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Attack?

315
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Who is it?

316
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
It's a man.

317
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Isn't it Heechan?

318
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
There's someone.

319
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
Who?

320
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
It's a big guy.

321
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Oh, I'm so stupid.

322
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
So what?

323
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
What?

324
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,680
First, close your SNS account.

325
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Just sell your cell phone and the computer at home to me.

326
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
No, I don't know.

327
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I don't even know what that account is.

328
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Hey, I'm not even on SNS.

329
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,680
I'm sorry, but I've checked my IP.

330
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
It's a new account.

331
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Oh, my God.

332
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,680
I'll replace your cell phone.

333
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
So give it to me quickly.

334
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Hey, Park Sang-hyun.

335
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,680
You're a fucking high school kid.

336
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Fuck.

337
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Hey, Park Sang-hyun.

338
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Hey.

339
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
Are you threatening me?

340
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
So what?

341
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Are you going to do everything?

342
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
You're a fucking bastard.

343
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Huh?

344
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Oh, fuck.

345
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Hey, Wang Jae-young.

346
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Do you want to keep hitting me?

347
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Oh, fuck.

348
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Oh, you fucking bastards.

349
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Hey, come on.

350
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Come on, you bastards.

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
Come on, you fuckers.

352
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Hey, you.

Come on, you.

359
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Come on, you.

360
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Come on, you.

361
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
Come on, you.

362
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Come on, you.

363
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Come on, you.

364
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Come on, you.

365
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Come on, you.

Come on, you.

367
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
Come on, you.

368
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Come on, you.

369
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Come on, you.

370
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Come on, you.

371
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Come on, you.

372
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Come on, you.

373
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Come on, you.

374
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Come on, you.

375
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Come on, you.

376
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Come on, you.

377
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Come on, you.

378
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Come on, you.

379
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Come on, you.

380
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Hey.

381
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Hey.

382
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Kang Jaewon.

383
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Stop it.

384
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Hey.

385
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Hey.

386
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Hey, your phone.

387
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Hey, look for the video.

388
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Damn it.

389
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Yes, sir.

390
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
There's a problem right now.

391
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
You take care of this.

392
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Okay.

393
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Yes, sir.

394
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Yes, sir.

395
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Guys.

396
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Hey.

397
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
I'll send you a lawyer soon.

398
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Just say you did it while playing.

399
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Are you kidding me?

400
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Good luck.

401
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
I told you not to do it.

402
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
You bastard.

403
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
What's this?

404
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Hey.

405
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
What is it?

406
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Hey, did something happen to him?

407
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
What's going on?

408
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Kang Jaewon.

409
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
You're here because of him, right?

410
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Are you Kang Jaewon?

411
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Go quickly.

412
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
I'm so embarrassed.

413
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
He's so confident.

414
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Let's go.

415
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Go in, everyone.

416
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I'll go now.

417
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Please come out.

418
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I'll do well.

419
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Please come out.

420
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,680
The last result of the survey came out.

421
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
It's a little advantageous for us,

422
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,680
but we can't be relieved because Oh Cha-beom is on the inside.

423
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
It's okay.

424
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,680
We have the last speech left, so let's press it with that.

425
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Why are we in the election now?

426
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
What did we do wrong in the past?

427
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
It's not time to argue about that.

428
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
If we win,

429
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
it doesn't matter at all.

430
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
It doesn't matter at all.

433
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,680
The friends and teachers who have helped so far,

434
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
I only trust them.

435
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Do you understand?

436
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Yes.

437
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Yes.

438
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
It's all over.

439
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
It's over in two hours.

440
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,680
We'll laugh in two hours.

441
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Let's go.

442
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Let's go in and get the signature.

443
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Yes.

444
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Yes.

445
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
You originally told me to come to the election with the baseball team.

446
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
But why did you come to me?

447
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Brother,

448
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,680
do you know the difference between lead and want?

449
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Life-saving or favorite?

450
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Did you hear that from Jun-gyu?

451
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
No, I didn't.

452
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
I told you that.

453
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
What?

454
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
What do you mean?

455
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,680
The one we met in front of the convenience store.

456
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Did you just happen to be Woo Young?

457
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Yangwon University is already looking for a vice president and coming to the election.

458
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
I was curious.

459
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
What kind of guy Yangwon University picked.

460
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
You're not going to tell me, are you?

461
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
No.

462
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Why?

463
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Do you regret it?

464
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
No.

465
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
I don't regret it.

466
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Yeah.

467
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Don't regret it.

468
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
That's what losers do.

469
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Loser.

470
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,680
There are kids who have been treated as losers.

471
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I won't be able to say anything from tomorrow.

472
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Yes, brother.

473
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,680
This election was the best competition ever.

474
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,680
There were people who were too much and made others blush.

475
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,680
But your passion is the student's school owner.

476
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,680
I think it's a practice of democracy that makes the people the owner of the country.

477
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm glad on the one hand.

478
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,680
The best thing is to find the best thing and support it.

479
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:06,680
But even if you don't like the two candidates, you need the courage to choose the best one.

480
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:16,680
With that mindset, you will be the foundation for supporting our society and maintaining it in the world you will meet in the future.

481
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Students, you all did a great job today.

482
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
You did a great job.

483
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Then, in the order of the previous election, let's listen to the speech of student No. 2 Yangwon University.

484
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
A big round of applause.

485
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Youngjin's leader.

486
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Yangwon University.

487
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Youngjin's future.

488
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Yangwon University.

489
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Youngjin's hope.

490
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Yangwon University.

491
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Youngjin.

492
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Hello.

493
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Hello.

494
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,680
I'm Yangwon University, the candidate for the chairman of the No. 2 Law.

495
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:09,680
First of all, I would like to thank the two vice-chairmen, the friends of the choir, the teachers and the seniors who respect me.

496
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,680
I will live with the support and good words you have shown me so far.

497
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,680
The pledge we made is that all students should come out first and the students should be the ones who are for the students.

498
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,680
In order to do that, we tried to give you a little bit of advice.

499
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,680
The notes you have received for the past month, they are in this notebook that I am holding right now.

500
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,680
This notebook is a kind of O-Dap notebook to solve the problems of the future with a better method.

501
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Through this O-Dap notebook, we will try to send a 100-point score to both me and you.

502
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Thank you.

503
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:11,680
I apologize on behalf of the students and teachers for criticizing the other candidate for the past few days and making the school's honor go to waste.

504
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm really sorry.

505
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Especially, I think that the personal attacks and proactive actions of the students of our camp were a disgrace and a disgrace that cannot be tolerated.

507
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Although the students of Nam Gyeongtae did something personal, I couldn't stop the student's fault as a senior and a leader of a camp.

508
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:03,680
And I will make sure that Nam Gyeongtae, who has dropped the school and the students' honor to the ground, is punished and punished.

509
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,680
I will never close my eyes again because I'm on our side.

510
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:16,680
And through this, we will draw out the division and distrust in our school and set the school's period right.

511
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Please trust our Yangwon University. Please vote for candidate 2. Thank you, everyone.

512
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm so happy.

513
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Did you plan all that? You're talking to the principal, right?

514
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Yangwon University is such a bad guy. I'm so pissed off that I forgot it.

515
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Hey, aren't you planning all that?

516
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
But he's crying. Look at him.

517
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Hey, he's crying.

518
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
He's so crazy.

519
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
Hey, where are you going?

520
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Mr. Ha.

521
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,680
No, you can't. You can't just let it go like this.

522
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,680
I hate violence the most.

523
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I'm really sorry. Please forgive candidate 2.

524
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Please.

525
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,680
I will scold you so much that this won't happen again.

526
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

527
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Stop it, mother.

528
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
This won't solve your problem.

529
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Look at him. He's just trying to kill people.

530
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
You bastard!

531
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,680
What did you do to deserve this?

532
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Apologize now!

533
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Let's go.

534
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm sorry!

535
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
I'm sorry.

536
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Please!

538
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Look at his face and tell me.

539
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Yangwon.

541
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
I'm sorry.

542
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
I'm sorry.

543
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Next, let's hear the final speech of candidate 1, President Park Sanghyun.

544
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Park Sanghyun, fighting!

545
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I love you, Sanghyun!

546
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Everybody, Sanghyun!

547
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I love you, candidate 1!

548
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Everybody, candidate 1!

549
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
I love you, Sanghyun!

550
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Everybody, Sanghyun!

551
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Fighting!

552
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Fighting!

553
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Hello.

554
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
I'm candidate 1, Park Sanghyun.

555
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
I'm Park Sanghyun.

556
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
There's a saying in the Bible that says,

557
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,680
You should worship others, even if you're a big man.

558
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,680
I'm going to worship my students in the lowest position.

559
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,680
You're talking like a priest, but you don't even go to church.

560
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Hey!

561
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Hey, Park Sanghyun!

562
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,680
You're the president of the student council.

563
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Park Sanghyun, you bastard!

564
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
You bastard!

565
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Do you want to stay like this forever?

566
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Turn the screen!

567
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Wow, Park Sanghyun is so embarrassed.

568
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
He keeps getting embarrassed.

569
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
What are you doing?

570
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Someone threw an egg at Park Sanghyun.

571
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,680
Egg?

572
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
What are you doing? Go quickly.

573
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Are you okay?

574
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
I'm screwed.

575
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I have to do it while looking back.

576
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
It's embarrassing.

577
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Should I stop?

578
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
What?

579
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
I'll finish it and go down. Go.

580
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
You're going to stop?

581
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Come all the way here?

582
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Shut up and go down quickly.

583
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
It's so embarrassing right now.

584
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Brother.

585
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Hey, be quiet.

586
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Be quiet.

587
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Be quiet.

588
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
What are you doing?

589
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
What's going on?

590
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
You think your senior's mental is out, right?

591
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Hey!

592
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Hey!

593
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Hey!

594
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Hey!

595
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Hey!

596
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Hey!

597
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Hey!

598
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Hey!

599
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Hey!

600
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Hey!

601
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Hey!

602
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
Hey!

603
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Hey!

604
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Hey!

605
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Hey!

606
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Hey!

607
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,680
There's nothing to be surprised about.

608
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
I'm sorry.

609
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,680
I'll tell you what I really wanted to say.

610
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,680
First of all, our camp friends who helped us this time.

611
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
You all did a great job.

612
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
I know.

613
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,680
I'm so fake and I'm so fake.

614
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,680
But thank you so much for everything.

615
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
I'm sorry.

616
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
It's okay, right?

617
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,680
It's okay.

618
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,680
What's the situation right now?

619
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,680
It's okay.

620
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,680
The first time I brought Jung-hee to our team was because she was the top student in the school.

621
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,680
That's how I could get some support from the teachers.

622
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,680
If I had to say it, I used Jung-hee.

623
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
I'm sorry, Jung-hee.

624
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,680
I had fun with you in this election.

625
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
I learned a lot again.

626
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Hey, An Tae-oh.

627
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,680
What do you think of that argument?

628
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,680
I think he used Yangwon-dae's operation, which was donated to Nam Kyung-tae, to gather the evidence that was negative.

629
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
What do you mean?

630
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,680
Because Yangwon-dae drew a knife of justice and justice, Park Sang-hyun took it as a reflection and gratitude.

631
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Oh, a reflection and gratitude?

632
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Why did he do that?

633
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,680
He knows that it's more humane and cool.

634
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
That's great.

635
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
Huh?

636
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Park Sang-hyun is a natural narcissist.

637
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,680
On the other hand, Yangwon-dae is a perfect sociopath.

638
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Oh, you're so noisy.

639
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
Hey, you go to your room and see.

640
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
And actually,

641
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
on my birthday,

642
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I was on the live broadcast at my house.

643
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Yeah, that's right.

644
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
The rumor of a drinking party.

645
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
That's true.

646
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
It's not the first time for a drinking party like that.

647
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
I've done it a few times before.

648
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
I'm sorry to have deceived everyone.

649
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,680
I'm sorry to Jung-hee and Se-hoon, who were invited for no reason.

650
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
I'm sorry.

651
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,680
And the crazy Ji-hoon's record chart scandal yesterday.

652
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
The person who posted it on the school cafe's account.

653
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
That's me.

654
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,680
I recorded it without Se-hoon's knowledge.

655
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm really sorry, Ji-hoon.

656
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
I was too cheap and unruly.

657
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
But Ji-hoon, don't get me wrong.

658
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Se-hoon didn't even know I was recording it.

659
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
I was going to keep it a secret until the end.

660
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,680
It's no different from using Se-hoon.

661
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
I don't have a brother.

662
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
Brother.

663
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,680
Do you know what it's really embarrassing?

664
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
What?

665
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Just confess.

666
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,680
What are you talking about?

667
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
I did a drinking party on your birthday.

668
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
That's all a lie.

669
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Crazy.

670
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
You're not going down fast?

671
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,680
I'm not.

672
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
You're a fake.

673
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
You're bluffing.

674
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
I have to break all that.

675
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
If you want to win.

676
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
What are you talking about?

677
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
bluffing.

678
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Yes.

679
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
It's better than losing.

680
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Admit it all and let go.

681
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Are you crazy again?

682
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
Yes.

683
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Do it like that.

684
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Like now.

685
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
If you're not crazy.

686
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
You can't win this election.

687
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
The election is over like this.

688
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
It's all because of me.

689
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
Not anyone else.

690
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,680
As a representative.

691
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
Please scold me.

692
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
For the rest of the year.

693
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
With the heart of apology.

694
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
I'll volunteer for the school.

695
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
I'll be a good student.

696
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
I'll be a good student.

697
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
I'll be a good student.

698
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
I'll be a good student.

699
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
I'll be a good student.

700
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
Guys.

701
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Don't fight.

702
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
It's all over.

703
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
Guys, don't fight.

704
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
It's all over.

705
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Don't fight.

706
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
It's all over.

707
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Don't fight.

708
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
It's all over.

709
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Don't fight.

710
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
That's it.

711
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Yangwon University's final speech.

712
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
The final statement of Kwak Sang-hyun.

713
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Both personalities and words were different.

714
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
But the intention was clear.

715
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
Today.

716
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
I'm going to win.

717
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
I'm going to win.

718
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
I'm going to win.

719
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
I'm going to win.

720
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
I'm going to win.

721
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
I'm going to win.

722
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
I'm going to win.

723
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
I'm going to win.

724
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm going to win.

725
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
I'm going to win.

726
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
I'm going to win.

727
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,680
I'm going to win.

728
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
I'm going to win.

729
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
I'm going to win.

730
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
I'm going to win.

731
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
I'm going to win.

732
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,680
I'm going to win.

733
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm going to win.

734
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
I'm going to win.

735
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
I'm going to win.

736
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
I'm going to win.

737
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm going to win.

738
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
I'm going to win.

739
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
I'm going to win.

740
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
I'm going to win.

741
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm going to win.

742
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
I'm going to win.

743
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
