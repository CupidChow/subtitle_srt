17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,270
Sister Xia.

18
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,510
You see, in front of everyone,

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,910
you didn't save bro Zheng's face at all.

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,760
Right, guys?

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,160
Yeah.

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,550
If bro Zheng was bad,

23
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,645
would you marry him?

24
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,760
How could we have
our groom today if that happened?

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,800
That's why people call
our Xiao Xi a fairy.

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,680
She bears the burden of the world!

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,480
- Forget it.
- No way!

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,080
What do we call this?
Earning happiness at all costs!

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,910
Exactly!

30
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:11,830

<i>In This Ignorant Stage of Life,
Loving Someone Is a Kind of Happiness</i>

33
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,550
I'm not caring about this family?

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,750
It's not that I don't come home.

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,910
Right.

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,720
You are home once per month,
two days each time.

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,830
How do you take care of this family?

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,830
All you do is
playing with those silly stones!

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,630
Daddy.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,630
- I miss you.
- Finally, you're home!

41
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,190
Dad!

42
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,630
Look.

43
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,320
Look what I brought home for you.

44
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,550
You did? What's that?

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,600
Stones.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,630
Stones?

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,830
- Where did you find them?
- What time is it?

48
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,440
- Have you finished your homework?
- I picked them in the desert.

49
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,880
Have you done your homework?

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,600
She's just come home, let her rest.

51
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,630
Rest now,

52
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,030
and she has to live on air later.

53
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,190
How is the tutor?

54
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,750
Beautiful?

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,320
Pretty good.

56
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,440
He has a clear mind and is very familiar with
the corresponding examination skills.

57
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,960
He also has a thorough understanding of
previous years' College Entrance Examination routines.

58
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,470
Beautiful?

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,440
Oh.

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,160
Right, mom.

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,600
What's wrong?

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,630
I asked him to give me
an extra lesson today.

63
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,030
I'm about to discuss it with you.

64
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,110
Okay.

65
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,880
This is the first time you
think so highly of your teacher.

66
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,240
Look at this picture
I took while collecting folk songs.

67
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,257
Wow!

68
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:31,440
My photography skill
has improved greatly right?

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,110
You did great!

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,240
When I took this picture,
the wind blew heavily.

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,470
Blowing at my face...

72
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,630
What are you looking at? Don't go too far.

73
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,270
I don't care if you
have neither knowledge nor skill,

74
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
but Xiao Xi is in Grade 12 now.

75
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,470
She doesn't have time
to look at those things of yours!

76
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,600
Can't I talk to my daughter?

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,000
What to talk about with you anyway?

78
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,160
This...

79
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,720
Can you talk more properly?

80
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,320
Hello aunty.

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,390
Quickly.

82
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,880
Your teacher is here, go study!

83
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,440
Okay.

84
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,320
- Try your best.
- Yes.

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,240
Let's go.

86
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,320
I'm only at home once per month

87
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,830
and you just told Xiao Xi
to come back to her room quickly,

88
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,110
can't you let us talk a little?

89
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,390
She is entering
an important phase of Grade 12.

90
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
She doesn't have time to speak with you!

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,230
You can't do anything well.

92
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,070
You!

93
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,720
You will mislead Xiao Xi,
do you know that?

94
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,510
I'm teaching Xiao Xi more
about geography

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,230
and Xin Jiang's traditions,
what is inappropriate here?

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,670
You just care about benefits,

97
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,550
always control Xiao Xi

98
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,600
and make her stressed!

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,880
What do I do that makes her so stressful?

100
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,000
To be admitted to a university,
what else do they look at besides the score?

101
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
- Moreover.
- What do you want to do?

102
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,720
Isn't that the result of my teaching?

103
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,640
The one yesterday.

104
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,390
You want her

105
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,880
to study that geography thing of yours
and can't earn any money

106
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,920
and go digging stones with you?

107
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,270
She's a girl!

108
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,390
Firstly,

109
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,640
I will tell you this,

110
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,390
Geography is a mighty science,

111
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,230
it's not about digging stones as you said!

112
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,000
Secondly,

113
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,880
I approve of everything

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,720
that Xiao Xi likes!

115
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,720
I don't want Xiao Xi
to know nothing but only studying!

116
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,110
What is your right to say that I'm wrong!

117
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,510
Have you done anything for this family?

118
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,790
Focus.

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,110
Wanting Xiao Xi to study is harming her?

120
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,230
Where am I wrong?

121
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,510
Have you done anything for this family?

122
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,440
What else except facing those stones?

123
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,390
What's wrong with
researching these stones?

124
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,950
Those are worth a fortune!

125
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,920
Have you ever
tried counting these all these years?

126
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,390
You are just talking

127
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,640
like you care about this family!

128
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,070
Don't just sit there.

129
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,320
I...

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,640
Okay, you're always reasonable!

131
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,320
Everything is right coming from you!

132
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,110
You're almighty, you're great!

133
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,640
Why can't I say?

134
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,070
Am I wrong?

135
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,160
It seems your father went out,
do you need to...

136
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,720
It's okay.

137
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,670
I'm used to it.

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,440
He will come back soon.

139
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,510
Oh my.

140
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,640
Isn't this our Zheng?

141
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,230
Don't try to be close to me.

142
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,600
Last time, you took 3 bottles of Coke
from the internet cafe.

143
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,070
That's 7.5 yuan, give me the money.

144
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,270
Zheng.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,390
Don't regard us as outsiders.

146
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,480
That internet cafe belongs to bro Da Fei.

147
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
We're all bro Da Fei's brothers.

148
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
What's wrong with taking some bottles?

149
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,760
Okay.

150
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Let me talk to bro Da Fei then.

151
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,790
Zheng. Zheng. Zheng.

152
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,040
Just some pennies,
you don't have to tell bro Da Fei,

153
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,230
that's not good.

154
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,760
Then give back the money.

155
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,480
Jiang Zheng Han,

156
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,110
we are all out on the street for a living.

157
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,070
We still have to
meet each other frequently,

158
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,000
don't make things worse.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,040
Who's out on the street?

160
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,950
Don't pretend.

161
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,350
We all know each other well.

162
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,790
Some tiny things, some tiny problems.

163
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,160
you're talking nonsense with me here.

164
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm just a student doing a part-time job.

165
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,510
You tell bro Da Fei yourself.

166
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,880
Okay, okay.

167
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,880
You're great.

168
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,760
Give me the money.

169
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,640
Study slacker!

170
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,550
Getting along with this kind of people.

171
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,350
Give me the change.

172
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,230
I don't have any change.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,040
Pay by WeChat.

174
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,670
Damn!

175
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,390
We have to teach him a lesson.

176
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,510
- Remember to take it for me.
- Okay.

177
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,550
My shoes.

178
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,880
What are you looking at?

179
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,760
You spitted on my shoes.

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
So what?

181
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,830
No problem.

182
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,000
Where are you going?

183
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,040
Defiant, aren't you?

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,390
Who did you glare at?

185
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,510
Jiang Ming No.1 High School?

186
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,760
Don't pull my shirt.

187
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,550
I will tell my teacher.

188
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,400
Give me money.

189
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,470
Money. My money.

190
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,520
My money!

191
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,350
That's great, you are such a rich kid.

192
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,710
- Take off the other one.
- A Long.

193
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,230
This is my friend.

194
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,880
Save me some face.

195
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Moreover,

196
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,230
you will be in deep trouble
if the school makes it more serious.

197
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,320
Zheng, what are you talking about?

198
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,640
Wasn't that you who told me
to play with your friend

199
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,760
for fun?

200
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,640
How can I take his money for real.

201
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,280
Jiang Zheng Han, you bastard!

202
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,080
What are you talking about?

203
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,760
Okay, don't be mad.

204
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,520
Don't be mad, don't take it for real.

205
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,110
Just friends kidding with each other.

206
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Yours, take it.

207
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,080
You have to respect our Zheng at school.

208
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,320
Got it?

209
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,230
Why did you do that?

210
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,230
Why?

211
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,840
You're a student, right?

212
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,760
I set you up, didn't you see?

213
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,960
Okay.

214
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,030
I will tell bro Da Fei about this.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,880
Jiang Zheng Han, don't you dare!

216
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,710
Who do you think you are?

217
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,910
Jiang Zheng Han.

218
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Don't come here.

219
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,710
Stand there.

220
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,840
Stand there.

221
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,670
Stay!

222
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,670
Are you okay?

223
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Jiang Zheng Han.

224
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,910
You dared to tell those gangsters
to take my sneakers.

225
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,440
This is not over! Remember that!

226
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,308
Your shoes were robbed,
which has nothing to do with me.

227
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:28,790
You are such a study slacker, a gangster!

228
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,960
You're born stupid

229
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,790
but I haven't expected
that you were so bad.

230
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,760
Let me tell you.

231
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,670
Don't think that you can
scare me with those gangsters,

232
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,670
never!

233
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,840
You know, your class monitor
couldn't be scared that easily.

234
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,520
I'll tell my parents
to drive me every day,

235
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,910
you can't steal anything from me.

236
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,150
Just wait and see.

237
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,760
Later I will...

238
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,590
I will tell the teacher everything

239
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,520
and you will be expelled.
Stop right there!

240
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,790
What do you want?

241
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,110
Where is my uniform?

242
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,790
The school's facilities are good.

243
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,760
This is our sports area.

244
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,670
- This is what we should do.
- You have to take a rest after hard work.

245
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,440
Our school cares about
the students' results and health.

246
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,960
That's right, you see.

247
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,030
That is our basketball court.

248
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,590
Amazing.

249
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,910
Look at our trees.

250
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,670
Almost my school's age.

251
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,440
Beautiful.

252
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,640
That's because of
our students' protection.

253
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,350
That's right, one look only
and you can tell that.

254
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,670
Our Mr. Zhang
also researches about plants.

255
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,280
Teacher, this is the playground
of our Jiang Ming high school.

256
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,670
This is our senior year

257
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,110
but we always train for good health.

258
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,030
So normally we still
have much time to train.

259
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,760
Our school wants to guarantee
that we can study well

260
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,520
and be strong at the same time.

261
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,030
Fully developed.

262
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,760
- Well done.
- They are our representatives.

263
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,960
I'm their homeroom teacher.

264
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,350
Yeah.

265
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,200
Our Ministry of Education always

266
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,640
values Jiang Ming No.1
high school's development.

267
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,150
Both students and teaching quality

268
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,710
are the role model for other schools.

269
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,840
Especially in senior year,

270
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,150
health is important.

271
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,320
This training

272
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,440
is a good way to improve their health.

273
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
That's right.

274
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,350
You're right.

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
Please come this way, teacher.

276
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,080
We will lead the way

277
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,760
to our new multimedia classroom.

278
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,350
- Please be careful of the pole.
- This way, please.

279
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,670
Be careful.

280
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,280
That's right.

281
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,910
Attention, please.

282
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,400
You have to remember

283
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,150
this point.

284
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,470
This is the last time
I told you about this experiment.

285
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
You have to remember it.

286
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,840
Jiang Zheng Han.

287
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,520
Tell me.

288
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,030
What is this experiment's point?

289
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,200
Sulfur, molecular formula S.

290
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,230
Hard to dissolve in water,

291
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,000
it dissolves just a little in ethanol and ether,
easy to dissolve in sulfur dioxide.

292
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,400
Easy-to-be-burnt solid.

293
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,670
By normal eyes, it's a light yellow solid.

294
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,840
With a special smell.

295
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,440
Good.

296
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,280
Wait.

297
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,000
Why don't you wear your uniform?

298
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,670
Today, you will suffer
when meeting Mr. Zhang.

299
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,640
Jiang Zheng Han.

300
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,790
Come here.

301
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,080
Jiang Zheng Han, bring this

302
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
to Zhang Huai Wu to take a sniff

303
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,550
to wake him up.

304
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,640
That's a way for you to remember
more about sulfur.

305
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,030
Hey.

306
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,640
Oh my God, who farted?

307
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,320
Ha ha ha ha.

308
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,880
- Jiang Zheng Han
- Come here.

309
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,520
- What are you guys doing?
- Jiang Zheng Han, come here!

310
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,280
- Jiang Zheng Han, do you hear me?
- Go away quickly.

311
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,670
Please wait.

312
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,880
Let us see what's happening.

313
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,280
- Just go and deal with it.
- Please wait for me.

314
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,150
- Call Jiang Zheng Han!
- Go first.

315
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,790
Don't be so loud here!

316
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,731
I'm talking to you,
call Jiang Zheng Han out!

317
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:15,200
What are they doing?

318
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,110
They aren't students here.

319
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,350
- Please go with the leaders.
- Okay.

320
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,640
What are you doing?

321
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,880
Stop making a scene!

322
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,760
Jiang Zheng Han, come here!

323
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,520
Battle me!

324
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,280
This is a school,
what the heck are you yelling?

325
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,550
Your Jiang Zheng Han demanded our money.

326
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,440
He beat us after we ignored him.

327
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,790
I'm here for justice!

328
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,440
I'm the Dean of this school, just tell me.

329
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,670
Isn't this your school's uniform?

330
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,350
The one who beat us wore
your school's uniform.

331
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,670
- It's just a misunderstanding.
- He beat me to this!

332
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,790
Look!

333
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,880
- Look.
- That's right.

334
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,400
Keep going, please, let me handle this.

335
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,350
What's wrong?

336
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,110
- Call him here now!
- Yeah, call him!

337
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,910
Jiang Zheng Han, come here!

338
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,880
Jiang Zheng Han, come out!

339
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,280
- Give me the uniforms.
- Quickly!

340
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,440
- Quickly.
- What's this?

341
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,880
- Headmaster, this...
- Come here this instant!

342
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,760
This Jiang Zheng Han,

343
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,200
- is he our student?
- Why not?

344
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,400
Yeah, Jiang Zheng Han is our student.

345
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,011
Who is in charge of this?

346
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:08,280
Your school does have good training.

347
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,350
Call Jiang Zheng Han out.

348
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,910
Aren't you his teacher?

349
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,230
Teacher,

350
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,280
my father forced
me to study late yesterday,

351
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,840
that's why I'm so sleepy today.

352
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,670
- Zhang Huai Wu.
- Call him out this instant.

353
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,030
You, come here.

354
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,710
It wasn't me, dad.

355
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,110
Ah no, Mr. Dean.

356
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,910
Dad, you can't blame me.

357
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,670
It's not that, Mr. Zhang.

358
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,080
Yesterday I stayed up too late to study...

359
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,440
Stand aside!

360
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,790
Jiang Zheng Han.

361
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,710
Stand up!

362
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,790
Come here.

363
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,142
You dared to receive
the protection fee from others?

364
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:52,840
What's that?

365
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,234
- You even beat them.
- Money?

366
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,710
They're making a mess outside!

367
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,550
Mr. Zhang.

368
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,440
Please, let me explain.

369
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,840
Actually, last night,

370
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,110
it was like this, I...

371
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,280
What else can you explain?

372
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,320
Is this your uniform?

373
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,960
That's right.

374
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,400
They found you here.

375
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,200
Today, it was because of you,

376
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,710
our school suffers from such
an embarrassment, got that?

377
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,470
Mr. Zhang, can you just listen?

378
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,080
Say.

379
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,670
They planted a conspiracy against me.

380
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,000
Planted a conspiracy against you?

381
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,080
Then why not others?

382
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,880
Look at you!

383
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,670
You really look like someone
who beats others.

384
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,280
Mr. Zhang, this...

385
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,150
Please calm down.

386
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,710
Mr. Zhao.

387
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,400
You see, we teachers
have to be responsible

388
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,280
for these students' actions!

389
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,000
That's right.

390
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,080
That's why

391
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,520
we have to be strict this time.

392
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,590
Right.

393
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,880
Mr. Zhang.

394
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,710
I have something to report.

395
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,230
What?

396
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,030
This is Jiang Zheng Han's doing.

397
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,830
Yesterday I was robbed.

398
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,040
Chen Yi Chuan.

399
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,310
You...

400
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,950
Why did you say that?

401
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,190
Yesterday, the one who robbed me

402
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,230
was assigned by Jiang Zheng Han.

403
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,070
You see, I wasn't wrong.

404
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,680
You.

405
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,160
We should expel students like you.

406
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,400
Why don't I do that?

407
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,430
Mr. Zhao.

408
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,880
If his case affects

409
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,950
our school's bonus points,

410
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,830
your class will be
the first to be affected.

411
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,000
We will reduce
the extra points from your class.

412
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,830
No deals.

413
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,040
This...

414
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,040
Teacher.

415
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,880
Jiang Zheng Han is a study slacker.

416
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
A bad student like you,

417
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,470
this is the first time I met.

418
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,520
Jiang Zheng Han,don't you feel ashamed
when facing your parents?

419
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,470
Do you think you are
worth all the hard work?

420
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,400
- Teacher, Jiang Zheng Han...
- Enough, Chen Yi Chuan.

421
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,230
Fine.

422
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,560
If that is how you see me,

423
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,400
I don't have anything else to say,
let it be then.

424
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Sorry for the trouble.

425
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,640
I'm sorry.

426
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,000
What are you doing? Come back here!

427
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,400
What is that attitude?

428
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,430
Sir. Sir.

429
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,110
He didn't respect the elders!
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>

430
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,280
Don't be mad, please.
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>

431
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,900
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>

432
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,880
Xiao Xi, you've finally come.

433
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,920
I can't believe Jiang Zheng Han
is that kind of person.

434
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,920
He isn't.

435
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,070
How do you know?

436
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,710
Bro Zheng, are you alright?

437
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,470
Bro Zheng, were you expelled?

438
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,590
Bro Zheng, you only
have to talk to that old man properly.

439
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,950
Just apologize to him sincerely

440
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,470
and all will be okay, trust me.

441
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,640
Listen to me.

442
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,350
Listen.

443
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,880
Xia, say something!

444
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,950
Jiang Zheng Han.

445
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,830
What's wrong?

446
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,680
I'm

447
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
this class's monitor.

448
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,520
I can't ignore my fellow classmate.

449
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,590
Don't leave.

450
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,400
- Jiang Zheng Han.
- You can't go!

451
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,880
Jiang Zheng Han,

452
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,710
you told those gangsters
to rob my thing,

453
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,760
and now you affect our class's record.

454
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,310
You have to apologize to me

455
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,800
and this class!

456
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
After so many years,

457
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,880
this is the first time
I met a student like you!

458
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,760
Jiang Zheng Han, don't you feel ashamed
when facing your parents?

459
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,350
Don't you feel sorry

460
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,800
to all your hard work these years?

461
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,590
Bro Zheng! Bro Zheng!

462
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,920
- What's are you doing, Jiang Zheng Han!
- Chen Yi Chuan!

463
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
What are you doing, Jiang Zheng Han!
- Jiang Zheng Han!

464
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,920
- Jiang Zheng Han!
- Do you dare to tell the story of yesterday?

465
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,350
I, I don't want to talk with you!

466
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,110
Dead last!

467
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,880
- Jiang Zheng Han!
- Chen Yi Chuan!

468
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,430
Can you talk properly?

469
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,680
Stop talking!

470
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,830
What else to say anyway?

471
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,430
You're on his side.

472
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,590
Chen Yi Chuan,

473
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,830
you are the class's monitor,

474
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,680
stop being silly, okay?

475
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,950
Xia Lin Xi, you're a class monitor too,

476
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,520
but you chose to support that troublemaker!

477
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,230
You definitely got benefits from him.

478
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,040
The list of bonus points is shortened.

479
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,230
- You should leave your slot.
- Shh!

480
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,190
Chen Yi Chuan,

481
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,830
before you know perfectly what happened,

482
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,310
you chose to make a mess!

483
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,470
So who is the troublemaker here?

484
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,400
Stop, bro Zheng, listen.

485
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,640
Calm down, please!

486
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,470
Please, wait for me, bro Zheng!

487
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,920
Hey!

488
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,760
The number you
have called is not available,

489
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,160
please call again later.

490
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,110
Sorry.

491
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,160
Where are you? Why don't you explain?

492
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,880
Something's wrong?

493
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,590
Gosh.

494
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,800
Xiao Chuan, what happened yesterday?

495
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,430
Were you hurt?

496
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,400
I'm okay, they didn't do anything.

497
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,040
That's great, at least you're not hurt.

498
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,520
Chen Yi Chuan,

499
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,350
do you see that clearly? You...

500
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
How could bro Zheng
tell people to rob things from you?

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,310
That's impossible!

502
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,520
What do you mean?

503
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
Didn't Chen Yi Chuan say

504
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,350
- that was Jiang Zheng Han?
- You...

505
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,000
Right?

506
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,040
Let me tell you this,

507
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,310
bro Zheng is not that kind of person!

508
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,950
Right? How could bro Zheng do that?

509
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,110
Stop it, Zhang!

510
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,950
That's just your feeling,

511
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,040
but we have proofs.

512
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Chen the second, nothing else to say now,

513
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,430
I'm on your side!

514
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,230
But

515
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,760
you said you
went home bare feet yesterday.

516
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,160
You are!

517
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,040
Say who? Who walked bare foot?

518
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,590
Your family!

519
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,110
Let me tell you this, Feng Tian Jun,

520
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,710
if bro Zheng is expelled,

521
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,920
I...

522
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,920
Just wait and be the dead last!

523
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,950
I...

524
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,880
Who have I pissed off this time?

525
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,800
You wait,

526
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,230
let see how
I will handle that Jiang Zheng Han.

527
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,680
Hey, what's that play?

528
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,520
Let me show you!

529
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,230
- Hey, sister Zheng!
- Sister Zheng is here!

530
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,950
Sister Zheng? Call me Sister Xia.

531
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,560
Sister Xia!

532
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,070
Do you know

533
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,040
what was those people's purpose?

534
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,040
Finding Bro Zheng,

535
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,110
they said they were
underlings of bro Da Fei.

536
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,710
Beating them is like sullying
bro Da Fei's name.

537
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,005
They even said bro Da Fei
wouldn't let it pass!

538
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:12,590
Yeah!

539
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,230
So where is Jiang Zheng Han?

540
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,310
We don't know.

541
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,190
- He's gone all day.
- Yeah.

542
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,040
Maybe they had him...

543
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,310
Yeah.

544
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,760
This bro Da Fei is a stray man.

545
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,110
Where is bro Da Fei?

546
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,060
<i>Cardroom</i>

547
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,190
This is not bad.

548
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,350
Hello.

549
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,160
You have good hands!

550
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,920
Please... Oh...

551
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,040
- Girl.
- Yeah.

552
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,280
What's wrong?

553
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,160
I, I want to find bro Da Fei.

554
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,310
What?

555
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,110
I want to see bro Da Fei.

556
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,160
Speak louder, please, I couldn't hear you.

557
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,760
I want to find bro Da Fei!

558
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,800
- What?
- Who wants to find bro Da Fei?

559
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,560
It's me.

560
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,000
Bro Zheng! Bro Zheng!

561
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,710
Bro Zheng! Bro Zheng!

562
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,190
About my account,

563
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,070
please help me level up.

564
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
Okay.

565
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,350
The fee is 300.

566
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,760
Equipment, ingredients are my gift.

567
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,920
You're the best!

568
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,710
Hello Bro Zheng.

569
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,830
Bro Zheng, we want to tell you this.

570
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,400
- Yeah.
- Oh!

571
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,470
Sister Zheng is here today.

572
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,640
Who? Sister Zheng?

573
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,400
- Yeah.
- Let me.

574
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,830
Sister Zheng asked us about you
beating the gangsters.

575
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,920
Yeah, beating them!

576
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,710
- We said they wronged you.
- Yeah, right.

577
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,710
Sister-in-law is so good to you.

578
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,640
When she heard bro Da Fei
wanted to beat you...

579
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
- She freaked out!
- Yeah!

580
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,640
That's right!

581
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,230
Where is she?

582
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,190
Oh, when she was here waiting for you,

583
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,190
bro Da Fei's minions came too.

584
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,920
I thought you were caught by bro Da Fei,

585
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,560
so we told sister Zheng to go...

586
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,040
go find you...

587
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,680
Yeah.

588
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,680
What's the yelling?
A Xiang A Zheng something,

589
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,520
I don't know them.

590
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,110
Four!

591
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,400
Today your underlings came to our school

592
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,710
and talked badly about
Jiang Zheng Han beating the gangsters,

593
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,640
you know that?

594
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,190
Talk badly?

595
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,430
I don't know.

596
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Bro Da Fei,

597
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,830
I...

598
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,190
Do you know what kind
of person I hate the most?

599
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,310
Bro Fei,

600
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,920
just do it to me!

601
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,680
You kid is brave,

602
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,800
you dared to come here.

603
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,350
Believe me.

604
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,710
Be quiet.

605
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,680
Bro Fei, she wasn't here to make a scene,

606
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,040
please, let me take her away.

607
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,000
Three.

608
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,310
Three.

609
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,760
Hahaha, blue dragon.

610
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,710
You're great, bro Fei.

611
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,590
Oh!

612
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,160
That's good, girl.

613
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,190
How do you know about Three?

614
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,830
Oh, because

615
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,230
N multiplies AAA plus
M multiplies ABC plus DD,

616
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,230
M and N can be 0.

617
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,160
I learned it from the internet.

618
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,590
Oh.

619
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,350
I don't understand.

620
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,830
Just calculating.

621
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,110
Calculating? Great job!

622
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,000
In the future,
you only have to say my name,

623
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,190
good food and drinks are all for you.

624
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,000
What's that?

625
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,830
Bro Da Fei,

626
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,110
Jiang Zheng Han...

627
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,110
Oh,

628
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,590
What's wrong, Spiked Hair?

629
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,680
Bro Da Fei,

630
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,000
I heard about it too,

631
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,350
that boy intentionally sullied Xiao Xiang.

632
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,950
Sullied?

633
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,190
Go to the school and explain it clearly.

634
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,000
What do you do?

635
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,470
Okay, bro Fei, got it!

636
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,400
Kid,

637
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,470
this girl isn't bad,

638
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,400
you have to be good to her.

639
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,000
- Come here more, girl?
- Yeah.

640
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,190
Thank you, bro Fei.

641
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,710
See?

642
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,640
Bro Da Fei is kind.

643
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,070
He isn't that scary like people said,

644
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,310
he listened to me too.

645
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,400
I kept asking bro Da Fei
to do a favor for you,

646
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,350
and now he helped you solve the problem.

647
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,520
- Isn't that great?
- Xia Lin Xi.

648
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:31,950
Yeah.

649
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,310
You think you're awesome?

650
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,520
This is my first time meeting
bro Da Fei, isn't it good?

651
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,830
You don't have a brain, do you?

652
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,110
Do you know what kind of place is this?

653
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,280
Evil mafia, don't you understand?

654
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,640
Someone growing up
in a glass case like you,

655
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,560
you were finding for fun or what?

656
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,350
You think I was willing to come here?

657
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,950
Wasn't that because of you?

658
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Bro Zheng,

659
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,680
please remember
that you are a student, okay?

660
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,190
You can't just leave school
because the teachers scolded you.

661
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,760
If you were wronged,

662
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,640
you had to explain!

663
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,880
Why did you leave?

664
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Do you know what is
the most important thing for a person?

665
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,830
It is taking care of themselves.

666
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,520
You can't even do that,
and now you want to care for others?

667
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,640
You make it harder for them, understand?

668
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,350
I'm just a troublemaker,

669
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,880
I don't need your worries!

670
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,880
You're tough!

671
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,310
A thick-headed porcupine,

672
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,400
you ditch school to work,
you take care of the elderly,

673
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,400
you're so great!

674
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
I don't have to worry about you.

675
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,920
But the real responsibility

676
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,310
is to do the things

677
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,800
that your age should do.

678
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,950
Do you know that you should
respect schooling and teachers?

679
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,190
You tell me to look after myself,

680
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,040
but have you
ever taken responsibilities

681
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,430
for your future?

682
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,110
Never come to places like this again.

683
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,190
When I was on my way here,

684
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,710
I was so worried.

685
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,830
So tomorrow...

686
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,640
Please apologize to our teacher,

687
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,040
be nice,

688
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,920
stop being thick-headed.

689
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,760
A responsible person

690
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,070
should respect their teachers.

691
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,920
Don't think you just fought with others,

692
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,430
then had someone as your witness,

693
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,590
and you can be free of troubles.

694
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,400
You still sullied our name!

695
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,000
Move your things to normal class

696
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,400
immediately!

697
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,230
Please stop, Mr. Zhang.

698
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,160
Actually,

699
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,400
- Jiang Zheng Han's story...
- I don't agree.

700
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,640
Do you have the right to do so?

701
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,110
I...

702
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,040
Stop being thick-headed,

703
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,760
stop being a porcupine.

704
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,310
A responsible person

705
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,590
should respect their teachers.

706
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,560
I hope you would grant me a chance

707
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,070
of redemption.

708
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,560
Mr. Zhang...

709
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,190
Guys,

710
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
listen to me.

711
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,640
Jiang Zheng Han

712
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,040
doesn't study, just plays outside,

713
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,230
and hangs out with gangsters.

714
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,280
This kind of gangster

715
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,800
- Xiao Man,
- can't be in our class.

716
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,300
how do you write the "on the same side"
word that Chen the second mentioned?

717
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,000
Because of this gangster,

718
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,010
our Jiang Ming No.1 high school lost a slot.

719
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,000
Why don't you check the dictionary?

720
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,310
Can I borrow it?

721
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,520
Mr. Zhang said so.

722
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,190
A shame.

723
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,430
A piece of mouse shit that ruins the soup.

724
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,760
I'm here today to call for signatures

725
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,110
of you guys

726
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,080
and force Jiang Zheng Han to leave our class.

727
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,920
Where did Chen the second learn that?

728
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,800
Chen Yi Chuan,

729
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,110
you can't say that.

730
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,520
Bro Zheng is kind and righteous,

731
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,070
you, you're talking badly about him!

732
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,470
You are the same.

733
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,110
I'll sign first.

734
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,230
Chuan!

735
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,230
Really? What's wrong with
Chen the second?

736
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,190
Who's next?

737
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,800
Chuan, stop making a scene.

738
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,560
Hey, Gu Xiao Man, what are you doing?

739
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,560
Yi Chuan, don't act up like that.

740
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,590
We are classmates, please don't...

741
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,310
Gu Xiao Man,

742
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,470
if you don't sign, then stop interfering.

743
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,430
Calm down!

744
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,920
Chen Yi Chuan!

745
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,000
Yi Chuan!

746
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,590
Gao Lei, do you want to sign?

747
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,110
Guys, don't sign!

748
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,800
Hey, what are you doing?

749
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,400
Come back to your seats.

750
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,830
As a teacher,

751
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,310
I'm always tolerant of

752
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,110
those who made mistakes.

753
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,920
We decided

754
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,670
to grant Jiang Zheng Han another chance.

755
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,630
Jiang Zheng Han, show your determination.

756
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,630
Hey, don't stand here.

757
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,710
Go to the front
of the class and read it.

758
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,630
Yeah, go up there.

759
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,390
I, Jiang Zheng Han, promise that

760
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,190
in this mock exam in our city,

761
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,760
I'll be in the top 100 of our school.

762
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,080
- Jiang Zheng Han in top 100?
- If I can't do that

763
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,120
- Is he kidding?
- I will leave class 12-1,

764
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,430
and listen to our teachers'
and class's decision.

765
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,520
Okay.

766
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,080
Study by yourselves.

767
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,230
Come back to your seat.

768
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,390
Bro Zheng,

769
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,430
isn't it too much to bet?

770
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,870
Jiang Zheng Han,

771
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,080
don't waste your time.

772
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,630
You can't be in the top 100.

773
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,710
To be honest,

774
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,760
I wrote a letter today

775
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,910
and asked the school board
to transfer you to other classes.

776
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,080
If he wins?

777
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,320
Hah! Wins?

778
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,560
If he can do that,
I'll jump squat around our school.

779
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,040
Chen Yi Chuan,

780
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,760
remember what you said.

781
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,190
- Xiao Xi.
- What?

782
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,560
Xiao Xi.

783
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Jiang Zheng Han worked with
the mafia to bully Xiao Chuan,

784
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,430
why did you help him?

785
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,360
I didn't help him,
I just did what was right.

786
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,840
What?

787
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,870
He helped my stupid brother.

788
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,630
Jiang Zheng Han said the truth.

789
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,390
- Really?
- Yeah.

790
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,600
So...

791
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,230
Chen Yi Chuan
encouraged our class to sign,

792
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,800
he wanted to force
Jiang Zheng Han to leave.

793
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,360
I have to tell him,

794
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,670
he is wrong!

795
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,630
Xiao Man,

796
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,470
he won't believe you.

797
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,710
I can't let him go deeper.

798
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,760
This is not the time.

799
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,150
Wait.

800
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,760
Xiao Xi,

801
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,320
when did you and
Jiang Zheng Han become friends?

802
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,470
What did you say?

803
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,760
Be honest,

804
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,000
are you hiding something from me?

805
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,840
No way.

806
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
My tutor is waiting at home,

807
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,470
we will talk later, okay?

808
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,520
Tutor?

809
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,910
Hey, Xiao Xi!

810
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,910
Xiao Xi!

811
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,280
Xia Lin Xi!

812
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,670
Oh!

813
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,430
Girls who can run 800m in 3 minutes 40 seconds
will be in excellent rank,

814
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,840
and pass this exam,

815
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
just once.

816
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,280
Please prepare.

817
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,120
Oh my god, that's harsh.

818
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,710
Who can do that?

819
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,800
I can, it's easy.

820
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,150
Stop it,

821
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,800
it's easy for the students ranking 1st to 8th
in sports in our whole school, not 800th.

822
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,040
With your result,
what are you joining for?

823
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,910
Are you confident
that you will be in the top 100?

824
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,470
No, just try.

825
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,670
No?

826
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,360
What should we do then?

827
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,280
- Hey.
- Let it be.

828
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,760
Right,

829
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,630
recently my Math score has improved,

830
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,800
my mother asked me
to tell you to have extra lessons.

831
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Stop your work at the internet cafe.

832
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,320
When you teach me,

833
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,870
I can help you with your review.

834
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,600
No need,

835
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,800
your math score is now enough
for the College Entrance Examination.

836
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,910
Who said that?

837
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,670
You can't be sure that I could pass and
enter Jing Hua University!

838
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,470
Don't refuse.

839
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,670
- Take it.
- I can't.

840
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,840
I have to try my best with the review.

841
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,390
I'll go first.

842
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,000
Hey, are you serious?

843
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,230
Where are you going now?

844
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,120
Internet cafe.

845
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,150
Internet cafe?

846
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,000
You don't have time to teach me
but have time to go to the internet cafe?

847
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,470
Wait.

848
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,870
Xia Lin Xi, you liar!

849
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,120
I called your home but nobody was there!

850
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,710
Tell me, where are you now?

851
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,950
At the book store.

852
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,910
I don't care,

853
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,470
I'm waiting for you at our gym.

854
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,430
Come back and practice running with me.

855
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,630
You won't get extra points
if you don't pass P.E.

856
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,000
Oh, I, I, okay okay.

857
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Talk to you later, okay?

858
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,190
I'm at the book store.

859
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Bye!

860
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,760
We can catch up!

861
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,760
Oh, Zheng's friend.

862
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,120
- You're looking for Zheng?
- Yeah.

863
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,560
Oh.

864
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,000
We are like mayflies
wandering in this terrestrial world

865
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,430
or a grain of millet
drifting on a deep ocean.

866
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,870
What a short life span we have,

867
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,760
yet how endless the Yangtze River is!

868
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,390
I wish we could travel
with flying immortals in heaven

869
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,950
or hold the bright moon
in my arms through eternity.

870
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,520
I know this is not
something easily obtainable

871
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,600
so I groan in the desolate breeze!

872
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,950
So I groan...

873
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,600
So I groan in the desolate breeze!

874
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,040
How did you know I was here?

875
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,760
I have a third eye.

876
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,840
What's that?

877
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,280
The owner told me.

878
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,190
Oh.

879
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,560
So...

880
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,910
Do you want to come in?

881
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,630
I, I can?

882
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:59,663
