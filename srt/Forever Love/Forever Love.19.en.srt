<i>The Next Hurdle, Mother-In-Law's Approval</i>

20
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right.

21
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,879
The affection starts with friendship.

22
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:54,000
Whether they are right for each other,

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
they must first get along
and have something in common.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,599
Right?

25
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,279
Come on.

26
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,800
Let me drink a toast to you, Qin Yue.

27
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:01,559
Come on.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,639
Thanks, auntie.

29
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:05,400
Thank you for taking care of our Lin Xi
in Jing Hua University.

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,759
Behave yourself.

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,399
She doesn't usually do like that.

32
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,839
Can you stop toasting?

33
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,919
Just eat.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,440
-Well, let's eat.
-Let's enjoy the meal.

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,080
Young people get hungry easily, let's eat.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,399
Let me help you.

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,559
This fish was made by my husband.

38
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,839
A private home cuisine.

39
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,800
-Have a taste.
-Okay.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,199
Wow.

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,399
Nice.

42
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,919
Xiao Xi, have you been tired

43
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,839
all the way back, so you're hungry?

44
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,759
Xiao Xi, is something
bothering you at school?

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,839
It's not easy for children now,

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,000
mainly because of too much pressure.

47
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,880
About this,

48
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,639
Qin Yue is also in Jing Hua University.
You should also know that.

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,080
The students of Jing Hua University
are all under great pressure.

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,479
Ms. Chen.

51
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,240
Yes?

52
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:30,080
Does Xiao Xi have any hobbies?

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,720
She learned piano when she was six.

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,360
In the first year of high school,
she was already level ten.

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,600
But I had too much homework
in high school.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,279
So I stopped playing.

57
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,440
Dad, Mom.

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,160
Xiao Xi was admitted to Jing Hua

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,919
as the top scorer of science in Jiangming.

60
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,080
Because of the College Entrance Exam,

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,240
she had no time to play the piano.

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,119
No, I just didn't want to play the piano.

63
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,039
By the way, it was my mom
who forced me to play.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,199
You don't know how happy I was
to escape from playing the piano.

65
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,919
Uncle, aunt.
I'm actually an ordinary person.

66
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,919
It's just luck that
I got admitted to Jing Hua University.

67
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,160
Of course, I also want to thank my mother.

68
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:12,000
It would have been difficult for me
if she hadn't forced me.

69
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,799
Watch your mouth.

70
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm telling the truth.

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,440
Mom, I really have to thank you.

72
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,320
If you hadn't been so strict,

73
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,559
I wouldn't have been where I am.

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,000
A toast to you.

75
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,799
I will drink it first.

76
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,239
I'm not used to drinking the red wine.

77
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,559
I'm going to buy some liquor.

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,359
Xiao Xi.

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,079
I spoiled her. I will get her back.

80
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,160
Ms. Chen.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
She is still young,

82
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,959
and can be changed.

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Then, let's enjoy the dinner.

84
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,239
Try my husband's cooking.

85
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:02,920
Come on.

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,239
Come on, please.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,799
Dad, Mom.

88
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:10,200
Xiao Xi might be a little tired today.

89
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,440
She didn't treat us as outsiders.

90
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,880
If she is just shy and introverted,

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
it's fine.

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,760
But look what she has done,

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,640
she is vulgar and uncultivated.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
Look how indifferent she was,

95
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,200
I couldn't see that
cute small girl at all.

96
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,119
I think you should break up with her.

97
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,799
-Mom.
-Enough, no more words.

98
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,279
Xiao Xi is really not like this.

99
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,239
If she is not like this normally,

100
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,399
that means she doesn't like you at all.

101
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,480
You can't get her
even though you keep chasing her.

102
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,839
I hope you two can get closer.

103
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,359
You know,

104
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,920
there is a problem with
our company's capital chain.

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,239
Her mother has been responsible for
financing in her company.

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,279
One more ally is always good.

107
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,440
But today,

108
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,880
you can see Lin Xi's attitude.

109
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,839
Dad,

110
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,720
I really like Xiao Xi.

111
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,760
Let's talk about your affection
when the company turns the scale.

112
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,239
Let's go.

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,559
Xiao Xi, don't rush back.

114
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,359
I'm coaxing your mother.

115
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,559
Thanks, Dad.

116
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:06,399
I just wanna get some air.

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
I'll go back in a while.

118
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,600
Dad, don't worry.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,200
Okay.

120
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,679
Take care of yourself.

121
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,079
Okay.

122
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:20,959
I'm done.

123
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,040
Hello.

124
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,760
Has my "secret girlfriend" got home?

125
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,320
Did you make a pitch for me
before your mom?

126
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Jiang Zheng Han, where are you?

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,799
Can we meet?

128
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,720
Stop it.

129
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,600
What happened?

130
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,920
What happened to you during the hours
when I was on the train?

131
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,279
During these few hours,

132
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,599
my mother invited
Qin Yue's family to our house.

133
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,119
As soon as I walked in,

134
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,880
I knew they had planned it.

135
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,760
What's wrong?

136
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,239
Aren't you full?

137
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,599
Hungry?

138
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,559
I'm not full.

139
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,599
I just beat the bowl.

140
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,919
Why did that when having dinner?

141
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,359
To make Qin Yue's parents hate me.

142
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,960
Clever move.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,559
I have much more tricks.

144
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,760
Be careful from now on.

145
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:17,840
Got it.

146
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,280
I haven't eaten a real meal

147
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,599
since I got off the train.

148
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,719
Yet I drank a large glass of wine
on an empty stomach.

149
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,960
How cruelly my mom treated me.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,039
Hungry now?

151
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:38,679
Stop drinking coffee.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,239
I will take you to eat delicious food.

153
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,119
What do you want to eat?

154
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,400
I want to eat

155
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,280
a lot of things.

156
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,080
Then,

157
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,359
what do you want to eat most?

158
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:57,119
You are the boss. I'll listen to you.

159
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,200
Then have a meal here.

160
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,280
Here?

161
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,039
Is this a special restaurant?

162
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,599
Yep.

163
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,479
You'll know when you go.

164
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,200
Let's go.

165
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,559
Wait.

166
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,919
This isn't

167
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,200
your home, is it?

168
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,320
You are taking me to see your dad and mom?

169
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,599
-I can't. I still...
-It's too late to say that.

170
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,200
You have already come here.

171
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,119
-Oh, I can't.
-Come with me.

172
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:25,840
Jiang Zheng Han.

173
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,400
Dad, I'm back.

174
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,359
This is my girlfriend, Xia Lin Xi.

175
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,799
Hello, uncle.

176
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,919
Hello.

177
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,159
Sorry for coming up here like this.

178
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,840
Don't say that.

179
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,640
Welcome. Welcome.

180
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,760
Come and sit down.

181
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,880
Jiang Zheng Han,

182
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,919
you said you would
take your girlfriend home.

183
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,919
Your mother and I
thought you were kidding.

184
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,880
Fortunately,

185
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,719
we have prepared for that.

186
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,320
Wait for a while.

187
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,119
Okay.

188
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,599
Okay, Dad.

189
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,840
Sit down.

190
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,760
-The meal is almost ready.
-Why didn't you tell me earlier?

191
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,679
If you had told me,

192
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,760
I wouldn't have prepared nothing.

193
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,080
No need to prepare.

194
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,239
-You are perfect.
-You...

195
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,679
How did your parents know
that I would come?

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,119
Well,

197
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,559
I told them.

198
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,039
Dad,

199
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,239
I'll take my girlfriend to our home later.

200
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,320
Why didn't you tell me?

201
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,679
If you had told me earlier,

202
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,599
I would have brought some gifts
on the way here.

203
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,039
An ugly daughter-in-law
will see her in-laws sooner or later.

204
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,400
Not to mention you are so pretty.

205
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,559
Come on!

206
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,599
Your mother is cooking,
it'll just take a moment.

207
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,400
Okay.

208
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
Come and have some tea first.

209
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,799
Dad, let me do it.

210
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,440
Okay, thank you.

211
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,440
She hasn't eaten yet.

212
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,280
I see.

213
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,119
Then she can't drink tea.

214
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,799
Drinking tea on an empty stomach
is bad for the stomach.

215
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,200
The more you drink,
the more hungry you'll feel.

216
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:00,919
Drink some water then.

217
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,679
Have some water.

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,320
-Pour it for your girlfriend first.
-Let me help you.

219
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,359
No, I'll pour you first.

220
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,119
Hey, sit down.

221
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,719
-Just sit.
-OK.

222
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,760
Xiao Xi, glad to have you with us.

223
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,599
Mom.

224
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,320
-Sit, make yourself at home.
-Hello, auntie.

225
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,440
Take it easy.

226
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,799
Auntie, it sounds nice

227
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,640
that you call me Xiao Xi.

228
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,440
Xiao Xi, I knew you a long time ago.

229
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,400
So I look at you as if you're my child.

230
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
I know you like eggplant,

231
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
cabbage, carp, carrot

232
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,520
and sweet tomatoes, right?

233
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,799
You like milk,

234
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,479
and don't like coke, right?

235
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,520
All these are prepared.

236
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,520
I don't know if it suits your taste today.

237
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,080
Try them all later.

238
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,799
Okay.

239
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,119
-Just sit down.
-Sit down.

240
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,239
Is this chair a spring? Don't stand up.

241
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,159
Just sit.

242
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,239
I also cooked sweet potatoes we planted.

243
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,280
-Have a taste later.
-I will peel it for her.

244
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,840
Thank you.

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,719
Come with me to get the crucian here.

246
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:58,039
Okay.

247
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,640
-Enjoy yourself.
-Okay.

248
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,039
How do you think of my parents?

249
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,880
They are good.

250
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,359
How do you know so clearly about me?

251
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,599
Come on,

252
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,479
I know everything about you, okay?

253
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,799
But...

254
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,599
Uncle and aunt prepared so much for me,

255
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,280
but I came empty-handed,

256
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,440
it seems very rude of me.

257
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,239
Easy, my parents don't care about this.

258
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,119
Em...

259
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,440
-How did I just do?
-Yeah.

260
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,119
Did I look casual?

261
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:35,599
And

262
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,200
if I say something wrong later,

263
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,760
you gotta correct me.

264
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,919
Okay, I know.

265
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,919
Oh! Shall I go to the kitchen and

266
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,440
help your parents cook?

267
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,679
No, just sit down.

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You don't have to do anything.

269
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,840
My mother likes you very much.

270
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,799
-Really.
-But...

271
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,960
This is the first time
I have met your parents.

272
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,159
My parents must like

273
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,119
the girl I like.

274
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,640
Try this.

275
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,080
How is it?

276
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,479
Very tasty.

277
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Coming.

278
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,359
Come on.

279
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,159
Uncle, let me help you.

280
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,719
Here it is.

281
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,719
You just sit.

282
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,880
Sit down, Xiao Xi.

283
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,400
Such a big meal.

284
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,000
Now we can start eating.

285
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,640
Xiao Xi,

286
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,280
these dishes were all made by your aunt.

287
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,400
I don't know if you like them.

288
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,559
Uncle, aunt.

289
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,599
I am not picky on food.

290
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:37,960
Xiao Xi,

291
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,039
the dishes I cooked today
are all that you like.

292
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,000
-Enjoy yourself.
-Okay.

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,919
You like carrot, try it.

294
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,679
How does it taste?

295
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,280
Drink some water.

296
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,599
Drink some water first.

297
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,559
Come and drink some water.

298
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,919
Just eat slowly.

299
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,039
You okay?

300
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,719
Auntie, it's really delicious.

301
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,760
Eat more then.

302
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,080
Eat slowly.

303
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,479
Try this.

304
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,000
Eat this.

305
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,479
Come on.

306
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,760
Dad, just eat.

307
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,719
Okay, okay.

308
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,479
Here, sweet tomatoes.

309
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,400
Have a big bite.

310
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,599
Mom, don't help her, enjoy yourself.

311
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,239
-Auntie, just eat.
-Xiao Xi, it's okay.

312
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,479
I'm happy to see you eat so much.

313
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,840
Come and eat more.

314
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,479
Xiao Xi, have an apple.

315
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,440
Thanks, auntie.

316
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,119
-Paste it straight.
-Okay.

317
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,400
-Xiao Xi.
-Yes, auntie.

318
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,000
I know you young people
don't wear this now.

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,320
But your skin is fair.

320
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,799
It's a good match for your skin-tone.

321
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,479
Auntie,

322
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,359
this bracelet is too expensive.

323
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,960
I really can't take it.

324
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,719
Thanks, auntie.

325
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,760
This is a gift for you.

326
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,000
I really can't take it.

327
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,200
Maybe I'm too impatient.

328
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,559
But anyway,

329
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,760
this is yours sooner or later.

330
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,440
Dad, do you really see it?

331
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,919
My eyesight is good.

332
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,280
You have presbyopia.

333
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,679
Hurry up.

334
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,640
Xiao Xi, we all like you very much.

335
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,440
You can come to us often.

336
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,760
Okay.

337
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,320
Tell Zheng Han what you want to eat
and I will prepare it.

338
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,479
By the way, I still try to learn

339
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,440
how to do the milk tea
you young people like.

340
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,080
Wow, auntie, you are so amazing.

341
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
As I see,

342
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,960
don't think about milk tea.

343
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,840
It tastes too bad.

344
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,239
She always forced me to drink.

345
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,719
Don't slander me in front of Xiao Xi.

346
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:24,559
Listen,

347
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,280
you don't beg me to cook for you.

348
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,440
Uncle, aunt.

349
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,640
It's getting late.

350
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,080
-I should go home.
-Now?

351
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,559
Xiao Xi, just stay longer
to talk to me, okay?

352
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,479
Sorry. My parents are still
waiting for me at home.

353
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,440
That's OK.

354
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,799
Let Zheng Han send you back.

355
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,359
Okay.

356
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,239
It's all right.

357
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:44,880
I'll just go back by myself.

358
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,239
No, I'll send you back.

359
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,640
Zheng Han, send Xiao Xi back home.

360
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,880
Be with her until she gets home.

361
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,559
-Rest assured.
-Yes.

362
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,080
Be careful on the way.

363
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,119
Then, uncle, aunt, we'll go first.

364
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,640
Remember to come here when you are free.

365
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,799
Okay, bye-bye.

366
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,440
Goodbye.

367
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,919
Let's go.

368
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:00,960
-Bye.
-Be careful.

369
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,679
Just tell Zheng Han
what you want to eat.

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,079
Okay, aunt.

371
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,280
Are you full?

372
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes, very full.

373
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
-Is it delicious?
-Auntie cooks well.

374
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,439
Why didn't you beat the bowl just now?

375
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,959
Don't laugh at me.

376
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,400
Do you often

377
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,920
mention me to your parents?

378
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,800
Of course.

379
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,439
Today,

380
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,199
my mother gave you that bracelet.

381
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,880
Why didn't you take it?

382
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:32,800
You saw it?

383
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,319
I think

384
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,079
it's not good to receive gifts
at the first meeting.

385
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,040
And I think that bracelet
should be quite expensive.

386
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,800
Actually, when my dad ran the factory,

387
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,959
my family was quite rich.

388
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
But something bad happened to the factory.

389
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,680
All the things that
can be mortgaged were pledged.

390
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,680
Only the bracelet is left.

391
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,079
You had a hard time
paying off the debt in high school.

392
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,479
Why didn't you sell it?

393
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,920
Because it's our heirloom.

394
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,319
Then why aunt meant to give it to me?

395
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,839
It's for her daughter-in-law.

396
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,599
Of course it's for you.

397
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,479
Then, did I just...

398
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,199
Regret?

399
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,079
I'm going to take it.

400
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,199
Wait! No, no.

401
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,560
Maybe next time.

402
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,959
Are you still angry about Qin Yue?

403
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,800
No.

404
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,560
He is not as important as you.

405
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,040
Are you chilly?

406
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,520
Yes.

407
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,160
Come here.

408
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:11,520
We're still at your door, is it okay?

409
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,680
Mom.

410
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,920
Are you angry?

411
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,079
Are you running away from home?

412
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:03,719
No.

413
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,160
I got work to do.

414
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,479
A business trip again?

415
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,280
Mom, it's the New Year soon.

416
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,800
Why do you do this?

417
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,439
Mom, I was wrong.

418
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,400
Don't be angry, okay?

419
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,599
I want to be angry with you.

420
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,680
But I have no time.

421
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
I'll be back on the day after New Year's Day.

422
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,800
I told your dad to stay with you at home.

423
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,800
Where did my dad go?

424
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,719
I never know

425
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,839
what the hell is going on
in your dad's company.

426

<i>Dad</i>
Xiao Xi, I can't save you.

427
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,400
After you left,

428
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,040
your mother just kept nagging.

429
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,280
I had to go to the company to avoid it.

430
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,800
What's that?

431
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,800
Nothing.

432
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,280
Xia Lin Xi.

433
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,040
I should have a talk with you

434
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,800
for what you did just now.

435
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,560
Your actions were extremely bad.

436
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,280
Just stay at home
during the New Year this year!

437
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,400
I will give you video calls at any time.

Moreover,

439
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,680
don't mess around
with those worthless people,

440
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,439
or I gotta punish you
for all you have done.

441
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,959
Reflect on yourself at home.

442
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,560
I know that.

-Xiao Xi.
-Uncle, aunt.

Why are you here?

447
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,920
You didn't come to us during the New Year.

-Come on in.
-Okay.

Why you are here?

so your aunt and I come to see you.

we have to bring you the food.

we brought you the New Year's Eve dinner.

It's still hot.

-It's okay.

-Happy new year.
-Happy new year.

If aunt heard it,

469

you would never see me again.

you spend the New Year alone at home?

to worry about this alone.

512
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,920
I don't want him to worry about me.
