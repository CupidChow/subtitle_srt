20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,800
Look, all the user comments are anonymous.

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,580
-How can they be real?
-They must be bought off.

22
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,060
Chen Yi Chuan.

23
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,519
All right, take it easy.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Lin Xi, take a look at this.

25
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:00,160
Qiu Yan, anything new now?

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,919
The posts have fermented further.

27
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:04,839
All the information in our software
has been encrypted so many times!

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,559
How could this kind of problem ever happen?

29
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,080
It should be Xu Zhi Li.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,559
Who?

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,399
Qiu Yan, don't think that way.

32
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,160
Hey, guys.

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,160
Go back to review. Don't worry.

34
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,639
I'll figure it out.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Have a look.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,160
How is it going?

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,279
I just don't believe that

38
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,479
it's so easy to break into
our encrypted space.

39
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,240
So I wrote a web crawler

40
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,639
to compare 2,000 pieces of leaked data.

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,240
I found that their storage spans

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,479
are all within half a month.

43
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:42,160
I also analyzed the IP addresses.

44
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,720
Only two hundred of it.

45
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,880
So it should be paid posters.

46
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,119
Paid posters?

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,839
That's to say...

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,960
We didn't leak out our data at all.

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,279
The two thousand pieces of customer information
were stored by someone else.

50
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:01,240
That's right.

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,000
And then,

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,880
they deliberately gave out
such real information.

53
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,839
If that's the case,

54
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,080
we should call Rui Teng
and explain it to them right now.

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,000
That won't work.

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,080
Now Rui Teng is anxious
to cut ties with us.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,960
Even if we prove that we were set up,

58
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm sure that we won't get the money back.

59
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,600
So what should we do now?

60
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,880
Anyway,

61
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,320
let's prove our innocence first.

62
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,440
Guys.

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,520
Xie Ping Chuan and I share the same conclusion
that it should be paid posters.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,440
Look,

65
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,520
Lin Xi, Qiu Yan.

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,639
You two go have a look at

67
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,199
any other companies
still willing to invest in us.

68
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,160
Chen Yi Chuan, Duan Ning.

69
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,800
Analyze the IP addresses
of those paid posters.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,199
Let's see if we can go there
and get evidence.

71
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:56,880
OK.

72
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,279
Xiao Man.

73
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,839
Make a phone appointment.

74
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,520
OK.

75
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,399
Huai Wu.

76
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,479
You also learned software maintenance.

77
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,720
Help us.

78
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
OK!

79
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,630
<i>Student Cafeteria Building A</i>

80
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,359
It costs too much
to maintain the software.

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,799
We can only last a few more weeks at most.

82
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:23,000
If there's no more investment,
I'm afraid that...

83
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,040
I got a phone call.

84
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,239
Hello.

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,839
Yes, it is me.

86
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,399
-Don't worry too much.
-Excuse me.

87
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,679
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,399
I won't consider that for now.
I already have a job.

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,279
Lin Xi.

90
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,519
I think,

91
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,119
I shouldn't let them
waste time on me, should I?

92
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
What do you mean?

93
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,959
In fact, Duan Ning turned down an offer
the day before yesterday.

94
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,640
So did Chen Yi Chuan.

95
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,920
The students in our major are so popular

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,720
that big companies are fighting for them.

97
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,760
But now they're wasting
their time with me.

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
I think why don't we...

99
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,480
Just disband?

100
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,480
At least, everyone can go to
somewhere else after graduation.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,079
You mean, you want them to leave?

102
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,200
Or in another word,

103
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,359
you want to give up?

104
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,760
I certainly don't want to give up.

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,760
But I don't want to

106
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,279
drag everybody down,

107
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:37,559
including you.

108
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,160
Jiang Zheng Han.

109
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,760
Since we've chosen to
start a business with you,

110
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,959
we've prepared ourselves
for success or failure.

111
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,239
Difficulties will be overcome.
We can make a comeback after failure.

112
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,760
Our company's future
has endless possibilities.

113
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,880
But I don't think that

114
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,320
backing out is the style of our team.

115
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,620
<i>Mobile Phone: Slide to answer</i>

116
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Hello?

117
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,160
Is that Jiang Zheng Han?

118
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,839
Who is that speaking?

119
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,480
This is Zhang You Cai.

120
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,359
You are the greatest shame
in the history of my teaching!

121
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,519
Director Zhang.

122
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,119
Tell me,

123
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,799
is Zhang Huai Wu working for you?

124
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,440
Yes, director.

125
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,200
Yes?

126
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,239
Listen to me,

127
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,679
don't take him with you
for this kind of things in the future.

128
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,760
He isn't as good as you in studying.

129
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,359
Neither is the college he went to.

130
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,519
If he keeps hanging out with you guys,

131
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,000
how could he get any prospects?

132
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,359
Any futures?

133
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,519
By then, he may end up a nobody.

134
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,480
Since you are classmates,

135
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,920
you should also think for him, right?

136
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,079
This is an office.
Can't you put your feet down?

137
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,399
Miss Shi.

138
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,559
After the dinner last time,

139
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,839
Mr. Zhang of Rui Teng

140
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,760
told me that

141
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,519
he hoped that
you could work as his secretary.

142
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,799
If you are willing to,

143
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,679
when you work there,

144
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,200
your salary will be double
that of Lion Group.

145
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,119
What do you think? Give it a thought?

146
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,720
I'm working for Lion Group.

147
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,920
If you want me to go,
just talk to Mr. Qin.

148
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,279
I will leave if he agrees on it.

149
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,839
Wait. Wait.

150
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,079
You can come and go as you please.

151
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,920
You didn't sell yourself to Lion Group.

152
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,760
Or you...

153
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,519
Want to be the wife of the boss here?

154
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,920
I can tell that
you care about Mr. Qin a lot.

155
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,279
Mr. Xu, you must be joking.

156
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,440
I'm a petty clerk.

157
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,359
How can I have such an improper desire?

158
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,839
If so, this thing gets much easier.

159
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,880
If you don't want to leave Lion Group,
I can arrange it for you.

160
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,679
You don't have to resign.

161
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,760
Just go to Mr. Zhang's company tomorrow.

162
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,119
And you will get two salaries.

163
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,440
How's that?

164
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,040
A special treatment for you.

165
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,760
Mr. Xu.

166
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:18,320
Mr. Zhang is old enough to be my dad.

167
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,760
Age isn't a problem, okay?

168
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,519
Mr. Zhang said that

169
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,519
you look like his first girlfriend,

170
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,320
not his daughter.

171
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,480
I won't go.

172
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:31,079
Do you think I'm asking for your advice?

173
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,359
What's the matter?

174
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,520
Mr. Qin.

175
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,760
You're right on time.

176
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Mr. Zhang

177
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,599
wants Shi Ying

178
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,359
to be his personal secretary.

179
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,479
I just came here to inform you.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,679
Mr. Zhang?

181
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,200
Yes.

182
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,440
What do you think, Shi Ying?

183
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,239
Shi Ying thinks that she

184
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,159
would be at your disposal.

185
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,559
After all, it's also
a rare opportunity for her

186
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,840
to hone herself at Mr. Zhang's company.

187
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,840
But I feel that...

188
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,039
Come on!

189
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,359
It's settled then.

190
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,640
By the way, Qin Yue.

191
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,000
The issue of Heng Xia's data leakage
seems to have been escalated.

192
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,039
Why don't we

193
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,320
-take this opportunity to take Jiang Zheng...
-Shi Ying,

194
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,799
I'll talk to Mr. Xu about something.
You can leave now.

195
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,599
No, no, no.

196
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,359
Shi Ying is very important.

197
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,159
Now whether Jiang Zheng Han fails or not,

198
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,000
it depends on Rui Teng.

199
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:27,479
If Shi Ying works as
Mr. Zhang's personal secretary,

200
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,799
she can convince him
by pillow-talk now and then.

201
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:31,919
No.

202
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,719
By whisper in his ear.

203
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,440
To make Mr. Zhang directly
file a lawsuit against Heng Xia.

204
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
In this way, Jiang Zheng Han

205
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,479
will have no way to make a comeback.

206
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,280
Xu Zhi Li,

207
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,559
this is

208
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:44,880
over the top.

209
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,080
Qin Yue, you know what,

210
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,599
in the business world,

211
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,520
it's all about doing things
by hook or by crook.

212
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,239
To tell you the truth,

213
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,320
I did that to Heng Xia.

214
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,080
If Jiang Zheng Han got the investment,

215
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,479
the software that he developed

216
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,320
would be
a competitor's product similar to ours.

217
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,479
It will take the market share
from us directly.

218
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,520
Can't you see such results by yourself?

219
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,159
Moreover,

220
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,239
it was you and me together
who suppressed Jiang Zheng Han back then.

221
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,359
Why are you now playing the sage?

222
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Mr. Xu.

223
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,960
You've arranged it well.

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,239
But it seems that
you haven't asked if I agreed.

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,559
Shi Ying.

226
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,840
Jiang Zheng Han now
has evidence against us.

227
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,719
If we don't take him down now,

228
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,719
it would be your Lion Group to suffer.

229
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,200
Let go.

230
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,239
I said, let go.

231
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,159
Shi Ying.

232
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,200
Shi Ying.

233
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,840
Shi Ying.

234
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,400
Could you hear me out?

235
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,080
You don't have to take
Xu Zhi Li's words seriously at all.

236
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,119
If you don't want to do it, I can...

237
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,080
If?

238
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,719
Qin Yue.

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,239
In your eyes,

240
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,400
it's possible for me
to be Mr. Zhang's secretary?

241
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,400
Jiang Zheng Han was fired by XV.

242
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,320
It was because of
you and Xu Zhi Li, right?

243
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,719
At that time, I...

244
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,679
I got it.

245
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,640
You don't have to feel awkward for me.

246
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,119
I'll resign.

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,679
Why?

248
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't care why you did it.

249
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,440
But it already happened.

250
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,359
If Jiang Zheng Han's company
doesn't go bankrupt,

251
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,840
tens of millions yuan of
Xu Zhi Li's investment would go for nothing.

252
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,239
And he will surely drag
Lion Group down with him.

253
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,760
You are no match for him.

254
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,359
If you continue to work with him,

255
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,520
I choose to leave.

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,719
Shi Ying.

257
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,479
You don't have to think about

258
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,320
all these things.

259
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,080
You don't have to worry so much for me.

260
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,840
How about this?

261
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,559
You don't have to go to
Mr. Zhang's dinner party from now on.

262
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,679
Just do your own job, okay?

263
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,440
Don't talk to me about strategies.

264
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,239
From now on,

265
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,520
I don't belong to your company anymore.

266
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,239
♪Unity is strength.♪

267
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,039
Coffee will be ready soon.

268
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,679
Okay.

269
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,359
Sis Xia, no fresh ground coffee today.

270
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,200
Only instant coffee.

271
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,880
Huai Wu, no sugar.

272
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,520
I want a latte.

273
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,119
Got it.

274
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,320
Guys.

275
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,119
I have something to tell you.

276
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,880
Since we knew each other
from the freshman year,

277
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,520
we've been through a lot together.

278
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,559
None of it was easy.

279
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,080
After all, no one believes that

280
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,119
a group of college students
can achieve something big.

281
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,840
And that's also the fact.

282
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,440
We met with some difficulties.

283
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,119
We...

284
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,400
We have no money left.

285
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,760
We even can't pay Rui Teng
for the compensation.

286
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,719
I really wish to

287
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,280
tell you that
we still have a glimmer of hope.

288
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,119
But I don't want to fool you with that.

289
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,039
Jiang Zheng Han...

290
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,880
Starting from today...

291
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,760
Our company may not be able to

292
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,599
pay salary to you any more.

293
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,119
Hey.

294
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:00,960
Brother Zheng.

295
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Are you trying to scare us to death?

296
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,320
I thought it's something more serious.

297
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,799
No salary, not a big deal, okay?

298
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,760
We don't live on this salary, right?

299
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,000
That's right.

300
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,640
So I made a decision.

301
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,159
Let's disband right now.

302
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,559
-What?
-You deserve a better future.

303
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,719
-Disband?
-What?

304
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,359
Sis Xia.

305
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,479
Sis Xia, see?

306
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,239
Brother Zheng is joking again.

307
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,039
That's interesting.

308
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,640
What are you doing this for?

309
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,359
Xiao Xi, say something.

310
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,679
Sis Xia, what's going on?

311
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,799
Your salary.

312
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Jiang Zheng Han.

313
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,840
What do you mean by this?

314
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,239
Do you really think you can
send me away by a hundred yuan?

315
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,440
Jiang Zheng Han,
we have been fighting together.

316
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,640
It's not fun for you to do this.

317
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,280
Brother Zheng.

318
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,919
We can't disband.

319
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,159
I turned down every job
that my dad offered me.

320
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,520
I mean it. He scolded me every day.

321
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,919
He almost got here, Beining, for that.

322
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,640
Even so, I didn't flinch.

323
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
You're trying to get rid of me?

324
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,119
I tell you what, it's impossible.

325
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,640
Jiang Zheng Han!

326
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,200
Xiao Chuan.

327
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,719
-Chen Yi Chuan.
-I'm talking to you.

328
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:46,039
All of us worked so hard
day and night to build this company.

329
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,840
Why should we quit when you say so?

330
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,799
I,

331
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,000
and the rest of us

332
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,400
don't agree on it.

333
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,760

Are you going to sit here all night?

He told me,

365
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,079
his dad scolded him that

366
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,839
even if he is not much capable,

367
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,760
he shouldn't give up on himself.

That's what he told you.

Well, what his dad said about me
was kind of indirect.

371

Love is to admit defeat.

457

I did like Jiang Zheng Han before.

458
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
While you, senior,

00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,439
fell in love with senior Qin Yue.

460
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,959
But who hasn't been a fool in their youth?

461
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,800
Senior, stop being dispirited.

462

she can do that, as far as I know her.

470

Okay.

Qiu Yan isn't with you, is she?

476
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,119
Mr. Xu.

477
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,199
I came here alone.

478
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,520
Alright.

479
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,040
I'll leave you to talk.

480
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,560
Excuse me.

481
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,800
What brought you here, Xiao Xi?

482
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,199
Shi Ying came to me.

483
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,560
She wished that
I could persuade you to stop.

484
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,040
But I think,

485
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,760
I am not able to do that at all.

486
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,359
Brother Qin Yue.

487
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:03,400
Do you still remember Mr. Zhao,
a teacher in our high school?

488
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,280
My head teacher.

489
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,479
The day before
we attended the College Entrance Exam,

490
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
Mr. Zhao told us that

491
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,719
the College Entrance Exam

492
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,800
was only the first ticket to the society.

493
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,520
After you got into society,
you would find that

494
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,239
many choices in your life

495
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,319
were much harder than
the College Entrance Exam.

496
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,160
He once wrote a sentence
on the blackboard.

497
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,359
Having known a lot about the world,

498
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
but still don't forget why we started.

499
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,839
That's to say,

500
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,520
he hoped that we could keep it in mind

501
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,319
the bottom line of conducting ourselves

502
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
and dealing with things.

503
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,319
I thought that between you and me,

504
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,239
there is either a decent loser

505
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:57,880
or

506
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,239
an honest winner.

507
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,000
At least, a man
should keep the bottom line.

508
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,199
Qin Yue, you know what,

509
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,640
in the business world,

510
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,520
it's all about
doing things by hook or by crook.

511
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
Actually in my eyes,

512
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:12,040
you are now no different from

513
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,199
Mr. Zhang and Xu Zhi Li.

514
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:15,880
The Qin Yue that I knew

515
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,479
was decent,

516
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,319
gentle and outstanding.

517
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,400
Everything that I did

518
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,280
was to become outstanding enough

519
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,400
to stand by your side one day.

520
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,640
But now you are

521
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,280
just a piece of pawn
disposed of by others.

522
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,280
You even have no right
to jump out of the board.

523
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,839
Alright, Mr. Tian.

524
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,359
If you change your mind,
please feel free to contact me.

525
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,119
Okay. Sorry to bother you.

526
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm back.

527
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,719
Welcome back.

528
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,880
You already knew what Qin Yue has done?

529
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,880
You also knew it?

530
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,959
Why didn't you tell me?

531
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,319
After all, he's a brother
you grew up with.

532
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,160
I didn't want you to feel sad.

533
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm not sad.

534
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,239
I'm just very angry.

535
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
Don't lie to me.

536
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,800
When I knew it,

537
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,319
I was sad as well.

538
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,760
But maybe as the old saying goes,
men die for wealth, birds die for food.

539
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,160
He must have a reason to do that.

540
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,000
Don't be sad.

541
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,860
<i>Are you available? Let's meet.</i>

542
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,640
It's been a while
since I worked out last time.

543
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,079
I've become lazy.

544
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,040
You have many social activities.

545
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,800
And you're busy.

546
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,280
What's wrong?

547
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,199
Are you okay?

548
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,520
Stop it. Get up.

549
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm fine.

550
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:07,959
Get up and rest.

551
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,800
Are you alright?

552
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,359
Do you still see me as your friend?

553
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:25,800
I knew it early on

554
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,119
that you were part of those things.

555
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,400
I didn't tell you about it before,

556
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,239
because I didn't know how to face you.

557
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,680
Qin Yue.

558
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,959
I'm really grateful to you.

559
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,079
At the turn of my life,

560
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,119
it was you who gave me a chance
to change my life.

561
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,439
So I can put it behind us,

562
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,479
no matter what you did to me before.

563
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,160
Now I want to ask you,

564
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,319
do you still think of me as a friend?

565
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Do I still deserve it?

566
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,839
If you'd rather accept Xu Zhi Li's threat,

567
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,239
than discuss it with me, your friend,

568
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,560
no one wants to be your friend.

569
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,119
I can't win every time.

570
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,319
I really don't care if I lose once.

571
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,680
But if you...

572
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:31,319
If you keep repeating your mistakes,

573
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,800
I think this would be the last time
for us to work out together.

574
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,199
Tomorrow morning,

575
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,239
there will an appointment for you
and Mr. Wang from Inflection group.

576
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:47,199
They will have an Internet testing fair
the day after tomorrow.

577
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,560
They're the organizer.

578
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,760
This opportunity is rare.

579
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,239
Make good use of it.

580
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,719
That's why

581
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,640
you called me here today.

582
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,880
Sorry. Sorry.

583
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,439
I forget it.

584
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,839
What's wrong? I can't help you now?

585
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:16,920
Thank you.

586
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,599
You are welcome.

587
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,920
Consider it

588
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,319
as my apology to you.

589
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,280
Hello.

590
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,920
Sir, what's your name?
Do you have an appointment?

591
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,079
My surname is Jiang.

592
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,520
I have an appointment with
Mr. Wang at 2:00 p.m..

593
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,760
Please take a rest aside.

594
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,599
I'll call to confirm it.

595
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,560
Okay, thank you.

596
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,880
Hello, this is the front desk.

597
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,640
Here comes Mr. Jiang.

598
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,959
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang.

599
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,359
I was just informed that

600
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,680
Mr. Wang has just got another meeting.

601
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,319
So his meeting with you today
may be canceled.

602
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,839
Really?

603
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,640
Could you confirm it?

604
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm sorry.

605
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,760
I've already confirmed it.

606
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,199
Thank you.

607
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:14,640
It's alright.

608
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,199
I know Qin Yue told you to
solicit investment from Inflection Group.

Mr. Wang of Inflection is
an old friend of my dad's.

612
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,479
If you're available, Mr. Jiang,

613
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,479
we can have dinner with Mr. Wang later.

-It was from all of you...
-Brother Zheng.

This is the money
we raised for our company.

One million and
fifty thousand yuan in total.

we can raise more money afterwards.

So now I am also a shareholder.

670
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,439
In the future,

671
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,360
you can't make
shareholders get out, right?

672
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,560
Am I right? Am I right?

673
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,040
Right.

674
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,439
Yes.

675
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:45,959
Brother Zheng.

676
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,520
I've really tried my best.

677
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,320
Although I declared strongly

678
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,840
to my dad

679
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,959
that I have to invest.

680
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,520
Not surprisingly,
he didn't give me any money.

681
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,879
I didn't get any money from my dad.

682
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,000
But,

683
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,280
I can eat less.

684
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,239
It's alright. It's alright.

685
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,080
That can serve as money.

686
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,479
You've tried your best.

687
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:04,600
-Yeah, you have.
-I have.

688
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,399
Mr. Jiang.

689
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,800
That is my own money,

690
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
nothing to do with my family.

691
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,360
We didn't discuss it with you before.

692
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,439
We all decided to raise money.
It wasn't for you,

693
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,120
but for this company.

694
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,719
After all,

695
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,399
we've made

696
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,159
much effort into it.

697
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,760
This company

698
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,280
is not only yours now.

699
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,800
So no matter what difficulties lie ahead,
we'll face it together.

700
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,439
Yeah, yeah, yeah, together, together!

701
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,840
But you also know that

702
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:38,760
one million and fifty thousand yuan
is inadequate for our company.

703
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,479
Although it's not enough,

704
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,560
it can support us for a while.

705
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:44,399
If you say that,

706
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,360
even I can't take your side.

707
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,879
Stop it!

708
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:49,239
Brother Zheng, Sis Xia has said that

709
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,879
this is our first-round financing.

710
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,000
Tomorrow, I will

711
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,439
talk to my dad again.

712
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,439
Even if he beats me to death,

713
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:58,479
I'll also invest money in it.

714
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,919
Just let me get some money for it.

715
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:01,399
That's right.

716
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
I have so many ex-girlfriends.

717
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,399
Although we didn't get together,
we're still friends.

718
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,760
If I borrow money from them with tears,

719
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,600
they would definitely do it.

720
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:09,080
Actually,

721
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,919
if you don't mind,

722
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,479
my dad can really invest in our company.

723
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,399
Jiang Zheng Han.

724
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,719
I checked our company before I came here.

725
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,560
Our company can make it.
You got to trust me.

726
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,360
As long as there is investment,
we can make money.

727
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,159
I mean it. I mean it.

728
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,639
Jiang Zheng Han,
are you underestimating me?

729
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,800
My brain alone is
at least worth billions of gold.

730
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,719
With my help,

731
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,600
we're sure to get a bigger investment.

732
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,000
That's right.

733
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,040
-Trust us.
-Right, we together

734
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,879
hold in there and we'll get over it.

735
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:32,800
Yeah.

736
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,919
We hang in there, and we'll get over it.

737
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:38,159
Once it's over, our luck will turn around.

738
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,679
Time is cost.
This small difficulty is nothing.

739
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,439
We surely can make it through.

740
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:47,080
One million and fifty thousand yuan
is inadequate.

741
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:53,560
But I've got a Letter of Investment Intent
worth ten million yuan.

742
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,439
And an invitation letter
to the testing fair.

743
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,239
Our future is unstoppable!

744
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,879
Oh, my. Is that real?

745
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,399
Jiang Zheng Han!

746
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,360
This start-up

747
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,879
is like a big gamble.

748
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,560
When we put all our hope on this career,

749
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,679
and bet we will succeed,

750
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,239
we've become hostages to this dream.

751
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:29,679
We can't help it,

752
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,479
but we will do our best.

753
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:48,503
