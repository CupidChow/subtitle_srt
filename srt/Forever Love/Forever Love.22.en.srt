21
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,520
Lin Xi.

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
Do you know that

23
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,039
I really

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,960
love you

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,320
very much.

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,399
I love you so much.

27
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,080
So much.

28
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,919
I love you.

29
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,320
I love you, too.

30
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
-Drink some ginger cola. Don't get cold.
-Thank you.

31
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,600
Don't pick me up

32
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,119
on rainy days.

33
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,559
I didn't know he was following me.

34
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,679
Are you angry?

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,119
I am not angry at you.

36
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,480
Then I will talk to him tomorrow.

37
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,559
Maybe I didn't make myself clear before.

38
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,119
Don't.

39
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,559
He is right.

40
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,799
I did not take good care of you.

41
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,279
Why didn't you take good care of me?

42
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,279
Because you didn't allow me
to bathe in the rain?

43
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,959
You stopped me from failing exams?

44
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,600
Or you picked me up
and drove me back every day?

45
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,679
And you fed me
with luxurious food every day?

46
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,000
Before I was 18,

47
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,320
my life

48
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,119
was well taken care of.

49
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,839
But I have never felt

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,640
happier than now.

51
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,160
-Lin Xi.
-We're interdependent

52
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,880
yet so independent.

53
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,600
I love you.

54
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,119
I hope that we are boyfriend

55
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,119
and girlfriend

56
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,600
who grow up together.

57
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,119
The Chicken Soup of Love sounds quite reasonable.

58
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,959
It's not like that.

59
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,160
I don't need

60
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,440
my boyfriend to protect me all the time.

61
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,200
I don't need him to be a nanny,

62
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,359
or another parent to me.

63
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,480
Sit down.

64
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
You're not angry now?

65
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,959
Good advice accepted.

66
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,239
All right.

67
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,480
Look,

68
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,559
we're using the same shampoo.

69
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,119
Does it mean that

70
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,720
my hair has the smell of you?

71
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,160
Bath gel works the same, actually.

72
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,200
In this case,

73
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,640
everyone will know I am yours.

74
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,760
Although the cycle is
longer than I expected,

75
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,559
trust me,

76
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,839
there will be both happiness

77
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,239
and wealth.

78
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,679
But could you

79
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,640
stop being so considerate and adorable?

80
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,160
Don't make it so stressful

81
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,799
to be your perfect boyfriend.

82
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,839
Mr. Jiang Zheng Re.
[*Han means cold, Re means hot]

83
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,440
I failed a subject.

84
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,799
You still think I'm excellent?

85
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:11,399
Then let me

86
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,239
make up for it tonight.

87
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,959
Senior. Senior Shi Ying.

88
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,239
In the report uploaded in the group,

89
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:37,760
there are still some problems
with the data.

90
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,880
I modified the data. What's the problem?

91
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,440
I understand that the data looks good
after being modified in that way.

92
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,599
But it really causes

93
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,280
a huge difference from the actual results.

94
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,719
The professor will figure it out.

95
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,840
The professor is so busy

96
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,000
-that she won't verify one by one.
-Senior, she...

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,440
I know your worries.

98
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,239
But I have studied
two years earlier than you.

99
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,919
And I know the teachers here
better than you do.

100
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,200
Submit the report

101
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,719
just the way it is.

102
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,200
Shouldn't you just think about work

103
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,080
during working hours?

104
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,679
I will try my best.

105
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,119
Try your best?

106
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,119
Any instructions for me, boss?

107
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,840
Why do you fall in love?

108
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,679
You should think about
some serious business.

109
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,679
If the relationship stays stable...

110
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,320
-Greater value will be created.
-Cut it out.

111
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
This is the client's
suggestions on revision.

112
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,640
-Hurry to get it done.
-Okay.

113
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,280
You can only leave after it's done.

114
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,159
Got it.

115
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,760
Mr. Xu. Sorry, Mr. Xu.

116
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Wait a minute, please, Mr. Xu.

117
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Good news, Mr. Qin.

118
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,239
Good news.

119
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,960
Mr. Xu, what a rare visitor.

120
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,359
-Do you want some...?
-No need.

121
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,760
My dad

122
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,039
has decided

123
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,640
to invest in your company.

124
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,960
And I

125
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,599
will also fully support you

126
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,799
in your project.

127
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,599
On what condition?

128
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,119
Mr. Qin, so sensible you are.

129
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:56,760
The condition is that

130
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,039
you have to find a way

131
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,799
to make Jiang Zheng Han

132
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,200
work for us.

133
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,239
I don't think it's necessary.

134
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,919
By virtue of the contacts
and technical level

135
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,559
of my current company,

136
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,960
including your future company, Mr. Xu,

137
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,359
we will be absolutely
capable to defeat XV.

138
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,679
Besides, Mr. Xu,

139
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,719
Jiang Zheng Han is just an undergraduate.

140
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,440
You're afraid of him?

141
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,159
Mr. Qin.

142
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,479
If I remember it correctly,

143
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,200
you and Jiang Zheng Han

144
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,559
seemed to be good friends before?

145
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Mr. Xu.

146
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,119
What we are talking about now

147
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,320
is business,

148
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,479
not friendship.

149
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,679
That's enough for me.

150
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,400
I have my own way

151
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,520
to get Jiang Zheng Han on our side.

152
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,719
However,

153
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,880
I need your cooperation.

154
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,919
In the USB flash drive that you gave me,

155
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,799
it is XV's

156
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,760
latest model?

157
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,159
Yeah.

158
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,640
It's created by Jiang Zheng Han,
but not released yet.

159
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,679
So you want me to

160
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,359
do this?

161
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,599
Smart.

162
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,679
As long as it gets disclosed,

163
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,280
Jiang Zheng Han will naturally

164
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,400
become XV's leaker.

165
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
As I expect,

166
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,599
XV will fire him soon.

167
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,760
What's more,

168
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,880
no one in the industry dares to hire him.

169
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,679
By then he will have nowhere else to go

170
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,479
except for my company.

171
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,719
Mr. Xu.

172
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,559
Aren't you hounding him to death?

173
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,159
Mr. Qin.

174
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,840
What we are talking about is business,

175
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,479
not friendship.

176
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,239
This is what you just said.

177
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,239
Taking a step back,

178
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,479
even if we don't need Jiang Zheng Han,

179
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,080
I've already given you the model.

180
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,400
We can develop the product

181
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,039
at the same time as XV does

182
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,599
or even one step in advance.

183
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,280
Mr. Qin.

184
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,000
You should not be worse
than Jiang Zheng Han, right?

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,719
Since we are on the same boat,

186
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,200
I will not beat around the bush.

187
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,520
I really hope this time,

188
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,799
I can cooperate with Lion Group.

189
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,159
It seems that there is no other solution

190
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,400
to the broken capital chain
of your company?

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,719
I have already told my dad, and

192
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,440
he will invest in your company

193
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,599
as soon as our project is launched.

194
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
If you don't believe me,
just go ask your father.

195
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:55,080
Mr. Qin, wish our cooperation
a pleasant one.

196
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:00,919
By the way,

197
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,679
there is something you have to do for me.

198
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:21,119
You are almost late for work, Mr. Jiang.

199
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,200
Why are you still playing this phone game?

200
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:26,200
I was afraid that
you would fall while walking,

201
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,799
so I called to remind you.

202
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:32,799
Isn't it boring?
Don't you need to pay for phone bills?

203
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,880
I am willing to do this, okay?

204
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,359
Are you playing
the domineering president lover?

205
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,520
Today is Monday.

206
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,080
I hope everything goes well
for my girlfriend on campus.

207
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
I will report my itinerary
to her at any time.

208
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,239
Are you going to

209
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,200
keep calling me until the bus stop?

210
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,719
Where are you?

211
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,479
Almost there. You can move on.

212
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,679
There is someone behind you.

213
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,880
My girlfriend.

214
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,200
Just go.

215
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
Go.

216
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Bye.

217
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,119
This is a public place, young man.

218
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,679
Shouldn't you hold it back a little bit?

219
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,880
Hearing you say that feels like

220
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,280
a womanizer talking about
the moral bottom line.

221
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,440
A stark contrast.

222
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,239
Who's a womanizer?

223
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,719
Huh?

224
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,479
Listen to me,

225
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,119
our company will hold
a project meeting this afternoon.

226
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,599
Not surprisingly,

227
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,239
the main project for the next phase

228
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,359
will be the one we're working on.

229
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,080
Check it again carefully

230
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,599
before the meeting starts.

231
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,000
Make sure that there is no mistake.

232
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,520
No worries. I've checked it.

233
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,239
We are using a new type of module, right?

234
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,799
Coupling between models is inevitable.

235
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,799
Does your part of the problem

236
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,479
need post-maintenance?

237
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,640
In fact, I think the current problem

238
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,280
is mainly data cleaning.

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,559
We can try the improved model.

240
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,559
Well, didn't you say that
you can't graduate if not

241
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,760
handing in your homework?

242
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,679
Yes.

243
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,440
No homework today?

244
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I should have.

245
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,560
But you asked me to come here.

246
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,359
It's okay.

247
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,599
I've asked the professor for a leave.

248
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,079
My girlfriend will hand it in for me.

249
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,800
But there will be
a project meeting tomorrow.

250
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,280
How about this?

251
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,319
Today I will give you a day off.

252
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,640
Put together your thoughts

253
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,439
before dinner

254
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,000
and send it to me via email.

255
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,400
No need to elaborate it,

256
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
just a brief summary.

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,239
Really?

258
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,400
Well, stay with your girlfriend.

259
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,520
Do your duty as a boyfriend.

260
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,479
No words can express my gratitude.

261
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:50,400
Hurry to go before I change my mind.

262
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,959
Come early tomorrow.

263
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,959
Womanizer...

264
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,640
Xie.

265
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,439
Good for you.

266
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,599
You finished the project so quickly.

267
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,479
Yes.

268
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,199
The theme project for next phase

269
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,439
will definitely be yours.

270
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,640
You gotta treat us, Mr. Xie.

271
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,880
Jiang Zheng Han

272
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,079
is the main developer of this project.

273
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,280
The credit should be on him.

274
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,800
So, Jiang

275
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,640
is really so promising.

276
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,119
He is indeed talented.

277
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,280
But it is mainly because of

278
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,439
my leadership.

279
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,800
I find that our conversation just now

280
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,959
resembles the Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

281
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,680
Mr. and Mrs. is accurate.
Hits the nail on the head.

282
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,680
I find that
your proficiency in using idioms

283
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,239
-has improved greatly recently.
-Of course.

284
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,599
To write poems with your dad,

285
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,199
my idiom skills must be improved.

286
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,439
How is the project doing?

287
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,920
Full of difficulties.

288
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,079
But everything will be alright.

289
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,640
You sleep so late and wake up so early.

290
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,239
You have to control the tempo.

291
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,599
You can't always be like this.

292
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,520
Why are you making a grimace
out of my face?

293
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,760
Because I am uglier.

294
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,920
Mr. Xie.

295
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,119
Why so panic?

296
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,920
What?

297
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,680
-Wait a moment.
-Okay.

298
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,760
A phone call.

299
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Hello.

300
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,880
Secretary Huang.

301
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,719
Okay, got it.

302
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,880
I will be back now.

303
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,280
What's the matter?

304
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,359
I can't send you back to school.

305
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,760
Something happened in the company.

306
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,880
I have to go back and deal with it.

307
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,319
Is it serious?

308
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,119
It's okay.

309
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,479
I will take care of it.

310
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,160
Be careful.

311
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,839
I have to go.

312
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,280
Okay.

313
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,119
-Send me a message when you are there.
-Okay.

314
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
How was it leaked?

315
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,000
Leave us first.

316
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,800
No time to explain.

317
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,880
They are waiting for us.

318
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,520
Boss,

319
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
I didn't do it.

320
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,719
Stop watching.

321
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,000
Mind your own business.

322
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,520
Mr. Xie, please.

323
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,839
Jiang Zheng Han.

324
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,400
For what you did,

325
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,119
our company's senior executives
felt disappointed.

326
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,479
May I ask,

327
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,239
what did I commit?

328
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,560
How dare you ask?

329
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,439
You posted the information on GitHub.

330
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,719
You leaked a product

331
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,319
that our company is about to launch.

332
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,280
Now the competing company

333
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,000
has our models.

334
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,000
Our company and our teams' efforts

335
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,839
of several months are all paid in vain.

336
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,839
You are the worst programmer
I have ever seen.

337
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,640
Our company focused on
training you, an intern.

338
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:40,000
But your nasty behavior
has failed everyone!

339
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
Everyone! You know?

340
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,319
Mr. Cao.

341
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,439
You don't need to go so far.

342
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,160
It has not been confirmed yet.

343
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:55,119
There is no need to
blame him so furiously.

344
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,000
Jiang Zheng Han.

345
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,280
Do you have anything to say?

346
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,719
Yes.

347
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,400
If I meant to divulge the private key,

348
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,599
I would never use
such an untechnical method

349
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,719
like uploading it to GitHub.

350
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,760
Secondly,

351
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,719
I would not propose over
a dozen improvements

352
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,760
before disseminating our company's model.

353
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,800
Besides,

354
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,040
the private key was handled by many people

355
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,599
before I came here.

356
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:34,959
Apart from me,
many other people could also leak it.

357
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I hope that our company

358
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,439
could investigate the matter carefully.

359
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:47,400
You should save this speech to the police.

360
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,880
Whoever it is, I have a clear conscience.

361
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,839
Mr. Liu.

362
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,520
If our company insists to call the police,

363
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,359
I will cooperate with them

364
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,400
to investigate until the truth comes out.

365
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,560
See?

366
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,119
See that, all of you?

367
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,520
He is not that capable,

368
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,680
but as a robber,
so good at playing the cop.

369
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,000
Enough.

370
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,719
Calm down.

371
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,000
Mr. Cao.

372
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,719
Please go out with Jiang Zheng Han first.

373
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,479
I will have a talk with Mr. Xie alone.

374
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,160
Jiang Zheng Han.

375
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,880
Now it's only us.

376
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,239
I'm wondering

377
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,959
if I should remind you of something.

378
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,319
If you are not sure
whether you should or not,

379
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,319
just forget it.

380
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,040
Hey.

381
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,599
Do you know the thing has become huge?

382
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,560
It is fermenting on
our company's intranet.

383
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,160
And tomorrow, no,

384
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,280
perhaps today,

385
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,359
your disclosure of the private key

386
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,880
will be known to everyone

387
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,319
in the industry.

388
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,199
By then your future will be ruined.

389
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,319
In fact, as an intern,

390
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,719
you should not be held responsible.

391
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,959
You are young and skilled.

392
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:57,439
I believe you would not
take the initiative to make mistakes.

393
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,719
What do you mean by

394
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,479
taking the initiative to make mistakes?

395
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,359
Xie Ping Chuan

396
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,560
is experienced

397
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,680
at a high position with
a wide network of contacts.

398
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,040
If he is unwilling

399
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,439
to suffer in XV,

400
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:15,640
it is normal for many hunters outside

401
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,239
to poach him away.

402
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,760
But you are different.

403
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,959
Now there is a chance.

404
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,119
You usually stay with him.

405
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,959
You can tell me

406
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,599
whatever he does

407
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,079
and whoever he gets along with.

408
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,680
Don't worry.

409
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,640
I can definitely

410
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
keep your position in XV.

411
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,119
Sorry for letting you down.

412
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,319
I can't do

413
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,959
such a thing.

414
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,880
And I really don't know

415
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,880
what Mr. Xie has done.

416
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Don't think that
if you don't betray others,

417
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,680
they won't betray you.

418
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,839
Never stand in the wrong team

419
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,079
in the workplace.

420
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,280
I don't want to stand in anyone's team.

421
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,800
I just want to walk my own way

422
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,880
and keep my own rules.

423
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,599
Fine.

424
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,560
You are really a student.

425
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay, I shall stop talking.

426
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,800
What are you going to do with this matter?

427
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,280
Dig it deep to find out the truth.

428
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,319
Jiang Zheng Han could never have done that.

429
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,880
Well...

430
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,400
How to find out the truth?

431
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,880
Our company didn't publicize it
in the first place.

432
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,359
What does it mean?

433
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,760
They don't want to make it clear.

434
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,319
If you really want to dig,

435
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,800
it will not be good for you.

436
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,239
But it is a project

437
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,439
that has not been launched officially.

438
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So there is no need to investigate.

439
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,880
Jiang Zheng Han

440
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,520
is just an intern.

441
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,119
According to our company's
articles of association,

442
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,880
he must be fired this time.

443
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,800
You and he are not relatives.

444
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,920
I advise you not to act on impulse,

445
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
but to keep your own nose clean.

446
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,800
Then you can have room for manoeuvre.

447
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,119
Most people feel that their talent

448
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,800
and ambitions are not paid off

449
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,160
for their entire life.

450
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,760
Then they start

451
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,119
becoming cynical.

452
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,319
Fortunately, we are both those kind

453
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,599
that take upon ourselves.

454
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,280
Ping Chuan, say something.

455
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
What do you think about the matter?

456
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,800
Keep my own nose clean

457
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,560
and make an undergraduate the scapegoat?

458
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,520
All right.

459
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,199
Think it over yourself.

460
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,640
I have said everything
that should be said or not.

461
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,319
I'm doing it for your own good.

462
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,479
The senior management
will talk to you later.

463
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,599
It's up to yourself.

464
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,239
-Morning, senior.
-Morning.

465
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,920
-Well...
-Senior Qian, why are you back?

466
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,359
I sneaked back.

467
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,400
Where is Jiang?

468
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,719
He is not here.

469
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,839
Not here... Go ahead.

470
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,560
What's wrong with Jiang Zheng Han?

471
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,719
Nothing, nothing.

472
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,640
Senior.

473
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,880
Did anything happen to Jiang Zheng Han?

474
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,520
Well, it's...

475
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,400
Something happened to XV.

476
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,640
It's said that the secret key
of their software was leaked.

477
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
And it was done
by an intern from our university,

478
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,680
which is Jiang.

479
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,319
I don't know
who posted it on the Internet.

480
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,280
Now the whole industry knows.

481
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,160
Here, take a seat. Listen.

482
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:27,560
Now there is a post

483
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,880
with tens of thousands of likes
on the Internet.

484
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,560
<i>An intern of Jing Hua University
revealed XV's business secrets.</i>

485
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,400
<i>Shocking inside information!</i>
See?

486
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,079
This one,

487
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,880
Jiang snatched the resources
of his colleagues

488
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,719
and stole the company's information.

489
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:39,640
And he imitated and plagiarize
a model of his predecessors.

490
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,839
Most importantly,

491
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,599
big-shots in the industry
are gonna block him.

492
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:48,040
But it has been dealt with.

493
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,000
Our university

494
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,920
has already contacted XV.

495
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,319
Professor Shi was also there.

496
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:53,719
Well...

497
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,000
You...

498
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,920
-Don't worry.
-Senior, I have to go.

499
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,520
Hey, you...

500
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,079
Hey.

501
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,119
Xiao Xi.

502
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,160
Xiao Xi.

503
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,160
Qiu Yan.

504
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,719
Professor Wu is looking for you.

505
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,040
Hurry to go there with me.

506
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:11,880
Qiu Yan.

507
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,119
I got something urgent.

508
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,640
Could you help me deal with it first?

509
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,160
No, you have to go there.

510
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,880
Professor Wu is
already angry in the office.

511
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,079
She asked to see you.

512
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,800
Now, come with me.

513
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,920
I really have something urgent to do...

514
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,800
Something happened to Jiang Zheng Han.

515
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,079
Leave Jiang Zheng Han aside.

516
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,119
Professor Wu is really angry.

517
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,560
I can't make it there.

518
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,360
<i>Financial Figures</i>

519
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,210
<i>Development Plan</i>

520
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,270
<i>The Sum-of-the-years-digits Method</i>

521
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,920
Why would this happen?

522
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,319
Professor Wu,

523
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,000
as the team leader,

524
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,760
I must admit that it's my negligence.

525
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,959
Because I've seen

526
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:53,079
Xia Lin Xi's computing ability before,

527
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,239
I made her in charge of

528
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,239
the work of statistics.

529
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,680
Fortunately, I took a look in advance.

530
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,680
If such a report is sent out,

531
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,640
how do you think other teachers

532
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,920
will view our project?

533
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,520
How would the companies

534
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,160
that we work with view our university?

535
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,400
Have you ever thought about

536
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
how much loss and negative influence

537
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,359
will your mistakes

538
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,079
bring to our university

539
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,040
and our major?

540
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,000
Xia Lin Xi

541
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,760
might have not realized its severeness.

542
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,959
So she didn't take it seriously.

543
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,079
But I don't think she meant to do that.

544
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Professor Wu, are you looking for me?

545
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,439
Xia Lin Xi.

546
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,760
Here you are.

547
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,599
Did you calculate this data?

548
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,520
You could say so.

549
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,040
Could say so?

550
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,839
Look at what you did!

551
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,760
How could this be the level of students
from our Jing Hua University?

552
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,920
It's all fancy data here and there.

553
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,319
But the real data is full of loopholes.

554
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:02,760
Are you fooling me?

555
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,160
Professor Wu, here is the thing.

556
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,760
I have long known that

557
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,079
there are huge loopholes in this data,

558
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,160
and I have already told senior Shi Ying.

559
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,319
Senior.

560
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,000
Aren't you going to explain it?

561
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,119
Xia Lin Xi.

562
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,439
Project learning

563
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,119
tests your personal ability

564
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,680
and teamwork ability.

565
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,119
I didn't expect you

566
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,319
to be so anxious to pass the buck

567
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,280
when something went wrong.

568
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,959
Professor,

569
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,959
I didn't say that I am not responsible.

570
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:31,560
But it is meaningless

571
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,719
to hold anyone accountable now.

572
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,520
This is another report I made

573
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,640
based on the real data analysis.

574
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,839
Please have a look.

575
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,050
<i>Data Comparison By Year</i>

576
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,319
There is no problem

577
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,280
with this data.

578
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,680
Okay, that's it.

579
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,479
Lin Xi, add the new data
into your project's

580
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:09,160
powerpoint as soon as possible.

581
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,160
Such data is fine

582
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,400
for any company.

583
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,599
We are done here.

584
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,359
-Then I am leaving.
-Okay.

585
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,439
Shi Ying, stay here.

586
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,319
I must prove my innocence.

587
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,560
They won't give you time.

588
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,160
They are deliberately framing me up!

589
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:56,760
Fine.

590
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,400
I'll handle it myself.

591
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,760
Thank you for
taking care of me these days.

592
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,600
They are using me as a gunman.

593
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,639
Be careful.

594
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,040
I saw the news about Jiang Zheng Han.

595
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,600
Is that why you
went out in a hurry just now?

596
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,460
<i>I saw the news about Jiang Zheng Han.</i>

597
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,360
<i>Is that why you
went out in a hurry just now?</i>

598
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,120
What is going on with
Jiang Zheng Han, Xiao Xi?

599
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Is he okay?

600
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,170
<i>What is going on with
Jiang Zheng Han, Xiao Xi?</i>

601
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,600
Sis Xia, what's going on?

602
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,919
Mom.

603
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,679
I have heard about
what happened to Jiang Zheng Han.

604
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,919
No discussion this time.

605
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,080
You have to break up right away.

606
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,399
What's up?

607
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,199
Stop pretending.

608
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,360
It is all over the Internet.

609
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,760
You don't know that?

610
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,639
He stole the secret key

611
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,520
and leaked the company's information.

612
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,959
He has no future

613
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:25,000
in the industry.

614
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,080
My friend doing E-commerce
in Beining told me that

615
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,199
the senior management
of XV handled it themselves.

616
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,360
He has been blocked
by the entire industry.

617
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,159
Mom, I believe him.

618
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,919
He has no future at all.

619
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,600
What he did back in high school

620
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,919
already tells that he

621
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,560
is eager for quick success.

622
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,760
So I am not surprised at

623
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,600
what he has done now.

624
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,760
Why are you so stubborn?

625
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,239
It's something between me and him.

626
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,760
Mom, stay out of it.

627
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,280
I am your mom.

628
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:03,239
I have the right to remind you.

629
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,840
Mom.

630
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,239
I am an adult now.

631
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,679
I also have the right
to make my own judgment.

632
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,560
You've really grown up, huh?

633
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:16,959
Mom.

634
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,040
I know you are for my good.

635
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,879
But now I want to be

636
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,600
who I want to be,

637
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,439
not what you shape into.

638
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,600
I've chosen this way myself.

639
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:33,040
Even if I encounter
any setbacks in the future,

640
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,159
I will try my best to overcome them.

641
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,760
Mom.

642
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,479
If Jiang Zheng Han

643
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:45,040
really has no future,

644
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,239
I will support him.

645
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,199
Fine.

646
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,800
Think about how to live on your own first!

647
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,120
<i>Shocking inside information!</i>

648
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,250
<i>An intern of Jing Hua University

650
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,360
Qiu Yan, what can we do?

651
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,959
Xiao Xi still doesn't answer the phone.

652
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,479
How is Jiang Zheng Han?

653
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,959
No news, either.

654
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,600
Xiao Xi must be anxious

655
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,360
as such a huge thing
happened to Jiang Zheng Han.

656
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:44,199
I don't know anything
about their industry.

657
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,959
We still have to find someone for help.

658
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,560
Oh, right.

659
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,320
Chen Yi Chuan

660
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,159
is in the same major with Jiang Zheng Han.

661
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:54,040
He can definitely help us.

662
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,879
Qiu Yan.

663
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,159
Can you go ask Chen Yi Chuan?

664
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
Xiao Man.

665
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,639
You should.

666
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,679

to help Jiang Zheng Han.

670
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,679
Okay.

671
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,919
Then go ahead.

672
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,360
I will go to Chen Yi Chuan.

673
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,080

Come in.

680
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,280
What is our company going to do with me?

681
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:51,320
Your internship agreement
has been annulled.

682
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,120
You will be suspended for investigation

683
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,719
and wait for our company's final decision.

684
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,959
If I have a way

685
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,080
to prove my innocence,

686
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,520
is it possible to withdraw the decision?

687
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,600
Even if you prove your innocence,

688
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,479
the impact has already taken place.

689
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,760
No one cares what you did.

690
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,040
So now I don't even

691
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,520
have the right to tell the truth, right?

692
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,239
I cannot accept

693
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,479
such a decision.

694
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,360
The so-called truth

695
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:34,439
in this industry

696
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:37,560
is just what the higher-ups want to hear.

697
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,159
No one cares about

698
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,679
your so-called innocence

699
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,479
and whether you accept it or not.

700
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,879
Young man.

701
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,639
Don't think too highly of yourself.

702
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,919
I don't believe that trusted aids

703
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:51,520
will always be eliminated
in this industry.

704
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,120
If this is really our company's decision,

705
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,800
it will not be a pity for me to be fired.

706
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,520
You young people always

707
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,360
regard yourselves as wind,

708
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,520
while others are grass.

709
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:11,000
But listen to me,

710
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,840
in fact,

711
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,800
we are all grass.

712
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,719
Where the wind above blows,

713
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,439
where we will follow.

714
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,360
Bear this in mind.

715
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Jiang Zheng Han,

716
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,360
you can go back to the university

717
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,560
to continue your study attentively.

718
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,239
Anyway, it is impossible for me to admit

719
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
anything that I have never done before.

720
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,600
Don't be too lofty-minded, young man.

721
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,239
Do you know that for your sake, Mr. Xie...

722
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,080
Liu!

723
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:59,104
