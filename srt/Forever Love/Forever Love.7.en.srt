How should he say that I'm not his type?

His EQ is particularly low.

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,880
He doesn't have a love string in his head.

45

How could he know what type he likes?

Yes.

What's wrong with me? I'm fine.

163
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Really, dad?

164
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm really fine!

165
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,519
If so, I'll go to surf the Internet
with my friends.

166
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,519
Surf the Internet?

167
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,160
Listen to me,

168
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,359
after the kebabs,

169
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,880
I'll go there with you.

170
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Really?

171
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,880
Ah!

172
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,520
-I've made it!
-Great!

173
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,239
Mom, I got to call Xiao Xi right now.

174
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,919
-Maybe we can go to the same university!
-Right, right, right.

175
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,679
Hey, Dad.

176
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,559
Buddha bless us. Let her
be admitted to a good university.

177
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,799
Hey, what are you doing?

178
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,080
Let's do worship together! Ex-voto!

179
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,919
Do worship now! Hurry up! Hurry up!

180
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,440
-Oh, okay, do worship.
-Hurry up.

181
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Okay, okay. Ex-voto, ex-voto.

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,520
Ex-voto.

183
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,320
Thank you, Buddha!

184
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,239
All right. Stop saying that.

185
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,760
Both of them can go to Jing Hua University.
Now everybody is happy.

186
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,039
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Right, right.

187
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
We should dine out, right?

188
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,799
Oh, yes.

189
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,119
Sure, find a good place.

190
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:04,880
Go, go, go.

191
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
Go, go, go. Let's go quickly.

192
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
Hurry up, kids.

193
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,000
Go, go, go, let's go.

194
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,359
Wow.

195
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,200
Seven hundred and twelve,
seven hundred and twelve.

196
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,110
<i>Contacts</i>

197
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,110
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>

198
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,850
<i>Typing...</i>

199
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,540
<i>My score is enough for Jing Hua University!!!</i>

200
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
<i>Deleting the message...</i>

201
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,799
And this one.

202
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,400
I put books here for you.

203
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,599
God. How could you fold it up like this?

204
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,239
It's done, see?

205
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,400
Come on, come on, this one.

206
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,479
I put all your summer clothes here.

207
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,039
I think the sweaters aren't enough.

208
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,159
I'll find you some more.

209
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,039
Okay.

210
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,080
Right. Find more, find more.

211
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,320
The summer vacation that followed
the College Entrance Exam

212
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,359
passed very quickly.

213
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,080
But, before going to Jing Hua University,

214
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,000
the person I wanted to see

215
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,919
never showed up.

216
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,599
Gu Xiao Man and Chen Yi Chuan are waiting
for me in front of the community gate.

217
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,200
Dad, just leave me here.
I can do it by myself.

218
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,880
Alas.

219
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,640
Well,

220
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,599
your ID card, cell phone,

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,919
and the ticket,

222
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,640
put them away. Don't lose them.

223
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,440
Um.

224
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,559
When you get there,

225
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,000
if you find something missing,
call me as soon as you can.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,400
Okay.

227
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,280
This is the first time
for you to leave home.

228
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,239
But you insist on
not letting us accompany you.

229
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:06,440
I've made a deal with
Chen Yi Chuan and Gu Xiao Man.

230
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,640
Don't worry, okay?

231
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,440
The point is, I want to go there with you
and play around in Jing Hua University.

232
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:17,119
Well, when you have time,
come to visit me.

233
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:19,679
Hey, what are you murmuring
to each other over there?

234
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Nothing.

235
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,159
I'm talking about Jing Hua University, no...

236
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,719
It's cold in Beining.

237
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,239
Have you brought enough sweaters?

238
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,239
Yes, I have.

239
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,520
Don't say all that useless stuff.

240
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,440
I've already informed your brother Qin Yue.

241
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,719
-If you have any problems there, go to him.
-Um.

242
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,960
Okay.

243
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,080
Well, I got to tell you that

244
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,679
I want to see your name

245
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,760
on the scholarship list this year.

246
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,880
-What a person you are.
-Okay.

247
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,000
Xiao Xi is a university student now.

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,919
Yet you still focus on the scores.

249
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,640
She's going to study
rather than on vacation.

250
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,440
If not her scores, what else
should I pay attention to?

251
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,239
Playing with stupid rocks all day long,
just like you?

252
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,799
-Can our girl be admitted to Jing Hua University?
-Dad, mom.

253
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,719
Don't worry about me.

254
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,960
Dad.

255
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,840
You're always away from home.
But when you're at home,

256
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,520
remember to make some porridge for my mom.

257
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,840
She has an upset stomach.

258
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,520
Mom.

259
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,200
I will study hard.

260
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,400
However,

261
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,599
my dad only comes home once a month.

262
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,359
Don't always quarrel with him.

263
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,280
Look.

264
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,200
Our kid has grown up
since she knows to care about us.

265
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,400
Rest easy.

266
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,520
Tongue still knocks against the teeth.

267
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,280
Your mom and I,
we get on well with each other.

268
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,080
Who gets on well with you?

269
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,239
Don't tell me what to do with your dad.
It's not your problem.

270
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,080
Study hard and make sure
you'll get good scores.

271
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,719
No one will supervise over you
in the university.

272
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,080
You must discipline yourself.

273
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,520
You should go now. Go.

274
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,280
Go, go, go.

275
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,000
-Go, go, go.
-Go, go, go.

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hurry up, it's too late.

277
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,840
Don't worry, it's okay.

278
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,280
Dad, mom. You can leave me here.

279
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,239
I can do it.

280
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,159
Okay.

281
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,200
-They've been waiting for a long time.
-Um.

282
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,479
Let's stop nagging.

283
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,719
-Come on, give me a hug.
-Okay.

284
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,280
-Mom.
-Um.

285
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,760
-Take care of yourself.
-I will.

286
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,080
Call me if you need anything.

287
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,679
Okay.

288
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,440
I'm leaving.

289
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,760
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

290
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,400
Before 18 years old,

291
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:40,479
I was always well-behaved and following

292
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
the path carefully designed by my parents.

293
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,400
Afterwards,

294
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,000
they'll still stay where they were.

295
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,440
I'll walk down the rest of the way

296
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,559
all by myself.

297
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,470
<i>Beining</i>

298
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,080
According to seniors,

299
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,960
you had a girlfriend back in high school.

300
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,919
Where the hell are you taking me now?

301
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,159
Well, to a small coal pit
for illegal work.

302
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,119
Are you scared?

303
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm scared to death.

304
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,159
Stop the car ahead.

305
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm getting off.

306
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:51,200
Just leaving like this? Not your style.

307
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,039
When you arrive in Beining,
you're in my territory.

308
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,080
The professor worried that
you couldn't find a place to stay.

309
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,719
So I took the good chance to volunteer

310
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,280
and let you stay at my house
for a few days.

311
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,760
What do you mean by good chance?

312
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,320
A good chance to fleece me?

313
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,080
Say it,

314
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,960
how much is the rent?

315
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,760
Why do you always think about money?

316
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,559
Then you let me live there for free?

317
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,919
Not for free.

318
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,239
Wow.

319
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,239
Unexpectedly,
I've got an all-around roommate.

320
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,599
Sit down there.

321
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Just wait for dinner.

322
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,080
Yum.

323
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,559
You're good at cooking.

324
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,799
Say it,

325
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,119
what are the difficulties in your project?

326
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,479
Alas...

327
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,719
Since you say that,

328
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,359
I shall not beat around the bush with you.

329
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,559
While you're living in my house,

330
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,000
help me finish this project.

331
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,039
Otherwise, I have to
quit the circle of programming.

332
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,679
-Quit the circle of programming?
-Um.

333
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,400
Don't pretend to be helpless.

334
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,919
You tell me the terms first.

335
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,760
Otherwise, no deal.

336
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:14,840
Okay.

337
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,119
So here's the deal.

338
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,320
I won't charge you rent.

339
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,039
You will be paid as usual.

340
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,000
But, work starts tomorrow.

341
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,760
Deal.

342
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,919
However, I accept half of the pay.

343
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,039
The other half goes to rent.

344
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:29,880
Okay.

345
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,280
Er, but I have some

346
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,599
personal affairs tomorrow.

347
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
So can we start work
the day after tomorrow?

348
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,760
But I won't delay the progress.

349
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,400
Okay?

350
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,159
Personal affairs refer to

351
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,359
your girlfriend?

352
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,559
Sort of.

353
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,039
Sort of? That means

354
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,599
not yet.

355
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,160
How are you going to confess your love?

356
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,000
Confess my love?

357
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,160
I've never thought of it.

358
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,920
But to confess,

359
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,520
if you were me, what would you do?

360
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,359
If I were you...

361
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,079
In a relationship,
it's simply buying breakfast,

362
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,880
picking her up
and sending her back to the dorm.

363
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,920
In short, to moisten everything
silently and softly. Daily happiness.

364
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,119
Wow.

365
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,800
Could you be more vulgar?

366
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,199
All right,
I can't get anything useful from you.

367
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,479
Nowadays,
when we young people fall in love,

368
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,040
we are very straightforward.

369
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,319
Silently and softly, how could it work?

370
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,479
Straightforward?

371
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,599
That's the domineering president's style.

372
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,359
Different people have different ways.

373
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
Fine.

374
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,280
But, let's make a deal first.

375
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,319
Don't follow me tomorrow.

376
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,800
I won't follow you tomorrow.

377
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,680
-I also need to meet a girl tomorrow.
-Yo.

378
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,479
Well, I wish you a speedy success.

379

00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,719
What is your star sign?

492
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,800
In which year were you born?

493
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,839
Hmm, senior.

494
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:21,319
You must be very busy with the induction.

495
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,599
I can walk on my own.
Don't worry about me.

496
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,479
I'm not busy.

497
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,359
Hey, if I leave you today,
I will definitely regret it.

498
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,400
How about

499
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,439
this?

500
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,640
Let's have lunch together.

501
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,680
Then, let's get to know each other better.

502
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,439
What do you think?

503
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,839
Senior, I'm not interested in knowing you.

504
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,520
Hey, interest can be cultivated.

505
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,040
Senior, here is the thing.

506
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,359
I have been to Jing Hua University before.

507
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,119
I can find the dorm by myself.

508
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,439
-Let me help you.
-No need.

509
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,800
-Let me help you.
-Give me back my luggage.

510
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,280
I can do it by myself.

511
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,040
He Guang Yu.

512
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,520
-Brother Qin Yue?
-Qin Yue?

513
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,119
Why is he here?

514
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,439
Don't bother with this.

515
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,520
You two know each other?

516
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,000
They really deserve to be the couple
that I've been supporting for three years.

517
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,359
How handsome he is.

518
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,560
This is called a hero saving a beauty.

519
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,959
Do watch and learn.

520
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,640
So boring.

521
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,239
Senior Qin Yue.

522
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,560
I'm heading to the dorm now.

523
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,239
Okay, see you later.

524
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Hey, sis, let me take you
to the dorm as well.

525
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,920
No need, thanks.

526
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:31,959
Let's go.

527
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,000
Qin Yue.

528
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,239
Can you keep the rules?

529
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:37,400
I met Lin Xi first.

530
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,439
You have no sense of shame? Once you came,
you held her hand directly.

531
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,079
Are you her boyfriend?

532
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,760
Xiao Xi is a sister to me who has been
living next door since childhood.

533
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,719
We grew up together hand in hand.

534
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,599
He Guang Yu, listen,

535
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,920
don't pester girls as you like,

536
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
especially her.

537
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,760
If you dare approach her again,

538
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,319
don't blame me for treating you badly.

539
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,119
Xiao Xi, I envy you so much.

540
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,760
Stop talking.

541
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:06,880
Are you threatening me as
President of the Student Union?

542
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,760
You haven't learned well ideology and morality
over the past three years.

543
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,560
I do suggest you to study it again.

544
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,160
Otherwise, you'll really
let down your professor.

545
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,280
Say that again?

546
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,439
Xiao Xi, let's go.

547
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,199
Okay.

548
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:19,839
Hey?

549
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,640
What does he mean?

550
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,319
There's a convenience store over there.

551
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,119
We usually go there to buy stuffs.

552
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,920
-Oh, okay.
-Then look right. It's the cafeteria.

553
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,119
And this is the dorm for you freshmen.

554
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,680
Er, my dorm is here. So I'll get inside first.

555
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
-Hey, Xiao Man...
-Senior, bye-bye.

556
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,400
Look, that's Qin Yue,
President of the Student Union.

557
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,000
Who is that girl?

558
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,479
Well, brother Qin Yue,
I'll take my luggage by myself.

559
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,520
It's okay. You must be tired
after walking all the way.

560
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,160
I'll carry it for you.

561
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,199
I'm not tired.

562
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,160
Okay, then.

563
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:02,959
Let's go.

564
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,160
Hey, Qin Yue.

565
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,479
Hey, what a coincidence.

566
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,760
You're in the dorm as well.

567
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,880
Well, you rarely come back.

568
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,119
Have you finished your project?

569
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,199
Well, not yet.

570
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,959
I just returned to the dorm
for some stuff.

571
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,079
Okay.

572
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,439
Oh, let me introduce.

573
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,680
This is Shi Ying.

574
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,599
She is a senior in your dept,

575
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:23,359
the only girl in the computer varsity
of Jing Hua University.

576
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,439
-She's also Vice-president of the Student Union.
-Oh.

577
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,520
-This is Lin Xi. She is my...
-Hello, senior.

578
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,479
I was a junior to Qin Yue in high school.

579
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:32,359
I'm also a freshman in the Dept
of Economics & Management this year.

580
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,359
Glad to meet you.

581
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,760
Er, Lin Xi, right?

582
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,199
-Well, let me help you take this upstairs.
-Okay.

583
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,680
-You're a boy, it's not...
-Not today.

584
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,239
The university just opens today.

585
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:43,160
Aren't boys allowed to
enter the girls' dorm?

586
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,640
It's not easy for you to
carry such a heavy luggage.

587
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,400
-Right.
-Let's go.

588
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,920
Okay.

589
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,359
Well, would you like to
have dinner together?

590
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Consider it as a way to welcome Lin Xi?

591
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,479
I have things to do this afternoon.
Maybe some other day?

592
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,319
I'll treat you to a nice meal then.

593
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,000
-Great.
-Okay.

594
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,319
-We're leaving. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

595
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,319
Bye-bye.

596
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:07,280
Xiao Xi, there are
many mosquitoes in the dorm.

597
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,560
I'll help you put up a net.

598
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,920
When you use it,
just take it down by yourself.

599
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,400
Well, brother Qin Yue,
you don't have to help me.

600
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,199
Don't you have something to do this afternoon?
You can leave to deal with it.

601
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,199
It's okay. There's still some time.

602
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:16,959
I've finally arrived.

603
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:17,439
Okay.

604
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,199
Hey.

605
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,119
-It's you.
-Hello, my name is Xia Lin Xi.

606
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,239
Hello, I'm Zhuang Fei.

607
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,199
Well, you guys continue to do your things.
I'm going to tidy up mine.

608
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,040
Xiao Xi.

609
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,959
Your roommate is also here.
Why don't you guys talk for a while?

610
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,319
Anyway, it's almost done.

611
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,599
If you need anything, just give me a call.

612
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,920
-I'll leave first.
-Okay.

613
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,160
Let me see you off.

614
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,079
-Okay.
-Um.

615
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,280
Well, by the way...

616
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,239
Hello, president.

617
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,079
Hello.

618
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,920
-Hello, president.
-Hello.

619
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,920
You should prepare well...

620
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,719
-...for the entrance ceremony in the afternoon.
-Um.

621
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,280
In the evening,
I'll show you around the university.

622
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,920
Okay.

623
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,079
-Then I'm leaving.
-Um.

624
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,280
They look quite familiar with each other.

625
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,880
Who is she?

626
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,479
Once she came, she has conquered
the strongest fort of Jing Hua University.

627
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,040
As a sophomore,

628
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,760
so far I haven't said a word to
President Qin, the Prince Charming.

629
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,239
Hey, nowadays, junior sisters

630
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,880
are really more capable than one another.

631
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,719
Exactly.

632
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,520
-What a coincidence.
-Well...

633
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:27,760
Hmm?

634
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,079
I just ran into you

635
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,359
at the gate of our university.

636
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,479
-Did you?
-Um.

637
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,239
-I'm sorry. I didn't notice you.
-It's okay.

638
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,479
-Well...
-Hmm?

639
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,479
These are some local specialties
from my hometown.

640
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,199
My mom asked me to bring them here
to share with my roommates.

641
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,079
Thank you,
I've also brought some specialties here.

642
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,199
Let's eat them together.

643
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,560
Well...

644
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,800
The boy just now is your boyfriend?

645
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,599
-No, just neighbors back home.
-Hello.

646
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,040
Hello.

647
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,119
You didn't dump the rubbish?
Smells so bad.

648
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,920
Sorry about that.

649
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,000
Hello! I'm Chu Qiu Yan.

650
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,680
Hello, my name is Xia Lin Xi.

651
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,560
I'm Zhuang Fei.

652
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,040
Hey, where is the fourth girl?

653
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:28,040
We live with a senior sister.

654
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
She said she's often outside
doing projects.

655
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,280
So she doesn't come back often.

656
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,079
Oh, by the way,

657
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,920
my mom prepared a lot of
imported snacks for me.

658
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,160
You guys can try them.

659
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,839
This biscuit with cheese, my mom
has also brought me some from abroad.

660
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,680
I like them very much.

661
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,760
It's good since you like them.

662
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,400
You can have one, too.

663
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,079
Er, I... I don't eat sweet things.

664
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,479
Salty cookies.

665
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,880
Hmm, thank you.

666
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,239
I don't eat snacks.

667
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,000
Oh, fine.

668
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,479
Hey, by the way,

669
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,239
let's go out for a meal later,
the three of us.

670
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:03,280
I've done tips for
all the restaurants in the city.

671
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:06,719
Would you like to
have western food or seafood?

672
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,839
-You're a local?
-Yes.

673
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,880
Oh.

674
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:12,560
From now on,
if you have any life problems,

675
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,599
you can ask me.

676
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,479
Then, let's eat outside.

677
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,839
Well, I... I'll pass.

678
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,880
I'll go to the cafeteria later.

679
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,640
I also asked my high school classmates
to have lunch with me.

680
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,199
Okay.

681
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,760
-Then, we'll eat outside another day.
-Um.

682
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,719
It seems that I can only
ask my boyfriend out today.

683
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,920
As expected, I'm number one again.

684
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,100
<i>Chen Yi Chuan</i>

685
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,320
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>

686
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,920
Jiang Zheng Han?

687
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,479
Someone with the same name?

688
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,680
Xiao Xi!

689
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,319
Hey, Xiao Man.

690
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,079
Hello.

691
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,479
Xiao Xi.

692
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,199
I heard it from a senior sister
in my dorm that

693
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:06,119
you will speak on behalf of the freshmen.

694
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,280
We just entered the university,
and you've become so well-informed?

695
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,640
Thank you for your compliments.

696
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,160
You haven't tidied up the dorm?

697
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,040
Why is there a strange smell?

698
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,199
No more nonsense.

699
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,479
That's some preserved meat that

700
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:21,239
my roommate's mom
asked her to bring to us.

701
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,920
I'm sorry.

702
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,640
Xiao Xi, I have something to tell you.

703
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,439
Sit down first.

704
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,239
What's up?

705
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,959
Sit down.

706
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,920
What are you going to say?

707
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,359
I read our horoscope tips today.

708
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,319
We both have good luck in love!

709
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,640
Do you know what it means?

710
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:44,079
What does it mean?

711
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,239
It means I will take down
Xiao Chuan by one try

712
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,319
at the entrance ceremony.

713
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,199
And you...

714
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,959
Hey, stop tidying up your things.

715
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,800
And you will hold

716
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,040
senior Qin Yue's hand successfully.

717
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,160
Gu Xiao Man!

718
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll kick you out
if you keep talking nonsense.

719
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,199
Hey, don't be shy.

720
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,520
-Are you really gonna let go of such a chance?
-Hey.

721
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,199
Oh, my.

722
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,439
Xia Lin Xi!

723
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,880
-Xia Lin Xi!
-What's up?

724
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,760
Look at what you're wearing?

725
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Are you really going to wear this to
the entrance ceremony?

726
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,439
I look quite good.

727
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,439
No!

728
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:21,160
You're going to
make a speech for freshmen.

729
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:21,640
Don't I

730
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,119
look good?

731
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,800
Leave it to me, Gu Xiao Man.

732
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
I will dress you up as

733
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,680
the most beautiful fairy today!

734
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,439
Hello.

735
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,479
-Hey, Qiu Yan.
-Lin Xi.

736
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,800
Preparing for the entrance ceremony?

737
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,599
-Oh, yes.
-You also live here, right?

738
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,079
Hello, my name is Gu Xiao Man.

739
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,760
Hello, I'm Chu Qiu Yan.

740
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,479
I'm Lin Xi's roommate.

741
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:47,760
I'm Xiao Xi's high school classmate,

742
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,199
and also her bestie.

743
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:49,880
Hello.

744
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,000
Qiu Yan.

745
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,199
I'm helping Xiao Xi choose her clothes.

746
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,839
Can you give us your advice?

747
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,160
-This one.
-This one?

748
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,680
Um, and also this one.

749
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,800
Lin Xi has an elegant yet aloof charisma.

750
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:03,880
If she participates in the ceremony,

751
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:06,719
I think it would be better
to change the color.

752
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,680
-I think...
-Try another one.

753
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,239
This black dress is good.

754
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:15,280
-Great.
-Try it on.

755
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,000
Lin Xi's neck

756
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,599
and collarbone are particularly nice.

757
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,359
With this black dress...

758
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:27,239
-She will look more elegant.
-Beautiful!

759
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,439
But is the black dress
a little too formal?

760
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,280
The entrance ceremony symbolizes
the beginning of our life at university.

761
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,400
Isn't it better to have a sense of ritual?

762
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,640
-It makes sense.
-It makes sense.

763
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,920
If you want to
wear this earth tone eyeshadow,

764
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:45,079
I'll use this palette for you.

765
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,800
Let's see what kind of brushes we have.

766
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,199
This dress is also beautiful!

767
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,560
I have a similar one.

768
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,760
-Come, I'll help you put on eye shadows first.
-Oh.

769
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,839
-It suits you well.
-It's beautiful!

770
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,119
Look in the mirror.

771
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,599
Have a look, what is this?

772
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,319
-This?
-Let me show you.

773
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,839
A bling-bling eye shadow!

774
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,520
-This is a highlighter.
-Oh.

775
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,639
-Oh, highlighter.
-Isn't it very shiny?

776
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:09,360
Wow!

777
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,120
-I want to try this.
-I'm going to dine with my boyfriend.

778
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,280
Let's do it next time.

779
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,679
Okay, we'll have lunch, too.

780
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,639
Thank you, Qiu Yan.

781
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,000
Hey, Zhuang Fei.
Would you like to go with us?

782
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
-No, thanks.
-No need.

783
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,679
I still need to
tidy up my things for a while.

784
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,959
Okay. See you later.

785
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:25,760
Um.

786
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,959
-I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

787
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,879
Wish you and your boyfriend happiness!

788
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,360
Yeah! I'm leaving first.

789
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,040
Bye-bye.

790
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:32,679
Bye-bye.

791
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,639
Xiao Xi, we hasten to have lunch as well.

792
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,760
Okay, I'm hungry.

793
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:37,919
-Let's go.
-Go.

794
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,679
Zhuang Fei, bye-bye.

795
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,639
-Bye-bye.
-Let's go.

796
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,320
-Let's go.
-What would you like to eat?

797
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,840
Let's have a look first.

798
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:00,439
Slow down, slow down.

799
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,719
It's my first time to wear high heels.
I feel a little uncomfortable.

800
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,560
But Qiu Yan really dressed you up nicely.

801
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,840
And the makeup she put on you…

802
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,600
-So beautiful.
-She also gave me such a braid.

803
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,000
No wonder she has a boyfriend.

804
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,919
She's good at make-up and dressing up.

805
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,280
Xiao Xi, the girls in our dorm
all have boyfriends.

806
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,199
I envy them.

807
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,760
Shush, keep your voice down, gossip girl.

808
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh, by the way,
I want to go to the toilet first.

809
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,159
You are not used to
wearing high heels, walk slowly.

810
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,159
I'll see you inside.

811
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:30,919
Okay.

812
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:34,159
-Xiao Man, run slowly!
-It's okay.

813
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:36,959
Hey.

814
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:37,320
Ah!

815
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,000
Senior.

816
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,679
Hey, don't call me senior.

817
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll feel that
I'm being treated as a stranger.

818
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,040
Call me brother Guang Yu.

819
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,560
Hmm...

I have something to do,
so I have to leave first.

Don't reject me in a hurry.

825
00:35:58,959 --> 00:35:59,520
Look,

826
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,840
we have such a kismet.

827
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:02,719
The first person you met
in university is me,

828
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,399
right?

829
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:13,120
Er, Lin Xi,
you haven't had a boyfriend yet, have you?

830
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,199
Senior He Guang Yu.

831
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,199
I have. I have got a boyfriend.

832
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,639
So please behave yourself.

833
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,600
-No...
-Ah!

834
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:28,199
Sorry, I rode too fast.

835
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,360
Well, you...

836
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,320
At the beginning,

837
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,959
I really hated you.

838
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,120
What do you mean?

839
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,239
You mean, you like me now?

840
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,239
But, that's because
I didn't know you very well.

841
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,919
You are honest, kind and responsible.

842
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,679
But, perhaps,

843
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,360
you are too kind sometimes.

844
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,040
No matter what you encounter,

845
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:53,479
you like to carry it on all by yourself.

846
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,120
You don't like to explain, either.

847
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,959
Long time no see.

Hey!

850
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,040
How could Lin Xi know everyone here?

851
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:28,919
Xia Lin Xi!

852
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,560
Xia Lin Xi, why are you running?

853
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,320
Is it... Is it because
I showed up too suddenly?

854
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,159
I'm here to find you, Xia Lin Xi.

-Do you have any experience to share with me?

Well, you can take a deep breath
before you get on the stage.

933
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,919
-Okay, take a deep breath.
-Don't be nervous.

Yes, give yourself a little confidence.

941
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,439
Don't be nervous.

942
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:33,040
You can try to regard the people
as potatoes and wax gourds.

943
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,760
-Exactly.
-I'll try it.

944
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,760
The key is the mentality. If you think like this,
you will not be nervous.

945

I, well...

946
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,679
Yes, senior Qin Yue is right.

947
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,879
The mentality is very important. Relax.

948
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,760
Take a deep breath.

949
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,159
Just like this.

950
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,080
I'll give it a try.

951
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,760
You just regard them
as potatoes and wax gourds,

952
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,520
like what senior Qin Yue told you.

953
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,280
Will potatoes and wax gourds really work?

954
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,919
Of course, it'll work. It's called
the Mental Victory Method.
