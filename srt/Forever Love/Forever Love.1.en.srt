Come on, I'm giving lucky money.

18
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,870
Come on, come on.

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,230
- Hey, hey.
- Please give me one.

20
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,510
5 yuan, Huai Wu.

21
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,680
- Huh?
- I say there are only girls here.

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,910
This one who's so much
like a bad boy is Duan Ning,

23
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,310
a roommate of
Jiang Zheng Han at university.

24
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,190
That's enough!

25
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,720
Lucky for you that I stopped him.

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,800
Bro Zheng even intended to give out 1 yuan.

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,510
Brothers, follow me.

28
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,550
This one who seems to be
quite old is Zhang Huai Wu,

29
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,040
deskmate of
Jiang Zheng Han at high school,

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,870
- usually called Zhang Neighbor.
- Bro Zheng, bro Zheng.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,760
Guys, you've worked so hard today.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,910
Bro Zheng, what can I do with this 5 yuan?

33
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,520
That's right.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,270
This stingy refined rascal
is my future husband,

35
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,390
Jiang Zheng Han.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,750
With this small amount of money,
can they let us in?

37
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,160
- Can we come in with this?
- Like this, push the door.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,030
Money is all yours.

39
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,320
Come on, come on.

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,630
Open the door, Chen Yi Chuan.

41
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,720
- Open the door, sis Xia.
- Xia Lin Xi.

42
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,520
Lucky money.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,550
Go outside.

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,360
Come on.

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,240
My wife told me to take the money.
Please excuse me.

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,720
This one, Chen Yi Chuan,

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,440
is my younger cousin and my sworn enemy.

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,910
We've not got on well since our childhood.

49
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,030
Come on, open the door.

50
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,270
Chen Yi Chuan, are you cheating?

51
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,750
Lin Xi.

52
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,270
This angle, let's take one more photo.

53
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,270
Let me in.

54
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,880
Open the door.

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,360
Lin Xi.

56
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,390
Darling, I want to give it to you.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,880
Do not let them in.

58
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,862
She's Gu Xiao Man, the best friend

59
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,360
who has been going
through 8 tough years with me.

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,320
She's also Chen Yi Chuan's wife,
and also my sister-in-law.

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,720
Answer the questions first.

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,750
The groom, please.

63
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,080
How long have you
been in love with our Xiao Xi?

64
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,110
6 years.

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,800
It's wrong, more lucky money.

66
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,110
It's really 6 years.

67
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,160

Teacher Zhao, am I considered coming late?

95
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,440

96
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,830

97
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,550

99
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,390
please collect answer
sheets from bottom-up in order.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,440
Xiao Xi, why did you oversleep?

101
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,320
The alarm clock was broken.

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,270
Why was it broken?

103
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,110
You haven't written down your name.

104

<i>Xia Lin Xi</i>

Are you the one who

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,880
It's good if I could sit beside you,

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,390
so that I don't have
anything to worry about.

108

Of course, she's our Xiao Xi.

109
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,790
But she didn't attend
the listening section.

110
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,480
Maybe she will lose her first place.

111
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,320
Zhang Huai Wu, can you please speed up?

112

- Here, one more sheet.
- Xiao Xi, have you done?

That was "amazing" of you.

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,670
You even overslept on the day
of your classification exam.

115
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,550
Don't worry. It won't happen next time.

116
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,790
No more next time, we're off tomorrow.

117

Oh.

118
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,600
- Oh, Xiao Xi, I don't want to go.
- Let's go.

119
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,160
- Why do you keep muttering?
- Xiao Xi, please.

120
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,270
- Oh god, let's go.
- Let me go.

121
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,270
I really don't want to see it.

122
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,440
How about this? You'll help me to see it.

123
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,720
I assure you that I will treat you
the next time we play claw crane.

124
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,320
Please?

125
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,920
Please?

126
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,720
It's the last term of Grade 12.

128
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
- Continue to try your best.
- Yes.

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,790
Xia Lin Xi, fighting.

130
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,830
Yes, teacher.

131
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,070
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.

132
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,200
Teacher Zhang, I have something
to ask for your help.

133
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,440
- OK, let's go to my office.
- Can you please lower your voice?

134
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,160
If you let my mother
know that I play claw crane,

135
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,640
she will surely throw me
and the toy away.

136
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,160
So I won't tell your mother.
Please help me.

137
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,950
Just see it yourself.
You will have to see it sooner or later.

138
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,510
You will be reincarnated sooner
if you die soon, right?

139
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,200
Xiao Xi, of course you're not scared.

140
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,760
Normally, your results are high.

141
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,790
It's not a problem if you
want to be in the gifted class.

142
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,950
Do you know that,

143
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,200
the last math quiz, I wrote it
by throwing the eraser?

144
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,640
Xiao Xi, please.

145
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,350
Alright.

146
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,720
I will do it, OK?

147
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
OK.

148
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,510
So please tell me if it's good news.

149
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,230
If it's bad news, just send me a message.

150
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,670
- Alright, I'll go now.
- Love you, love you.

151
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Childish.

152
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,640
Who are you talking about?

153
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,550
You're the childish one.

154
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,270
Did I talk about you?

155
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,950
Snoopy.

156
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,670
It was hard for me to buy it.

157
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,200
This nonsense sweater

158
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
has nothing worth swanking.

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,950
Childish.

160
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,950
Oh.

161
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,550
I heard that there
was someone who overslept

162
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,350
and skipped the English listening test.

163
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,550
I really hope that that one,
after seeing the result,

164
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,670
still can be that arrogant.

165
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,760
Is there anyone who talks
to his cousin the way you do?

166
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Don't threaten me with this.

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,880
Care about your result first.

168
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,830
Let me tell you,

169
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,960
this time, the first place in the grade

170
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,840
belongs to me, for sure.

171
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,960
It's true.

172
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,520
Only when I missed my listening section

173
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,840
can you reach that position.

174
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,590
- Xia Lin Xi.
- Yeah?

175
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,470
You're in the first place
one more time, so great.

176
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,910
Thank you.

177
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,150
I'll go now, see ya.

178
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
- Bye bye.
- Yeah.

179
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,710
So...

180
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,710
sometimes,

181
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,590
don't be happy too early.

182
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,470
So handsome.

183
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,110
Where did you come out from?
You scared me to death.

184
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,640
Seeing him here,

185
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,760
- I also come.
- What are you talking about? Oh god.

186
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,470
Tell me, can he be in the first place?

187
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,840
Which side are you on actually?

188
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,790
Didn't you say that you wouldn't
go to see the result?

189
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,470
Seeing him encourages me to come here.

190
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,670
Gu Xiao Man.

191
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,550
Please don't tell anyone that I know you.

192
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,880
Hey, his scores are not as high as yours.

193
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,670
Oh, 2 points higher than you.

194
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,220
That's enough.

195
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,940
<i>Xia Lin Xi - 140
Chen Yi Chuan - 135</i>

196
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,710
It's impossible.

197
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,230
Wasn't she late for the listening section?

198
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,400
The world of geniuses is not a world
that average people like us can guess.

199
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,760
It's true, even if the sky falls,
our goddess can still take first place.

200
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,000
So admirable.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,590
- How can she be that good?
- I really can't imagine.

202
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,470
Excuse me.

203
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,350
Chen Yi Chuan, hi.

204
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,000
Xiao Man, don't look at him anymore,
look at the board.

205
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,640
Why do you take me here? I won't see it.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,220
I believe in you, let me find it.

209
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,880
18th place.

210
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,874
Oh, is it true that
I'm in the gifted class?

211
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,440
Yeah.

212
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,670
I passed.

213
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,590
Ah. Yes.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,520
Take a photo with me to save this moment.

215
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,350
Oh, how can your
Chinese score be that high?

216
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,320
Come on, come on.

Oh, who's this?

224
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,200
Is he the next-door
brother of our Xiao Xi?

225
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,150
Can you stop flustering everything?

226
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,462
Talented boy and beautiful girl,

227
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,720
two carefree children,

228
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:56,520

the heaven will support you guys.

You don't have
to think anymore, it's him.

230
00:10:58,142 --> 00:10:59,400
You're too noisy, my friend.

231
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Oh, I understand, you're not close.

232
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,670
- I can't stand you.
- Actually,

233
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,760
you guys are normal friends, right?

234
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,200
It's a coincidence that you're neighbors,

235
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,840
and a coincidence that
you guys study at the same school.

236
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,760
Unintentionally, he was at the first place
of the grade in the past,

237
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,230
and you're in the first place
of the grade at present.

238
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,790
Not close, you guys are just well-matched.

239
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,590
What are you writing?

240
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,910
Note it down.

241
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,150
Note down all
the process of being a couple

242
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,030
of Xia Lin Xi and senior Qin Yue.

243
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,880
You guys are going to see each
other after a long time of separating.

Oh.

at least 30 couples will break up.

Congrats to all of you

249
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,960
on surpassing the difficulties
and being in this class.

250
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,320
You're going to take the College Entrance Exam,

251
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,550
so studying is your priority.

252
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,790
We won't vote for
the class representatives.

253
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,400
I will directly assign.

254

The monitors

00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,440

Ah, Xia Lin Xi.

In the oath-taking
ceremony this afternoon,

Be well-prepared.

263
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes.

264
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,400
Alright, let's start our lesson.

265
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,590
Teacher.

266
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,400
Our class hasn't had enough people.

267
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Who hasn't come?

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,470
Zhang Huai Wu and Jiang Zheng Han.

269
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,080
Jiang Zheng Han is a transferring student.

270
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,670
Oh.

271
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,440
These two are wonderful.

272
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,931
One boy is the first from bottom up,

273
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:25,000
and the other boy
is the second from bottom up.

274
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,440
The two monitors, find me these two

275
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,960
before the oath-taking ceremony.

276
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,470
OK?

277
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,150
Sit down.

278
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
Now, let's begin our class.

279
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,320
Alright, paid. Next one.

280
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,590
Me, me, me.

281
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,880
Bro Zheng, 3 games, promotion battle.

282
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,710
Promotion battle fighting,
1 game for 30, 3 games for 100.

283
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,350
1 game for 30,
shouldn't it be 3 games for 90?

284
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,350
Bro Zheng, why didn't you lower
the price but even increase the price?

285
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,550
Promotion battle.

286
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,400
It's important,
so I have to increase the price.

287
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,320
So aren't you just sitting there
and increasing the price?

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,110
I won't play anymore.

289
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,030
It's your choice,
but just think about it yourself.

290
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,670
There is only one person
on the level-up list tomorrow.

291
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,030
Bro Zheng, I have money, I have money.

292
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,400
Give it to me.

293
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,670
Manager.

294
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,550
Turn on a computer for me.

295
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,470
Identity card.

296
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,880
Zhang...

297
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,110
You Cai?

298
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,590
Yes.

299
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,550
Were you born in 1970?

300
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,790
I gave you the wrong card.

301
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,110
Are you over 18?

302
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,470
Yes, yes.

303
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,760
I just turned 18 today.

304
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,590
I brought it along,
I, please wait a moment.

305
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,880
Come on.

306
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Ah, here.

307
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,400
Ah, can you give me back that one?

308
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,908
Don't bring your father's
identity card along anymore.

309
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:04,520
Yes.

310
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,550
Look at the camera.

311
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,910
- Alright, the 13th computer.
- Yes.

312
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,110
Do you want to have a membership card?

313
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,790
- No.
- Hey.

314
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,710
Do you want me to play for you?

315
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,880
Reasonable price.

316
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,910
No.

317
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,150
Let me tell you, I'm really skillful.

318
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,590
They call me "Canyon God".

319
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's go.

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,110
Where?

321
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,640
Find the two students.

322
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,171
There are not enough audience
listening to your speech.

323
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,280
Of course, you have to go
and find them.

324
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,320
Why can I feel

325
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,590
the jealous, admiring and hateful smell?

326
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,150
Xia Lin Xi.

327
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,880
A double-dealer like you

328
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,840
will be exposed one day.

329
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,670
Today is your good chance to
show the existence of a monitor.

330
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,840
Don't miss it at all costs.

331
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,230
You can't go.

332
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,150
Get away. I have to go to the library.

333
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,640
Xia Lin Xi.

334
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,790
This pen is a global limited edition.

335
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,285
What are you doing?

336
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,280
There are only 1000 pens like
this over the world.

337
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,670
Give it to me.

338
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,710
If you come here, I will throw it away.

339
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,640
- I won't.
- Go back.

340
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,110
- More.
- Alright.

341
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,440
Be careful with the pen.

342
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,790
Do you go with me or not?

343
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,520
Yes, yes.

344
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,280
Go.

345
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,200
I've agreed with you.

346
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
Pull your hand back.

347
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,320
What can we do if it's dropped?

348
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,280
Do you dare to take it back?

349
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,030
- Xiao Xi.
- Yeah.

350
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,910
Yi Chuan.

351
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,470
Xiao Xi, don't do it.

352
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,470
That's the pen
that Yi Chuan likes the most.

353
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,320
- Oh, Chen Yi Chuan.
- Wait for me.

354
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,080
I will tell my aunt all
of your mean actions.

355
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,840
3-Years-Old Chen, childish.

356
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,230
Gu Xiao Man, which side
are you on actually?

357
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Oh, Xiao Xi Xi.

358
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,760
Of course, I'm on your side.

359
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,880
Don't argue with him anymore, OK?

360
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,880
That's enough.

361
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,710
How about this?

362
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,590
I will go searching for them with you.

363
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,400
How?

364
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,400
I have the Weibo accounts
of all of our classmates.

365
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,590
You're excellent.

366
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,150
Jian Xi Internet cafe.

367
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,080
Jiang Zheng Han is so mysterious,
I can't find him.

368
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,400
So I will catch this one first. Thank you.

369
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,590
Catch...

370
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,350
Take care of yourself.

371
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,300
<i>Jian Xi Internet cafe</i>

372
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,780
<i>Under-aged people
are not allowed to come in</i>

373
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,200
They're broken, don't you know it?

374
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,150
I was wrong.

375
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,350
What's wrong? You did it on purpose.

376
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,080
Zhang Huai...

377
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,030
The first place of the grade,
please save me.

378
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,000
Zhang Huai Wu.

379
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,470
What are you doing?

380
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,710
We study at No.1 High School.

381
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,760
Don't mess up.

382
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,840
Who's this girl?

383
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,080
It's none of your business. Get away.

384
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,760
- You!
- Hey, hey, hey.

385
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,000
Hey, do you know that

386
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,550
it's illegal to hit someone?

387
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
The police will detain you for 15 days
if your crime is not serious.

388
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,400
If it is, you will be convicted
of intentionally injuring others,

389
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,525
imprisoned with a term

390
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,400
of between three years
and ten years.

391
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,520
Who intentionally injured him?
This kid hurt us.

392
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,070
That's right.

393
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,590
- Don't talk much. Hit him!
- Hit him!

394
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,350
Hey!

395
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,710
Ah.

396
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,400
Ah, don't hit me.

397
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Let me go.

398
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,830
You're a girl. Don't fight.

399
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,920
Let me go.

400
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,280
If you want to hit him,
go outside and do it.

401
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,520
Let me go.

402
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,350
Ashtray, 50.

403
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,880
Broom, 10 yuan.

404
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,640
Chair, 98.

405
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,350
Come here.

406
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,680
Come here!

407
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,000
Tell me, what's wrong?

408
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,110
This kid pulled us into this group,

409
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,710
saying that he
would boost our score. Bullshit!

410
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
You pulled us to hell.

411
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,880
Their skills were too bad.
I couldn't pull them up.

412
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,230
- What are you talking about?
- Alright.

413
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,710
Your skills are really bad.

414
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,760
- Zhang Huai Wu, silence!
- Alright.

415
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,190
Alright, alright.

416
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,280
Bro Zheng, we respect you.

417
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,640
Tell us, what should we do?

418
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,040
How many stars that he owes you?

419
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,400
1 star per person, level-up star.

420
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,520
- That's right, it's level-up star.
- It's not true.

421
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,710
Seriously.

422
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,920
Give me your accounts.

423
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,000
I will help you gain 2 stars per person.

424
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,710
This story will end up here, OK?

425
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,950
- OK.
- OK.

426
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,710
- Alright, dismiss.

427
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,760
Let's go.

428
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,560
- Thank you, bro Zheng
- Thank you, bro Zheng.

429
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,000
These bad people.

430
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,160
- Come here.
- Yes.

431
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Thank you.

432
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,640
Without you today,

433
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,230
I really don't know what to do.

434
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,000
Thank you so much.

435
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,070
Ah.

436
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,590
Since you helped me,
I will pay back you more.

437
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,830
Don't need to do so.

438
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,230
How can I?

439
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,560
You've helped me a lot,
I can't let you do it for nothing.

440
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,230
I did not do it for nothing.

441
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,520
When I play games,
1 star for 10 yuan.

442
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,590
4 people, 2 stars for each,
80 yuan in total.

443
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,280
Plus your playing time,
100 yuan in total.

444
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,590
Plus rescuing you in the fight,
200 in total.

445
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,950
I've just thought that your
heroic actions were so noble,

446
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,710
but why do you even charge fees?

447
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,110
Friend, I've written down
the price so clearly.

448
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,830
You even do homework for others?

449
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,880
Why don't you charge
fee for breathing?

450
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,280
Bro, money,

451
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,880
talking about money
affects our affection, right?

452
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,280
You're talking about affection, right?

453
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,310
Alright.

454
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,070
So I'll call them back,
so that you guys can have a talk.

455
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,950
Ah, no, no.

456
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,710
- No, I have money, I have it.
- Hey.

457
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,190
I, I only have 20.

458
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,350
Sorry, I only accept
full payment at once.

459
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,160
Haiz, please keep it first.

460
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,520
My father will give me money at the end
of this month. I will pay you then.

461
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,950
Take it, take it.

462
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,070
210.

463
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,470
Why do you want more?

464
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,350
Doesn't breaking my glass
require compensation?

465
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,880
One more thing.

466
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,310
My time requires fees also.

467
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,400
If you continue,
it will not be this price.

468
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,430
You're too much.

469
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,000
Jiang Ming No.1 High School, right?

470
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,680
Yes, it's true, and my father
is the leader of teachers.

471
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,560
- Zhang You Cai?
- That's right, Zhang You Cai.

472
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,350
- Go home.
- Thank you.

473
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,310
I will ask for money from him.

474
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,000
Or, you just hit me.

475
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,560
So that I have the reason to cry
and beg for money when I come home.

476
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,830
Your cup is 5 yuan.

477
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,800
Deal.

478
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,230
Where's the money?

479
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,590
Alright.

480
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,350
I will pay for him.

481
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,040
- Thank you.
- I don't have cash.

482
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,280
At our gaming center,

483
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,590
you can pay with Wechat.

484
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,800
<i>Return money to Jiang Zheng Han</i>

485
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,350
Alright, you guys can just go.

486
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,400
Jiang Zheng Han?

487
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,280
Wait a minute. Are you Jiang Zheng Han?

488
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,640
What's wrong?

489
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,110
You're in the same class as us.

490
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,110
Why are you pretending that you're
the owner of the internet cafe?

491
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,310
What? Same class?

492
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,000
Jiang Zheng Han? Bro Zheng?

493
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,830
- We're classmates.
- Zhang Huai Wu,

494
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,800
Jiang Zheng Han,

495
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,560
follow me to come back to school.

496
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,590
At the oath-taking ceremony,
our class lacks only you guys.

497
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,280
You guys, please go right away, OK?

498
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,110
Don't affect my business.

499
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,230
If I wasn't taught not to litter
when I was a little kid,

500
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,950
I really want to litter
you guys right now.

501
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,590
Ah.

502
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,590
Alright.

503
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,560
If you don't go, I'll go.

504
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,430
Hey!

505
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,710
Do you believe that I will call the police?

506
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,470
I will tell them this
internet cafe hires child labor.

507
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,760
I'm 18.

508
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,760
Can't I study and work at the same time?

509
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,110
You're in Grade 12, and you still study
and work at the same time?

510
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,070
What's the problem with Grade 12?

511
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,000
Can't our family
be poor if I'm in Grade 12?

512
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,880
Why do you only care about money?

513
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,160
Bro Zheng, 1 Coca, please.

514
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,230
I'm coming.

515
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,640
Heroine, please let me go.

516
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
Sis Xia.

517
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,070
You can't blame it on me.

518
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,680
They didn't let me go.

519
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,160
They made me stay there.

520
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,230
How about this? Please help me...

521
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,560
Ah, ah... please help me,

522
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,680
I'll pay you back when I come home, OK?

523
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,160
Jiang Zheng Han is our classmate, right?

524
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,070
So, whatever happens,

525
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,310
we have to take him back together, right?

526
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,560
Ah, right.

527
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,800
The first place is always right.

528
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,920
So if we're done, I'll go first.

529
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,470
Come back here.

530
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,070
Ah.

531
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,560
Don't rush.

532
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,310
Maybe I, need the help

533
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,070
of my friend, Zhang.

534
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,950
Hey, hey.

535
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,920
Bro Zheng.

536
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,800
Why the connection is not stable?

537
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,190
It's the final battle, bro Zheng.

538
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,070
Come on, come on.

539
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Alright, I'll go to see it.
Just come back.

540
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,000
Come on, come on.

541
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,000
Hey, first place.

542
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,590
This matter...
Don't tell my father, will you?

543
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,525
So please don't play truant

544
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,131
and don't get me in trouble in the future.

545
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:26,800
Alright.

546
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,950
If you do it again,

547
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,520
I will tie you to a grass boat
to borrow archery.

548
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,070
Yeah, I assure you that
this is the last time.

549
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,520
When Jiang Zheng Han comes back,
send me a message.

550
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,110
Yeah, no problem.

551
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,280
First place.

552
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,950
Hey, whose laptop is it?

553
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,350
None of your business.

554
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,560
We've waited for so long.
Why hasn't the connection been stable?

555
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,400
Alright, let's check it again.

556
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,560
Alright. Come on, come on.

557
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,165
<i>Your computer is at my place.</i>

558
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:01,660
<i>Meet me at school
if you want to take it back - Xia Lin Xi</i>

559
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,950
Xiao Xi.

560
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,230
Bro Qin Yue.

561
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,350
Bro Qin Yue, you have come here?

562
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,110
Long time no see.

563
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,560
I want to give you this.

564
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,560
What's it?

565
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,520
It's the notes when I reviewed
for the College Entrance Exam.

566
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,470
I hope that it can help you.

567
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,230
Thank you, bro Qin Yue.

568
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,760
- One more thing.
- Yeah?

569
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,680
Don't you forget our promise?

570
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,350
Yeah, no.

571
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,350
Reach the first place
and study at Jing Hua.

572
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,640
Just like you.

573
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,680
Bro Qin Yue,

574
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,160
you've always been my model.

575
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,640
I won't let you down.

576
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,040
I will try my best

577
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,560
to become a person like you.

578
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,350
Alright.

579
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,400
- So I will wait for you at Jing Hua.
- Yes.

580
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,230
Xiao Xi, don't talk anymore. It's time.

581
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,350
Come on.

582
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,190
- Eh, hello, bro Qin Yue.
- Hello.

583
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,040
I didn't mean to interrupt you guys,

584
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,070
but the oath-taking
ceremony is about to start.

585
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,800
One person is the
representative of Grade 12.

586
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,710
The other one is an excellent student
coming back here to cheer his juniors.

587
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,470
- Wow, you guys are a nice couple.
- Let's go.

588
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,470
- Bro Qin Yue, don't listen to her.
- Goodbye bro Qin Yue.

589
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,560
Bye bye.

590
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,040
Where did you get that laptop?

591
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,230
- Hello, teacher.
- Hello.

592
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,520
Ah, hey, wait a minute.

593
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,920
Xia Lin Xi,

594
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,800
the ceremony is about to start.
What are you carrying the laptop for?

595
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,788
I...

596
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,742
Our school doesn't allow students

597
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:48,470
to bring along their laptop, does it?

598
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,350
Let me keep it for you.

599
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,040
- Ah...
- Don't talk anymore. Go preparing.

600
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,110
Come on, come on.

601
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,400
Yes.

602
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,920
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

603
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,800
- Goodbye.
- Go go go.

604
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,520
Where did you get that laptop?

605
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,710
You're in Grade 12 already,
but you still come late.

606
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,190
Don't you know what this day is?

607
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,110
Hand!

608
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Students,

609
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,470
today is the oath-taking ceremony
of 100 days to the College Entrance Exam

610
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,400
of Jiang Ming No.1 High School.

611
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,000
For the last few years,

612
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,040
we've climbed up bumpy mountains,

613
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,880
wading through the dark sea...

614
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,190
- Our path of studying...
- Bro Zheng.

615
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,590
is long and meandering.

616
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,350
It's not me who
unplugged the network cable.

617
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,131
Don't let me see you at the
internet cafe anymore.

618
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:42,640
Yes.

619
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,310
Where is your accomplice?

620
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,800
Next, please welcome Xia Lin Xi,
the representative of Grade 12.

621
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,760
Grade 10 and 11, listen to my command.

622
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,430
Grade 12 fighting!

623
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,310
Jiang Ming No.1 High School will win.

624
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,560
Grade 12 fighting!
Jiang Ming No.1 High School will win.

625
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:10,230
Grade 12 fighting!
Jiang Ming No.1 High School will win.

626
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,920
Please fist your hands
and declare with me.

627
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,310
During the time of 100 days
to the upcoming College Entrance Exam...

628
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,560
During the time of 100 days
to the upcoming College Entrance Exam...

629
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,350
in the name of youth,
we take the solemn oath of our promise...

630
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:36,040
in the name of youth,
we take the solemn oath of our promise...

631
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,560
We, under the instructions of teachers...

632
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,070
We, under the instructions of teachers...

633
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,430
We, under the instructions...

634
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,470
of teachers...

635
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,430
using the fullest enthusiasm
and the highest spirit to fight...

636
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,400
using the fullest enthusiasm
and the highest spirit to fight...

637
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,680
the most austere spirit,
the most resilient will...

638
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,000
can surely make it...

639
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,880
can surely make it...

640
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,350
to follow the disciplines, try our best...

641
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,520
to follow the disciplines, try our best...

642
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,350
be steady, take advantage
of every moment...

643
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,350
be steady, take advantage
of every moment...

644
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,590
balance our attitude, have no laziness...

645
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,400
balance our attitude, have no laziness...

646
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,950
use all our strength, surpass ourselves.

647
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,880
use all our strength, surpass ourselves.

648
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,920
We, at that time,

649
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,190
hadn't known how this school-wide activity

650
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
was different from the past ones.

651
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,520
We just considered it a normal day

652
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,920
in our high-school life.

653
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,880
But when we think of the past,

654
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,110
think of that day,

655
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
we suddenly understand.

656
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,280
It turns out that the College Entrance Exam

657
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,190
was the very first campaign

658
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,680
that we had to do it on our own.

659
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,590
Alright, students,

660
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,760
in these last moments, please welcome

661
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,680
our former excellent student,

662
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,160
Qin Yue from Jiang Ming,
currently studying at Jing Hua University,

663
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,160
to this stage to encourage you guys.

664
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,760
Hello.

665
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,040
I'm Qin Yue, a student in the class of 2012
at the Faculty of Computer in Jing Hua University.

666
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,160
Today, I'm really delighted to stand here

667
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,000
to encourage students who are preparing to take
the College Entrance Exam.

668
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,950
Grade 12 is really important.

669
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,470
You just need to believe in yourself
and be persistent with yourself.

670
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,800
I believe that you guys

671
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,350
will achieve wonderful results.

672
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,760
Thank you.

673
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,430
I'm quite sure about this question.

674
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,070
I've checked it.
There won't be any problem.

675
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,190
Wait a minute.

676
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,880
Where are you going?

677
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,710
Yi Chuan,

678
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,350
I want to ask you about an exam question.

679
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,710
Are you free today?

680
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,190
Now I don't have time to help you.

681
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,920
I'm reviewing.

682
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,350
Please help me.

683
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,560
Please.

684
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,680
Who hasn't come?

685
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,640
Teacher.

686
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,640
This student, you are...

687
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,110
Hello, I'm Jiang Zheng Han.

688
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,160
Ah, are you Jiang Zheng Han?

689
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,110
You didn't go to class on the first day.

690
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,565
There aren't any cures for
those unenthusiastic students.

691
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:53,560
It's the first day
and he's come late.

692
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,000
It's the first time,
so I will forgive you. Come in.

693
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,000
Hey, wait.

694
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,710
Why aren't you wearing a uniform?

695
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,160
I will give you 3 days.
Change your clothes to be like your classmates.

696
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,950
Come on, come in.

697
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,680
Open your book, page 4.

698
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,110
Today, we will review from the start.

699
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
We will review the concept of sets.

700
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,950
Bro Zheng.

701
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,040
A set refers to a few specific objects

702
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,310
that aggregate together and form a set.

703
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,190
Each object is called an element.

704
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,950
The point is

705
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,230
set and elements of the set

706
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,470
are two distinct concepts.

707
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,830
I have told you so many times.

708
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,830
At the same time,

709
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,560
the elements in the set...

710
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,640
- Return the laptop to me.
- have what characteristics?

711
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,710
They're deterministic,

712
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,880
different,

713
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,760
and disorderly.

714
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,350
About the classification, we have

715
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,640
finite set, infinite set,
and null set, those 3 types.

716
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,800
The concept of sets is quite simple.

717
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,430
When taking the exam,
there's only 1 type of question.

718
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,950
You just need to review it simply,
and do some similar questions.

719
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,920
Next, we will talk about function.

720
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,560
First,

721
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,110
we will review
the simple concept of function.

722
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,830
What are you doing?

723
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,390
Tell me, what do you want?

724
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,670
What's the problem?

725
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,800
Return me my laptop.

726
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,120
Hello, teacher.

727
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,020
<i>Lady's Room</i>

728
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,520
Do you need help?

729
00:35:18,544 --> 00:35:28,544
