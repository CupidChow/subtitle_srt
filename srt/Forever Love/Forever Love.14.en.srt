20
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,559
Isn't it nice here?

21
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,160
There's a lot of space here,

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,360
and it's close to our university.

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,319
Let's start sorting things out.

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,800
Wait a minute.

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,720
Come here with me.

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
What's up?

27
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:09,160
Listen to me,

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,839
this is a French window
with great day-lighting.

29
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,440
I settled on this after a careful study.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,639
What's wrong?

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,639
You must make sure

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,479
to close this window
every time you go out.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,679
You're on a low floor. It's dangerous.

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,559
The bedroom?

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,000
-What do you think of the bedroom?
-It's fine.

36
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,360
The closet is quite big, too.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,199
Good.

38
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,279
What's this? The bathroom?

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,240
How is it?

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,800
Good.

41
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,520
Over there is the kitchen.

42
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,000
Look at this.

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,639
This is the gas valve.

44
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,720
Always turn it off before you go out.

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,479
Otherwise, it would...

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,559
Boom!

47
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,039
Gas valve...

48
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,919
However,

49
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,479
you don't cook,
so you could just leave it closed.

50
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,440
I can learn to cook.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,320
All right.

52
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,600
But you live here alone.

53
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,199
I'm still worried.
I think it's not so good.

54
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,559
What's not so good?

55
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,800
Think about it...

56
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,320
Why this is not so good?

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,839
Just think about it.

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,759
There might be rats and cockroaches.

59
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,919
When you're alone,

60
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,520
they might swish under your feet,

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,960
and climb on you when you're asleep.

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,320
Besides, you are a girl, and alone.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,000
What if when you're out there alone,

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,479
and you got

65
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,199
stalked by some pervert?

66
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,600
He might just

67
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,000
climb up the pipe
and get in through the window,

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and then show up
in front of you all of a sudden.

69
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,839
Stop it, stop it.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,559
Then...

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,000
-What should I do?
-It's OK.

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,479
I can actually move in with you.

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,759
You can't do this. We're just freshmen.

74
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,160
Does that mean
I can when we're sophomores?

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,720
No, you can't.

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,399
At least...

77
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,000
At least until we're juniors.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
You always carry it with you?

79
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,279
How about throwing it away?

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,959
Why?

81
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,640
Because I envy him.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
For what?

83
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,040
Because he could accompany you every day,

84
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,959
but I can't.

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,600
Jiang Zheng Han, you're really
more and more shameless.

86
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,320
<i>From Zhishu Bu Dali:</i>
It's almost the end of the month.

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,079
When will our codes be ready?

88
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,519
Or you forget your GitHub password?

89
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,359
If it can't be debugged before the 29th,

90
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,200
we won't pay you the balance.

91
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,140
<i>Can you help write api and texts?
Urgent! We need your help here...</i>

92
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,079
So many people asking for your help?

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,679
Do you want to have a break?

94
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,320
I have two more jobs and
an assignment to hand in today.

95
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,119
I might need to do this all night.

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,920
Do you want me to help you?

97
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,040
No need.

98
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:52,559
Don't worry.

99
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,799
I'll go back when you fall asleep.

100
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,079
I... I didn't mean to rush you.

101
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,079
I know.

102
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,279
But it's so late after all.

103
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,920
It's not as safe as
the dorm here by yourself.

104
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,040
Don't worry.

105
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,679
I'll go back to our university
when you're asleep.

106
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,559
Then you can work here first.

107
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,839
I can't help you with programming.

108
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,000
But,

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,320
it's amazing to
make money through programming.

110
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,480
Why did I hear a trace of

111
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,559
worship from your words?

112
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,679
Stop it.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,720
All right.

114
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you like programming?

115
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,079
Why do you ask this all of a sudden?

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,600
I mean,

117
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,399
if you learn something

118
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,000
because you like it, it'll be
a great impetus to support you.

119
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,239
When I was in Grade 12,

120
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,760
my family needed a lot of money.

121
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,519
But at that time,

122
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,279
I didn't even graduate from high school,
so I couldn't find any jobs.

123
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,640
So at that time,
programming was all about

124
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,119
a way to get money.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,959
But that pressure is gone now, and

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,239
the technology is changing
with each passing day.

127
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,760
I think I need to explore and learn more.

128
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,279
Anyway, I feel like

129
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,559
it's an interesting process.

130
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,839
Is this PHP language hard to learn?

131
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,480
It's hard for me anyway.

132
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,519
It should be

133
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,200
not that hard for you.

134
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,640
Would you like to teach me?

135
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,679
Well, how are you gonna

136
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,160
pay for the tuition fee?

137
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,839
I can give you money.

138
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,359
Actually, except for money,

139
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,720
it could be something else.

140
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,000
What?

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,399
Get back to your work.
I'll go to sleep now.

142
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,200
So early?

143
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,720
Why are you going to bed so early?

144
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,760
Why should you care what time I go to bed?

145
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,799
Well, you go to bed first.

146
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,760
I can't concentrate
if you keep staying here.

147
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,040
Good night.

148
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,760
Good night.

149
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,039
Don't stay up too late.

150
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,080
OK.

151
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,400
Help me give Professor Shi
the USB drive on the desk.

152
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,880
It's my homework.
I got something else to do first.

153
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,960
Professor,
here's Jiang Zheng Han's homework.

154
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,840
Jiang told me that. Just put it here.

155
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,760
OK.

156
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,559
Professor, then I'll leave now.

157
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,320
Xia.

158
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:18,479
Come.

159
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,479
Sit down.

160
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,679
Please tell Jiang that

161
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,119
the final of
the ACP Contest is in two days.

162
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,599
He should be well-prepared.

163
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,640
Some well-known companies
of the industry will be there,

164
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
with internships to offer.

165
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
If he got chosen by any one of them,

166
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,880
his salary would be much more
than his current programming jobs.

167
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
And it'll be paid off
by each project done.

168
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:47,239
Then he wouldn't have to hold onto
his broken computer any longer.

169
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,159
His computer isn't good enough?

170
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,840
It's not "not good enough",
but not good at all!

171
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,280
A work that normally takes two hours

172
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,880
has to cost at least
half a day with his computer.

173
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,679
I suggested to give him a new one.

174
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,039
But that brat refused me, alas...

175
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,119
I see, professor. Then I'll leave now.

176
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,200
Okay, off you go.

177
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,840
Love isn't something
you can buy at your wish.

178
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,719
What are you doing?

179
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,479
Nothing.

180
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,119
Here you are.

181
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,239
Thanks.

182
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,679
Huai Wu.

183
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,080
You know, Chuan is already an adult now.

184
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,200
But why is he still so fond of Snoopy?

185
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,760
He's childish.
He's into it since high school.

186
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,919
What about Gu Xiao Man?

187
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,640
Did she know that back in high school?

188
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,039
So,

189
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,880
they started it since high school?

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,359
Yeah, they did. Listen to me,

191
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,440
at that time, Chen Yi Chuan

192
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,640
even wrote a love letter to Gu Xiao Man.

193
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,960
That caused a big fuss in our class.

194
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,880
-Chen Yi Chuan?
-Yeah, it's true.

195
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,080
I can't believe he did that.

196
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,760
It's not what you think.

197
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,719
Listen to me,

198
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,159
Chen Yi Chuan actually tried to

199
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,640
apologize to Gu Xiao Man. But...

200
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,080
Just tell me.

201
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:13,840
But Gu Xiao Man took it as
a confession of his love to her.

202
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,119
So that's the case.

203
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,599
Fortune favors fools,
and he's one of them.

204
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:26,200
He knows nothing about love.

205
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,080
But he's loved by such a good girl.

206
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,599
And she even loves Snoopy because of him.

207
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,280
What a pure love it must be!

208
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,960
You... You sound like

209
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,320
a little envious.

210
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,799
Of course, listen to me,

211
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,239
I, Prince Duan,

212
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,880
have dated countless girls.

213
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,559
Why didn't anyone of them
treat me like that?

214
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,039
All right.

215
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,320
Don't be envious.

216
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,440
Listen to me,

217
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,039
Chen Yi Chuan has no EQ at all.

218
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,599
It must be hard for him to get married.

219
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm sure he'll be single all his life.

220
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,080
He is a typical

221
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,440
love herbicide.

222
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,479
What do you mean by that?

223
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,159
Kills love from the root.

224
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,479
Instant noodles?

225
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,880

-Chen Yi Chuan had a fever today.

We carried him to the infirmary,
on our shoulder.

230
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,000
Is he still alive?

231

Yes.

232
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll say it.

233
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,520
Well, brother Zheng.

234
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,080
What did you have
for breakfast this morning?

235
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,719
What did you eat?

236
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,840
Breakfast? Bag and porridges.

237
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,479

You got a new idea for that project?

You got a new idea?

A little bit.

Which stage are you and sis Xia at?

242

Which stage?

243
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,440
Just... Kiss is done.

-No, no.

247
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,599
Take my one-point finger!

248
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,080
-Tell us about that!
-Why should you hide it from us?!

249
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,599
One-point finger, one-point finger.

250
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,719
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

You are indeed a pig.

No, I bought this for you.

Aren't you just
recovered from a serious illness?

264

I wanted you to
eat more to get more nutrition.

265
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,599
So I bought so much food.

266
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,919
Please eat more, okay?

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,440

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,400
What Snoopy?

274
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,000
Why do you mention that all of a sudden?

275
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,960
I like it as long as it's Snoopy.

Great! I knew you would like it,

To replenish all the energy
that you wasted on the illness.

279
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,440
You don't have to remind me of that.

280

Xiao Chuan,
this chicken fillet looks delicious.

281

I'd like to try it, too.

00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,080
Get it by yourself if you wanna eat.

What are you doing?

No.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,079
What happened?

291
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,439
No idea. You know,

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,439
she always loses her temper for no reason.

I think Xiao Man is not bad.

00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,160
Not bad?

296
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,040
She just follows me around.

297

more suitable for a relationship.

Are you a man?

The girl is so initiative.

304
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,439
Visited your ward and gave you a gift.

305
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,199
Why don't you give some reaction?

306
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,199
How did you also know that?

307
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,199
Of course! You know my capacities.

That's not a good thought.
You'd better quit it.

In my opinion, a man like you

A smart woman like senior Shi Ying

335
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,359
is worthy of me.

336
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,719
Enough, enough.

337
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,359
Stop watching. She's gone.

338
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,400
Listen, judging from
my years of experience,

339
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,160
this goddess

340
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,479
is not as simple as what we can see.

341
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,959
You gotta be careful.

342
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,719
What do you know?

343
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,560
The little fool adores a senior.

344
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,359
Where did he get the confidence?

345
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,239
Do you have time now?

346
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,079
Let's meet.

347
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,590
<i>Running downstairs.</i>

348
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,040
Running downstairs?

349
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,359
I'll come to you.

350
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,300
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

351
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,280
Xiao Chuan.

352
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,119
Your leg is still not recovered?

353
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,839
Um.

354
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:47,800
Hey.

355
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:52,079
I'll be fine
soon after receiving your concern.

356
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,040
The clothes you're wearing today

357
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,160
is quite complicated.

358
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:08,199
You look so beautiful today.

359
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
I know.

360
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,319
You like my dress today, don't you?

361
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,719
I mean...

362
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,119
You don't have to
dress up so complicated, okay?

363
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,319
You're beautiful

364
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
even if you don't dress up.

365
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,160
I know I'm beautiful
no matter I dress up or not.

366
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The moon is so beautiful today.

367
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,160
Isn't your leg still not recovered?

368
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,239
Stop running. Be careful! Hey!

369
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,000
Xiao Xi.

370
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,400
Xiao Man, what's up?

371
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,760
Be ready for this.

372
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,640
I'm going to tell you a big good news!

373
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,920
What's up?

374
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,400
You could never expect this.

375
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,400
My wait pays off.
The sago cycas is blossoming.

376
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,880
Chen Yi Chuan

377
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,199
confessed his love to me.

378
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,880
You'd better tell me all about

379
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,479
how he told you that exactly.

380
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,280
You can never imagine that.

381
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,839
He used a classic allusion
of Natsume Soseki.

382
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,719
"The moon is so beautiful tonight."

383
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:59,400
He confessed his love to me
in an euphemistic way.

384
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,760
Well...

385
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,479
I don't mean anything else.

386
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,959
But I'm just worried about his low EQ.

387
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:11,719
And he is not so good at
literature as you think.

388
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,560
With a low EQ and
unable to express himself well,

389
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,760
he could only turn to

390
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,079
"the moon is so beautiful tonight",
instead of "I love you",

391
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,920
to implicitly express his love to me.

392
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,160
Well, why does that mean "I love you"?

393
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,920
When Natsume Soseki

394
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,359
was a teacher of
English translation in Japan,

395
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,160
one of his students translated
"I Love You" directly.

396
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,640
But he felt that love should be implicit.

397
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,839
Doesn't that sound exactly like Chuan?

398
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,560
So he told the student
it's better to express love

399
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,680
by saying
"the moon is so beautiful tonight".

400
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,640
That's what Xiao Chuan did.

401
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,040
Xiao Man, calm down first.

402
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,239
You know, back in high school...

403
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:03,880
It's just that...

404
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,439
Are you sure he knows the allusion?

405
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,040
Well...

406
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,040
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

407
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,280
As I know about that blockhead,

408
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,560
it's likely that
he was just talking about the moon.

409
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,959
No way.

410
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:26,119
Do you remember
I told you I gave him a Snoopy?

411
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,520
I asked him,
and he said he loved it very much.

412
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:33,040
This time, I won't misunderstand it again.

413
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Really?

414
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,359
Xia Lin Xi.

415
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,319
I think...

416
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
We have to end our friendship

417
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,520
and start changing it into kinship.

418
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:52,359
-Come on, be happy for me.
-I...

419
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,920
Next, I'm going to
study advanced mathematics.

420
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,520
I gotta make myself smarter
to protect Chen Yi Chuan's dignity,

421
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,640
and for the sake of the average IQ
of our children in the future.

422
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,479
Okay?

423
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,119
I have to go.

424
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,160
Yes! Love you.

Hello, Chen Yi Chuan. Where are you?

427
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,520
Are you being kidding or serious?

428
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,560
If you're kidding,
you shouldn't accept her gift.

429
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,719
That you told her you liked it
would make her misunderstand you.

430
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,599
It's my own business
to like something or not.

431
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,920
It's not up to you.

432
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,640

How did you also know that?

435
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,479
If you're serious,
you should treat her well.

436
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,680
I'm serious, of course.

437
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,560
Really?

438
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,479
Yeah.

439
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,719
Then...

440
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,040
Then don't hurt her again.

441
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,199
Be mature.

She's still here.

I don't know where she has gone now.

What?

447
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,640
OK, I'll take a look.

448
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,079

about me and senior Shi Ying?

449
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,400

00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,800
I'll give you a present.

457
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:18,079
Whatever it is, you just accept it, OK?

458
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:21,439
Why do you give me a gift all of a sudden?

459
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,280
What gift? Say it first.

460
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,439
I bought a computer for you.

-This computer...
-I didn't use my parents' money.

No, this is too expensive.
Go return it for refund.

Hey.

00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,040
I've torn up the invoice, no refund now.

467
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,719
You can't return it now.

468
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,800
You have to keep it.

469

What's the smile about?

470
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,119
You know what, even without the invoice,

471
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,479
if I put it on the market,

472
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,400
I can sell it at the original price
within a month.

473
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,239
You just sell my present for you
to some stranger like this?

474
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:26,319
You can give it back to me in the future.

I'll throw it away now.

Okay, okay, I'll take it. I will.

Give it to me.

00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,959
a wedding ring,

500
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,000
a marriage certificate and
a property ownership certificate.

501
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,439
All to be paid off
at a time with no delay allowed.

502
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:07,479
Promise maker, Jiang Zheng Han.

503
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,280
Who wants your marriage certificate
and property ownership certificate?

504
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,719
This is my

505
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,880
contract to you.

506
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,319
I'll give you the money and myself.

507
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,239
Then I'll charge more interest.

508
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,319
If it's this kind of interest,

509
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,599
I don't mind paying more.

510
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm scared to death.

511
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,199
Xia Lin Xi, why did you lock the door?

512
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:06,959
Open the door.

513
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,479
It's my cousin.

514
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,880
Hide yourself up.
