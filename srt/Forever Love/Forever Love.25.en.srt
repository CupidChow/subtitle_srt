This novel is so touching.

29
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,320
Beauty, you have such beautiful eyes,

30
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,839
willow-leaf-shaped eyebrows
and a lotus-like face.

31
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:34,880
Hey, beauty.

32
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,720
Wait a minute.

33
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,559
With such a beautiful look,

34
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,559
you must be like a cup of soda.

35
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,919
Why?

36
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
Because looking at you

37
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,800
makes my heart beat happily with bubbles.

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,759
So right now,

39
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,919
could I have your name?

40
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,720
And you must be a punchbag!

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,440
Because I can't help beating you
every time I see you!

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,919
Chen Yi Chuan.

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,880
Are you insane?

44
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,080
You scum!

45
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,720
Beauty...

46
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,039
Chen Yi Chuan.

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,039
How could you be so cruel to break up

48
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,839
a coming-to-be couple?

49
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:07,880
How dare you say that

50
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,199
since you already have a girlfriend?

51
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,240
No wonder Gu Xiao Man cried so hard.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm gonna kill you now.

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,919
Hold on.

54
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
I already have a girlfriend?

55
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,480
Xiao Man is not my girlfriend.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,600
You're still denying it.

57
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,079
Chen Yi Chuan!

58
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,880
I've had enough of you.

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,279
Chen Yi Chuan, Duan Ning,
what are you doing?

60
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,239
You're still not aware of
what you've done?

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
I did nothing, really.

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,119
Oh, my god! Please.

63
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,239
Open wide your eyes, okay?

64
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,839
Duan Ning was beat by Chen Yi Chuan

65
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,359
because of you.

66
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,399
Impossible.

67
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,000
How would Chen Yi Chuan
beat anyone for me?

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,519
No, Gu Xiao Man is not the reason.

69
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,239
Duan Ning, he's such a scum.

70
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,679
So I can't help myself.

71
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,600
That's what's really going on.

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,119
Listen, Xiao Man.

73
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,519
You should stop making use of Duan Ning

74
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,119
to get Chen Yi Chuan angry.

75
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,000
It's really unfair

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
to both of them.

77
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
In fact,

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,640
Duan Ning is not my boyfriend.

79
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,239
What?

80
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,359
Duan Ning has told me that

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Gu Xiao Man is not his girlfriend.

82
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,559
You made a mistake.

83
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,519
Why didn't you admit it?

84
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,440
No, I didn't.

85
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,760
He kept it a secret.

86
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,559
If not, I would already...

87
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,880
Didn't you also keep it a secret

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,239
that you love Gu Xiao Man?

89
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,200
Gu Xiao Man.

90
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,799
You didn't tell anyone

91
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,880
about you and Duan Ning,

92
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
even including me!

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,239
Do you still take me as your best friend?

94
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,399
I didn't mean to hide it.

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,239
It's all Chen Yi Chuan's fault.

96
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,880
He said that he didn't like me.

97
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
Duan Ning decided to play along with me

98
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,320
because he knew that I was too angry.

99
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,320
Chen Yi Chuan.

100
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,839
It's not a shame to admit your feelings.

101
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,640
But you keep bothering her
instead of confessing your love.

102
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,959
That's a shame.

103
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,399
Can't you figure out what a logic it is?

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,839
I... I didn't realize it before.

106
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,239
But now I do know how I feel about her.

107
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,839
Since that,

108
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,320
and you know she is single now.

109
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,839
What's your plan?

110
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:11,239
Lots of things happened recently.

111
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,760
I've totally given up on
dreaming about a romantic love.

112
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,720
Maybe,

113
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,040
I can only write love stories,

114
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,959
but not to have one.

115
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,320
Even if you can,

116
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,399
my cousin is such an idiot

117
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,760
that he really needs to
suffer more or less.

118
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
Xiao Man.

119
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,600
You should continue to

120
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,040
play cat and mouse with him.

121
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,839
It works well on Chen Yi Chuan!

122
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,760
My plan is

123
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,239
to treat her times better

124
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,920
than what I owed her before.

125
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,600
Good.

126
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,200
What exactly will you do?

127
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,559
Can you tell her that I like her?

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,359
Shouldn't you tell her in person?

129
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,720
But I...

130
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,119
I... I really don't know how to do it.

131
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,119
Brother-in-law.

132
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,359
Brother-in-law.

133
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,480
My brother-in-law.

134
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,399
Please help me.

135
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:17,399
Okay.

136
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,320
As your brother-in-law,

137
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,839
here,

138
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,959
I have some ideas for you.

139
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,480
To get a girl...

140
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,880
How's your talk with Chen Yi Chuan?

141
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,440
Not bad.

142
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,160
I helped remind him

143
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,720
of what should be done,

144
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,320
and taught him something.

145
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,040
What's that?

146
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Nothing special.

147
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,679
I told him a story about

148
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,279
how you and me got together.

149
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,279
What?

150
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,279
Jiang Zheng Han,
that should be only between us.

151
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,440
Just kidding.

152
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
Actually,

153
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,119
I gave him a book.

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,040
-A book?
-Yeah.

155
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,399
In fact, Duan Ning gave it to him.

156
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,040
Surprisingly,

157
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,079
Duan Ning does care about her.

158
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,119
Yeah, what a surprise.

159
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,519
Duan Ning does have feelings for her.

160
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,519
Hope they live as they wish.

161
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,239
They will, actually.

162
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,799
-Right?
-Yes.

163
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,760
Xiao Man.

164
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,280
What?

165
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:49,799
Why are you here?

166
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,559
Xiao Man.

167
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,520
I...

168
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,200
I...

169
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,479
If nothing, I'd say goodbye.

170
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,359
Wait.

171
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,520
What?

172
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,599
Look.

173
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,400
It's for you.

174
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,020
<i>Lei Guo
Keep Good Health</i>

175
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,950
<i>Herbal Foot Bath</i>

176
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,400
What is it?

177
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,840
A foot bath bucket for your health.

178
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
There are also

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,520
foot-soaking materials
and handmade brown sugar.

180
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,440
I learned it online that

181
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,479
soaking foot helps
improve blood circulation,

182
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,479
physical condition, immunity,

183
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,200
and sleep quality.

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,960
So I...

185
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,599
You don't have hot water in your dorm?

186
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,880
I can get some for you right now.

187
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,799
No, thanks.

188
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,640
I don't need this.

189
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,559
I wanna go back

190
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,520
if there's nothing else.

191
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,679
No, there's something else.

192
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,679
A gift for you.

193
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,039
I made it.

194
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,400
I've been waiting for a chance

195
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,200
to give it to you.

196
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I don't want it.

197
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,799
So ugly. Keep it to yourself.

198
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,359
Hey... Xiao Man.

199
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,559
Once,

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
in a house on Street Egypt,

201
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,080
there lived

202
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,640
a china rabbit named Edward Tulane.

203
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,039
The rabbit was very pleased with himself,

204
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,880
and for good reason.

205
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,359
He was owned

206
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:42,239
by a girl name Abiline,

207
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,280
who treated him

208
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,640
with the utmost care

209
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,119
and adored him completely.

210
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,840
But later,

211
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,159
one day,

212
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,280
he was lost.

213
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,359
Yi Chuan.

214
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you available to
help me with this question?

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,679
Please, do me a favor, okay?

216
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,840
Xiao Chuan.

217
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,919
This limited edition toy of Snoopy,

218
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,679
I registered dozens of times

219
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,840
to win it over.

220
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,880
This Snoopy

221
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,119
has been blessed.

222
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,640
So I believe

223
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,799
it will bring you good luck

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,520
and help you recover.

225
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,760
All you want can come true.

226
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:49,280
I wish you'd get better very soon.

227
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,880
Gu Xiao Man!

228
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,159
I've read the book,

229
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,479
the Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane.

230
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,000
I've realized that

231
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,919
I am Edward Tulane the rabbit.

232
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,919
I don't know love and feelings.
I'm self-contented.

233
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,159
My heart was not living

234
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,400
until I started that journey.

235
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,080
I'm sorry!

236
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,760
Because

237
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,039
I've made you so sad

238
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,559
in the past days.

239
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,039
I'm sorry for what I've done.

240
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,960
Could you accept my apology?

241
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,270
Why there's no boy
confessing his love to me?

242
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,460
This is how boys will do.

243
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,730
They say sweet words
but do things that are...

244
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,740
So romantic.

245
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,850
I've never...

246
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,679
That rabbit eventually understood

247
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,400
what love was after a long journey,

248
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,280
and he got back to be with his owner.

249
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,000
So did I.

250
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,039
Since I knew my feelings for you,

251
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,200
I've been feeling uncertain and upset

252
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,679
and also I was desperate
to get close to you.

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
But I was afraid.

254
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,000
Today, my courage brought me here.

255
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:30,760
Please give me another chance.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,119
Let me make up for

257
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,960
what you've suffered before.

258
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,919
Gu Xiao Man.

259
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,119
I love you!

260
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,280
Gu Xiao Man.

261
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,039
I am sorry!

262
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,200
Go for it, handsome boy!

263
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,359
Go for it!

264
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,640
We're on your side!

265
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:08,799
Go!

266
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,359
Xiao Man.

267
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,840
Where's the rabbit?

268
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,919
Both of you are not pretty.

269
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,039

You're welcome. I'm leaving.

You can have a guess.

279
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,599
I think you're the constellation of fairy.

280
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,440
You're truly

281
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,919
a fairy falling from the sky.

<i>2017, the third year at the university</i>

283
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,119
I have something to tell you.

284
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,199
My mom sent money to me.

285
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,400
Your mom loves you so much

286
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,839
that she can't watch you suffer.

287
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,160
But,

288
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,280
she still wants to keep her dignity.

289
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,680
So,

290
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,359
she makes dad
transfer the money every month.

291
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,199
My dad

292

wants me to quit my job.

293
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,079
He told me

294
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,479
it's time to
think about my future seriously

295
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,920
since it's the third year of my college.

No.

Hi.

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,880
Yeah,

303
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,239
it's Jiang Zheng Han.

304
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,599
I'm HR of TD Group.

305
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,520
I've been trying to reach you before.

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Would you like a meeting
when you're available?

307
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,640
Thanks.

308
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,119
But I'm not ready for that.

309
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:08,880
Mr. Jiang.

310
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,199
I've read your resume.

311
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,920
You did mathematical modeling
in high school,

312
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,119
and got the Gold Award in the ACP Contest.

313
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,479
Senior executives of XV

314
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,800
also admitted that you're brilliant.

315
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,760
You deserve a better platform
for your talent.

316
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,560
Thanks.

317
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,239
But I'm not planning to get a job now.

318
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,680
Maybe next time.

319
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,800
Well, consider it, Mr. Jiang.

320
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,359
Whenever you're ready,

321
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,439
just call me.

322
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,239
Okay, thank you.

323
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,800
Why did you refuse him?

324
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,439
Don't you know TD is the top

325
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,199
in the field of programming?

326
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,000
This company

327
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,040
is having a better future than XV.

328
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,000
Are you out of your mind?

329
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,880
Do you know a joke

330
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,719
in the start-up community

331
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,760
that a programmer is the last one to join?

332
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,839
You wanna start a company?

333
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:55,839
Yes.

334
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,280
Seriously?

335
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,520
I've seriously thought about it.

336
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,880
The path that
seems to be the most difficult

337
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,359
is actually the closest one.

338
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,119
Do you remember

339
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,719
I showed you a security alarming software

340
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:12,800
that I developed back in our secret base?

341
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,199
Yes.

342
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,520
That one

343
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,079
was just tested once.

344
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,719
Come here.

345
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,839
The one I showed you

346
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,359
is the original version.

347
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,520
And this one,

348
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,959
has been tested seven times.

349
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,359
It can try and go online now.

350
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,760
And look,

351
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,640
I've written a business plan
and proposals.

352
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,040
Lin Xi.

353
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,239
I want to start a business.

354
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,079
I want to

355
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,680
develop my own software
of security alarming.

356
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,319
Wait a minute.

357
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,959
I have twenty thousand yuan in this card.

358
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,599
That's all I have.

359
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,160
Plus the money in your pay card,

360
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,760
which should be fifty thousand yuan.

361
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,680
If you need more later,

362
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,040
I'll try some other ideas.

363
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,719
You wanna keep me forever?

364
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,599
No need.

365
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,079
I can afford it

366
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,239
with my own money.

367
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,880
No, this money is for me.

368
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:22,839
You don't know

369
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,680
my strongest point?

370
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,000
No, what is it?

371
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,239
I'm good at making choices.

372
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,719
So,

373
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:30,599
from now on,

374
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,880
I'm your investor.

375
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,319
And then, show your respect.

376
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,359
You and me,

377
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,520
wife and husband working
as boss and subordinate.

378
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,199
Isn't it tricky for company management?

379
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:45,199
Not wife and husband yet, okay?

380
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,439
What's more,

381
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,280
there are just two people in the company,

382
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,479
how can you supervise over anyone?

383
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:53,640
Alright.

384
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, thanks, President Xia.

385
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,560
For your great support
for me and the company.

386
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,239
It's okay.

387
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,319
Alright then, Mr. Jiang.

388
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,920
How are you gonna start it?

389
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,839
First of all,

390
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,719
rent a place to work.

391
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,520
Well, leave it to me.

392
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,160
That's what I'm good at.

393
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,359
But where to find technicians?

394
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,280
And the initial fund seems not that much.

395
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,439
Although it's enough to cover the salary,

396
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,359
however,

397
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,439
it's just much enough

398
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,599
to afford one or two people.

399
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,439
Don't worry about it.

400
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
I can handle it.

401
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,880
I'm in the office.

402
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,079
Are you coming here?

403
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,839
Come in.

404
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,040
That's our office.

405
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,199
You're here.

406
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:46,880
Wow!

407
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,280
-Oh my goodness.
-You all come.

408
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,000
How cool is this!

409
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,640
Hi, sis Xia.

410
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,160
-Wow.
-I like this kind of style.

411
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,280
It looks great.

412
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,959
-Chuan, you're also here.
-Er...

413
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,520
Can we work in such a place?

414
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,880
Great place.

415
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
It looks good, Xiao Xi.

416
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,119
Cut it out.

417
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,160
Don't expect something else

418
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,680
when you've got a good one.

419
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,760
I think this place is pretty good.

420
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,479
Hey.

421
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,160
Wow.

422
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,920
Here is a place to have a break.

423
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,560
Look at this office. Look.

424
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,839
The working area is really spacious.

425
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,319
Right now, we can't afford a scenic place

426
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,439
with a French sash.

427
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,280
It's the best place that we can afford

428
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,959
with the limited fund.

429
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,439
Jiang Zheng Han.

430
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,479
Don't need to feel guilty.

431
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,680
I can forgive you at this special time.

432
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,599
Thanks, Talent Chen.

433
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,959
That's enough.

434
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,719
Stop it, you two.

435
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,640
Come over here, Talent Chen.

436
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,520
These printers and computers

437
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,040
come with this place?

438
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,920
How could it be?

439
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,000
I like these hanging lamps.

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,920
Lin Xi bought them

441
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,640
in a second-hand market.

442
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,959
-Really?
-And Mr. Jiang assembled them by himself.

443
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,719
Brother Zheng, sis Xia.

444
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,000
Just let me do this kind of
tiring job in the future.

445
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,319
You two don't need to do it.

446
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,599
Don't worry about it.

447
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,560
That will be all your work in the future.

448
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,079
No problem.

449
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,599
I'm good at everything

450
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,719
that doesn't need brains!

451
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,839
Jiang Zheng Han.

452
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,520
I think there's something wrong
with your head.

453
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,959
Starting up a business is fun.

454
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

455
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Why told you?

456
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,199
Called you here to fix computers?

457
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,800
-I...
-Alright, alright.

458
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Xiao Chuan is not good at speaking.

459
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,280
I know what he means.

460
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,800
He wants to join you.

461
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,119
And I think

462
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,760
I can help handle promotion

463
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,119
and public relations in your company.

464
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:32,839
What do you say?

465
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
-Good.
-Great.

466
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,160
In this case, I think I can handle more.

467
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,439
Like system architecture,

468
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,640
network security...

469
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
-He can handle it?
-Emergencies like system failure.

470
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,199
And network monitoring.

471
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,880
Hey, I can do it, too.

472
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,479
And I'm better than any one of you.

473
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,040
Apart from Jiang Zheng Han,

474
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,199
I'm the only one among us

475
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,199
who could use

476
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,000
the hexadecimal system at fourteen.

477
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,239
Alright, you're the best.

478
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,520
Well...

479
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,079
Those skilled things

480
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,359
are beyond me.

481
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,160
I'm not that smart, either.

482
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:08,640
How about this?

483
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:11,079
I can be the support staff.

484
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,719
-I can take care of you.
-Zhang Huai Wu, our guard!

485
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,319
Great.

486
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,400
-Good.
-Great.

487
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,760
-I can be your guard.
-That's what I need.

488
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,839
-Well, be our guard?
-Okay.

489
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:20,760
Jiang Zheng Han.

490
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,400
That's what you called the solution?

491
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,119
These people?

492
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,319
Sis Xia, that sounds really harsh.

493
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,520
How could you say that?

494
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,160
I don't like your remarks just now.

495
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,959
What's wrong with us?

496
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,599
-I agree.
-We're definitely

497
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,239
-your strongest backup.
-Exactly.

498
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:39,439
You can't be a boss
without letting us know.

499
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,119
No way.

500
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,520
-We must be your partners.
-Yeah.

501
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,920
If Qiu Yan hasn't come across

502
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,760
Jiang Zheng Han asking for help on campus,

503
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,239
we wouldn't have known your plan.

504
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:48,760
Why turn to others?
We're waiting for you to hire us!

505
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,479
-Yes.
-Right, we can't be hired?

506
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:54,160
You should feel honored
to have a talent like me.

507
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,160
Mr. Jiang, we're absolutely
the best partners.

508
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,560
Tell me,

509
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,040
do you have bank confirmations?

510
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,040
What? What's that?

511
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,520
Items made by an accounting firm,

512
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,239
before the business does start.

513
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,719
Well...

514
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,040
We don't, I think.

515
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,640
I bet you have no one
in charge of accounting.

516
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,959
Mr. Jiang, do you trust me
to help you with it?

517
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,160
Of course.

518
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,359
I believe you're capable of handling it.

519
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,520
But if Xu Zhi Li knows that

520
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,119
you're working for us,

521
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,959
your relationship with him
may be affected.

522
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,479
So...

523
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,199
Why?

524
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,439
Does this have anything to do with him?

525
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,119
Well, in the past,

526
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,839
he was refused by me many times.

527
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,359
That's not a big deal.

528
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,680
He can't control my job.

529
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,400
Don't worry about that.

530
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,160
Well then, as you wish.

531
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,839
-Good.
-Great.

532
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,239
Okay.

533
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
But if there's anything inconvenient later,

534
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
you can just leave.

535
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,160
No problem.

536
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:01,880
Guys.

537
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,119
We are

538
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,359
a small company,

539
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,199
a small team.

540
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,640
The salary for now won't be very high.

541
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,160
But I promise,

542
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,640
when things get better,

543
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,079
I'll make up for it.

544
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,479
Working for brother Zheng,

545
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:15,479
I can even accept zero salary.

546
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,199
Stop saying something like that.

547
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,520
That sounds like I'm a stranger to you.

548
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,479
Brother Zheng.

549
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,359
I also don't like it when you said that.

550
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,239
Listen,

551
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,800
I, Zhang Huai Wu,
don't need any money from you.

552
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,319
Just don't refuse me since I'm not smart.

553
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,160
Seriously?

554
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,920
-Seriously, no money.
-I need money.

555
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,640
I need a basic salary.

556
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,719
One hundred yuan.

557
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,280
Oh, remember,

558
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,040
whenever you buy something,

559
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,239
bring me back the receipt.

560
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,319
Okay, though I don't know what that means.

561
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,719
Bring back the receipt, right?

562
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:46,079
-That's all, right?
-Right.

563
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,040
Can I buy a cake?

564
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,160

565
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,439

566

I'll send you a model form later.

567
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,280
Don't forget to fill out the form.

568

569
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,319
Thank you.

570
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,719
All you do will be kept in my mind.

571
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:23,800
Alright,

572
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,560
everything is done now.

-Let's go.

-Go for it!
-Where's still unclean? Leave it to me.

582
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,719
Look at this.

583

everything's clean here?

to have a check at our firm at any time.

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,199
You looked weird

609
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,479
when you talked to Qiu Yan.

610
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,599
So obvious?

611
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,599
A little bit.

612
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,520
Is there anything

613
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,400
that you're hiding from Qiu Yan?

614
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,079
Is it something

615
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,760
about Xu Zhi Li?

616
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,839
The other day,
Xie and I went out on business

617
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,920
and found something.

618
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,760
I didn't know it until I met
some big figures in the industry.

619
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,599
I found that Mr. Cao and Xu Zhi Li

620
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,880
manipulated the leak scandal,

621
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,280
so that Xie
would be kicked out of the firm,

622
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,680
and also

623
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,479
that I would have to
join them with the project.

624
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,160
He also has some source codes.

625
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,400
So I think

626
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,400
he may extrapolate from them.

627
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,640
You mean,

628
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Xu Zhi Li is likely

629
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,239
to launch a similar competitor's product.

630
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,000
If he puts it on the market ahead of us,

631
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,319
it will be harder for us
to get the investment

632
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,599
as a new start-up?

633
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,280
Yes.

634
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,359
Does Qiu Yan know about this?

635
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,800
She seems not.

636
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,000
Don't let her know now.

637
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,920

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,199
Go for it! Go for it!

682
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,560
Work. Go to work.

683
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,680
Let's go, go.

684
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,079
Hurry up.

685
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:33,479
Wait, I have something else to say.

686
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,719
Here's the data comparison
between the two testing versions.

687
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:36,319
Basically it's stable.

688
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,520
Is there anything else to confirm?

689
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,839
-Let me see.
-Okay.

690
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,959
I need to have a close look.

691
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,239
You'll go to Rui Teng
for the investment meeting

692
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,280
at nine o'clock tomorrow morning, right?

693
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,680
Yes. Why?

694
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,199
Right.

695
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,599
I can't go there with you.

696
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,599
What happened?

697
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,520
Our software needs the investment.

698
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
But our patent certificate
has not arrived yet.

699
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,119
I heard it from Xu Zhi Li

700
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,800
that we might be in bad situation

701
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,520
if we fail to get the certificate

702
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,400
before seeing those potential investors.

703
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,479
Can we get the patent certificate in time?

704
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,560
Xu Zhi Li

705
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,000
will go to that meeting tomorrow.

706
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,840
I bet he would take advantage of

707
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,360
our lack of the certificate.

708
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,520
In fact,

709
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,199
I've known what he's done.

710
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,719
-But if you don't want me...
-I believe you.

711
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,320
So do I.

712
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,719
Thank you.

713
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:33,679
And about the certificate,

714
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:37,320
it can be applied urgently.

715
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,520
When the patent office opens

716
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,239
at eight o'clock tomorrow morning,

717
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,679
I'll be definitely there in advance

718
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,919
and take the certificate to that meeting.

719
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,040
Don't worry about that.

720
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,199
Thanks, Qiu Yan.

721
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,199
But,

722
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,719
I don't want the thing

723
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,439
to affect your relationship with Xu Zhi Li.

724
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,840
We will feel very sorry.

725
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Xiao Xi.

726
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,040
If there's something wrong
with the relationship,

727
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,560
it's because he and I
don't have that kismet,

728
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,760
not your fault.

729
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,439
Although I

730
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,879
don't like the way he deals with things,

731
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:16,239
undeniably,

732
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,479
he's a perfect boyfriend to me.

733
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:21,800
So don't worry about it.

734
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,840
Well, I should leave

735
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,080
and do something for the application.

736
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,280
-Okay.
-Okay.

737
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,080
Thank you.

738
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,959
Mr. Jiang, Mrs. Jiang.

739
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,679
Good luck for tomorrow.

740
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,479
Good luck.

741
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,199
Let's get back to work.

742
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,100
<i>Rui Teng Plaza</i>

743
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,600
What a coincidence.

744
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:06,639
You're coming here
for the investment meeting?

745
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,439
A bunch of losers,

746
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,840
how can you do anything big?

747
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,360
Whom are you referring to?

748
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,800
I just want to remind you kindly,

749
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,520
does your software

750
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,479
get the patent certificate,

751
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,959
our great Heng Xia?

752
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,679
Hope everything goes well on your side.

753
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,479
Brother Zheng.

754
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:44,719
Will it affect the bidding if we

755
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,399
don't have the patent certificate?

756
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,000
It's okay.

757
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,360
We should believe in ourselves.

758
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,879
-Believe in our team.
-Yes.

759
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:54,959
Let's keep our morale up

760
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,040
before getting in.

761
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,000
-Okay.
-Good.

762
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,439
Come.

763
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,840
All of us.

764
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,679
Three.

765
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,040
Two.

766
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,639
One.

767
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,040
Good luck!

768
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,280
All right.

769
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,560
Hi, everyone.

770
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,439
Mr. Zhang.

771
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,600
Today, let me introduce

772
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,040
our company's project.

773
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,850
<i>Business Plan Of
The Security Software Project</i>

774
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,420
<i>HX: Security Software Planning Solution</i>

775
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,600
Here's our patent certificate, Mr. Zhang.

776
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,040
-Please have a look.
-Okay.

777
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,760
Then, where's your certificate?

778
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,520
Mr. Zhang.

779
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,840
We've applied for it.

780
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,280
But the certificate is on the way.

781
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,120
When will it arrive?

782
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,439
Next year,

783
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,719
huh?

784
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:37,840
Mr. Zhang.

785
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,919
Let's move on.

786
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,800
-We prepared a lot for our cooperation...
-Mr. Zhang, the patent application...

787
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,320
-Has been approved.
-Including the certificate and other details.

788
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,239
However, the certificate...

789
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,199
Sorry.

790
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:46,639
I'm late.

791
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:25,360
Mr. Zhang, this is the patent certificate.

792
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,520
Please have a look.

793
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,600
Qiu Yan.

794
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:32,600
Chu Qiu Yan.

795
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:38,840
Why did you do that?

796
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,239
I'm working now.

797
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,760
I don't wanna talk with you.

798
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,639
Come with me.

799
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,280
Are you gonna

800
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,840
break up with me right here?

801
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,439
I...

802
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,520
No...

803
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,679
Okay, see you at home tonight.

804
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,120
Get back early.

805
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,600
Cheers!

806
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,000
Brother Zheng.

807
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,719
Didn't you promise

808
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,199
to celebrate at a seafood restaurant?

809
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,560
Why are we eating this normal food?

810
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,320
We don't have that much money.

811
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,360
You know it very well, don't you?

812
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,280
Hey, see that?

813
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,840
What a bloodsucking capitalist.

814
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,280
You won five million yuan of investment.

815
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,800
But you're too mean to
reward us laboring people.

816
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,040
He's right, Jiang Zheng Han.

817
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,600
You're so mean

818
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,080
that I have to worry about our future.

819
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Chen Yi Chuan.

820
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,040
We're celebrating now.

821
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,600
We should say something happy, right?

822
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,080
Sure, you're right.

823
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,760
I'd like to enjoy even on the roadside.

824
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,840
Stop being so picky.

825
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,320
I said nothing.

826
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,159
Wow, I finally witness the power of love.

827
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,520
It can make a picky man

828
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,679
into such an obedient man.

829
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,199
Exactly.

830
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,239
Enjoy the food and cut it out.

831
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,919
Alright, stop kidding, guys.

832
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,760
Okay, let me say something serious.

833
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,520
From now on,

834
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:01,840
we shall call brother Zheng Mr. Jiang.

835
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Yes, Mr. Jiang.

836
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,760
-That's right, Mr. Jiang.
-What a lickspittle.

837
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,439
Don't call me Mr. Jiang.

838
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:08,239
Mr. Jiang, say the opening words.

839
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,479
Okay.

840
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,360
Well,

841
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,439
the first one,

842
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,800
to Qiu Yan.

843
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,320
It's Qiu Yan

844
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,959
who helped our investment go well.

845
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,080
Now,

846
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,959
to Qiu Yan.

847
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,159
To Qiu Yan.

848
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,560
Thank you.

849
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,679
Qiu Yan did destroy
her relations to be righteous.

850
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,239
Xiao Chuan, what nonsense is that?

851
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,479
Qiu Yan is the biggest contributor
to us today.

852
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,560
She knows very well
personal matters and work.

853
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,760
Alright, in the following days,

854
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,919
we must pay more attention

855
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,919
to the security of our software

856
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:50,600
and also its maintenance.

857
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,879
I know Xu Zhi Li very well.

858
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:54,320
After what happened today,

859
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
he will definitely do more things.

860
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,360
Here's good news.

861
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,520
What is it?

862
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,239
Next month,

863
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,639
our software will be tested.

864
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,120
The investor also
promised to do ground promotion.

865
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,159
So next month, on the subway...

866
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
-We can see our company's ad.
-Really?

867
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,959
-Wow!
-There are lots of people.

868
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,479
-Great place.
-Okay.

869
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:21,639
The second one, to Heng Xia,

870
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,639
hope it have a promising future.

871
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,439
Yeah, a promising future. Cheers.

872
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,879
Great.

873
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,760
Boss's time is over now.

874
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,679
Mrs. Jiang, say something, won't you?

875
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,879
Sis Xia, you should say something.

876
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,199
Mrs. Jiang. Mrs. Jiang.

877
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,120
Alright.

878
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,000
The third one,

879
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,639
hope our software goes well online.

880
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,879
And also,

881
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:49,879
hope it stands on the top

882
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:50,919
on the APP rankings.

883
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:52,520
-Good. Hope it goes well.
-Sure.

884
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,879
Hope it goes well. Cheers.

885
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,120
Hurry up.

886
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:00,399
Coming, coming.

887
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,040
Xiao Man, your latte.

888
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,800
Take it away.

889
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,239
Okay.

890
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,760
Look at this.

891
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,800
Coffee?

892
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:12,239
Smell it.

893
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:13,239
Smell it.

894
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:14,159
Take it away from my eyes.

899
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,199
There are still some bugs.

900

Before it's put online,

901
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,120
we need to check again.

902
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:36,439
-Well...
-We must ensure that

903
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,239
there's nothing wrong at each stage.

We're finally

917
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:07,199
done with developing the software

918
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360

escape from these annoying exams?

Your tears during the reviewing period

come from your thoughtless brain

Oh god, it's driving me crazy.

Hey, if there's something you don't know,

ask me, such a talent beside you.

Talent,

928
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:31,600
can you develop a high-tech software

929
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,719
to print the knowledge
directly into my brain?

930
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,479
Well...

931
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:38,639
Let me think about it.

932
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,760
Hello, please get back to your seat.

933
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,280
Alas, I just want to sit by your side.

934
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,679
I won't bother you.

935
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,199
-No way.
-Stop and review it.

936
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,879
-With you by my side...
-Okay.

937
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,320
I can't help looking at you.

938
00:44:57,639 --> 00:44:58,679
Besides,

939
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,600
I can't fail any exams any more.

940
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:06,760
Okay, go ahead.

Stop reviewing.

943

Here's something.

944
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,919
We have a problem.

945
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,080
What happened?

946
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,760
The software of Heng Xia revealed

947
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,320
five thousand users' personal information?

948
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,199
What? No way!

949
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,080
Impossible. Let me see.

950
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
Let me see.

951
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:41,399
-Let me see it closer.
-I need to answer the call.

952
00:45:41,399 --> 00:45:44,000
-Hurry, Xiao Xi.
-We have a perfect encryption system.

953
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,239
How could it be?

954
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,520
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

955
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,479
This is the most unsafe software?

956
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:50,320
If what they said is proved wrong,

957
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,399
we can sue them.

958
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:53,360
Clam down now.

959
00:45:57,439 --> 00:45:58,360
Guys.

960
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:01,800
The investor called to
withdraw the investment,

961
00:46:03,399 --> 00:46:05,080
and claim for compensation.

962
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,120
What?

963
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,679
No way...
