00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,199
I told you. I don't quit for him.

20
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,720
It's for myself.

21
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,160
Now the company is no longer what it was

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,199
when I started working here.

23
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,639
I don't know

24
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:01,800
the one that has changed is me,

25
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,760
or the company.

26
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,160
Okay.

27
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,600
Zheng Han.

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,479
You have a good chat with Mr. Xie.

29
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,759
I'll leave.

30
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,119

Boss.

33

-You don't need to quit for me...
-Don't think too much.

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,960
It's not for you.

35
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,039
I've been dreaming of becoming a hermit

36
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,320
who is distant from
the worldly life for long.

37
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,039
Isn't it good to be an aspiring young man

38
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,479
far from vulgarity of the society?

39
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,119
Anyway, thank you.

40
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,080
If you need me in the future,

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
I'll be there for you.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,600
Come on, stop your emotional speech.

43
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,720
Now I am an aspiring young man.

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,080

or an aspiring uncle?

46
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,360
Boy, you're gonna get smart with me?

47
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,160
Hello.

48
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,919
It's for you.

49
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,399
Hello.

50
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,759
Yes, I'm.

51
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,240
Alright.

52
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,320
I'll be back soon.

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,839
I need to go back to the university.

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,279
How come I got this call for you?

55
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,239
Too many calls today.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,079
So I set my phone on silent mode.

57
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Listen,

58
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,239
when you are back to the university,

59
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,600
no matter what others say,

60
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,920
don't take their words to heart.

61
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,799
This thing is not done yet.

62
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,559
Don't worry.

63
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,119
Even if you can't
find a job in the future,

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
as long as I have food,

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,160
you won't starve.

66
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,959
You know how old you are now?

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,079
How many years can you keep working?

68
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
You better count on me in the future.

69
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,799
You brat!

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,320
Hey.

71
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,399
Chuan, where are you going?

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,040
What?

73
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,600
-Xiao Man.
-Chen Yi Chuan!

74
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,760
I've been looking for you.

75
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,359
What's the matter? You look so flustered.

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
It's great that both of you are here.

77
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,440
Have you read the news
about Jiang Zheng Han?

78
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,040
-What news?
-What happened?

79
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,359
Shocking inside information.

80
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,480
An intern of Jing Hua University
revealed XV's business secrets.

81
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,880
What nonsense is this?

82
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,000
The intern of XV mentioned in the articles

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,880
is Jiang Zheng Han.

84
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,519
They made his name public.

85
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,600
People are scolding him online

86
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,079
blindly.

87
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,880
I can't find either Jiang Zheng Han

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,480
or Xiao Xi.

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Has brother Zheng

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,720
been detained by XV?

91
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,279
You bet.

92
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,239
We must do something.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,959
Oh my God.

94
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,559
You're all here.

95
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,399
Why didn't you answer my calls?

96
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,600
-What's the matter?
-What happened?

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,640
It seems that
brother Zheng will be expelled again.

98
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,279
-What?
-What nonsense are you talking?

99
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,399
It's true.

100
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,480
Your instructor made a call to your dorm.

101
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,959
But you were not around. So I answered it.

102
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,839
He seemed to have known the XV scandal.

103
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,720
And he asked brother Zheng
to see him at once.

104
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
Did you call brother Zheng?

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
Yes. He said that he would come soon.

106
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll go back to the dorm

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,480
to see if Xiao Xi has come back.

108
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,119
What should we do?

109
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,079
I have no idea, either.

110
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,279
Let's go to the instructor's office first.

111
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,279
Right. Let's go.

112
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,559
It's not true. Believe me.

113
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,119
Jiang Zheng Han is absolutely trustworthy.

114
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,519
It's impossible that
he revealed the secrets.

115
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,720
That's right.
Brother Zheng is an upright man.

116
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,519
It's impossible that he would do that.

117
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,880
Sir, Jiang Zheng Han is not a fool.

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
How could he possibly do such a thing

119
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
to destroy his own future?

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,399
-That's right.
-It's impossible.

121
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,399
-Enough.
-You gotta believe us.

122
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,959
Can't you let me say something?

123
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,440
I haven't told you
why I need Jiang Zheng Han here.

124
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,359
Yet you begin to attack me together.

125
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,119
Do me a favor, guys.

126
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,600
Go back, okay?

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,279
-Wait...
-Sir, please let me explain.

128
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,239
Sir, look...

129
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,200
-Brother Zheng would never do such a thing.
-Right, he can't...

130
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
-Wait.
-Yes.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,799
Who are you?

132
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,799
Which department are you from?

133
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,279
Have I seen you before?

134
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,799
I... Who am I?

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,640
A righteous passer-by.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,559
Yes.

137
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,559
I'm a righteous passer-by.

138
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,040
Can't you be serious?

139
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,119
Sir.

140
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,600
It happened so suddenly.

141
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
There must be something tricky unknown.

142
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,320
-So you can't blame Jiang Zheng Han...
-Brother Zheng.

143
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,359
Why are you all here?

144
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,320
Brother Zheng.

145
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,480
Brother Zheng.

146
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,399
Are you alright?

147
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,600
-Are you fine?
-Where have you been?

148
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,880
You'll be expelled soon.
How can you still be so carefree?

149
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,799
Be careful about what you say.

150
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,359
Has he been expelled?
Has it become a fact?

151
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,000
Even the instructor hasn't said that yet.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,839
-Anyway, you can't...
-I'm just worried that he will possibly...

153
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,720
Stop.

154
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,440
I have something to
talk with Jiang Zheng Han.

155
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,920
You guys go back first.

156
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,920
Withdraw. Withdraw.

157
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,320
Be careful.

158
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,200
-Take care.
-Take care?

159
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,000
Just go. I won't eat him alive.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,279
Keep calm.
I don't want you to be expelled.

161
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,320
Sir.

162
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,559
Our university

163
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
wants to know

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,079
the whole story of what happened in XV.

165
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,399
There are
all kinds of comments online now.

166
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,359
Although

167
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,160
a minority of people doubt it,

168
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,559
most of them are scolding you.

169
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,160
I think
you must have seen the comments, too.

170
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,559
I asked you to come back

171
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,160
because I wanted you to tell me your plan.

172
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,480
Sir.

173
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,559
It was fabricated.

174
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,359
I know that

175
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,399
it has a negative impact

176
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,679
on our university's reputation.

177
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,039
I'm sorry for that.

178
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,520
But I really hope that

179
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,039
you and other faculties can believe me.

180
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,000
I've never done anything

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,640
that I shouldn't do.

182
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,119
Good.

183
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,239
Make it clear.

184
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,159
I'll believe you.

185
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,840
In fact, the truth is...

186
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,690
<i>Administration Building</i>

187
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:02,760
Here he is!

188
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,559
Brother Zheng, how is it going now?

189
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,400
-Are you alright?
-It's okay.

190
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,039
We were so worried about you, you know?

191
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,799
Listen,

192
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,239
sixty percent

193
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,919
of the netizens are just onlookers.

194
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,960
-They are following the crowd.
-That's right.

195
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,520
You must prove your innocence by evidence,

196
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,919
so that people will be on your side.

197
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,080
Jiang Zheng Han, don't worry.

198
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,239
I'll manage to obtain the evidence

199
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,359
to prove that you're innocent.

200
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,479
Yes. Even if you are not,

201
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,479
we'll still...

202
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,159
No.

203
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,559
I... I...

204
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,799
I mean that you are surely innocent.

205
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,239
-We'll support brother Zheng till the end, right?
-Jiang Zheng Han.

206
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:29,960
Got it.

207
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,919
Lin Xi.

208
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,200
Why didn't you answer my calls

209
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,559
and my WeChat messages?

210
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,919
I got too many calls.

211
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,280
So I set my phone on silent mode.

212
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,119
Did you see the news online?

213
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,479
Yes, I read one piece of them.

214
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,919
But I didn't believe any word of it.

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,520
It's my fault this time.

216
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,000
I didn't contact you in the first place.

217
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,799
Sorry.

218
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,520
That's alright.

219
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
Gosh.

220
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,159
-What's the matter?
-What's wrong?

221
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,410
<i>Shocking Inside information!</i>

222
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,440
<i>An Intern Of Jing Hua
University Revealed XV's Business Secrets.</i>

223
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,039
Brother Zheng.

224
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,960
You are

225
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,520
fired by XV?

226
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,960
-Impossible.
-What?

227
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,479
What's going on?

228
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:23,080
Hey.

229
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,440
Isn't he Jiang Zheng Han, Talent Jiang?

230
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,599
You get famous now.

231
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,320
Jing Hua University is proud of you.

232
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,239
Right?

233
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,919
-Right.
-Look...

234
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,719
Anyhow, you're a student of
Jing Hua University.

235
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,799
Alas, think about this,
so popular Talent Jiang was.

236
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,520
But now
he is obnoxious to everyone.

237
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,599
Can you imagine that?

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,400
The world is changing so fast,
Jiang Zheng Han.

239
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,440
Why should our university
make an exception to admit such a man?

240
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,919
A shame to our
Jing Hua University's varsity!

241
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,840
What did you say?

242
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,119
What did you say just now?

243
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,039
-What you said is too harsh.
-You think I can still control my quick temper...

244
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,159
after you said that?

245
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,559
I dare you to say that again!

246
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,359
What are you gonna do?

247
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's go.

248
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,599
Do as brother Zheng says.

249
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,559
Xia Lin Xi.

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,200
Look, what a "good" taste you have.

251
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,599
You'd better stay with me rather than him.

252
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,440
Jiang Zheng Han!

253
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,039
-Jiang Zheng Han!
-Stop!

254
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,159
Stop!

255
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,159
Stop! Didn't you hear me?

256
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,599
Professor Shi.

257
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,119
Professor.

258
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,599
Professor.

259
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,880
He beat me.

260
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,320
Jiang Zheng Han, you're rubbish.

261
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,119
I advise you to quit the varsity.

262
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,000
Stop bringing shame on
our university's fame.

263
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,640
I'm not in charge of fights.

264
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,119
Call your instructor to come here.

265
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,000
However, I just heard that

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,400
someone wanted Jiang Zheng Han
to quit the varsity?

267
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,080
If he could make such a decision for me,

268
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
I'll let him take over my position.

269
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,520
Fine.

270
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,479
Even if I was wrong,

271
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,080
but he beat me.
How can he get away with it?

272
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,000
He brought shame on our university.

273
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,440
He stole the company's business secrets.

274
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,679
Now he's the wanted man
of the whole industry.

275
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,840
I was just
ridding the people of an evil man!

276
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Excuse me.

277
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,880
You shouldn't have said so.

278
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,080
We're all highly-educated.

279
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,400
You should also know

280
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,599
the meaning of the saying that

281
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,320
a wise man doesn't believe rumors.

282
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,679
How could you also
join in the cyber violence?

283
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,159
You wanted to
rid the people of the evil man?

284
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,039
Who are you?

285
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,280
Are you

286
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,440
Lu Zhi Shen, the reckless monk?

287
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,479
Right. He's so stupid.

288
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,320
He has lost his IQ

289
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,719
in the Mariana Trench.

290
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,280
Students like them
are far from being educable.

291
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,919
I'd like to see

292
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,080
who dare fight

293
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,159
before me!

294
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,080
Go.

295
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,440
Professor.

296
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,119
Long time no see.

297
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,200
You also know
we haven't seen each other for long?

298
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,640
Zheng Han, the thing has become huge.

299
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,520
We were so scared

300
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,359
that we stopped working at once.

301
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,960
Lest that you couldn't handle it alone,

302
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,880
we all came to support you.

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,559
Lin Xi.

304
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,159
Zheng made you worried.

305
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,559
Seniors, I felt reassured
when I saw you all here.

306
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,039
However,

307
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,119
we can't stop the netizens from commenting.

308
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,479
Zheng.

309
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,520
If you still want the job in the future,

310
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,039
you must ask XV to stand out

311
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,039
to make an explanation.

312
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,599
I heard that a top manager of XV

313
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,599
has also been involved?

314
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,679
He's my immediate supervisor.

315
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,799
His name is Xie Ping Chuan.

316
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,679
He already quit because he was on my side.

317
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,559
Unbelievable.
He does have a special personality.

318
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,919
Well, Jiang.

319
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,320
Is it the final say that you are fired?

320
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,119
You may say so.

321
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,799
Then we must rectify

322
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,159
this final say.

323
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,440
-Um, right.
-Look...

324
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,039
All of us

325
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,320
will help Jiang investigate thoroughly.

326
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,039
Meng, Qian.

327
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,479
You collect information
regarding the industry.

328
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,799
We should

329
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,760
study on it very carefully.

330
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,719
I don't believe that

331
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,799
we can't discover any evidence.

332
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,719
-Right.
-Okay.

333
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,599
Set it right and counterattack.

334
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,000
Zheng Han, trust us.

335
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,559
Let's go.

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,640
Wait.

337
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,960
You haven't asked me

338
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,919
whether I revealed the information or not.

339
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,919
You believe me to this extent?

340
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,039
-Of course.
-We believe you.

341
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,760
We don't need to ask.

342
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,840
I knew it was fabricated

343
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,159
as soon as I saw the news.

344
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,960
Even Chen Yi Chuan

345
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,719
knew that you're wronged.

346
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,159
Why did you say "even"?

347
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:17,640
Listen to me,

348
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,080
even if I didn't see those comments,

349
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,400
I still chose to believe Jiang Zheng Han.

350
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,039
Enough, you two.

351
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,359
Brother Zheng, we all believe you.

352
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,880
Right, professor?

353
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,679
Jiang.

354
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,400
Where there are lights, there are shadows.

355
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,799
The shadows exist because of the lights.

356
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,479
I've been teaching for so many years.

357
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:40,679
I believe that
I'm a good judge of character.

358
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,320
I trust you.

359
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,159
Thank you, professor.

360
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,719
Thank you, everyone.

361
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,280
I know you well.

362
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,400
By virtue of your capabilities,
you don't need to steal any codes.

363
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,840
I've also read
those articles scolding you.

364
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,760
Thousands of people gave them likes.

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,880
But I think they're all fake, all robots.

366
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,640
WeChat messages, screen shots.

367
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,960
Such things are easily to be made.

368
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,880
Even I can make some.

369
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,679
That's right. All fake.

370
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,000
The truth will be known eventually.

371
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,559
That day won't come too late.

372
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,719
Yes.

373
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:30,119
Professor, do you think
I can learn programming?

374
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,039
Do you think
I can be capable of learning it?

375
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,200
Don't think too much.

376
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,280
Smell it. The dumplings smell delicious.

377
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,000
All will get better.

378
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,280
Okay.

379
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,239
Hi!

380
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,039
Leave aside your work.

381
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,080
Come eat some dumplings.

382
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,440
Dumplings are here.

383
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Come, come.

384
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,679
Wait. Let me finish it first.

385
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,919
Leave aside your work.

386
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,880
Come, come.

387
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,960
Put it here.

388
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,039
It's for your hard work.

389
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,200
Wow, it's so good to have a girlfriend.

390
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,599
-Yeah!
-I'm so jealous.

391
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,799
Lin Xi, you're so considerate.

392
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,239
You even bring us some food.

393
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:06,479
-Come, try it.
-What stuffing is it?

394
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,479
-It is yummy anyway since it was bought by Lin Xi.
-Right, right.

-Thank...
-Zhang.

397
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,559
Try one.

398
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,640
-What stuffing?
-Before it turns cold.

399
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,919
Pork and cabbage.

400
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,840
Slowly. No one else will steal it from you.

401
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,760
So delicious.

402
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,239
Eat while they're still hot.

403
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,080
Thank you.

404
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,440

405
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,640
Hmm...

406
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,080
Not bad.

407
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,400
Where did you get the dumplings?

408
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,440
Did you make them?

409
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,159
I bought them from the student cafeteria.

410
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:47,280
Although they are not as good
as those made by your parents,

411
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,440
I'll learn to make dumplings in the future.

412
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,119
When I know how to make dumplings,

413
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,840
I'll make some for you.

414
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,880
You're so sweet.

415
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,599
Even if you can't make dumplings,

416
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,839
I'll still marry you.

417

Sorry.

440
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,160
I won't buy these things.

We've checked.

446
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,680
All of your bank cards are frozen.

447

506
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,800
teaching six courses is a heavy workload.

507
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,239
Is it okay for you?

508
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,719
Xia.

509
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,920
Your salary of this month
will be paid next month.

510
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,079
No problem.

511
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,040
Watch out.

512
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,319
This is a class of Grade 11

513
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,239
preparing for the College Entrance Exam.

514
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,040
Children aged 16 or 17

515
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,319
are usually disobedient.

516
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,119
You should get prepared for this.

517
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,400
-Okay.
-Good luck.

518
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,319
Hello, everyone.

519
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,760
Look, this teacher

520
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,239
is quite good-looking.

521
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,540
<i>Xia Lin Xi</i>

522
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,199
My family name is Xia.

523
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,199
I'm a student from the Dept of
Economics&Management of Jing Hua University.

524
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,319
My score
in the College Entrance Exam is 712.

525
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,160
Wow.

526
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,599
You paid for math tutoring.

527
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,599
So we'll only learn math in class.

528
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,439
But if you have any questions

529
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,640
in the other five courses,

530
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
welcome to come to me for help.

531
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,599
I prepare three tests for you.

532
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,119
Now I'll give out the test papers.

533
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,160
Now, please pass the papers

534
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,599
to classmates behind you.

535
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,479
As far as learning is concerned,

536
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:59,359
there is no short cuts.

537
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,079
The most practical way

538
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,359
is doing tests.

539
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,439
As long as you have done enough exercises,

540
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,800
during the exams,

541
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,319
you can get the key points of a question

542
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,800
by only a single glance at it.

543
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,479
Miss Xia.

544
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,439
You got such a high score.

545
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:15,520
But now you're here being a teacher.

546
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,719
Can you explain this?

547
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,760
In the world,

548
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,199
not all the problems
can be solved by high scores.

549
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,640
But in my class,

550
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
improvement of scores is the main goal.

551
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,119
After all,

552
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,439
with high scores,
some problems can be solved.

553
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,719
If there is no other question,
let's move on.

554
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,599
Look at the first question.

555
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,560
It's about probability.

556
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,719
According to the distribution table
of the growth rate of output value,

557
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,160
among the 100 enterprises investigated...

558
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm back.

559
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,000
You're back, sweetie.

560
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Yes.

561
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,719
Are there some difficulties
in the university's project?

562
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,640
Why do you ask so?

563
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,920
You arrive home

564
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,280
three hours later than last Friday.

565
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,839
Oh, yes.

566
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,119
Some difficulties.

567
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,280
You've worked a lot.

568
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:43,800
Let's eat.

569
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
-Come.
-Okay.

570
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,959
Come, eat.

571
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,959
What's wrong?

572
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,760
No appetite?

573
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,719
Are you having a fever?

574
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,319
What's up?

575
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,959
It's cold these days.

576
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,599
Maybe, a little uncomfortable.

577
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,520
You should sleep earlier today.

578
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,680
Eat this. I'll buy some medicine for you.

579
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,040
Okay?

580
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,760
Uh, I'll go back to the university later.

581
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,959
It's so late now.
Why do you have to go back?

582
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,239
Just as I said,

583
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,719
there are some difficulties in the project.

584
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,680
I have to go back to solve the problems.

585
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,400
But it's already ten o'clock.

586
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,359
What's more, it's Friday.

587
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,280
Didn't you just come back from there?

588
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,280
I worked outside for the project today.

589
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,640
And I have a powerpoint to finish.

590
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
I can discuss it with Qiu Yan in the dorm.

591
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,599
If so, alright.

592
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,640
I'll send you back later.

593
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,839
Maybe I can go back tomorrow morning.

594
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,800
You sleep on the couch tonight.

595
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,359
What's more, when I work,

596
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,959
you

597
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,160
can't stay by my side.

598
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,479
If you are beside me,

599
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:16,959
I'll be distracted.

600
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,959
Are you

601
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,760
playing the woman to me?

602
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,680
Can't I?

603
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,880
Yes, you can.

604
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,199
I like it.

605
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,359
All right.

606
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,079
You've cooked so much delicious food.

607
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,160
Let's eat.

608
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,359
-Let me serve rice to you.
-Um.

11:30.

00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,959
You should go to bed. Now.

615
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,040
No.

616
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,119
I'll have another project tomorrow.

617
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,199
I must finish this one today.

618
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,560
But it's already 11:30.

619
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Tomorrow upon tomorrow,
so many tomorrows have gone!

620
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,920
If we only rely on tomorrow,
nothing in the world can be done!

621
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,239
You have two days
to rely on at the weekend.

622
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:51,920
-Come, go to sleep.
-No.

623
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,680
-No.
-Stand up and go to bed.

624
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,280
-Go to bed.
-I can't.

625
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,880
I'm always a top student.

626
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,239
Being excellent is my tag.

627
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,800
Although I'm in college now,

628
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,760
I must finish my homework before I sleep.

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,640
Yes?

631
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,119
Are you hiding something from me?

632
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,359
You think I'm holding out on you

633
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,359
because I don't show you my homework?

634

What you said just now

635
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,839
is usually said only by Chen Yi Chuan.

636
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,959
No.

637
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,280
I don't have anything hidden from you.

638
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,560
I'm just doing my homework.

639
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,359
Alright.

640
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,680
Continue your homework.

641
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,560
I'll be here with you.

642
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,119
I won't go to bed until you finish it.

643
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:51,839
No, you can't stay here
stopping me being excellent.

644
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,040
Go to bed as soon as you finish it.
Got it?

645
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,160
No problem.

646

-I'll go to bed.
-Okay.

647

Go, go.

-Yes, it's 11:30.

649
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,280
Sit down.

650

-I'll sleep.
-Okay.

651
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,199
Are you sure you're okay?

652
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,920
Hush. Don't make noise.

-Bye-bye.

655
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,479
Hi, Miss Xia. A parent wants to see you.

656
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,719
She is waiting for you in the lounge.

657
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,119
Why does she want to see me?

658
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,359
I don't know.

659
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,880
But she seems in a fury.

660
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,040
Be careful.

661
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,920
Yes, I will. Thank you.

662
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,560
It's okay.

663

When Miss Xia comes,

664
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,119
we can ask her about the situation.

665
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,239
Do you agree?

666
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,359
-What happened?
-Lin Xi, here you are.

667

She's mom of Xu Fan.

00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,199
You're Miss Xia?

Hello, I'm Xia Lin Xi.

why there isn't anything useful for study

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,800
stored in my son's phone,

674
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,839
but only your photos?

675
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,479
What's more, he took the photos in class.

676
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,880
Young lady.

677
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,319
You'd better explain it clearly to me.

678
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:02,359
You're here to teach

679
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,239
or seduce students?

680
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,239
I think it's better to ask him

681
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,760
than make me explain it.

682
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,920
Why did he take photos of me?

683
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,640
It's his own phone.

684
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,359
I can't possibly
make him take those photos.

685
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,239
Sure, you didn't.

686
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:18,040
But how could I know

687
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,199
whether it wasn't you
who seduced him to do that?

688
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Mrs. Xu.

689
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,839
Calm down, please.

690
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,920
I think there must be
some misunderstanding.

691
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,400
Several photos can't prove anything.

692
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,479
Maybe he just did it for fun.

693
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,760
It can't be so serious.

694
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,280
Though Miss Xia is young,

695
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,640
she's very experienced.

696
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,199
She's also the top scorer of
the College Entrance Exam in Jiangming.

697
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:37,359
So what?

698
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,640
I just call it for what it is.

699
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,239
A high score doesn't mean

700
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:43,479
there isn't any problem with her personality.

701
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,599
I'm talking to you.

702
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,119
Where are you looking at?

703
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,400
You don't

704
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,959
respect others at all.

705
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,520
The top scorer of the city?

706
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,920
Look, students call you teacher.

707
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,719
So you regard yourself as a real teacher?

708
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,160
You don't deserve it.

709
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,560
You put on airs with me.

710
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,880
And you show me a long face.

711
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,199
Whom do you want to threaten?

712
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Listen,

713
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
my son took so many tutorial classes.

714
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,360
I've never met a teacher like you.

715
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,239
Mrs. Xu, please calm down.

716
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,959
If there's any problem, we can solve it.

717
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,399
Don't get angry at her.

718
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,959
We can talk it out, right?

719
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:19,080
Scolding her can't help you
solve the problem.

720
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
Now, let's go outside.

721
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,159
You can talk to me,
and I'll find a solution.

722
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,000
Okay?

723
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,239
This way, please. Let me help you.

724
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,000
Mrs. Xu, what do you say

725
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,080
if we transfer Xu Fan to another class?

726
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,719
I'll make sure that
he studies in the best class.

727
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,679
The teacher will be a very famous one.

728
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,120
If so, can you not
file a complaint against her?

729
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,879
Xia Lin Xi.

730
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,000
You're greatly wronged.

731
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,600
So you will quit the job?

732
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,080
No, I need money.

733
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,159
Lack of money isn't shameful.

734
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,679
Miss Xia.

735
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,919
Are you alright?

736
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:32,959
I'm sorry to hear that.

737
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,479
It's nothing. I was just misunderstood.

738
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:36,840
Oh, I see.

739
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,120
I'm fine, really.

740
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,600
Don't think too much.

741
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,560
-It's okay.
-Miss Xia.

742
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,080
It's not easy to be a teacher nowadays.

743
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,040
How about

744
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,760
we invite you to a meal later?

745
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,639
Thank you, but I'll give a lesson soon.

746
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,479
I have no time for that.

747
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
-Take care, Miss Xia.
-Yes, I will.

748
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,639
Don't worry about me.

749
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,239
I'm really fine.

750
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,040
Okay. Bye-bye.

751
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,000
-Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

752
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,639
What's up?

753
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,320
That's how you take care of her?

754
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,919
I thought that
you came for something else.

755
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,360
I didn't expect that
it's for Lin Xi again.

756
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,719
Jiang Zheng Han.

757
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,879
You don't have the right

758
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:23,879
to make her lead a hard life

759
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,479
just because she's willing to be with you.

760
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,560
Qin Yue!

761
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,800
I thought that between us,

762
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,760
there was either a decent loser

763
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,639
or

764
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,199
an honest winner.

765
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,360
Because I think a real man

766
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,639
should at least keep the bottom line.

767
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,560
I don't know why I became the loser.

768
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,199
Xiao Xi became your girlfriend.

769
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:58,120
If she has chosen me,

770
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,360
I would try my best to treat her well.

771
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,600
I would give her all I have.

772
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:06,800
Now you have the love
that I've been dreaming of.

773
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,919
But you are not able to
take good care of her.

774
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,479
Jiang Zheng Han.

775
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:15,679
Where's your bottom line?

776
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:34,100

777
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,280
Hi, where are you?

778
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,159
Your phone was power-off this afternoon.

779
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,280
I... I...

780
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,399
I was having a meeting about the project.

781
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:13,719
So I turned off my phone.

782
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,840
I've just finished a data analysis.

783
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,360
Let's meet at home.

784
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,800
-Um, see you later.
-Okay.

787
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,719
Hello, miss.

788
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,280
There's a promotion in our shop.

789
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,159
You can get this at a lower price
for every purchase of 30 yuan.

790
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,320
Do you want to buy more?

791
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,520
No, thanks. Just these two.

792
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,959
Okay.

793
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,639
You've come back?

794
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,320
I went to the supermarket just now.

795
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,520
The person before me
bought a cup of coffee.

796
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,320
The cashier

797
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
was so careless that she spilled it.

798
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,080
And I was also splashed all over.

799
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,399
I'll change the clothes now.

800
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,800
What's wrong?

801
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,840
Is it because the company...

802
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,120
Just now when you entered,

803
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,399
I felt that you became much thinner.

804
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,919
If that's true,

805
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,919
I don't need to try hard
to lose weight then.
