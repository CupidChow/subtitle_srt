Right in front of you,

164
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,640
I'll get her.

165
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,320
Alright.

166
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,039
I'll wait and see.

167
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,400
-Off you go.
-Here are your keys.

168
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,239
See you at school.

169
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,960
-Safe trip.
-Um.

170
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,239
Hey, isn't this Talent Jiang?

171
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,719
143...

172
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,320
-Talent Jiang, you're moving back?
-Yeah.

173
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,159
Stop looking.

174
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,640
After I knew you were my roommate,

175
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,559
I even went back to the gate to confirm

176
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,960
whether it was Jing Hua University or not.

177
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,159
Put your books well.

178
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,919
There is an evaluation on dorms.

179
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
If we got a bad rank,

180
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,880
everyone's credit would be deducted.

181
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
And this suitcase.

182
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,679
Take it out once you've unpacked it.

183
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,599
Otherwise, it will occupy space.

184
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,799
Rubbish should be emptied once a day.

185
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,760
Don't cross the line with your slippers
and all your shoes.

186
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,119
My space is small after all.

187
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,200
Aren't you tired?

188
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,440
Would you like a cup of water?

189
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,119
And about toiletries.

190
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,080
If you put them in the washing room,

191
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
we will share them.

192
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,719
-Don't mess it up, or...
-Uptown funk you up.

193
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,159
Uptown funk you up.

194
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,919
Oh!

195
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,359
Uptown funk you up.

196
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:39,679
Uptown funk you up.

197
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,239
Duan Ning, don't smoke

198
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,159
in the dorm!

199
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,039
Hey, Chen Yi Chuan.

200
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,080
Have I lit it? Huh?

201
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,359
Huh, have I?

202
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,559
I'll keep an eye on you.

203
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,719
You're such a busybody!

204
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,320
Yo!

205
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,479
Isn't this Talent Jiang?

206
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:57,919
Hi.

207
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,440
You finally showed up.

208
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,039
Hello. Hello.

209
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,440
Hey.

210
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,960
From now on, we'll live in the same dorm.

211
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,400
We are brothers!

212
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,919
Let me introduce myself to you officially.

213
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,640
My name is Duan Ning.

214
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm a Beijing native.

215
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,919
-Do you know Prince Duan?
-Duan...

216
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,239
He's my ancestor.

217
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,400
All my peers in Beijing

218
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,679
would address me Prince Duan.

219
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,919
Prince Duan was from Dali,
Yunnan province.

220
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,760
Hey, can't you stop cutting in?
You talk so much.

221
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,719
Well, Talent Jiang,
I was just flattered by my friends.

222
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,080
You may just call me Duan.

223
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,520
Okay.

224
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,760
So...

225
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,599
Nice to meet you.

226
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:42,640
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

227
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,280
Have you seen around the whole campus?

228
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,640
I just looked around a bit.

229
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,840
Now, brother Zheng,
let me show you around.

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,440
Leniency to those who confess,
severity to those who resist.

231
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,640
You have the right to remain silent,
but every word you say

232
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,760
will be served as sworn evidence.

233
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,840
Suspect Xia Lin Xi.

234
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,200
Why did you abandon senior Qin Yue
but choose Jiang Zheng Han yesterday?

235
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,520
That's why you asked me here
so early in the morning?

236
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,880
Or what else?
How many secrets are you keeping from me?

237
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,599
Alas!

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,359
Gu Xiao Man, I haven't asked you yet.

239
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,200
Why on earth
did you give me fake news that

240
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,039
He Guang Yu was going to
fight with Jiang Zheng Han?

241
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,559
And five against one?

242
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,880
I really thought that
they were going to fight.

243
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh, is that so?

244
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:31,280
So when you knew that Jiang Zheng Han
was going to fight with He Guang Yu,

245
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,159
were you nervous?

246
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:35,719
I was scared to death! I was so nervous.

247
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,840
Were you worried that

248
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,799
Jiang Zheng Han
would be at a disadvantage?

249
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,159
Yeah.

250
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,919
After all, we're from the same place,

251
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,159
and the same school, right?

252
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,280
Yeah.

253
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,840
Therefore, that's all because we're kind.

254
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,400
In the spirit of humanity,

255
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,440
we can't leave him alone.

256
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,719
So you can't simply put it as

257
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,320
which one I have chosen.

258
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:04,559
Oh, no, Xia Lin Xi,
don't try to deceive me.

259
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,880
I didn't deceive you.

260
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,119
Well, if nothing between you two,

261
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,400
tell me something about you
and senior Qin Yue.

262
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,359
Gu Xiao Man.

263
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:18,080
You should be
a paparazzo for being like this.

264
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,840
From high school up to now,

265
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,679
senior Qin Yue and I
have always been neighbors.

266
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,520
Nothing more.

267
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,719
But childhood sweethearts have always
been a standard part of idol dramas.

268
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,239
You two are an ideal couple.

269
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,239
Not to mention that

270
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,400
you followed senior Qin Yue
to get enrolled in Jing Hua University.

271
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,799
What I just said on the stage
was all for you.

272
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,200
Xia Lin Xi.

273
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
I didn't break my promise.

274
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,840
I've fulfilled our agreement.
I'm here in Jing Hua University.

275
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,239
Hello, Xiao Xi. I'm asking you.

276
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,280
Have you heard it yesterday?

277
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,359
Something terrible happened at the party
of the Dept of Economics & Management.

278
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,719
Jiang Zheng Han is a freshman.

279
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,080
-But he fought against senior He Guang Yu.
-Jiang Zheng Han?

280
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,239
That was exciting.

281
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,840
Are they talking about
Jiang Zheng Han, Xiao Xi?

282
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,919
The point is, he is so handsome.

283
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,080
Handsome? Gosh!

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,640
Oh, Talent Jiang!

285
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,960
How could he get a girlfriend
when he just got here?

286
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,840
Could the girlfriend that
she mentioned be you?

287
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,799
No, let's go.

288
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,320
Hey, hold on. Let me listen to it.

289
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,039
Don't. Let's go.

290
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,599
Gosh, the Jiang Zheng Han
that I knew must be a fake one.

291
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,359
No idea.

292
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,359
-Lin Xi, out for morning exercise?
-Yeah.

293
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,679
Well, Lin Xi, I was wondering...

294
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,080
You and Jiang Zheng Han

295
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,960
are really just classmates
since high school?

296
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,440
Well, yes.

297
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,119
Hmm...

298
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:59,200
What was going on yesterday?

299
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,640
Yesterday...

300
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,919
He just couldn't stand that someone
bullied his classmates from high school.

301
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,199
I see. Could you give me
his phone number and WeChat ID?

302
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:14,680
Ah, um...

303
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,680
Ah, I got it.

304
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,020
<i>Information: Jiang Zheng Han
Add to contacts</i>

305
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,340
<i>Verification:
I'm Zhuangsheng Xiaomeng Mihudie</i>

306
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,079
I heard it from the boys' dorm that

307
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,479
he comes from a needy family,
but he is very diligent.

308
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:34,599
He's only a freshman, but he's had
part-time jobs since high school.

309
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,800
Is that true?

310
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,239
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

311
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,760
No wonder. He's been programming
for others since high school.

312
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,479
So now he's become a
computer talent in Jing Hua University.

313
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,400
<i>From Jiang Zheng Han: Verification Accepted</i>

314
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,079
Ah, he... He accepted my request.

315
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,079
Lin Xi, thank you.

316
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,880
My stomach is still aching,
what should I do?

317
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,420
<i>My stomach is still aching,
what should I do?</i>

318
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,599
Yet you still have time to accept
another girl's WeChat request?

319
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,479
Who has a stomachache?

320
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:21,040
No one special.

321
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,319
Just an irrelevant person.
It doesn't matter.

322
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,640
Oh.

323
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,680
I really have a stomachache.

324
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,460
<i>I really have a stomachache.</i>

325
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,439
Well, Lin Xi.

326
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,920
-Um?
-How about going to the library together?

327
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,319
Sorry, just go.
I'll have a general course later.

328
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,880
Oh... Fine.

329
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,920
Stomachache. Stomachache. Stomachache.

330
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,719
Why did you accept
her request on WeChat then?

331
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,640
Well?

332
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,560
How to use this thing?

333
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,160
Xiao Man. Xiao Man. Xiao Man.

334
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,000
-Xiao Man.
-What's up?

335
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,160
How to use the electric pot
that you gave me last time?

336
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
No more nonsense.

337
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,079
You've thought too much.
I just need a basin to wash socks.

338
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,400
I got to go. Bye.

339
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,160
There are lots of socks to wash.

340
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,760
Oh, power on.

341
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,520
I see.

342
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,280
Ah!

343
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,319
Ma'am.

344
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,920
Sorry.

345
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,920
Lin Xi.

346
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,439
What are you doing?

347
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:28,439
Alas, I was scared to death. I thought
it was a raid from our dorm supervisor.

348
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,400
Cooking porridge?

349
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,599
Enjoying it alone?!

350
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,319
No, I'm making medicinal herbs.

351
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,199
Medicinal herbs? Let me have a look.

352
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,040
Gee!

353
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,319
Lin Xi, it's overcooked.

354
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,319
Overcooked?!

355
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,920
So, is this still edible?

356
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,400
You tell me.

357
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:48,760
Alas!

358
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,040
So much time has been spent on this.
What should I do now?

359
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,079
Alas!

360
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,199
Lin Xi. Lin Xi!

361
00:20:59,439 --> 00:20:59,680
What?

362
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,280
This porridge

363
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,959
is all about your intention,
not the taste.

364
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,160
Take my word for it.

365
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:08,839
Okay?

366
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,040
I really want to see
whether that person can

367
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,199
drink up your overcooked porridge or not.

368
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,640
Didn't you say that
my intention matters the most?

369
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
Then don't give it away.

370
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:48,800
It's such a pity that
I missed a big show yesterday.

371
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:51,479
Hey.

372
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,400
If someone drank for me,

373
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,680
I would also care about him by all means.

374
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,199
That's normal politeness.

375
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,079
But if you always keep it a secret,

376
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,280
that's a problem.

377
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,719
Who told you that?

378
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:12,239
-Lots of people knew it.
-Lots of people?!

379
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,079
Really so many people?

380
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,839
I think he's pretty good.

381
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,199
Okay...

382
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,800
Alright, he's definitely not
feeling well today.

383
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,280
Go and give your porridge to him.

384
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,359
I'll hold the seat for you.

385
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,959
Then I'm leaving.

386
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,280
Quickly go!

387
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,239
What are you doing?

388
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,719
Turn around.

389
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,439
Oh, here comes Jiang Zheng Han.

390
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,719
Quickly give it to him. Go!

391
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,359
Wait for a while.

392
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:48,920
I...

393
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:49,439
I...

394
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,359
I'm not ready yet.

395
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,319
-Hey, there he is.
-Hey, let's go.

396
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,199
I'll do it later.

397
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,959
Oh, no. He got company.

398
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,560
Is your stomach still aching?

399
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,959
You were not there yesterday.
What happened?

400
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,599
-How much have you drunk?
-Not much.

401
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,680
Homework.

402
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,959
Here you go.

403
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,719
Help us with the questions
and the formula writing.

404
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:18,079
Old rules, two hundred yuan.

405
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,280
Professor Shi urges it.
Another fifty yuan.

406
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,079
Money, we don't have that much.

407
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,119
But there are consolations.

408
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,239
Hello, everybody.

409
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,959
Give him what you've prepared.

410
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,600
-Come, come.
-Hurry, hurry.

411
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,160
Jiang, you gotta get better soon.

412
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,400
-We're expecting your contest.
-That's right.

413
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,880
Gosh. Lin Xi.

414
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,560
You've got too many allies.

415
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,319
You're the light of our computer dept.
You can't fall ill.

416
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,680
Yeah. That's right, Jiang.

417
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,280
Take some medicine for your hangover.

418
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,359
What's going on?

419
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,400
Didn't you defeat that notorious stirrer
of our university by drinking yesterday?

420
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,560
It's said that all the clubs
have been troubled by He Guang Yu.

421
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,439
So they're all here for you.

422
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,640
Well...

423
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,680
They came to me early in the morning,
asking which class you're gonna have.

424
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,359
The point is, I'm not used to this.

425
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,239
-I'm leaving.
-No, no, no.

426
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:06,839
Well, thank you for your concern.

427
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:09,479
I'm not feeling well.
I'm going to the hospital.

428
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,920
These two guys will keep your gifts.

429
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,599
Thanks for your kindness. Thank you.

430
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,040
Well, this...

431
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,599
-Talent Jiang, don't go.
-Thank you, senior.

432
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,239
Thank you. Thank you.

433
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,160
-We keep your gifts for him first.
-Thank you.

434
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,359
Thank you.

435
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,479
Oh, no, he starts looking this way.

436
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,760
Put it here. Put it here.

437
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,000
Lin Xi.

438
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,800
-Lin Xi.
-Um?

439
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,000
You're here.

440
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,880
Yeah, I'm in class. What's up?

441
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,959
This is...

442
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,839
Thank you.

443
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,199
-Look, what is Zheng doing?
-Go. Go. Go.

444
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,400
Zheng.

445
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,000
-This porridge is overcooked.
-Overcooked? Let me see it.

446
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:16,959
Don't...

447
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Got it. Something from his girlfriend
cannot be touched.

448
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,079
It's not like what we bachelors gave.

449
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,760
He just cast it away.

450
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,640
But for the thing from her,

451
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,000
he takes it as a treasure.

452
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,800
Oh, love...

453
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,199
It makes him beyond recognition.

454
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,680
Go. Go. Go. Go away.

455
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,160
You're particular about wording with me?

456
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,439
Don't you see what is it?

457
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,560
The gift from his beloved girl

458
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,199
has a fresh scent of love.

459
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:44,160
But all the things from others

460
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,479
can't have that scent.

461
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,800
Do you think

462
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,160
he actually hasn't gotten that girl?

463
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,280
Huh? Hmm...

464
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,319
Indeed, he hasn't.

465
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,160
Yeah.

466
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,959
Isn't it?

467
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,959
We have to be his qualified seniors.

468
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:55,520
Right.

469
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,000
He does get his mouth full of
this loving porridge.

470
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,280
Yeah.

471
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,040
But we can't do nothing about it.

472
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,160
We have to prepare a big gift

473
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,920
for him.

474
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,599
Yeah.

475
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,400
What do you want to do?

476
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,280
You know me.

477
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,520
-Oh, no, no, no.
-No, no, I...

478
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,199
Zheng, you can count on us.

479
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,959
No, don't go too far.

480
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,479
Don't worry.

481
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,479
Leave it to us.

482
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:16,680
Huh?

483
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,920
-Listen, this is what we have to do.
-No, listen to me...

484
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,359
No, listen to me.

485
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,439
Oh, stop it.

486
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,800
Hey, Chen Yi Chuan, listen,
don't look down upon me.

487
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,000
When you fall in love,

488
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,239
there will be times for you
to beg me on your knees.

489
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,959
Beg you? I prefer to give you a punch.

490
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,000
A girl worthy of me hasn't been born yet.

491
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,439
Hey!

492
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,040
-Oh, listen to me. Do as I say .
-You listen to me.

493
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,479
Yo!

494
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,160
-Hello, senior.
-Hello, senior.

495
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,000
-Hey.
-Hello.

496
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:40,800
Look. Look.

497
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,119
Given by his girlfriend.

498
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,719
-Breakfast of love.
-Yep.

499
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,079
What is that smell? Let me see.

500
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:46,719
Jiang Zheng Han.

501
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:47,119
Alas!

502
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,280
You can eat it
even though it's overcooked?

503
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,400
None of your business.

504
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:54,359
You kid know nothing.
Mind your own business.

505
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,880
Like I wish to mess with your business.

506
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,040
Hey, hey.

507
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,680
Zheng, it's from a girl, right?

508
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,560
Tell you what, I got it right away.

509
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,439
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

510
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,239
Tell us.

511
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,359
What kind of goddess she is? Of what type?

512
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,680
How come she gave Zheng

513
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,479
such a loving breakfast?

514
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,880
No type.

515
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,719
No? Got it.

516
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,000
If that so, there is only one type.

517
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,839
That's "meant to be".

518
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,560
Oh, great, you're really something!

519
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,000
However, that girl

520
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,760
always looks like being angry at Zheng.

521
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,479
No, no, it's not a good sign.

522
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,119
That's right.

523
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:35,680
She has given this porridge.

524
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,839
It should be fine.

525
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,880
I have a good idea.
What's her best friend's name?

526
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,520
Gu Xiao Man.

527
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,359
Gu Xiao Man.

528
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,479
What are you talking about?

529
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,479
Don't meddle in the affairs of grown-ups.

530
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,280
Mind your own business.

531
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,740
<i>Student Canteen Building A</i>

532
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,920
Now watch this.

533
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,319
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

534
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,599
I'll sit here then.

535
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,160
Why are you looking at me?

536
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,560
Is your meal not enough to eat?

537
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,000
Girl.

538
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,640
Hmm.

539
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,079
Why do you look so familiar to me?

540
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,800
Have we met somewhere before?

541
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,560
Where do you come from?

542
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,359
Jiangming.

543
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,599
Jiangming!

544
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,719
A beautiful city over water, isn't it?

545
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,280
Oh, dear!

546
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,439
Many beauties come from there.

547
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,319
You know what, I've admired it for long.

548
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,839
Judging from your temperament,

549
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,760
I guess you're either from
the college of literature or art.

550
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,479
I'm from the Chinese Dept.

551
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,599
See? Just as what I expected!

552
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,400
You're in the scholar's style.

553
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:25,760
-Like a lotus rising out of clear water...
-Well, you...

554
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,439
Are you out of your mind?

555
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:29,839
Can you talk normally?
You got me startled.

556
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:31,640
Well then.

557
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,239
I was wondering if I had the honor

558
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:38,040
to invite you, beautiful Miss Gu...

559
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,160
-...to talk about...
-Hold on.

560
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,319
How did you know that
my family name is Gu?

561
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,000
Er...

562
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,800
Well, here is the thing.

563
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,640
In fact...

564
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,959
-It's...
-You're a stalker, aren't you?

565
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:50,800
Huh?

566
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,199
I warn you, don't try to follow me.

567
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,560
Or I'll report it to professors.

568
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,119
No, you... Let me explain it.

569
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,239
You... No... You...

570
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,439
What's going on?

571
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,800
Brother Zheng.

572
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,920
She didn't react like a normal girl.

573
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,560
But I tell you what,

574
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,160
I like this girl

575
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,040
who's not interested in me!

576
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,119
Only in this way can it arouse
my fighting spirit as a man.

577
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,719
Enough. Don't mess with that girl!

578
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,719
She's my classmate from high school.

579
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,640
You know what?

580
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:33,680
This girl named Gu Xiao Man

581
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,239
is quite cute when watched carefully.

582
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:36,560
She would be mine if I got her.

583
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
What are you talking about, Prince Duan?

584
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,439
Nothing.

585
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,920
I did hear you mention Gu Xiao Man.

586
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,719
Then why you asked?

587
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,520
Right.

588
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:48,880
Listen to me,

589
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
don't lay a finger on her.

590
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:53,000
She can be very emotional at times.

591
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,959
Chen Yi Chuan
really knows well about that.

592
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,479
Stop it.

593
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,479
Believe me. For the girl I can't handle,

594
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,880
he has no chance at all.

595
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,160
We'd better go back
and make another plan. Let's go.

596
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,479
Believe it or not, I can get her.

597
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,839
But I warn you,

598
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,319
if I make it,

599
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,719
you must stop trying to bother her.

600
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,160
Deal.

601
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,160
Why is he so nervous?

602
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:32,119
Is she really his old lover?

603
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,640
She is unlikely his lover.

604
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,719
But he's probably able to get her.

605
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,199
Ahem.

606
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,680
Haven't I told you...

607
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,839
Xiao Chuan, what a coincidence.

608
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,000
Do you know the Stokes Formula
and the Interrogate of Positive Term Series?

609
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,280
Huh?

610
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,920
Stay curious when you're in college.

611
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,359
Although you never had it,

612
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,920
you can't be like this all the time.

613
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,800
Here you are.

No way!

620
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,719

What a unique pattern girls like
in a relationship nowadays!

625
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,439
It doesn't need tricks to get her.

626
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:17,959
What does it need then?

627
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,439
A clever human brain.

628
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,439

Brother Zheng.

632
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,520
How should he have made it in that way?

633
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,000
Isn't it a joke? Is it?

634
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:48,839
Hi, I'm Xiao Xi's roommate.

635

My name is Chu Qiu Yan.

636
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:50,959
Oh.

637
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,880
I think I can help you out, Talent Jiang.

638
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,199
Why did you suddenly
call for a walk outdoors?

639
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:04,599
It's better to do some exercise
than stay in the dorm.

640
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,439
You're right.

641
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,800
You haven't joined any clubs,
have you?

642
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,040
No, I haven't.

643
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:10,879
No suitable ones?

644
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,000
Um.

645
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,919
Well, what about the Math Club?

646
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,080
Is there such a club? I didn't see it.

647
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,280
Let me show you.

648
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,439
Look.

Well, take your phone out
and scan the code.

652

But I haven't found out
what their club activities are for.

653

If I scan it directly, isn't it too...?

654
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,120

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,360
Wow, I've already been into it.

660
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,900
<i>From Chu Qiu Yan: Done</i>

661
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,380

<i>Name: Xia Lin Xi</i>

664
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,439
Please come in.

665
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:28,679
Hello.

666
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:33,800
Yo!

667
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,399
Are you

668
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,000
here to sign up for the Math Club?

669
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,080
Yes.

670
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,879
You need to pass a few tests
before you join us.

671
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,959
Are you ready?

672
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,320
Oh, Okay.

673
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,239
Now listen to the first question.

674
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,760
Can't the sum of the angles
of a triangle exceed 180 degrees?

675
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,479
It depends on what conditions.

676
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:01,840
The sum of the angles of a triangle
on a plane must not exceed 180 degrees.

677
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,320
But if it's on the sphere, it can exceed 180 degrees.

678
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,560
Good.

679
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,479
The second question.

680
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,479
How do you understand

681
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,520
the Sierpinski Triangle Principle?

682
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,159
Infinite overlaps of individual shapes
can create a complete plane.

683
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:25,439
It's a perfect eternity created in consciousness.

684
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,080
Very good.

685
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
The third question.

686
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,919
Do you have any faith

687
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
in math?

688
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,439
Does that have anything to do
with joining the club?

689
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,439
This is our culture.

690
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,280
Please answer my question directly.

691
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,399
Oh.

692
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
As a mathematician once said,

693
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,879
Mathematics is
the closest approach to God.

694
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,000
Personally,
I like this sentence very much.

695
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,080
Good. Very good.

696
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,040
Well, you are really talented.

697
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,159
But you still have to pass our final test.

698
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,479
To solve the problem on the spot.

699
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,159
What is the problem?

700
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,719
Look.

701
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:11,120
It's on the blackboard.

702
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,239
Our Math Club is
beyond the reach of the ordinary.

703
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,239
More than a hundred students came here today,
but none of them solved it.

704
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,879
And we just shut them all out.

705
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Now the one who dares to challenge it

706
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,959
is only you.

707
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,120
You'll battle with the following guy,

708
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:33,639
the No. 1 master of Jing Hua University,

709
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,520
Jiang Zheng Han, Talent Jiang!

710
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,000
Both of you. Ready. Go.

711
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,919
Well...

712
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:43,120
Both of your answers are correct.

713
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,080
But Xia Lin Xi did it faster.

714
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,879
So Xia Lin Xi,

715
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,120
congratulations on joining the Math Club!

716
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,560
Thank you.

717
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,639
What are you doing here?

718
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
Wasn't I the only one who passed it?

719
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,120
I don't have to pass the tests.

720
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,959
I'm the president.

721

<i>Math Club</i>

722
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,800
What?

723
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,760
I founded the Math Club.

724
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,520
You are my only member.

725
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,800
Congratulations, Xia Lin Xi.
Welcome to the Math Club.

726
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:41,800
You did do whatever it takes, didn't you?

727
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,239
Gu Xiao Man is right.

728
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,159
I also feel like that
I just met you for the first time.

729
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,159
Xia Lin Xi.

730
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,719
