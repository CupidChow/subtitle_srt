Shen Wen Yue.

21
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,720
I made a promise to
Jiang Zheng Han just now.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,879
He and I will be

23
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,199
buddies.

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,919
Wen Yue.

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,800
My dear friends from Jing Hua University.

26
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:36,800
During this time,

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,880
I've caused you so much trouble.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,039
I'm going abroad
as an exchange student next semester.

29
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,440
This meal is on me today.

30
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,919
As a farewell dinner that you hold for me.

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,240
Hey, don't. Next time it's on you.

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,119
Today it's a celebration party
for Brother Zheng.

33
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,559
We have to make him pay for it.

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,199
Shen Wen Yue, stop drinking.

35
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,679
Don't stop me.

36
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,080
Our relationship as buddies

37
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,199
is all in this cup.

38
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,559
Give it back.

39
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,800
Huai Wu.

40
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,639
You don't have to worry about
my capacity for liquor.

41
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:52,960
Give it back.

42
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,839
Give it back.

43
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,480
Never mind. Never mind.

44
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,799
It is too dull here.

45
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,679
Enjoy yourselves.

46
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,959
Just cherish

47
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,519
your relationship.

48
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
Excuse me.

49
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,040
Wen Yue.

50
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,119
Huai Wu.

51
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,920
Wen Yue.

52
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,679
Actually, I feel bad for her.

53
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,679
Did you hear her last remarks?

54
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,399
What an epigram is that.

55
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,839
Just cherish your relationship.

56
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,640
Wen Yue.

57
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,200
You are drunk. Let me take you home.

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,279
I'm fine.

59
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,839
Wen Yue.

60
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,559
-You're too drunk. You're not safe alone.
-Alas, let go.

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,839
-Wen Yue.
-I told you I'm fine!

62
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,600
Wen Yue!

63
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,279
I must take you home!

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,959
Jiang Zheng Han.

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,640
You should know that I like you?

66
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,000
Wen Yue.

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Shen.

68
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,799
I really

69
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,000
-don't want to ruin our friendship.
-All right, all right.

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,760
Don't try to laugh it off
in the tone of a playboy.

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,079
Listen, I'm the best girl in the world.

72
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,799
Have you really thought it through

73
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,359
not to choose me?

74
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,839
Wen Yue.

75
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,720
I've answered this question before.

76
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,079
You deserve to be treated well by a boy.

77
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,720
But that boy

78
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,279
is really not me.

79
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,720
Jiang Zheng Han.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,399
What do you like about Xia Lin Xi exactly?

81
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,320
Everything.

82
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,839
Xiao Man, are you cold?

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,760
I can go back by myself.

84
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,399
-I'll take you back.
-I'll take you back.

85
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,320
Chen Yi Chuan, you can go back first.

86
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,679
Xiao Man and I are going shopping.

87
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,000
Huh? Shopping?

88
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,519
It's so late. Where can we go shopping?

89
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,959
Did you hear that?
She doesn't wanna go shopping with you.

90
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,839
Let's go.

91
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,519
Let go of her.

92
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,119
Chuan, what do you mean?

93
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm dating the girl I like.

94
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,320
It's none of your business.

95
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:12,720
What date?

96
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,679
Is Gu Xiao Man your girlfriend?

97
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,519
Duan Ning, stop joking around.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm not joking.

99
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,799
Xiao Man.

100
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,920
It's a good day.

101
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,200
I'll confess my feelings to you today.

102
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,399
Gu Xiao Man.

103
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,000
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

104
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,480
Duan Ning, are you crazy?

105
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,839
Xiao Man.

106
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,160
I can see that

107
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,359
Chuan wants to chase you, too.

108
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,760
It seems that
you must choose one between us.

109
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,839
To make a long story short.

110
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,239
Choose one now.

111
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:57,399
I...

112
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Did I say I want to chase her?

113
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,959
You... No more nonsense.

114
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,519
Come with me.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Chen Yi Chuan.

116
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,399
Do you like Xiao Man or not?

117
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,959
We'll play fair if you like her.

118
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,479
Answer my question.

119
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,520
Come on!

120
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
How could I possibly like Gu Xiao Man?

121
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,919
We were high school classmates.

122
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,559
If I liked her, we'd be together earlier.

123
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,320
I just can't bear
seeing her with someone like you.

124
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,520
What, me? What's wrong with me?

125
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,479
Duan Ning.

126
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,320
What did you say just now?
I didn't hear you.

127
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,080
I...

128
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,200
I asked you

129
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,359
if you'd like to be my girlfriend.

130
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,520
All right, I agree.

131
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,520
Gu Xiao Man.

132
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,960
Are you out of your mind?

133
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,479
I've always been stupid.

134
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,280
Anyway, you and I were just
high school classmates.

135
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,719
Chen Yi Chuan, thank you for your concern.

136
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,280
But as for a relationship,

137
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,760
it's my business.

138
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
Good night.

139
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's go.

140
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,440
Okay.

141
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,239
Oh, right.

142
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,320
You made it harsh when rejecting her?

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,799
Cut the Gordian knot swiftly.

144
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,000
It's good for us all.

145
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,559
Stop thinking about it. Get some rest.

146
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,840
Are you going back to your dorm?

147
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,280
Or what?

148
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,280
Why don't you

149
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,640
stay here?

150
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,060

Chuan.

152
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,479
Can you lend this to me?

153
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,119

No.

154

Welcome back.

158
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,599
Brother Zheng is still not back?

159
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,719
Not yet. How about giving him a call?

160
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,719
Why bother to ask him?

161
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,760
It is right that he won't come back.

162
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,039
What?

163
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,880
I dare him.

00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,280
My aunt will tear him up.

You...

166
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,080
Where did you go tonight?

167
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,359
None of your business, okay?

168
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,960
It's something
between me and my girlfriend.

169
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,799
Why do I have to report it to you?

170
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,840
What's going on, brother Duan?

171
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,559
You have a girlfriend?

172
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:54,359
Oh,

173
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:54,919
right.

174
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,520
Look, the latest news.

175
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,719
Come on, tell me.

176
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,479
Your sister Man

177
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,679
now is my girlfriend.

178
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,400
You mean Gu Xiao Man?

179
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,960
Of course!

180
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,359
Duan Ning!

181
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,599
Chen Yi Chuan.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Are you insane?

183
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,119
You almost got me choked.

184
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,359
You're holding the coke I bought.

185
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,840
Fine. Fine.

186
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,760
You keep it. You keep it.

187
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:28,799
What a madman.

188
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,200
Hey.

189
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,359
Wu.

190
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,599
Your team has been targeted.

191
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,640
Quickly reinforce the defense.
It might help.

192
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,719
Reinforce what defense?

193
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,599
More fire!

194
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,799
He's been bullied.
He should fight back immediately!

195
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,520
Fine.

196
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:48,919
I'll go to sleep.

197
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,239
You guys play.

198
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,280
Why sleep?

199
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,400
You and I

200
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,000
play a game.

201
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,640
Fine.

202
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,239
Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.

203
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,520
Today, I...

204
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,440
will sleep at home.

205
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,000
Stop playing! Go to sleep!

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,760
Okay, sleep.

207
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,039
-Turn off the lights.
-Okay, lights off.

208
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,880
Aunt.

209
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,520
Didn't I say too much?

210
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,359
Not at all.

211
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,520
Thank you for picking me up today.

212
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,440
It's my pleasure.

213
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,280
What's the name of
the boy you just mentioned?

214
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,440
His name is Jiang Zheng Han.

215
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,159
He is from Jiangming, and he was also
a high school classmate of Xiao Xi.

216
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,440
Jiang Zheng Han?

217
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes.

218
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,400
Aunt, do you know him?

219
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,280
Mr. Jiang is here.

220
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,640
-Hello, Aunt.
-We just met downstairs.

221
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,960
-Mom...
-I forgot the file.

222
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,400
Is this the take-out you ordered?

223
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,520
-Aunt, this is...
-Mom...

224
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,239
I felt dizzy because of low blood sugar.

225
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,119
I have a conference call later.

226
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,679
Let's have dinner together tonight.

227
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,280
Okay.

228
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,359
Let me take your luggage upstairs first.

229
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,820
<i>Aunt</i>

230
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,960
Hello.

231
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,799
Xiao Chuan, are you in class now?

232
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,799
No, I'm in my dorm.

233
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,840
Okay, come out now
and go to Xiao Xi's house with me.

234
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,559
Okay.

235
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,960
Hello?

236
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,919
I'm talking to you.

237
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,559
Yi Chuan, what are you thinking?

238
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,159
Aunt, well...

239
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,400
You have arrived in Beining?

240
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,119
Yeah.

241
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,559
Hurry up. Get the key
to your sister's house for me.

242
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,000
All right, all right. I'm on my way.

243
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,140
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>

244
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,080
Where have you gone?

245
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,880
Why don't you answer my phone?

246
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
<i>Siren</i>

247
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,000
Xia Lin Xi, what are you doing?

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,559
Why don't you answer my phone, either?

249
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,520
-I'm here, Aunt.
-Oops!

250
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,439
The key?

251
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,479
Sorry, I forgot it.

252
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,959
Then why are you here
since you don't have the key?

253
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,560
Xia Lin Xi, your mom is here.

254
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,079
Keep your voice down.
We're in the hallway.

255
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,520
Xia Lin Xi!

256
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,439
Xia Lin Xi, open the door!

257
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,680
Xia Lin Xi!

258
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,239
Aunt, it's probably not this room.

259
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,359
We might have made a mistake.

260
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,400
Shut up. Open the door, Xia Lin Xi!

261
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,800
Mom, what brought you here?

262
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,719
Step aside!

263
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,319
Where is he hiding?

264
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,079
Whom are you referring to?

265
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,680
Jiang Zheng Han.

266
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,880
He's not here.

267
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,800
If I stayed,

268
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,520
you would be even less safe.

269
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,479
Be careful.

270
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,959
Safe trip.

271
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,599
-Off I go.
-Good night.

272
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,430
Good night.

273
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,319
Then why didn't you answer my call?

274
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
I was taking a shower, okay?

275
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,199
You two were taking a shower together?

276
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,640
What nonsense is that in your mind?

277
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,280
-Let go.
-What are you doing?

278
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,079
Chen Yi Chuan

279
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,199
has something in his ear.
I'm helping him get it out.

280
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,359
I wouldn't have come
if I'd know you two weren't together.

281
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,439
Jiang Zheng Han didn't leave
anything in your room, did he?

282
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,079
Oh, no!

283
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,119
Whose clothes is this?

284
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,560
Mine.

285
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,479
I asked Xia Lin Xi to help me wash it.

286
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,800
But she hasn't done it.

287
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,560
Oh, yeah, I forgot it.

288
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,599
Yep! What kind of a brain you have?

289
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,280
It doesn't stink, does it?

290
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,280
Lin Xi.

291
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
At your age,

292
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,479
you have to be clear about

293
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,400
what you should do and
what you shouldn't, you know?

294
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,959
I understand.

295
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:58,079
It's normal for me to worry about you.

296
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,520
I've been there.

297
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,520
I can't tell you anything else.

298
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,040
But listen, when it comes to boyfriend,

299
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,439
the most important thing is
to know him thoroughly.

300
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,439
His look doesn't matter.

301
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,719
But his character
and family background do.

302
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,760
Got it?

303
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,160
Aunt, you can rest assured.

304
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,479
Well, I'm keeping an eye on Xia Lin Xi.

305
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,920
If she dares to date someone,
I will let you know at once.

306
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:24,839
Really?

307
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,439
Look at your room.

308
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Take a good look at it.

309
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,439
Why did you buy all these stuffs?

310
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,959
It influences your study.

311
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,280
All right, stop standing here.

312
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,479
Go clean it up.

313
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,839
Qin Yue is coming for dinner tonight.

314
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:50,680
Huh?

315
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,959
What is he coming for?

316
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,520
I invited him.

317
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
Can't I do that?

318
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,079
Here comes the last dish.

319
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,199
Wow.

320
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,760
Aunt, thank you so much.

321
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,079
I haven't had any
home-cooked food for a long time.

322
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:03,800
Now you have.

323
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
Make yourself at home.

324
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,479
Hands off.

325
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,439
Come on, let's propose a toast to Qin Yue.

326
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,040
Welcome to have dinner with us.

327
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:13,520
Welcome, senior.

328
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,719
Come more often.

329
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:15,239
Okay.

330
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,920
Try the fish I cooked.

331
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,880
It's been a long time
since I cooked last time.

332
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,599
I'm wondering if it tastes good.

333
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,400
Senior, you are so lucky.

334
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,160
I've never had anything cooked by my aunt.

335
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,920
My uncle used to do it at home.

336
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,680
How important you are.

337
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,479
Qin Yue.

338
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,760
I heard that you're the main leader
of the project in Ryan company.

339
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,160
Look.

340
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,479
So young and promising.

341
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,599
Listen to me,

342
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,199
you should do internships more often
with Qin Yue during your spare time.

343
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,119
Then I can pave the way for you
more easily in the future.

344
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,599
Your dad and I

345
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,040
are getting old now.

346
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,479
We'll count on you in the future.

347
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:09,920
Aunt.

348
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,560
Actually, Xiao Xi is also
excellent back on campus.

349
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,920
Well, you're all studying
at Jing Hua University.

350
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,160
Lin Xi is a girl away from home.

351
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,040
I'm worried about her.

352
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,479
You must look after her for me.

353
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:21,880
Okay.

354
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,160
Don't let her
contact with some strange people.

355
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,959
Mom, you think too much.

356
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
Come, have a taste of this.

357
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,760
I remember...

358
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,640
Xiao Xi, you love eating fish, don't you?

359
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,479
Brother Qin Yue, you should eat more.

360
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:46,880
It's really rare for my mom to cook.

361
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,359
No friend of mine
has been treated like this before.

362
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,719
Come on.

363
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,560
Brother Qin Yue is very excellent.

364
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
He's a man of the time in our university.

365
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,839
Lots of girls are chasing him.

366
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,959
Am I right, senior?

367
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,719
Oh, right.

368
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,400
I have a roommate, senior Shi Ying.

369
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,439
She and brother Qin Yue
are from the Student Union.

370
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:11,839
And she likes Brother Qin Yue very much.

371
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,640
She is very excellent.

372
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,439
She and brother Qin Yue are
an official couple in our university.

373
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,520
Fine. Fine.

374
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,199
You two, don't bully Qin Yue.

375
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,520
I watched Qin Yue grow up.

376
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,280
Ordinary girls can't catch his eye.

377
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,479
Am I right, Qin Yue?

378
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,400
Have a piece of fish.

379
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,680
Don't worry.
There will be a good one for you.

380
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:48,640
Hey, what do you think of Lin Xi?

381
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,959
Xiao Xi is very nice.
And I like her very much.

382
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,839
But you've seen it at dinner today.

383
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,199
You have to work harder.

384
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,439
Aunt, I've been trying.

385
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,839
But Xiao Xi always treats me...

386
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,439
It's absolutely impossible
between her and Jiang Zheng Han.

387
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,520
I'm keeping an eye on them.

388
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,079
Go. Go give her a hand.

389
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,079
-Kid, go.
-Okay.

00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,160
Where have you been?
You didn't answer my call.

393
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,199
I got an urgent job,
busy modifying the program.

How could you type codes leisurely here?

397
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,880
Do you know what happened today?

398
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,599
Qin Yue had dinner
in Xia Lin Xi's rented house.

399
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,479
My aunt cooked in person.

400
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:34,839
Really?

401
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,119
Hey.

Well...

403
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,199
Jiang Zheng Han,
could you be a little nervous?

404
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,400
The situation today was very intense.

405
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
Judging from my aunt's attitude,

406
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,079
she was very satisfied with Qin Yue
to be her son-in-law.

407
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:50,800

Actually,

I think compared with Qin Yue,

465
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,959
you're just a little poorer,

we can inform each other.

00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,680
It's really hard to study

Natsume Soseki is a writer I like so much.

What are you looking at?

507
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:32,880
Hey.

508
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,880
Chuan.

509
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,119
Do you have notes
on the Discrete Mathematics?

510
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:36,839
No.

511
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,880
You have the book
for this course, don't you?

512
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,800
You only know to molest girls,
but forget bringing the book.

513
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,000
You're going to fail your exams.

514
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,560
I...

515
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,880
What are you looking at covertly?

516
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:57,160
To see if you're angry.

517
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,680
Don't take it to heart

518
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,520
about what my mom said yesterday.
She's always like that.

519
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,199
She's just sharp-tongued
with a kind heart.

520
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,439
-She never...
-It's okay.

521
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,479
She's my future mother-in-law after all.

522
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:11,880
All right.

523
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,199
You must be hungry.

524
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,000
Would you like to eat something?
I can take you there.

525
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,040
I can't.

526
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,599
She is still at my place.
I have to see her.

527
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,599
Do you think

528
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,880
I should invite your mom
to have dinner or something,

529
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,680
since she is here in Beining?

530
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,839
I don't think it's necessary.

531
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:33,959
She still remembers you pretended to be
a teacher when we were in high school.

532
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,359
Well, I'll go to apologize to her.

533
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,640
Forget it. Forget it.

534
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,880
Anyway, in your mom's eyes,

535
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,560
I'm just a strange and immoral person.

536
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,920
I'd better not appear
in front of her for now.

537
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,839
Don't take what my mom said to heart.

538
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,400
She didn't know you were there
when she was on the telephone yesterday.

539
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,719
Just because she didn't know that,

540
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,719
she was simply speaking her mind.

541
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,439
She just has a misunderstanding about you.

542
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,319
I think,

543
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,839
you don't have to be anxious.

544
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,599
We can work things out after she leaves.

545
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,119
Wait a minute.

546
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,839
Qin Yue.

547
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,760
Answer it.

548
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,079
Hello, brother Qin Que.

549
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
You've arrived here, haven't you?

550
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,199
Okay, I'm on my way.

551
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,239
My mom is leaving tonight.

552
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:28,199
Brother Qin Yue will
pick me up and then see her off.

553
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:32,199
And we'll probably
have dinner together tonight.

554
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:37,239
But don't worry. No matter how strong
the external force is,

555
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,800
I will never waver.

556
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,359
Off you go.

557
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,119
Be safe.

558
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
I'm leaving.

What's up? What are you searching?

I have a feeling that
I may fail the exam this time.

566
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,159
Alas, it's fine.

567
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,679
It's over. Don't search for it.

Do you think it's a waste of time

570
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,320
that you're in a relationship with me?

571
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,239
What makes you think that way?

572
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,560
I just feel I'm more interested
in math than economic management.

573
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,560
That's fine.

Isn't there an opportunity to

what you really like.

577
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,040
Um.

578

Your mom seems to like him very much.

592
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,919
That's because she doesn't know you yet.

593
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,600
She doesn't know how good you are.

594

It's better to stay in Beining.

So I can see you every day.

599
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,760
I can sneak out.

600
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,360
Sneak out again?

601
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,560

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,280
Come, come.

673
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,360
Come, come.

674
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,000
What a feast Xia made.

675
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,560
Oh, dear!

676
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Jing Jing, I really envy you so much.

677
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,719
That's all Xia has got.

678
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:42,199
Unlike Mr. Qin,
he is meant to do big things.

679
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,439
Lin Xi's dad

680
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:46,760
is a scholar. He's different.

681
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,560
Mr. Qin,
what have you been busy with recently?

682
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,879
Stop it!

683
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,959
From now on, let's stick to the old rules.

684
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,000
He was called Xiao Qin when he was young,

685
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,560
and just Qin since he's old now.

686
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,639
Okay. Qin.

687
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:03,560
Moreover,

688
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,679
maybe we'll become family in the future.

689
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,040
Don't call him Mr. Qin.

690
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:10,399
-Yes, yes.
-That's right.

691
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:13,560
Qin Yue and Xiao Xi grew up together.

692
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,840
We both know each other well.

693
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,159
It's rare to have such a kind of bonding.

694
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:20,239
Now,

695
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
they have grown up.

696
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,280
Something

697
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,120
that is supposed to
develop should be done soon.

698
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,719
Get a seat. Come on.

699
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,120
I'll help my dad get chopsticks.

700
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,679
-This kid is shy.
-How considerate she is.

701
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,919
What is my mom trying to do?

702
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,959
A blind date for you.

703
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,760
Is she crazy?

704
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,520
I just got back and she did that to me.

705
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,800
Has she asked for my opinions?

706
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,719
Can't she show me some respect?

707
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,700
I also want a daughter
to do manicure and beauty care with me.

708
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,320
Dad, are you also backing her up?

709
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,860
Next time, I'll tell Xiao Xi
to go there with you.

710
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:02,919
I support you mentally.

711
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,790
She's free during holiday.

712
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,280
But I can only support your mom in action.

713
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,770
Aunt, let me fill the cup for you.

714
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:08,919
How stupid you are.

715
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,479
A blind date doesn't
have to be successful.

716
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,439
Does it?

717
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,800
You just go out and cooperate.

718
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,639
Such good wine!

719
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,479
Can't you have your own stance?

720
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:20,159
On such an occasion...

721
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,639
This is my stance.

722
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,670
For a day like today, of course
we should have good wine.

723
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:28,120
By the way, Xia went to the market
to buy materials early this morning.

724
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,239
Try it later to see if it tastes good.

725
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,719
Okay, okay. Thank you so much.

726
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:35,879
Xia's dishes on this table
are really delicious.

727
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:36,840
That's right.

728
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:41,120
I heard a buzzword some time ago.

729
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,439
That's wedding-upon-graduation.

730
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:44,399
It refers to getting married immediately
the minute graduating from college.

731
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:46,919
Look, since these two kids
are on such good terms,

732
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,439
they can jump on the bandwagon.

733
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:55,000
But I'm wondering
if Qin Yue is worthy of Xiao Xi.

734
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,320
Well, Qin, you are too modest.

735
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:03,399
Qin Yue is handsome and smart.
He is the most outstanding one.

736
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,879
We've been telling
Xiao Xi to learn from Qin Yue

737
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:07,520
since she was a little girl.

738
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,000
Come on, let me give you a toast.

739
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,919
From now on,

740
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,199
let's interconnect more often.

741
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,360
-It's very kind of you.
-You're being modest.

742
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:19,120
Aunt, let me fill it up for you.

743
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,520
He is so sweet!

744
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,760
Today, it's all for you both.

745
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:28,800
Propose a toast.

746
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,120
Brother Qin Yue.

747
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,040
Xiao Xi.

748
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,040
We grew up together.

749
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:45,040
And we did many things
for the first time together.

750
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,239
First time to ride a bike.

751
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,879
And first time to go to school.

752
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,560
I hope there will a chance in the future

753
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,520
that we can do more things
for the first time together.

754
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:57,159
Two families together.

755
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,919
I believe that

756
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,239
we are the best match.

757
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,080
Let me toast to you.

758
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:21,439
Brother Qin Yue.

759
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,479
You're my elder brother
whom I grew up with.

760
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,360
As well as my first friend.

761
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,639
I will remember our friendship.

762
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,239
I also hope you can remember it as well.

763
00:43:42,263 --> 00:43:52,263
