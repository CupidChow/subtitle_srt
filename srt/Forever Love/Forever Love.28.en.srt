We should ensure not only
the progress but also the quality.

-OK.

All right, everyone.

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,600
Welcome to my experience sharing session.

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,440
Since everyone is here, I'll just

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,750
tell you all the important points.

38
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,600
Let's talk about

39
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,720
my high school experience.

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
Actually, I was

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
exceptionally admitted by
Jing Hua University.

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,240
When I was in high school,

43
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,440
I was the last place in our class.

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,720
My average score was only 65.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,190
Please raise your hand
if you had a higher score than me.

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,110
So I thought that

47
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,360
you should have a better future than me.

48
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,000
I think perhaps six years later,

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,670
there would be 100 more Jiang Zheng Han,

50
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,080
fifty Bill Gates,

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,750
and 30 Ren Zhengfei
in Jing Hua University.

52
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,830
I'm serious. Don't laugh.

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,110
Don't be afraid to dream.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,960
But,

55
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,600
don't just dream.

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,440
Be a doer,

57
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,110
not a talker.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,320
Seek the truth,

59
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,440
and be diligent in action.

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,800
Well,

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,550
if you have any questions,
just feel free to ask me.

I'm also from Jing Hua,

and a member of the computer varsity
to join ACP this year.

64
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,030
You are so young,
and you've brought HX

65
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,520
to one of the leading enterprises.

66
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,960
Can you give us some suggestions?

67
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,270
My advice is not to start a business.

68
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,000
It's so hard to start a business.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,510
Therefore,

70
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,390
welcome to work in HX.

you, such an excellent person, like?

76
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,830
Just let the girls know
how they could improve.

77
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,390
I don't have a favorite type.

78
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,950
I have only one person I like.

79
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,760
When she comes back from abroad,

80
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,720
we'll get married immediately.

93
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,160
beat up XV,

94

I've been his loyal fan.

I heard he was a study slacker before.

It's so inspiring to fight all the way
to where he is today.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,320
I was inspired by him to study hard
and become better.

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,600
I didn't expect to receive an interview
from HX right after graduation.

99

I'm looking forward to

He even greets the interns in person.

102
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,160
Even if I'm not hired today,
I feel satisfied for just meeting him.

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,950
Yeah.

167
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,470
Don't talk nonsense.

168
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,350
Wen Yue has always been my type.

169
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,000
We

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,320
fell in love at first sight.

171
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,110
You two fell in love at first sight?

172
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,880
Only you fell in love
at first sight I think.

173
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,790
Can't you just save me some face?
That's nonsense.

174
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
All right, all right.

175
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,910
Let me be honest.

176
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,550
Actually, when I was in college,

177
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,030
I fell for Wen Yue at first sight.

178
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,790
During her exchange,

179
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,840
I greeted her every day and night,

180
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,640
called her every day and night.

181
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,910
I had a

182
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,880
sincere attitude.

183
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,230
Finally, my Wen Yue came to me.

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,080
When did I agree to be with you?

185
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,670
-Don't make a fool of yourself.
-I'm blind.

186
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,910
She's gone.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,840
Wait.

188
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,590
Didn't you agree to
be with me that day?

189
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,520
Wen Yue!

190
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,550
-Huai Wu is so cute.
-What do you mean?

191
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,640
Let's go.

192
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,040
<i>Food Map</i>

193
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,520
<i>Doraemon will never leave Nobita.</i>

194
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,280
This is your office?

195
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,590
It's your office.

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
Mine?

197
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,280
I finally waited for
the real you to come here.

198
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,470
If you are willing to marry me,

199
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,030
I can live up to my promise today.

200
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,880
Me and my money

201
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,590
are all yours.

202
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,710
Honey, I'm here.

203
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,590
What's up?

204
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,400
The novel didn't go well?

205
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,710
Never mind.

206
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,350
I'm sure you can write better.

207
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,790
It's not about the novel.

208
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,760
Then what is this about?

209
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,350
I asked you to come here

210
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,320
because I have
something important to tell you.

211
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,000
What is it?

212
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,710
It's something important

213
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
about you.

214
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,590
It's about me?

215
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,320
Did I make any mistakes again?

216
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,840
Yes.

217
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,670
You made a mistake this time.

218
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,670
A fatal mistake.

219
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,640
What did I do wrong?

220
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,200
Think about it.

221
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,030
Alright. It's all my fault.

222
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,320
But I don't know what I did wrong.

223
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,960
No matter what I did...

224
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,790
No matter what mistake I made,

225
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,840
you must not say that to me.

226
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,000
We've gone this far,

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,230
and I don't want to say that either.

228
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,550
But what you did is...

229
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,670
I apologized to you so sincerely.

230
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,840
Please don't say that.

231
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,960
Chen Yi Chuan, are you a man?

232
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,550
As a man,

233
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,640
you should pay for your mistakes, right?

234
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,200
You have a stomachache?

235
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,030
I shouldn't have bought you
too many delicious food yesterday.

236
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,590
I'll never buy that yogurt again.

237
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,640
Idiot!

238
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,790
You're going to be a dad.

239
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,960
I'm going to be a dad?

240
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
There are people around here.

241
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,550
I'm going to be a dad.
Oh, my God.

242
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,550
Easy, easy.

243
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,470
I'm going to be a dad.

244
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,280
There is my kid in it.

245
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,000
I must tell Xia Lin Xi the good news.

246
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,960
She must be pissed off.

247
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,840
She's back today.
I'm going to give her a big surprise.

248
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,790
Xiao Xi is back today?

249
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,440
Yeah, she's back today.

250
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,400
Xiao Xi!

251
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,150
Xiao Man!

252
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,110
All right, all right.

253
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,590
Xia Lin Xi, be careful.

254
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,520
I miss you so much.

255
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,320
Xiao Man.

256
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,760
-Why did you come back so late?
-Be careful, Xiao Man.

257
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,710
What's up?

258
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,080
Gu Xiao Man married you
and she became delicate?

259
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,230
I can't even touch her now?

260
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,000
What do you know?

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,840
Xia Man is really delicate now.

262
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,150
What do you mean by that?

263
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,960
Xiao Xi.

264
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,440
Are you ready to be an aunt?

265
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,470
Chen Yi Chuan, you...

266
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,200
When did it happen?

267
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,670
Oh, my God.

268
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,440
I can't believe the news.

269
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,030
We can't talk to you guys anymore.

270
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,840
Chen Yi Chuan, good for you.

271
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,030
Xiao Man, let's go home.

272
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,520
We have to prepare your recipe

273
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,110
and the supplies for the baby.

274
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,960
We have a very important plan to make.

275
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,030
Okay.

276
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,080
I just saw Xiao Xi.

277
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,110
You look thinner.

278
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,790
Jiang Zheng Han,

279
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,320
my brother-in-law to be.

280
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,790
What can I do for you?

281
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,150
Can you step up on it?

282
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,710
I'm so much ahead of you.

283
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Don't you have to put
some pressure on me?

284
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,590
I don't even feel the pleasure of
competing with you.

285
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,960
Would you please go first?

286
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,230
I'll deduct your salary
if you keep saying that.

287
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,710
I'm a shareholder, okay?

288
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,520
All right.

289
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,430
Xiao Chuan and I will not keep you here.

290
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,040
You'd better go home for dinner first.

291
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,470
Well, I'll see you next time.

292
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,110
OK.

293
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,040
Xiao Xi.

294
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,950
See you next time.

295
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,520
-It's so nice that you're back.
-Come on, stop that.

296
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,470
OK.

297
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,110
Alright.

298
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,920
-We'll leave now.
-Alright.

299
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,800
Come on, Jiang Zheng Han.

300
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,680
Okay, I'll try harder.

301
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,760
Come on.

302
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,350
Be careful.

303
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,110
Bye-bye.

304
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,040
See you. Bye.

305
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,040
That's so fast.

306
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,110
But Chen Yi Chuan...

307
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,070
Have I been away for too long

308
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,520
that he has forgotten the fear of
being dominated by me?

309
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,110
However,

310
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,760
I think my brother-in-law is right.

311
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,470
What do you mean by that?

312
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,070
I can't let him get too far ahead.

313
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,070
I have arranged all the work
in the afternoon.

314
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,760
Let's go back to Jiangming
in the afternoon.

315
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,640
Fix the date of our wedding.

316
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,950
What?

317
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,000
So fast?

318
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,800
I don't want to wait any longer.

319
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,430
Let's go.

320
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,190
My dear wife.

321
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,760
What's wrong?

322
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm nervous.

323
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,920
What are you nervous about?

324
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,110
You're going to ask for my mom's approval.

325
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,280
Are you sure?

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,110
Aren't you nervous at all?

327
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,230
I am nervous.

328
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,520
I'm so nervous that I need a ventilator.

329
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,160
Then...

330
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,560
When we arrive at my home later,

331
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,520
if my mom's still picking on you,

332
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
you must follow her.

333
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,350
Based on my years of experience
in negotiating with her,

334
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,190
she could be persuaded by reason
but not cowed by force.

335
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,520
However,

336
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,400
if my mom still doesn't agree,

337
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,800
my dad should be able to sneak
the household register for us.

338
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,110
Since you said that,

339
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,350
I'm relieved.

340
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,590
But I still hope that

341
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,640
our marriage can be blessed
by your mother.

342
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,950
Take it easy.

343
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,230
Hi, Siri.

344
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,950
What should I do
to meet my parents-in-law?

345
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,560
I found these on the Internet.

346
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
You are so childish.

347
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,560
Alright, we're done.

348
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,590
Dad!

349
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,190
Coming.

350
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,310
-Dad, I'm back.
-Daddy misses you so much.

351
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,950
Hello, uncle.

352
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,590
Stop standing at the door, come in.

353
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,000
OK.

354
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,680
Is this the game machine

355
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,040
that I told you to buy?

356
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,160
The latest version.

357
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,030
-Come on in.
-Okay.

358
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,040
Dad.

359
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,230
Dad.

360
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,760
Uncle and aunt,

361
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,400
I'm here to ask you

362
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,190
to marry Lin Xi to me.

363
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,760
Lin Xi is well educated by you.

364
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,070
She is confident,

365
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,230
strong-minded,

366
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,280
and she never lets others worry.

367
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,830
But that's exactly why

368
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,400
I care about her.

369
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,520
I can assure you both that

370
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,950
besides you, I am

371
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,830
the one who knows Lin Xi the best.

372
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
I love her.

373
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,710
I'm willing to
take on everything with her,

374
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,400
and grow together.

375
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,950
I think that

376
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,280
two is better off than one.

377
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,920
Therefore,

378
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,040
I hope for the days to come,

379
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
you can both

380
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,000
believe me

381
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
and trust me with Lin Xi.

382
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,520
I'll use all the time I have

383
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,950
to accompany her.

384
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,830
Have you bought a house?

385
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,920
Don't be so direct.

386
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,110
I mean, did you redeem your contract?

387
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,640
Yes, aunt.

388
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,680
I have an apartment in the city center,
with three rooms.

389
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,070
My car was parked downstairs.

390
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
My company also had

391
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,040
gone through the early stage.

392
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,350
It's developing steadily now.

393
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,950
Jiang,

394
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,920
you have to promise me one thing.

395
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,590
Of course, auntie.

396
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,110
Love

397
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,920
and marriage are different.

398
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,560
You think she's all good now.

399
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,430
If there comes a day

400
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,760
when you don't think
she's as good as you thought...

401
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,430
Let me just say it,

402
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,400
if one day our girl
comes back to me crying,

403
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,560
I'll hold you accountable.
And I won't tolerate.

404
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,190
You won't have the chance to
come to my house anymore.

405
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,880
I can teach my daughter,
but others cannot.

406
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,640
Do you agree?

407
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,110
Mom.

408
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,190
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,560
It was all my fault.

410
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,520
Aunt,

411
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,110
I'll remember what you just said.

412
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,800
<i>Household Register</i>

413
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,070
Go register in the Civil Affairs Bureau.

414
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,080
<i>Marriage Certificate</i>

415
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,530
<i>Xia Lin Xi</i>

416
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,360
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>

417
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,430
Why do I feel like things

418
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,590
are going too well?

419
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,640
Perhaps

420
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,190
god saw us going through
so many setbacks,

421
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,640
so he decided to
give us some compensation.

422
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,070
Then god must have

423
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,710
given me

424
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,400
a gift for being a good kid all along.

425
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,520
My parents

426
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,070
also want to give this good kid a gift.

427
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,710
What?

428
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,350
You've seen this

429
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,520
last time at my house.

430
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,950
I can marry you

431
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,800
and wear this for you.

432
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,950
I did what I promised my parents.

433

Xiao Xi!

435
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,430
Do I look good?

436
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,950
Of course.

437
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,400
You look much prettier

438
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,800
than what I dreamt of.

439
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,400
You two are so lovey-dovey.

440
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,310
I can't stand it.

441
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,710
I don't think she looks as good as
you in a wedding dress.

442
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,000
What are you talking about?

443
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,880
Xiao Xi is the prettiest bride today.

444
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,830
I just don't think
she looks better than you.

445
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,560
Alright, I'm not going to
ever compete with Xiao Xi.

446
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,640
All right, come on.

447
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,470
Give me a comment.

448
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,350
Handsome.

449
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,160
Really?

450
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,560
Am I really handsome?

451
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,230
You're messing up my makeup.

452
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,880
This wedding dress is really beautiful.

453
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,310
Is it?

454
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,160
Xiao Xi.

455
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,070
Going by my experience,

456
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,920
this wedding dress is very expensive.

457
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,110
Mr. Jiang does have a good taste.

458
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,310
He's an expert.

459
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,830
This shop is very popular
in the industry in the past two years.

460
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
It's been on a lot of magazines.

461
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,040
Many couples can't make an appointment.

462
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,880
Good for you, Mr. Jiang,
you've found a way.

463
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,230
I really didn't make the appointment.

464
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,040
But it doesn't matter.

465
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,350
Then we'll have

466
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,920
this wedding dress.

467
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,230
Xiao Xi, you are really beautiful.

468
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,760
Yeah, you really look good.

469
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,160
Congratulations, Ms. Xia Lin Xi.

470
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,000
Happy wedding.

471
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,640
-Qiu Yan!
-Qiu Yan!

472
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,520
Long time no see.

473
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,520
Why are you here?

474
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,040
-Oh, my god.
-Take a guess.

475
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,400
I haven't seen you for so many years.

476
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,560
But we actually met here!

477
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,350
I'm here every day.

478
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,110
-Every day?
-You're here every day?

479
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,160
I'm the owner's wife.

480
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,520
Who is the owner then?

481
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,470
This company is owned by Xu Zhi Li.

482
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,680
Very good.

483
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,800
After resignation,

484
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I've been working in my dad's company.

485
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,400
Last year, Xu Zhi Li and I got married.

486
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,680
-Congratulations.
-Oh my, you're married, too.

487
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,590
Congratulations.

488
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,830
Back then,

489
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,280
Xu Zhi Li has done so many bad things.

490
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,800
I thought I would never forgive him.

491
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,640
But I didn't expect that

492
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,000
he pulled himself out of the company,

493
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,880
and got into the wedding industry.

494
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I saw that he really changed for me.

495
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,800
So I agreed.

496
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,520
That's so good.

497
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,710
Then you've really made a contribution
to the society.

498
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,230
-What do you mean?
-What do you mean?

499
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,430
Saved a young man who had gone wrong.

500
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,350
You're still so talkative.

501
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,430
It's just a cold joke.

502
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,400
You look so beautiful.

503
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,520
How is Mr. Xu recently?

504
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,280
Just as annoying as usual.

505
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,400
-As expected.
-He's the same.

506
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,470
But much better than before.

507
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,040
I know you're getting married,

508
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,880
so I let him take charge of your wedding.

509
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,760
Think of it as

510
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,760
making amends for before.

511
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,640
That's between he and "Mr. Jiang".

512
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,230
I'll treat it as a gift from you.

513
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:43,880
Don't worry.

514
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,280
It's all over.

515
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,760
Awesome.

516
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,350
Really?

517
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,880
-Four months.
-Oh, my God.

518
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,190
-Is it a boy or a girl?
-Time flies.

519
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,880
Are you stupid?

520
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,760
But, you are pregnant
and you are married.

521
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,400
Who's going to be my bridesmaid?

522
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,230
Who is the groomsman?

523
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,470
Qin Yue.

524
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,760
Then I think there is someone
who is very suitable.

525
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,680
Do you want to ask her?

526
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,110
Senior Shi Ying,

527
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,110
I didn't expect that you've really
become a jewelry designer.

528
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Thanks to Qiu Yan's recommendation.

529
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,230
Although I learned from scratch,

530
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,070
but I like it very much.

531
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,280
Then my wedding jewelry

532
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,760
will all depend on you.

533
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,520
No problem.

534
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,430
Thank you.

535
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,190
Congratulations, Lin Xi.

536
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,190
You and Jiang Zheng Han
finally get married.

537
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,110
It's wonderful.

538
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Actually,

539
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,830
I owe you an apology.

540
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,520
Because of Qin Yue,

541
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,230
I haven't been very nice to you.

542
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,190
So I gave you a lot of troubles.

543
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,680
I couldn't get rid of that feeling
for a long time.

544
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,920
That feeling

545
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,880
was like a fish bone stuck in the throat.

546
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,230
I can't swallow it or spit it out.

547
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,280
It's really uncomfortable.

548
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,520
I've forgotten all of that.

549
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,430
I only remember that
you're a famous jewelry designer.

550
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,560
Therefore,

551
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,640
I want you to accept
my wedding invitation.

552
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,680
Lin Xi,

553
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,430
although it's not right to say this now,

554
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,880
I still want to tell you that

555
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,880
I finally know

556
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
why Qin Yue liked you so much.

557
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,680
You are forthright and tolerant.

558
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,470
You're really likable.

559
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,880
If I hadn't been so persistent
and lost myself,

560
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,000
perhaps I wouldn't have
made myself regret for so long.

561
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,160
Senior,

562
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,800
I wanna ask you for a favor.

563
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Besides helping me design jewelry,

564
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,710
would you like to be my bridesmaid?

565
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Come on, come on!

566
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,830
This way, this way!

567
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,640
Being grateful to parents is
the most important kindness.

568
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,520
Serve tea for the parents.

569
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,640
Mom.

570
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,800
-Dad.
-Say louder.

571
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,070
Dad.

572
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,830
Please have some tea.

573
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,920
Wait, wait!

574
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,000
That's not loud enough.

575
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,710
How could uncle accept it?

576
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,950
Dad.

577
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,760
Please have some tea.

578
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,190
I didn't hear you.

579
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
He didn't hear you!

580
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,560
Dad, please have some tea!

581
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,830
Jiang,

582
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,920
I always like you.

583
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,760
I trust you with my daughter.

584
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,000
Wish you happiness.

585
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:08,800
Dad,

586
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,950
please rest assured.

587
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,230
I'm going to make Lin Xi

588
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,950
the happiest woman in the world.

589
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,310
-Mom.
-Mom.

590
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Please have some tea.

591
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,590
Mom.

592
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,400
Jiang.

593
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,230
Yes.

594
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,040
I admit that I am a stubborn mother.

595
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,190
Before Lin Xi turned eighteen,

596
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,350
I've been trying my best
to take care of her.

597
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,000
I let her only focus on study
when she was a student.

598
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,110
Until she met you,

599
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,840
my good daughter contradicted me
for the first time

600
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,470
and fought with me.

601
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,390
From then on,

602
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,230
I knew our Lin Xi has grown up.

603
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,040
She's going to make her own decisions.

604
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,840
Jiang,

605
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,120
you are

606
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,840
the biggest surprise
in my daughter's life.

607
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,280
Don't say too much in such a happy day.

608
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,320
You take Lin Xi from us.

609
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,470
Can you spend your life treasuring her,

610
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,120
and taking care of her?

611
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,430
And no matter what happens,

612
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,800
show up in front of her in time, can you?

613
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,390
I can.

614
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,150
I will accompany her,

615
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,470
respect her,

616
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,870
and love her.

617
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,600
I will be the best husband.

618
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,430
And I'll let Lin Xi be herself.

619
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,670
Be the best daughter

620
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,120
in your heart.

621
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,040
I know that

622
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,040
love that is not blessed by parents

623
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,760
is not good at all.

624
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,120
Only when we become better

625
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,080
can we give each other stable happiness.

626
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,000
This is what I should give

627
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,230
my parents, as a daughter.

628
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:03,650
<i>Class one, Grade 12</i>

629
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,840
Xiao Man.

630
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,560
This cake looks nice.

631
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,950
All right, you go ahead.

632
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,280
Thanks.

633
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,950
Zhi Li! Zhi Li!

634
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,280
Don't play with your phone.

635
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,320
What's up?

636
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,190
Is the music list ready?

637
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,000
Have you confirmed the gifts?

638
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,470
I'm confirming with them?

639
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,230
Look.

640
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,840
All right.

641
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,710
The parents said the banquet
would be held in the evening.

642
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,390
Leave this to our young people.

643
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,040
But we have to
make arrangements for that.

644
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,190
Take it easy.

645
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,390
I planned this. It can't go wrong.

646
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,800
Don't worry. I'll check again.

647
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,390
Go ahead.

648
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,430
This wedding is really good.

649
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,320
Xiao Man, don't go around.
You're pregnant.

650
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,120
I just want to help.
See? The chairs are not ready.

651
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,630
Let me do this.

652
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,040
I'll do this kind of work in the future.
You can have a rest.

653
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,710
-Please do as I say.
-OK, honey.

654
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,910
Be good.

655
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,040
Besides, it's not that I want to move.

656
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,230
It's the baby who wants to move.

657
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,280
Listen to him,

658
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,800
"Dad, Dad, I want to run."

659
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,760
Let me hear it.

660
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,230
-What did my baby say?
-Idiot.

661
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,150
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

662
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,120
<i>Wedding Party</i>
I'm Zhang Huai Wu, the MC today.

663
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,870
Thank you very much for attending

664
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,430
the wedding ceremony of
Jiang Zheng Han and Xia Lin Xi.

665
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,360
I officially announce that

666
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,950
their wedding ceremony begins now.

667
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,620
<i>The wedding ceremony of
Jiang Zheng Han and Xia Lin Xi</i>

668
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,080
Six years ago,

669
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,120
this couple came to
Jiangming No.1 High School.

670
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,950
Six years later, they came back here.

671
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,950
What does that mean?

672
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,470
What exactly does that mean?

673
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,840
-Stop doing that.
-Just tell us.

674
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,910
Just tell us the answer!

675
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,710
Why?

676
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,150
This means that the essence of education
is to educate people.

677
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,230
Our school

678
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,560
not only cares about whether the kids
could get into college,

679
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,760
but also cares about the future life

680
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,840
and growth of them.

681
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,320
Good.

682
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,390
Did director Zhang write
this manuscript for you?

683
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,630
It's getting more and more like him.

684
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,230
As a high school classmate and colleague

685
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,360
of brother Zheng and sis Xia,

686
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,390
I have to respectfully

687
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,760
-and selflessly dedicate a bit.
-What is Chuan doing?

688
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,670
Now I gotta tell you something

689
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,950
about brother Zheng and sis Xia's romance

690
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,800
from high school to the present.

691
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,190
Good!

692
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,520
What I'm going to say is that
they really didn't fall in love early.

693
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,560
What's up?

694
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,910
Bridegroom and bride,

695
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,910
no rush, okay?

696
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,840
We haven't reached that stage yet.

697
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,150
-What's going on?
-What happened?

698
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,040
What is the matter?

699
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,280
They are impatient.

700
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,870
The bridegroom

701
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,560
and the bride are just...

702
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,120
Thank you, senior.

703
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,760
Thank you very much

704
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,120
for taking time to attend our wedding.

705
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,800
To be able to marry Lin Xi
is the biggest wish of my life.

706
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
I want to say,

707
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,150
henceforth,

708
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,630
no matter it's sunny or cloudy,

709
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,800
rainy or windy,

710
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,360
foggy or sandstormy,

711
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,910
I would like to marry Lin Xi anyway.

712
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
What's the rush? I know the process...

713
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,280
There's a bug in the program.

714
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,040
Speed up the process.

715
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,080
Em...

716
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,230
Well...

717
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,320
Let's speed up the process.

718
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,390
Well...

719
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,950
Zheng, do you take...

720
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,950
Yes, I do.

721
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,390
Then how about you, sis Xia?

722
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,950
I do.

723
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,670
Good!

724
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,040
All right, let's go.

725
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,080
Now,

726
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,280
we got some problems to solve.

727
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,840
Our company...

728
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,630
Think about solutions together.

729
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,320
Are you willing to

730
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,190
accompany the bride and groom here

731
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,040
and wait?

732
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,600
Yes.

733
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,800
<i>The wedding ceremony of
Jiang Zheng Han and Xia Lin Xi</i>

734
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,230
The wedding of programmers is

735
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,950
really different.

736
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,320
Fortunately, I dropped out early.

737
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,600
You should really be grateful.

738
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,760
It's said that
the Internet industry kills people.

739
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,430
I thought after I married Xiao Chuan,

740
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,630
it's bad enough to be alone
waiting for him to come back.

741
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,390
Never thought the wedding
of Xiao Xi and Zheng Han

742
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,670
could be like this.

743
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,560
Enough.

744
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,470
You're happy enough.

745
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,000
When will they finish working?

746
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,280
Who knows.

747
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,120
I'm going to check on Xiao Chuan.

748
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,840
Go ahead.

749
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,710
How are you doing there?

750
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,360
It's okay.

751
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,120
Almost done.

752
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,470
I've finished on my side.

753
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,360
I've cracked to the second step.

754
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,390
Fortunately, it was a false alarm.

755
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,520
Thanks for your hard work, everyone.

756
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,670
Thanks. Thanks.

757
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,150
I didn't expect that you have to

758
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,630
work hard with me in a wedding dress
on our wedding day.
