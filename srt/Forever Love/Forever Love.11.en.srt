00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,160
What do you want to do?

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,199
I don't want you
to be taken away from me.

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,240
I know you have one just like this.

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,119
I just want to confirm

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,600
whether I still have an opportunity?

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,000
How do you know that?

26
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,240
<i>Jiang Zheng Han, we promised we would
go to Jing Hua university together.</i>

27
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,110
<i>Don't you remember that?
Where are you now?</i>

28
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,039
Jiang Zheng Han.

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,520
I didn't expect that you
even bought off Chu Qiu Yan.

30
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,679
When you left,

31
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,119
you told me not to be childish.

32
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,360
What do you mean by doing so today?

33
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,320
I am a slow starter.

34
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,559
And I am not sociable.

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,639
I was just worried about you.

36
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,160
Anyhow you haven't said yes
to Qin Yue, right?

37
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,679
I was afraid that he would take the lead.

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,679
-So I...
-So that's what you're thinking.

39
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,960
The thanks you said before,

40
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,520
the gratitude you expressed,

41
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,479
are all lies.

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,240
-Lin Xi...
-But it's not important any more.

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,600
It's up to me whether
I'll accept brother Qin Yue.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,360
None of your business.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,720
None of my business?

46
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,720
I want to know your answer to me.

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,240
What answer?

48
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,440
Talent of technology,

49
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,559
you hacked into the live screen

50
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,039
and made disturbances in my life.

51
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,960
You made it.

52
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,160
Now you feel happy?

53
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,559
What do you take me for?

54
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,880
A trophy of you two's battle?

55
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,760
No.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,239
I just thought you might
accept Qin Yue's confession,

57
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,760
so I became thoughtless.

58
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,399
But I was very embarrassed
at that moment.

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,880
Sorry.

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,440
I succeeded at a great cost.

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,399
But I had really considered
confessing my love to you earlier.

62
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,480
However, I held it back.

63
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
I'll go back to our university.

64
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,839
Please

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,559
don't make me a topic
of others' gossip again

66
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,440
in such a way.

67
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:10,920
Lin Xi.

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,839
Lin Xi, let me send you back.

69
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,959
No. I can go back by myself.

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,839
You broke the rules to confess.

71
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,279
Aren't you definitely the winner?

72
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,959
Why are you running alone here?

73
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,880
It was you who broke the rules.

74
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,640
Now neither of us wins,

75
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,480
okay?

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
I know Xiao Xi well.

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,440
She won't like
such a way of love confession.

78
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,600
Yeah, you are right.

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,920
But next time,

80
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
I'll do it in a better way.

81
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,320
I've been accompanying Xiao Xi many years.

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,799
I know what she likes.

83
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,359
I know what kind of person she is.

84
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,600
But have you ever thought that

85
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,000
even you've stayed with her many years,

86
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,000
you still have no idea

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,640
what kind of a girl she is.

88
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,959
You don't know her for long.
What do you know?

89
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,880
I've protected her for so long.

90
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
I won't allow you to cut in.

91
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:47,359
She isn't a girl who needs protection.
Do you know?

92
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:51,160
She pursues freedom.
There are things that she likes.

93
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,559
Of course there are moments
when she can't be sensible.

94
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,320
This is why I like her.

95
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:00,799
If so,

96
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,839
let's make a new rule.

97
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Let's compete again.

98
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,640
Well...

99
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,480
Hello, professor.

100
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,480
You've done a good job
in the analytic theory of number.

101
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:49,640
Thank you, professor.

102
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
Which department are you in?

103
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,839
And your name?

104
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,239
I'm Xia Lin Xi,
from the Dept of Economic&Management.

105
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,519
Xia Lin Xi?

106
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,440
Yes.

107
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,359
Oh, you are Xia Lin Xi?

108
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,119
Do you know me?

109
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,839
You may say so.

110
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,600
Well, go on with your work.

111
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,559
See you next time
if there's a chance.

112
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,600
Oh, okay.

113
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,519
See you.

114
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,640
See you.

115
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,480
Next time?

116
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,839
See me?

117
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:29,440
Hey.

118
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,440
What?

119
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,400
Chuan, you have a nice profile.

120
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,559
-I don't need you to tell me that.
-Hey there.

121
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,440
I saw that.

122
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,679
After you.

123
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,239
Use my pen.

124
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,000
No.

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,520
Is the seat taken?

126
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
It is.

127
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,280
Please tell your friend

128
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,520
that I'll take the seat.

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,080
Lin Xi, calm down.

130
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
I really have something important
to tell you this time.

131
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,599
Yesterday Professor Shi saw
your analysis of a math problem.

132
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,039
He felt you have a great gift for math.

133
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,119
So he wanted me to ask you

134
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,159
whether you want to
join the computer varsity.

135
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,320
What?

136
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,760
The varsity is recruiting?

137
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,000
Why didn't I know that?

138
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,599
Why can Xia Lin Xi join it while I can't?

139
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,880
Fill out an application form.

140
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,440
I need to discuss it with Professor Shi.

141
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,000
Then you must tell Professor Shi,

142
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,239
if I am not recruited,

143
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,159
it will be the biggest loss
for the varsity.

144
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,280
I'll apply for it later.

145
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,559
Brother Zheng.

146
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,559
How about you speak up for me?

147
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,159
I can try to help you
get into the qualification trials.

148
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,000
Your success relies on your own ability.

149
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:40,359
Okay.

150
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,840
It's already a big help for me.

151
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,000
-Thank you, brother Zheng.
-Why you again?

152
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
Wow!

153
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,799
Pretty,

154
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,479
you still remember me?

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,359
I read my fortune this morning.

156
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,960
It's said that I'd be lucky
in adventures with women.

157
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,719
See? I meet you here.

158
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,239
You know what? It's God's will.

159
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,679
Glib-tongued.

160
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:02,760
Mrs. Jiang.

161
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm not like what she said.

162
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:07,559
Though it's the first time we meet,
I've heard a lot about you.

163
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,840
First time?

164
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,440
Why aren't you shortsighted?

165
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,599
My name is Duan Ning.
Others call me Prince Duan.

166
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,520
You know what?

167
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,880
Even if I look at you
at such a short distance,

168
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,760
you are still so beautiful!

169
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,919
Brother Zheng, good taste.

170
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,039
Cut it out.

171
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,840
-No, Duan Ning...
-Mrs. Jiang, you know what?

172
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,159
-Brother Zheng cares about you very much.
-Well, he always speaks in such a way.

173
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,640
Don't take it to heart.

174
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,520
I know you're still angry at me.

175
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,080
But I know that is also your interest.

176
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,239
Don't give up what you like

177
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,760
because of me.

178
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,880
Think it over.

179
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,280
Hey, Xiao Xi.

180
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,719
-You're leaving?
-I'll go to the front row.

181
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:58,039
I said nothing wrong.

182
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Don't worry.

183
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,239
Xiao Xi will go for the interview

184
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,440
because it's her interest.

185
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,280
Trust me.

186
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,799
Here you are.

187
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,919
Listen,

188
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,799
I come because
Professor Shi wants to see me.

189
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,000
There's nothing to do with you.

190
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,919
No problem.
Anyhow you are here.

191
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,559
Have a seat. Sit.

192
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,599
Okay. Okay.

193
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:55,599
Lin Xi.

194
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,640
We lack a member good at math

195
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,520
in the varsity.

196
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,880
That day, I noticed that
you're really good at math.

197
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,679
So I hope you can join us.

198
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,400
Hmm, professor, maybe you don't know

199
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,239
I am a student of
the Dept of Economic&Management,

200
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,799
not the Math Dept.

201
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,960
So I may not be professional enough

202
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,960
to meet your standards.

203
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,640
That's exactly what I appreciate.

204
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,320
Although you're not from our department,

205
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,440
you're interested in math.

206
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,400
What's more, you have a clear mind
of solving problems.

207
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,960
You have great potential for competition.

208
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,320
Right?

209
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,919
Thank you, Professor Shi.

210
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,000
You don't need to thank me, but Jiang.

211
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,080
I am easy-going.
Don't get nervous.

212
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't call me Professor Shi.

213
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,080
Just call me Shi.

214
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:48,840
Okay.

215
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,359
Professor Shi.

216
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,799
There is really nothing

217
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,640
between Jiang Zheng Han and me.

218
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,640
Oh, that's right.

219
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,960
We were just high school classmates.

220
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,039
Professor Shi, in the future,
if you find she's no more capable,

221
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,719
you can ask her to quit.

222
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,280
There is a term in math
as “one and only one”.

223
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,479
I think every member in our varsity

224
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,000
is irreplaceable.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,960
Those qualified for staying

226
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,039
must be capable and mentally strong.

227
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,280
So I think...

228
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,880
Don't scare her.

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I believe that

230
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,719
our team is a warm,

231
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:35,080
responsible and capable group.

232
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,960
Right.

233
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,880
Lin Xi.

234
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,799
Our team is a sweet
and harmonious big family.

235
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,119
Our professor is handsome.

236
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,840
Our team members are humorous and funny.

237
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,400
It is your best choice
among all the clubs on campus.

238
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,359
That's right.

239
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,719
And out varsity

240
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,359
is a very famous official team
in Jing Hua University.

241
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,679
The scores you gain in the team

242
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,440
will be counted as scores
of extracurricular practice.

243
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,440
Most importantly,

244
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:02,440
it's very helpful in getting a job

245
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,239
and postgraduate recommendation.

246
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:04,799
Exactly.

247
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:07,880
Senior, even if
you don't make the introduction,

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,440
I know Jing Hua University's
varsity is great.

249
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,880
However,

250
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,559
I don't know...

251
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,280
I don't know how to program.

252
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,000
I may be a drag on all of you.

253
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,080
Don't worry.

254
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,039
We still use mathematical thinking
when solving problems.

255
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,679
Even if you don't know how to program,

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,320
it's still okay as long as
you have mathematical thinking.

257
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,239
You have a big advantage on that.

258
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,799
Well...

259
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
If so, I'll have a try.

260
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,039
Thank you, professor.

261
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,400
Welcome to join our varsity.

262
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,440
Applause.

263
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,359
By the way,

264
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:53,280
there will be a qualification trial in two days.

265
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,039
So,

266
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,880
you can come here for preparation.

267
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,280
Jiang, you teach her.

268
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,880
Okay?

269
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,159
Er...

270
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,000
In my opinion,

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,239
seniors can teach better than me.

272
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:10,679
Ah?

273
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,039
No, thanks...

274
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,440
He and I used to be classmates.

275
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,559
Mr. Jiang.

276
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,400
No, Jiang Zheng Han.

277
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,559
Don't mind that I might not be so smart.

278
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,679
It doesn't matter.

279
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,359
Er, professor.

280
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,320
They come also for the interview.

281
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,960
-Hello, Professor Shi.
-Hello, Professor Shi.

282
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,080
So many students want to join us?

283
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,760
We don't have enough vacancies.

284
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,919
Professor Shi,
you can ask me any questions.

285
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,200
I'll answer them very well.

286
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
Me too.

287
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
-Me too. Any questions.
-Okay.

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,239
Since they are here,

289
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,479
let them do the tests.

290
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,679
You are the supervisors.

291
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,479
Just tell me the results.

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,599
Okay. Okay.

293
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,640
Xia, let's go.

294
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,840
I'll show you our place.

295
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,280
Oh, okay, professor.

296
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,679
Professor Shi is kind.
Take it easy.

297
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,119
The varsity is more suitable for you,
compared with my Math Club.

298
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
<i>The varsity is more suitable for you,
compared with my Math Club.</i>

299
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,119
Lin Xi.

300
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,119
Sis Shi Ying.

301
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,640
I heard you joined the varsity.

302
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,320
Yes.

303
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,559
I am also one of the varsity.

304
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:56,080
But,

305
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,559
have you learned programming?

306
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,599
No.

307
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know
why Professor Shi chose me.

308
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,439
He asked me to
take part in a contest next week

309
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,439
for training.

310
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,079
Training through a qualification trial?

311
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,000
You asked Jiang Zheng Han for help

312
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,560
or Qin Yue?

313
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,880
What do you mean, senior?

314
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,160
The literal meaning.

315
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,160
Lin Xi, I know you're clever.

316
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,079
But you can't regard others as fools

317
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,319
because you're clever.

318
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,560
Though it's Professor Shi
who decides in the varsity

319
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,839
and assigns members for contests,

320
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,520
it's a tradition that
contestants should be selected

321
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,680
through competing fair and square.

322
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,760
Such things ever happened,

323
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,479
although the contestant
was a varsity member,

324
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,239
since his result in the trial
was not good,

325
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,400
he was disqualified from
taking part in official contests.

326
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,000
No one has told me this.

327
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,359
Although I haven't learned programming,

328
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,839
-I believe...
-In the varsity,

329
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:09,920
except Jiang Zheng Han or Qin Yue,

330
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,680
no one else is willing to team up
with you for the contest.

331
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,560
Aren't you afraid that
you will drag your team down?

332
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,920
In fact, it was Professor Shi
who recommended me to join the team.

333
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:25,400
I don't know whether it is an excuse

334
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,959
that Jiang Zheng Han or Qin Yue told you

335
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,560
or it's just your own illusion.

336
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,359
But if you can stay in the varsity,

337
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,520
I'll congratulate you.

338
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,040
I took a look at that code.

339
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,000
I think

340
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,719
we'd better modify this one.

341
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,760
Well, Zheng.

342
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,680
I gotta go.
Send me messages if you need help.

343
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,560
Okay.

344
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,520
What's wrong?
Why so hard-working today?

345
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,319
I heard the qualification trial
is also a knockout one.

346
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,959
The ones who lose will be disqualified
from taking part in official contests.

347
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:31,920
Yes.

348
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,920
Don't worry.

349
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,479
You are in my team.
We won't lose.

350
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,880
Why am I with you?

351
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,800
Don't you want to be
in the same team with me?

352
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,680
That's not important.

353
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,000
No matter which team I am in,

354
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,479
I don't want to be
the one who drags all down.

355
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,479
Lin Xi.

356
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,199
Personally speaking,

357
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,359
I'm happy that
you can join the varsity.

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But the reason
why I recommended you

359
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,280
is that I really find you suitable for it.

360
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,280
Because you enjoy it and do well in math,
and you are a good contestant.

361
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,319
I hope

362
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,439
you can keep on enjoying what you like

363
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
and working hard for it.

364
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,280
These are my real thoughts.

365
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,319
Xiao Xi.

366
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,680
I heard you become a substitute.

367
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,560
Congratulations.

368
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,640
Thank you, brother Qin Yue.

369
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,599
Maybe you don't know that

370
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,000
I was ever Jiang Zheng Han's referrer.

371
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,599
Yes.

372
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,640
Also the "Party A" to me.

373
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,640
Never thought that
you're on such good terms.

374
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,479
Before some coincidence appeared,

375
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
we were.

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,040
Am I here at an incorrect time?

377
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,040
We all come for training.

378
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,920
It doesn't matter.

379
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
Oh, Lin Xi.

380
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,920
Have you decided whom to team up with
in the qualification trial?

381
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,040
Xiao Xi.

382
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,560
Brother Qin Yue,

383
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,920
I've promised

384
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,880
to join Jiang Zheng Han's team.

385
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
Oh, that's right.

386
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,719
That's good.

387
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,439
Qin Yue, you can be with Shi Ying.

388
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,479
And we two a team.

389
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,359
Lin Xi was chosen by Professor Shi.

390
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:04,439
Leader Jiang,
you've got another capable team member.

391
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,839
I am still weak in programming.

392
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,319
I need to learn from you, senior.

393
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,959
Hmm...

394
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,920
Now that we're not in the same team,

395
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,520
we will be opponents
in the future competition.

396
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
It'll be a cruel contest.

397
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,160
Only two teams can be qualified.

398
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,520
So, if you want me to teach you something,

399
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,599
maybe after the contest.

400
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,680
This contest is only for
internal selection.

401
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,439
Its main goal is for
learning from each other.

402
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,560
Xiao Xi.

403
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,880
If you have any questions,

404
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,160
ask me at any time.

405
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,199
Xia Lin Xi is my team member.

406
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,640
I'll be responsible for her.

407
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,199
Let's go to the library.

408
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:03,400
Um, it seems that Leader Qin

409
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,319
is late again.

410
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,199
I've been in the lead for years,
so it's nothing if I'm late once.

411
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,400
Don't worry.

412
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,280
In this qualification trial,

413
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,199
we can beat Jiang Zheng Han's team.

414
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,479
In fact I don't care
whether we can win or not.

415
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,400
If I win,

416
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,560
Xiao Xi cannot join the varsity.

417
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,439
Let's start training.

418
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,650
<i>Student Cafeteria Building A</i>

419
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,119
All vegetables?

420
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,520
You can eat this.

421
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,920
No, no, no, this is for you.

422
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,760
You're too thin.
You should eat more meat.

423
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,199
You can get enough energy to study
when you are full.

424
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,800
-I just want to borrow a meal card.
-I'll eat this.

425
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,959
-Eat.
-Why so stingy?

426
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,359
Sis Xia, brother Zheng.

427
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,839
Zhang Huai Wu?

428
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,920
I've been trying to borrow a meal card.

429
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,239
I am lucky to meet you two.

430
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,599
I'm starving!

431
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,719
Why do you come to our school so often?

432
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,560
It's a long story.

433
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,800
I've put down roots in Jing Hua University.

434
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,640
I live in brother Zheng's dorm.

435
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,359
Put down roots?
Don't you have lessons?

436
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,560
Forget the lessons. I don't understand
what professors say anyhow.

437
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,599
They talk all nonsense in class.
I can't understand.

438
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,959
I'd rather learn from brother Zheng.
Am I right, brother Zheng?

439
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:27,680
Yes.

440
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,839
That makes sense.

441
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,040
Sis Xia.

442
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:31,640
Yes?

443
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,160
Your cafeteria

444
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,199
is much better than ours.

445
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,880
Look at the dishes.

446
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,959
The dishes look more delicious.

447
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,000
-I'll eat it. What?
-Zhang Huai Wu.

448
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
-It is for Xia Lin Xi.
-Sis Xia gave it to me.

449
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,479
-Sis Xia, right?
-Okay, okay, okay.

450
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,400
-Wait, I...
-Right?

451
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,079
-I can lend you my meal card.
-Right, right, right.

452
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,839
-Sis Xia just gave it to me.
-Here.

453
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,479
Enjoy your meal.
I'll buy another portion.

454
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,359
What are you looking at?

455
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,280
Brother Zheng,
should I call her Mrs. Jiang?

456
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,119
Eat your food.

457
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,239
Okay.

458
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,510
<i>Library</i>

459
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,199
What are you laughing at?

460
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,640
Don't you feel it's like

461
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,359
when we were in high school?

462
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,800
The period when I was your tutor.

463
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:45,640
What?

464
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,839
You mean I need to pay you?

465
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:48,959
For you, of course not.

466
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,760
Now, no matter what I do for you,

467
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,719
I do it willingly and for free.

468
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,560
Then, can you tell me

469
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,760
the potential security problems
of the singleton pattern

470
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,479
in a multi-threaded environment?

471
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,000
Alright, let me see.

472
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,199
Wait a minute.

473
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Xia Lin Xi.

474
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,359
Can't you be attentive? Read it.

475
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,160
Look.

476
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,719
Xiao Xi.

477
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:34,880
Um?

478
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,680
Brother Qin Yue.

479
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,760
I was going to your dorm to see you.

480
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,319
I didn't expect to meet you here.

481
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,520
What's up?

482
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,719
Well...

483
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,199
Here is the thing.

484
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,680
I've made a summary of
all the tests of the varsity contests.

485
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,479
I think it may be helpful for you.

486
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,079
So,

487
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,000
I come to give it to you.

488
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,599
Thank you, brother Qin Yue.

489
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,000
But I won't accept it.

490
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,079
What Shi Ying said is reasonable.

491
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,160
We are in different teams.

492
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,959
If I use your team's learning materials,

493
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:12,280
it'll be unfair to other members.

494
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,439
But if I have any questions,
I'll ask you.

495
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,599
Just like when we were kids.

496
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,160
Okay.

497
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:25,079
Well...

498
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,119
I wasn't thoughtful enough.

499
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:29,680
I...

500
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,719
Brother Qin Yue.

501
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,280
Yes?

502
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,599
You've been taking care of me

503
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,760
all the time.

504
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,040
You're like a brother
who makes me feel easy

505
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:47,319
all the time.

506
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,439
Tomorrow is the date of the contest.

507
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,839
We should sleep earlier today.

508
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,319
See you tomorrow, brother Qin Yue.

509
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,599
Xiao Xi.

510
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,760
Um?

511
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,119
The contest tomorrow,

512
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,560
go for it.

513
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,160
I really wish you can
become a member of the varsity.

514
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,520
Thank you, brother Qin Yue.

515
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,959
Go back to rest early.

516
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,880
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

517
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,319
Alas...

518
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,670
<i>Jing Hua University,
ACP Qualifier</i>

519
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,040
<i>Jing Hua University</i>

520
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,130
<i>ACP ADOLESCENTS COMPUTER
PROGRAMMING CONTEST</i>

521
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,950
<i>Team member: Jiang Zheng Han</i>

522
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,599
All the teams, enter please.

523
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,479
All the contestants, get ready please.

524
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,439
The contest will begin soon.

525
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,280
The points will be
recorded and accumulated.

526
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,640
One point for one problem solved.

527
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,560
The duration of the contest

528
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,640
is five hours.

529
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,920
We'll stop recording the points
in the last hour.

530
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,800
The first two teams gain the most points
can enter the next stage.

531
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,079
The teams can attack one another's
vulnerabilities by means of technology.

532
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,760
If succeeded, one point got.

533
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,560
Now, all the teams are ready.

534
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,400
The competition will begin.

535
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,880
Countdown begins.

536
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,000
Five.

537
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:56,560
Four.

538
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,199
Three.

539
00:29:59,319 --> 00:29:59,920
Two.

540
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,400
Go!

541
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,959
I am sure brother Zheng's team can win.

542
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:27,839
Don't worry.

543
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,599
Since there's Xiao Xi.

544
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,000
Right. Go for it!

545
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,640
Go for it!

546
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,319
Shen Wen Yue.

547
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,800
Hmm?

548
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,520
Why do you come?

549
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,199
You're also here?

550
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Hey.

551
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:42,280
Sit here.

552
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,479
Alas!

553
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,319
You block others' view. Sit down!

554
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,680
Sit down. Sit down.

555
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,160
Hey.

556
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,719
Zhang, Zhang, who's she?

557
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
You know her?

558
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,119
Goddess of our university, Shen Wen Yue.

559
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,400
You know what?

560
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,680
She is of Cheng University's computer varsity.

561
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:07,239
She became the fastest to solve problems
when she was a freshman.

562
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,560
-A geek of technology.
-Hey.

563
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:13,359
Hi.

564
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,700
<i>No.1: Qin Yue's team</i>

565
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,690
<i>No.2: Jiang Zheng Han's team</i>

566
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,110
<i>No.3: Gao Chen's team</i>

567
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,880
We can use Hash table

568
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,280
to deal with the data structure here.

569
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,800
Try it by yourself.
Ask me if you need my help.

570
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,680
Here is the result of this problem.

571
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,560
Senior.

572
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:39,839
Well, input the data

573
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,719
according to Qin Yue's answers.

574
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,119
Okay.

575
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:51,400
Check the data.

576
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,839
All contestants, attention please.

577
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,920
Now we're in the last hour.

578
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,479
We'll stop accumulating points.

579
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,430
<i>No.1: Qin Yue's team</i>

580
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,340
<i>No.2: Jiang Zheng Han's team
No.3: Gao Chen's team</i>

581
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:06,719
Now the first three teams will
compete for the first two places.

582
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,439
The first place, Qin Yue's team,

583
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:12,520
their points are very close to
that of the second place,

584
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Jiang Zheng Han's team.

585
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,119
Gao Chen's team is experienced
and performing steadily.

586
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,719
Jiang Zheng Han's team and Gao Chen's
must compete fiercely

587
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:22,119
with Qin Yue's to rise in rank.

588
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,800
They have to fight for the decisive point

589
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,560
and for the second place.

590
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,199
It's a pity the third place
will be knocked out.

591
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,880
Senior, someone is attacking our program.

592
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,680
Who?

593
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,680
Gao Chen's team that ranks the third.

594
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,520
What should we do?

595
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
We must fix the program.

596
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,959
Get ready to defend
the attack from Gao Chen's team.

597
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:58,800
-Okay.
-Wait.

598
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,800
We should tolerate Gao Chen's attack.

599
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,160
What do you mean?

600
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,760
The score of Jiang Zheng Han's team
is the closest to ours.

601
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,479
If Gao Chen can get one point,
the two teams have to fight.

602
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,160
Then our team can be definitely safe.

603
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,760
Hurry up, Chen Yi Chuan.

604
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:36,319
Now,

605
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:39,800
Gao Chen's team has attacked
Qin Yue's using their best strategy.

606
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,599
Can Qin Yue's team
defend the attack successfully?

607
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,680
This becomes a highlight
of the competition.

608
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,160
Now, let's observe
Jiang Zheng Han's team.

609
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,400
What on earth
will they react to the attack?

610
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,640
Will they continue to
compete with Qin Yue's team,

611
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:56,839
or attack the program of Gao Chen's team,
so as to keep the second place?

612
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,800
Hold on. Don't be disturbed.

613
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,719
Will they get an opportunity
by using tactics?

614
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,479
Brother Zheng, something is wrong.

615
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,000
Here is the situation,

616
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,600
even if we get another point,

617
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,280
as long as Qin Yue's team
makes concessions for them,

618
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,439
we still have to compete for No.2
against Gao Chen's team.

619
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:14,399
On the contrary, Qin Yue's team...

620
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,879
If we can win now,
why do we choose to wait?

621
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:16,520
No. You...

622
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,120
Don't you get what I said?

623
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,439
I said maybe Qin Yue's team
is making concessions for them!

624
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,120
Jiang Zheng Han, Duan Ning's right.
We should...

625
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,840
I don't believe he would do so.

626
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,600
Duan Ning, continue to attack the program.

627
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,439
Lin Xi.

628
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,360
Try to solve the last question by yourself.

629
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,760
Let me read the next one, okay?

630
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,800
-Let me have a try.
-This problem...

631
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,520
The time is limited. Hurry up!

632
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,360
Okay.

633
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,600
We're out of time.
How long do you need, Mrs. Jiang?

634
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,639
You must solve it quickly.

635
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,639
Concentrate on it.

636
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,719
Concentrate on it.

637
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,320
Yes.

638
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,719
Go for it.

639
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,239
Look here.

640
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,760
In the problem, the char sequence...

641
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:36,919
I've finished all.

642
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:37,520
Good.

643
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,280
Shi Ying, this one.

644
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,080
How is it?

645
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,560
I...

646
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:42,959
Lin Xi.

647
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,000
It's the answer for linearity.

648
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,080
Check the data.

649
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,040
Give me all the problems about
dynamic programming of the database.

650
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,639
Okay.

651
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,320
Brother Zheng, come and check this for me.

652
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,840
Here.

653
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,479
Hello! Would you come and have a look?

654
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:21,280
Does it break the rules?

655
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,239
Well, let me see.

656
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,239
Look here.

657
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,040
About the sequence numbers,
just output them.

658
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,399
And...

659
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,280
Chen Yi Chuan.

660
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,719
Fix the program.

661
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:40,679
Ah?

662
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,080
Qin Yue, you...

663
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,479
We're in a competition.
There aren't any tactics.

664
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:47,760
We must deal with the bug we've got.

665

00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:26,360
Okay.

668
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,840
It's a surprise that
Jiang Zheng Han fought back head-on

669
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,280
<i>No.1: Jiang Zheng Han's team</i>
with toughness by his excellent ability.

670
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,879
He became the champion finally,

671
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:43,719
while Qin Yue's team got the second place.

672
00:37:58,919 --> 00:37:59,320
Wow.

673
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,439
Yeah.

674
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:04,439
Jiang Zheng Han. Jiang Zheng Han!

675
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,719
-We won!
-We won!

676
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,320
Yeah!

677
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,399
We won!

678
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,959
Brother Zheng! Sis Xia!

679
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,600
We won!

680
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,159
Jiang Zheng Han! Jiang Zheng Han!

681
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:28,600
Qin Yue.

682
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,120
Xiao Chuan.

683
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:32,879
Sis Xia.

684
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:33,760
Let's go, Xiao Man.

685
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,639
I said you would win.

686
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,679
Thank you for the last point.

687
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,919
It's a competition.

688
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:42,399
You won. You're welcome.

689
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,479
Me too.
I was too nervous to work properly.

690
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:46,919
Xiao Xi.

691
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,760
Xiao Man, Qiu Yan.

692
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,560
Professor, are we cool?

693
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,399
Yeah!

694
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:55,919
Wow, you're awesome.

695
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,199
Hey, you young men
should have a celebration.

696
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,639
-Yes.
-I won't join you. I'm leaving.

697
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,840
It's your treat next time, professor.

698
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,760
-Okay.
-No problem.

699
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,959
-Bye, professor.
-Bye-bye, Professor Shi.

700
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:08,239
-Jiang Zheng Han, you're great.
-You're awesome.

701
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:08,959
I know.

702
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,719
Did you see how cool I was just now?
Handsome?

703
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,080
I don't know.

704
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,439
Xiao Xi, I noticed Xiao Chuan
was very disappointed just now.

705
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,399
Is it because
he only got the second place?

706
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,479
Xiao Man, can you not only care about him alone?

707
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:24,879
I'm still here.

708
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,399
I understand

709
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,320
such a feeling.

710
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,479
Yo, brother Zheng.

711
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,600
Great sweet words.

712
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,719
Well, you did a good job today.

713
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,959
Let's dine out together.

714
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:43,280
Okay.

715
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,520
Where's Zhang Huai Wu?

716
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,320
He went to the so-called goddess.
Forget him.

717
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,360
I also have something to deal with.
See you.

718
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,360
Beauty, see you.

719
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,919
Alright.

720
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,879
Well...

721
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll put something in the dorm first.

722
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,719
Then see you later.

723
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,000
Jiang... Leader Jiang.

724
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,399
Yes.

725
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,159
Member Xia.

726
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:14,080
See you later.

727
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,239
Leader Jiang, bye-bye.

728
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
Wow.

729
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,560
-Member Xia.
-What's going on now?

730
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:22,919
Let's go.

731
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:23,959
Hurry up, Xiao Xi.

732
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:25,840
Talent Jiang, well done in the contest.

733
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,679
Thank you.

734
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
Jiang Zheng Han.

735
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,040
Do you miss me?

736
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:44,399
Shen Wen Yue, why are you here?

737
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,439
Surprise?

738
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,360
I've been looking for you for long.
