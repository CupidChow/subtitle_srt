-Xiao Xi, go for it!

-Come on.
-Come on.

00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,519
Sit.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,839
Sit down first.

25
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,679
Yours.

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,559
-This row is yours.
-Okay.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,479
I thought you were going to withdraw.

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,199
I didn't expect that you are so cheeky.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,880
Instead of mocking me here,

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,479
you'd better pay more effort to
prepare the contest.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,360
I'll see you on the field.

32
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,880
What did Shen Wen Yue say to you again?

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,199
She declared war on me.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,199
Forget about it.

35
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,039
The contest is about to begin.

36
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,839
We are here to face the fight.

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,880
What we should do now is
to prepare well.

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,559
Today,

39
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,800
Jiang Zheng Han, we have to win.

40
00:02:59,199 --> 00:02:59,479
Yes.

41
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,199
Xia Lin Xi,

42
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,080
we are sure to win.

43
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,559
Go for it.

44
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,559
Go for it.

45
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,559
-Come on.
-Go for it.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,240
During the game,
each team uses one computer.

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,119
In five hours,

48
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:16,839
use either C languages Java or Python code

49
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,759
to solve 13 problems.

50
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,520
The program will be submitted to
the referee for running after completion.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,119
The result of the run
will be judged to be either true or false

52
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,839
and the team will be informed in time.

53
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,119
After each team has answered
one question correctly,

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,119
the organizer will
raise a balloon in its place

55
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,559
to represent the color of the question.

00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,960
formally starts.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,519
Here you go, this is done.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,640
Brother Zheng, how to solve the next?
Take a look for me.

61

Brother Zheng.

62
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:04,799
Wait, wait, wait.

63
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,119
Almost done. Wait a minute.

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,119
You solve the problem
and I'll do it over here.

Uh...

66
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,959
Hurry up!

67
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,839
Ah, okay.

68
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,000
Depend on you, sis Xia.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,000
Basic arrangement.

70

Brother Zheng.

71
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,920
She's full of fighting will.

72
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,880
Enough, don't waste your time,
hurry up.

73
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,359

Senior,

85
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,480
in that way, we'll be really slow.

86
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,720
I'll make up for what we're left behind.

87
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,480

88
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,359

91
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,200
I'll take care of it myself.

92
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,320
Shi Ying, listen to my arrangement.

93
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,480
You can't finish
so many tasks by yourself.

94
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,200
I can.

95
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,359
Are you sure?

96
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:03,920
Yes.

97
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,279
Okay, hurry up.

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,519

99
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040

Now, let's invite the team leaders

101
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,320
to come to the stage
and check with the referee.

102
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,160
I'll go check the score, well done.

Okay.

104
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,320
You've improved much more than last time.

105
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
How did you do that?

106
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,399
The least praiseworthy thing you said,

107
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,480
efforts.

108
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,679
What are you doing?

109
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,159
Teach me how to program.

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,640
What?

111
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,479
Teach me how to program.

112
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,799
You wanted me to teach you how to program?

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,559
Yes.

114
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,960
I don't want to be
a drag in the ACP contest.

115
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,559
Why don't you
ask Jiang Zheng Han to teach you?

116
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,000
Why do you ask so many questions?

117
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,559
Well,

118
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,840
don't you want to prove
you're better than me.

119
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
I've come to ask for your help.

120
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,719
Why don't you just
tower over me with your IQ?

121
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,200
Really? Are you Xia Lin Xi?

122
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,599
Are you fake?

123
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,559
Chen Yi Chuan.

124
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,280
Stop being wordy,

125
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,840
or I'll break all your Snoopy products.

126
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,599
Really you.

127
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,919
But why do you want me to
teach you?

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,159
You're even begging me.

129
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,200
Make effort at the last moment?

130
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,880
Do you think that I can't be your teacher?

131
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,840
And you mean to humiliate me?

132
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,719
This is probably

133
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,760
the only chance in your life
to be my teacher.

134
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,799
Just say out, do it or not.

135
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,479
Yes.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
This is the minimum notation.

137
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,840
This is about
the dynamic programming rule.

138
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,679
Basic algorithm.

139
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,760
What do you mean?

140
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,039
I finished 301 exercise books
in junior high school.

141
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,440
And completed all the reference books
on the market in high school.

142
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,039
So I was the first
in the College Entrance Exam in Jiangming.

143
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,799
Talent

144
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,359
can make a person shine.

145
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,000
So can hard work.

146
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,280
I admit that

147
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,760
you are very excellent.

148
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
I don't need your

149
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,280
or anybody's admission.

150
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,640
I just want to prove it to myself

151
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,559
whether I'm good enough.

152
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,520
Good enough

153
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,840
to be able to
stand on this stage with ease.

154
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,479
Lin Xi.

155
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes.

156
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,119
Did Wen Yue say something to you again?

157
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,840
I saw her come to talk to you again.

158
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,440
She threw down the gauntlet

159
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,640
and said she would never give up on you.

160
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,799
Real... Really?

161
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,400
She...

162
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:04,880
Easy.

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,440
I'm just kidding.

164
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,559
Leader Jiang,

165
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,440
I haven't gone to you for so many days.

166
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,159
Are you angry with me?

167
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,479
How could I be angry with you?

168
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,520
Are you angry with me?

169
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,760
Why did you

170
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,960
go to your brother
to learn programming not me?

171
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,440
Well,

172
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,119
if I say...

173
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,039
If you are beside me,

174
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,359
I'm afraid I'll get distracted.

175
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,640
Is this reason enough
to appease your anger?

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,640
Forget about it.

177
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,479
You must have your own reasons anyway.

178
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,039
You've been working hard these two days.

179
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,640
I'm fine.

180
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:09,719
But I haven't slept for days.

181
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,719
Next time...

182
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,599
-You must...
-Don't forget that

183
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,679
I was the top one in your high school.

184
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,039
Okay, talent of Jiangming.

185
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,479
-The top one who works the hardest.
-Yes.

186
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:34,000
Let's go back.
The result should be announced soon.

187
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,719
Let's go.

188
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,640
Okay.

189
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,559
The score is out now after a close race.

190
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,799
The result is in my hands.

191
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,119
Xiao Xi is so great.

192
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,159
The competition is
exclusively sponsored by XV.

193
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,239
The best player can win

194
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,719
the internship at XV.

195
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,280
Next,

196
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,200
we'll announce it from the third place.

197
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,159
The third place is...

198
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,640
Don't touch me. Listen.

199
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,760
Cheng Ye University.

200
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,919
Shen Wen Yue's team.

201
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,760
Congratulations.

202
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,159
Let's welcome Dr. Wang to the stage

203
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,320
to give them the prize.

204
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,000
Congratulations.

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,960
Okay, let's take a photo together.

206
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,799
Thank you. Thank you.

207
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,159
Let's give them a big hand.

208
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,119
Next,

209
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,679
we will reveal

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,719
the second prize winner.

211
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:11,400
So, who came in second in the competition?

212
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,080
Jing Hua University.

213
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,119
Congratulations to

214
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,280
Qin Yue's team,
from Jing Hua University!

215
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,840
Now let's welcome Dr. Zhao to the stage

216
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,520
to present the award.
Let's welcome.

217
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,039
Trash.

218
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,080
What did you say?

219
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,679
I said your roommate's boyfriend
is really good.

220
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,799
I don't know if he ranks the top.

221
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,840
Probably.

222
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,159
Congratulations.

223
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,840
Let's give our second prize winner
a warm round of applause.

224
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,479
Congratulations.

225
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:17,400
<i>Honor Certificate</i>
Well done.

226
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,799
Next,

227
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,520
we will announce

228
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,520
the first prize winner.

229
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,000
Who is it?

230
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,359
Let's invite the judge to announce it.

231
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,000
I declare

232
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,799
the champion team

233
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,280
that won the ACP Contest is

234
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,679
Jiang Zheng Han's team,
from Jing Hua University!

235
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,479
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

236
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,359
Leader Jiang Zheng Han is also
our best player.

237
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,919
Let's congratulate them.

238
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,799
Okay, thank you.

239
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:01,280
Thank you, judge.

00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Sincere congratulations again to
our champion winner

241

243
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,799
Let's welcome

244
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,039
Dr. Chen

245
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,159
to present the award to them.

246
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,400
Congratulations, congratulations.

247
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,719
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

248
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,000
Thank you, thank you.

249
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,679
-Thank you.

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,520
I... I held you up.

284
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,920
If I hadn't insisted,

285
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,319
the answer
wouldn't have been wrong.

-We wouldn't have run out of time then.
-It's not your fault!

I...

288
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,680
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:58,680
I just...

290
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,439
I was too emotional.

291
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,439
I mean,

292
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,680
even we had done it as I said,

293
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,439
the result is unlikely to be changed.

294
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,760
We lost the game.

295
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,160
Will it influence you?

296
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,719
I mean...

297
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,000
If you can be the best player,

298
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,040
you can go to XV

299
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,599
-and know more...
-Shi Ying.

300
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,439
Except the contest,

301
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,920
everything else is my own business.

302
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,719
Just stay out of that.

303
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,680
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,160
I was worried about that

305
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,520
you would deliberately
make Xia Lin Xi win, so...

306
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,359
You thought too much.

307
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,000
Qin Yue!

308
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,959
You're a little out of form today.

309
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,199
Today, I was

310
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,640
really out of state.

311
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,839
But I gotta make you win once.

312
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,239
What's the matter?

313
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,199
Why such long face
after winning the championship?

314
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,880
Forget about it.

315
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,119
Let's compete again
when you get yourself together.

316
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:33,760
Okay.

317
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,560
Hey, we'll have a glee feast.
Come join us.

318
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,839
I can't today.

319
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,680
I have piles of things
to do in the company.

320
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,280
And I got an engagement tonight.

321
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,239
What engagement?

322
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,079
You have to go there?

323
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,319
Of course.

324
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,119
Do you think it's easy to be a boss?

325
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,239
Right.

326
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:53,800
Zheng Han.

327
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,079
My company is preparing
some projects recently.

328
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,160
If you can come back and help me

329
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,560
or you have a new project,

330
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,239
you can come and discuss it with me.

331
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,680
After this competition,

332
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,839
XV will give me an internship offer.

333
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,800
I probably won't

334
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,160
pick up other jobs.

335
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,040
You're bought off so quickly?

336
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,680
Am I that kind of person?

337
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:19,920
Aren't you?

338
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,319
Jiang Zheng Han.

339
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,719
-Xiao Xi.
-Brother Qin Yue.

340
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,359
You're both here.

341
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,199
Xiao Xi,

342
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,239
your performance today

343
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,920
surprised me a lot.

344
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,599
Alright,

345
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,079
enjoy the celebration tonight.

346
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,280
I will treat you some other day.

347
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,880
Okay.

348
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,079
Let's go.

349
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:53,839
Okay.

350
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,640
Hello, Dad.

351
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:20,680
What's going on?

352
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,800
Son, how's your contest?

353
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,800
It doesn't matter, Dad.

354
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,880
But Xu Zhi Li agreed to see me.

355
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,239
I'll have dinner with him.

356
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,160
I'll tell him about our project.

357
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,680
And have a good talk with him.

358
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,439
Don't worry.

359
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,280
Very good.

360
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,160
I'll wait for your news.

361
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,680
There must be good news.

362
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,319
Okay then, bye.

363
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,079
Bye-bye.

364
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:15,000
Welcome, sir.

365
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,520
Your guest has arrived.

366
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,920
What guest?

367
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,560
Your fixed seat.

368
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,239
Mr. Qin is waiting for you over there.

369
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,599
-Mr. Qin?
-Yes.

370
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,319
Oh, Qin Yue.

371
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,000
How dare he come?

372
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,439
Mr. Qin.

373
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,239
Mr. Qin, Mr. Qin, I'm sorry.

374
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,280
Mr. Xu said he had something to tell you.

375
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,319
Well... Mr. Xu, he...

376
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,319
Tonight,

377
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,319
Mr. Xu said
he had a very important meeting.

378
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,280
He may not be able to dine with you.

379
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,359
How about...

380
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,800
Let me see if the orders are prepared.

381
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,719
If they haven't cooked it,
I can cancel it.

382
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,319
But if they've cooked...

383
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,880
Do you want to pack or...

384
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,640
Well,

385
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,719
you help me open the wine.

386
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,359
Cancel those haven't been cooked.

387
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,079
And serve those cooked dishes.

388
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,239
Okay, no problem.

389
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,479
Wait a moment, please.

390
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,060
<i>Xiao Xi's Mother</i>

391
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,199
Hello, aunt.

392
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,239
Hi, Qin Yue.

393
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,760
I've been trying to call Lin Xi and Chuan,
but nobody has answered.

394
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,760
I don't know where those kids are.

395
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,680
I'm going to Beining a few days later.

396
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:04,400
Do you need anything?
I can bring it to you.

397
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,000
Then let's dine out, okay?

398
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,359
It doesn't matter, aunt.
I don't need anything.

399
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:11,400
When will you come here?
I'll pick you up then.

400
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,119
That would be too much trouble for you.

401
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,800
By the way, I got you a present.

402
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,199
I'll bring it to you.

403
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,119
Aunt, you don't have to do so.

404
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,400
No, you've been taking care of
Lin Xi over there.

405
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,439
I missed Lin Xi's birthday.

406
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,959
So I bought her a birthday present,

407
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,839
and I just bought you
the same watch for men.

408
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,520
Well.

409
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,599
Of course I don't mind.

410
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,040
I'm afraid I was not so considerate.

411
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,439
If you have a girlfriend here,

412
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,239
I might bring you trouble.

413
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,160
Aunt,

414
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,160
I don't have a girlfriend.

415
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,319
Then I'll make my own decision

416
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,920
to let you and Lin Xi wear
the matching style.

417
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,239
Thank you, aunt.

418
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:54,959
But,

419
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,959
I'm worried that Xiao Xi

420
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,760
might feel...

421
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,079
No, no, no.

422
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,599
Xiao Xi is very obedient.

423
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Besides, we two families
know each other well.

424
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,920
I'm not pedantic.

425
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,599
You two are both in college now.

426
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,000
I've been encouraging Xiao Xi
to start a relationship.

427
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,800
I like you very much.

428
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,119
Thank you, aunt.

429
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:17,400
Aunt, how about this?

430
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,079
Please send me your flight number
and I will pick you up then.

431
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,520
Let's talk about the rest when we meet.

432
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,119
Sure, thank you.

433
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,719
Okay.

434
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,199
See you later in Beining.

435
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,000
Aunt, bye.

436
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,920
Do you like it so much?

437
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,160
Are you a cat?

438
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Why no sound when you're walking?

439
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,040
You got so absorbed, okay?

440
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,439
You're a straight A student.

441
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,880
How come it's like your first prize?

442
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:08,079
Because this is
the first prize you gave me.

443
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,359
And it has my efforts in it.

444
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,719
It will be my talisman from now on.

445
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,000
How's your sleep last night?

446
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,599
I slept like a log.

447
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,160
I could have slept another whole day
if you hadn't called me.

448
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,479
Another whole day?

449
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,439
You can sleep for so long?

450
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,959
In fact, in the dorm,
they call me "Sleepy Queen".

451
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
I wouldn't have called you if I'd known.

452
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,319
I'm afraid you didn't have lunch.

453
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,719
Alright,

454
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,640
the victory dinner yesterday
has been changed to tonight.

455
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,359
Because they said that without you,
the party is meaningless.

456
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,560
Even Chen Yi Chuan said you were

457
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,319
taught by him.

458
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,560
He'll come to get the free meal tonight.

459
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,119
How pleased he is with himself.

460
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,839
Have you decided where to eat?

461
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,040
No, so I come to ask you.

462
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,719
-What would you like to eat?
-Hey, Xiao Xi.

463
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,880
Hey, Qiu Yan.

464
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,839
Talent Jiang, we meet again.

465
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,479
-Mr. Xu.
-We won the medal yesterday.

466
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,400
By the way,
how about we dine out together?

467
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,479
Okay, I just have a question to ask you.

468
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,400
Talent Jiang,

469
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,239
my Qiu Yan has praised you a lot before.

470
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,199
But yesterday I saw it,
you do have the ability.

471
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,479
Do me a favor to go together.

472
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,680
Yeah, let's go together.

473
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,319
Yes.

474
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,959
-You say.
-How do you think?

475
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,880
You're the boss.

476
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,479
Well, let's go. You choose a place.

477
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,079
Mr. Xu, your dishes are all served.

478
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,680
You can go now,
we'll take care of it, thank you.

479
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,439
Okay.

480
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,560
Come on.

481
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,479
Congratulations on
winning the championship.

482
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:49,560
-Thank you.
-Congratulations, Xiao Xi.

483
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:55,760
Try the dishes.

484
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,040
-Okay.
-Okay.

485
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,640
Talent Jiang.

486
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,880
Once I came back home yesterday,

487
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,400
I asked someone to search

488
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,239
all the projects you've worked on before.

489
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,680
They are all about security services

490
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,239
and information analysis.

491
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,680
Yes, I've done a lot of research on that.

492
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:15,319
If you can put this idea into practice,

493
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,959
I can't even think about that

494
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,239
how much you'll be worth in the future.

495
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:25,359
By the way,
I was still talking with Qiu Yan yesterday.

496
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,199
We plan to go to France
during the winter vacation.

497
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:29,719
How about the four of us go together?

498
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,640
Huh...

499
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,959
Four of us.

500
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,560
Take a walk along the Champs-Elysees.

501
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,839
You can also take Xia to see Notre Dame.

502
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,920
Two girls can go to Paris-Spring
to buy cosmetics.

503
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,119
We men can

504
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,719
go to the Seine
and talk about the company.

505
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:49,079
I don't think it's going to have much ado.

506
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,439
If you want to talk about the company,

507
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,199
the river near the school is fine, too.

508
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,680
Talent Jiang, you're very humorous.

509
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,599
Of course, it's not the same.

510
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:06,479
Zhi Li, we come here
for meal as friends.

511
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:08,959
Stop talking about
your company, okay?

512
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,680
Because it's a private meal,

513
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,520
I have to remind Jiang as a friend,

514
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,520
as a businessman.

515
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:18,000
Although

516
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,040
Jiang Zheng Han is
the computer talent of Jing Hua University,

517
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,800
he's still too young.

518
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,400
It's hard for him to
strike out on his own.

519
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:27,719
So,

520
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,680
you can do it with me.

521
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,040
You have the project and I have the money.

522
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:35,199
The two of us will be a strong team.

523
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:38,079
We can go everywhere we want then.

524
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:40,319
Talent Jiang, listen to my advice.

525
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,359
Now,

526
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,520
you've already got some fame
through different contests.

527
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,079
You absolutely
don't need to keep this way.

528
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,520
Now the country's most powerful ACP team,

529
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,640
Cheng Ye University.

530
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,719
Do you know
how many hours they train everyday?

531
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,119
Starting in freshman year,

532
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,400
at least eight hours a day.

533
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:01,079
And you have to spare time to study as well

534
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,560
and do something else.

535
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:05,239
I feel tired just thinking about it.

536
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,319
You'd better directly join my company.

537
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,160
Next semester, Jiang Zheng Han

538
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
will go to XV as an intern.

539
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,239
Xu Zhi Li,

540
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,280
aren't you going to intern at XV as well?

541
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
Why Jiang Zheng Han
has to go to your company?

542
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,119
It's different.
My father arranged that.

543
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,560
Before I take over the company,

544
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,800
he wants me to accumulate
some management experience.

545
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,359
But Talent Jiang is different,

546
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,560
he is more capable and talented than me.

547
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,040
He needs no internships at all.

548
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,880
He can come to my company directly,
as a regular employee.

549
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,119
Let's start a business together.

550
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,359
This will be a shortcut in your life.

551
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,400
We're just freshmen.

552
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,359
There's still plenty of time.

553
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:48,400
Future jobs can be considered carefully.

554
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,040
Mr. Xu is kind.

555
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,439
Xiao Xi.

556
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,359
We're friends.

557
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,800
Don't call him Mr. Xu.

558
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,520
Yes, yes.

559
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,079
Brother Zhi Li,

560
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,199
that's a good idea.

561
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,239
See? Jiang understands it.

562
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,640
A causal meal like this

563
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,520
in this restaurant

564
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,680
at least costs a thousand.

565
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,280
You can definitely
live such kind of genteel life.

566
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,359
-I'll go to the restroom.
-Listen.

567
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,520
Work with me...

568
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,439
You eat first.

569
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,599
Go ahead.

570
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,719
He...

571
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:22,839
Just eat.

572
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,079
Can you shut up?

573
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,680
We are not here to
hear about your startup.

574
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,839
Easy, okay?

575
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,719
I... I'm talking about work.

576
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,439
Xia is clever.

577
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,599
It's for your boyfriend's good, right?

578
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,400
Oh,

579
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,359
thank you.

580
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,520
Jiang Zheng Han will think about it.

581
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,520
Well, I'll go to the restroom as well.

582
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,920
-Xiao Xi.
-Ah?

583
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:48,560
You...

584
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:50,599
I...

585
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,160
What are you doing?

586
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,319
Hello, room 888, check please.

587
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,359
Okay, wait a minute.

588
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,160
Xiao Xi, what are you doing?

589
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,040
Stop it, let's talk about it.

590
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,479
-Swipe my card.
-Okay.

591
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,080
No.

592
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,320
We should treat this meal.

593
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,120
Jiang Zheng Han is spoiled by me.
He didn't think too much.

594
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,600
Don't take it to heart.

595
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,199
He is good-tempered enough today.

596
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,679
I don't teach Xu Zhi Li well.

597
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,959
He didn't even know

598
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,760
what to say in different circumstances.

599
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,399
Please don't be angry with me.

600
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,120
I don't know how I can apologize to you.

601
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,159
Excuse me, your friend has paid the bill.

602
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,479
Who?

603
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,080
A man.

604
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,239
Don't know whether it is Xu Zhi Li
or Jiang Zheng Han.

605
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:47,959
Once we go in there,
I'll suggest we go Dutch.

606
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,439
I'll say a few more words
when you're done.

607
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,600
Okay.

608
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:53,639
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

609
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,399
You're welcome.

610
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,399
Sorry about that.

611
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,879
I have no idea why Xu Zhi Li said that.

612
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,959
Zhi Li.

613
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,840
Did you pay the bill?

614
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,199
No, there is no rush.

615
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,239
I can sign the bill later.

616
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,600
Sit down and have some more.

617
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:13,399
I'm really sorry.

618
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,840
I got things to do, gotta go now.

619
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,320
What?

620
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,479
I've paid the bill. Take your time.

621
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,520
If you'd like to order more dishes,

622
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,719
order as you like, okay?

623
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,679
Talent, you're so polite.
We didn't even have a good talk.

624
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:25,919
Why are you in such a hurry?

625
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,959
Mr. Xu,

626
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,959
you really overestimated me.

627
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,120
I don't have any financial connections

628
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,000
or the experience in technical management.

629
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,760
Even the jobs I took before

630
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,439
were all in accordance with
the requirements of Party A.

631
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,520
It's really not worth mentioning.

632
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,760
We asked you out to dine today.

633
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,239
How can you pay the bill?

634
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,959
-Besides...
-It doesn't matter.

635
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
If there's still a chance,
you can treat us.

636
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,520
Okay, we'll treat you
a bigger one next time.

637
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,080
Okay?

638
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,040
Okay, we gotta go.

639
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,520
Xu Zhi Li.

640
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,159
We came dine here as friends today.

641
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,639
You just held such an obvious purpose.

642
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,560
Putting aside
how they would think of me,

643
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,439
can you get the results you want?

644
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:12,760
Well... Don't get angry.

645
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:15,040
I was talking about work, I...

646
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,080
I'll never do that again, okay?

647
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,280
Eat some more. Sit down.

648
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,280
Don't be angry, okay?

649
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,919
Chu Qiu Yan is my roommate.

650
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,959
It costed you so much today.

651
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,199
I feel sorry about that.

652
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:39,199
Can I transfer the money to you?

653
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:59,520
Don't look at me. I... I'll be nervous.

654
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,840
Nervous about what?

655
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:10,560
I'm afraid I'll say the wrong words.

656
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,000
But you've always been a good talker.

657
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,239
Well...

658
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,719
I just said I'd transfer you some money.

659
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,679
Are you angry?

660
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,919
You care about me.

661
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,000
I should be happy.

662
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Don't worry.

663
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,040
We have the prize money.

664
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,959
I won't be short of money.

665
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,360
Really?

666
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,159
Yes.

667
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,560
Of course.

668
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,679
Besides,

669
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,520
I'm glad to be kept by you.

670
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,239
Be kept by me?

671
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:51,919
Yes.

672
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,320
I'm glad.

673
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,679
Shouldn't you feel ashamed about that?
Why so proud?

674
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,080
Duan Ning and Chen Yi Chuan

675
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,120
have reserved the restaurant
for the victory banquet.

676
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,800
I didn't eat too much.

677
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
Well, let's go to the restaurant now.

678
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,199
Okay.

679
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,080
Wait a minute.

680
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,000
Who's calling?

681
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,760
Answer it quickly.

682
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,600
Shall I answer it?

683
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,399
Yes.

684
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,439
Hey, Shen.

685
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,479
I want to see you.

686
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,520
Not today,
I have to be with my girlfriend.

687
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,639
Just a moment.

688
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,439
I'll wait for you in the restaurant,
you must come.

689
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,800
She said she was waiting for me
in the restaurant.

690
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,760
Okay, let's go.

691
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:49,560
What to eat...

692
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,439
Hey, Huai Wu.

693
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:51,879
Help me choose one of these two.

694
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,800
This one.

695
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,159
This?

696
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:54,760
Good.

697
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,600
Just order this big assorted dish.
We're a big party.

698
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,840
How about that?

699
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,520
Okay.

700
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:00,879
Hey, guys.

701
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,439
Sis Xia, why you're so late?

702
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:04,639
What makes you so late?
Where is Jiang Zheng Han?

703
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,919
Shen Wen Yue asked to see him,
he'll be here later.

704
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,040
Shen Wen Yue?

705
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,000
Rival in love.

706
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,760
That's fine. Jiang Zheng Han can handle
his things by himself.

707
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,320
What a sensible girlfriend
Brother Zheng got.

708
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,439
-Xiao Xi, look.
-What are you talking about?

709
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:24,639
<i>Wen Yue, where are you?</i>
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

710
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,479
<i>I must hear it myself.</i>
What did you order?

711
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,620
You've never been in a relationship.
What do you know?

712
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,710
I ordered this one.

713
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,879
Okay, let's order, order.

714
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:34,140
<i>Singapore bak kut Teh</i>

715
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,879
Why makes them so late?

716
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,159
Why haven't they come yet? I'm starving.

717
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:45,199
How about we eat first?

718
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,679
-I think so.
-Let's eat first.

719
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,560
No.

720
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,360
Are you alright?

721
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,120
I'm fine.

722
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,080
Here you are.

723
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,959
Drink some warm water.

724
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,760
Thank you.

725
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,639
Why hasn't he come yet?

726
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:15,600
Yeah, why Jiang Zheng Han hasn't come yet?

727
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,080
Hey, brother Zheng.

728
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,000
Here you are. Come on, let's start, start.

729
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,080
Come on, come on, come on.

730
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,560
Wen Yue, come here.

731
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,399
Sit, sit, sit.

732
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,639
So many dishes and you didn't eat?

733
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,879
You're so persevering.

734
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:30,919
No beer?

735
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:33,840
Wait, bring us a case of beer.

736
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,040
Really, are we going to drink?

737
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,439
Just drink it.

738
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:45,080
Anyway, brother Zheng
got the prize money yesterday.

739
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,879
I'd feel really bad
if I didn't let him spend money.

740
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,120
Come on, come on.

741
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,639
Xia Lin Xi, you should toast me, right?

742
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,879
Okay, tutor Chen.

743
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,600
I'll pour it for you.

744
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,120
-Okay, that's enough.
-Xia Lin Xi.

745
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,320
Shen Wen Yue.

746
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:25,080
A toast to you.

747
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,199
I'll drink it up.

748
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,719
Wen Yue.

749
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:48,743
