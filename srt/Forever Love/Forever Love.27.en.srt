<i>To Make You Better Is My Love For You</i>

20
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:48,120
We haven't been like this for a long time,

21
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,080
taking a walk around the campus.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,519
Right.

23
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,680
You are tired from the testing fair,
aren't you?

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,559
I'm fine.

25
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,919
After all, it's our own company.

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,199
When the fair is over,

27
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:06,160
we don't have to worry about
being separated, right?

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,639
Being separated?

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,399
Are you worried we're going to break up?

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,919
Are you a fool?

31
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,960
I mean, after the fair,

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,600
once our team has the investment,

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,320
we don't need to worry about
our team being separated then.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,240
You scared me to death.

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,759
Xiao Chuan,

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,679
do you think that

37
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,160
starting a business now

38
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,279
is like building the blocks
when we were kids?

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,559
This kid gave you a cuboid,

40
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,520
and that kid gave you a cube.

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
Slowly,

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,559
there were more and more blocks.

43
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:48,279
Then, you could place it together

44
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,720
to build the castle in your mind.

45
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,160
I didn't like playing with blocks
when I was small.

46
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,800
When I was six or seven,

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,039
I liked to do four-digit arithmetic.

48
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,720
Oh, come on!

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,759
It's good to be in love.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,440
Kissing is good as well.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,240
We're definitely not going to separate.

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,880
Yes.

53
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,119
But Jiang Zheng Han
and Xia Lin Xi are pitiful.

54
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,240
What do you mean?

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
Xia Lin Xi is going to leave.

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,919
Didn't she tell you?

57
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,279
To raise 500,000 for Jiang Zheng Han,

58
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,000
she really promised her mother
to go abroad?

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,839
Yes,

60
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,079
my aunt has wanted her
to go abroad for a long time.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, does Jiang Zheng Han
know about this?

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,519
No.

63
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,440
No, no!

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,399
He must be told about this, hurry up.

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,720
I promised Xia Lin Xi

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,959
I could not tell
Jiang Zheng Han about this.

67
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,559
Why?

68
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
I am back.

69
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,040
Why you suddenly bought so many things?

70
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,600
Nothing.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
Groceries are on sale at the supermarket.

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,920
So I bought more.

73
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,640
Look.

74
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,399
Both of these toothpastes work well.
Use them more.

75
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,040
This is laundry detergent.

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,359
And this is softening liquid.

77
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,600
Put the laundry detergent first
and then the softening liquid.

78
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,839
The toilet paper must be put
in the closet in the bathroom

79
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,040
or it will get wet.

80
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,799
About your socks,

81
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,119
I threw out all the odd socks

82
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,559
and bought you some new.

83
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,640
Remember to roll the new socks up

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,519
and put them all here.

85
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,640
Don't litter randomly.

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,359
What?

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,640
You look like a woman now.

88
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,279
You always say things that

89
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,559
only a wife would say.

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,359
Anyway,

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,119
I don't need to know these. You're here.

92
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,839
I can just

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,839
enjoy your taking care of everything.

94
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:50,880
You can't always rely on me to do this.

95
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,920
You have to learn to arrange your life.

96
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,679
What's wrong?

97
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,279
I'm just kidding.

98
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,720
Did your family put pressure on you?

99
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,600
No.

100
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,679
I...

101
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,320
I'm afraid that

102
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,160
you'll get lazy having me with you.

103
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,519
But you must promise me,

104
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,600
while I am away,

105
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,559
you must eat your meals on time

106
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,359
and go to bed early.

107
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,760
Okay.

108
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
You are the boss.

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,920
Good.

110
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,239
Thank you.

111
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,880
Done?

112
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,320
I'm leaving.

113
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,760
Okay.

114
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,399
You're leaving?

115
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,279
No,

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,079
I won't let you go.

117
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,679
I have things to do in school tomorrow.

118
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,279
You're also occupied as well.

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,799
I'm almost done.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,760
Come and see.

121
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
That's the last paragraph.

122
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,480
I want to be with you.

123
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
This testing fair

124
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,359
is important to all of us.

125
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,399
It's a life-and-death moment
for the company.

126
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,040
Nobody,

127
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,359
and nothing

128
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,959
should affect you,

129
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:37,959
including me.

130
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Mr. Jiang,

131
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,959
be nice.

132
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
But if you are not there,

133
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,160
I'm afraid I can't fall asleep.

134
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,200
The quilt is too light

135
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,600
to stop me from

136
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,640
thinking of you.

137
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,279
Lin Xi.

138
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,440
Yes.

139
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,200
Are you keeping something from me?

140
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,679
Nothing.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,719
I think you're a little strange.

142
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,640
We girls

143
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,840
are easy to be moved,

144
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,919
me included.

145
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,559
Besides,

146
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,919
you said such sweet words.

147
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,719
Let's hold for five more minutes.

148
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,919
Five minutes later,

149
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,280
I'll leave

150
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,919
and you go back to work.

151
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,479
Don't persuade me to stay.

152
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,359
Sir,

153
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,200
I come to hand in my application form
for overseas study.

154
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Okay, no problem with the form.
Just sign for confirmation.

155

<i>Signature of applicant: Xia Lin Xi</i>

156
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
Give it to me.

157
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,280
Okay.

158
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,640
We'll call you later.

159
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,440
-Thank you, sir.
-Okay.

162
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,960
Anyway, Jiang Zheng Han
has already got the investment.

163
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,000
Can't we just return the 500,000

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,599
to Xia Lin Xi's mother, right?

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,479
I don't think it's that simple.

166
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,280
Otherwise, Lin Xi would have done it.

167
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,919
That's her biological mother.

168
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,200
If it is not enough to just pay her back,

169
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,719
-let Jiang Zheng Han give her some...
-Forget about it.

My mother won't agree.

171
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,159
Go ahead, what do you wanna ask?

172
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,239
Xiao Xi,

173
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,599
you really decided to go abroad?

174
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:37,640
Yes.

175
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,760
What about Jiang Zheng Han?
What are you going to do?

176
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,760
Cross-country relationship.

177
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,239
You serious?

178
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,159
Xiao Xi,

179
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,880
do you really know
how harmful it can be to a couple?

180
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,080
Less communication.

181
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,640
Affection fades.

182
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,119
Easy to be cheated.

183
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,599
Higher breakup rates.

184
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,200
The advantage is

185
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,679
we will cherish each other more

186
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,559
and this can better test
whether our affection

187
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,280
can stand
the test of time and distance.

188
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
But I firmly believe that

189
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,200
cross-country relationship
may affect others,

190
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,520
it won't affect Jiang Zheng Han and me.

191
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,520
Xiao Xi,

192
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:24,640
if it's so good, why don't you tell him?

193
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,479
It's not the right time yet.

194
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,760
When is the right time?

195
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,880
You really mean to text to tell him

196
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,840
-until you are on the plane?
-Yes.

197
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,919
Xiao Xi,

198
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,479
Jiang Zheng Han disappeared
in the year of Grade 12.

199
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,039
You had been sad for so long.

200
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,080
Put yourself in his places,

201
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,440
just think about it.

202
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,520
Think for our Mr. Jiang,

203
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,159
okay, president Xia?

204
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,400
I borrowed money from my mother
without telling Jiang Zheng Han.

205
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,760
If he had known,

206
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,440
he would not have agreed.

207
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,119
Now,

208
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,080
I already made a deal with my mother.

209
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,799
If I break my word,

210
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,679
then,

211
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,400
it's harder for him
to get my mother's approval.

212
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,559
Anyway,

213
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,840
promise me that

214
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,679
you won't tell him.

215
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,719
I'll find a chance to tell him.

216
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:19,880
Lin Xi,

217
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,520
I have an idea.

218
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,039
Don't worry, listen to Qiu Yan first.

219
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,679
This one.

220
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,720
He'll definitely ask you

221
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,400
<i>Share Allocations of Fund Raising</i>
when he sees the share allocations.

222
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,559
<i>Xia Lin Xi: 500,000</i>
Then, you can directly

223
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,760
tell him the truth.

224
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:37,640
Thank you, Qiu Yan.

225
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,799
Come on, I'll be back, okay?

226
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:46,840
Please come in.

227
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,080
This is the share allocation form.

228
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,359
You raised 500,000 alone?

229
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,559
Which ATM did you break?

230
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,200
My father called before to ask about you.

231
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,000
I just told him the situation by the way.

232
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,359
He said

233
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,400
this is his egg money.

234
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,719
Uncle saved so much money?

235
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,119
How long had it taken?

236
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,960
I have something to discuss with you.

237
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,799
Brother Zheng.

238
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:00,880
Well,

239
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,159
sis Xia is also here.

240
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,400
Duan Ning, wait me outside.

241
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,960
Let me talk to Lin Xi first.

242
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,840
Oh, it's fine, Duan Ning.

243
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,400
You two go ahead, don't mind me.

244
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,919
The program is almost ready for testing.

245
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,200
Chen Yi Chuan is waiting to
enter the data.

246
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,320
Come and have a look.

247
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,679
But...

248
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
You guys go ahead.

249
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,320
I'll talk with you at home tonight.

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,640
Okay.

251
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,679
-Let's talk at home.
-Okay.

252
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,520
Let's go.

253
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:28,280
Go.

254
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm back.

255
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,719
-You're back.
-Yes.

256
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,479
Today,

257
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,960
the thing you meant to tell me,

258
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,080
what is it?

259
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,640
Oh,

260
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,119
formal attire is required
for the testing fair,

261
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,719
I'd like to order two suits for you,

262
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,280
but I haven't chosen the style yet.

263
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,320
Take a look.

264
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,679
Which one do you like?

265
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,080
Is that all?

266
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,080
Yes.

267
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,479
You lied to me.

268
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,760
Did your father sneak

269
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,880
that 500,000 for me,

270
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,679
and your mother found it?

271
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,640
Now your mother hates me even more, right?

272
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,919
Kind of.

273
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,119
But my mom later agreed.

274
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,880
She said you could invest the money first,

275
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,039
and you can't lose it all.

276
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,520
Can you promise it?

277
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,159
Yes.

278
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,960
I have confidence in
tomorrow's fundraise.

279
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,840
I think

280
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,039
I have the ability to make your mother
think better of me.

281
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,359
I'm sure I can go to your parents

282
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,080
and propose the marriage

283
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,760
fair and square.

284
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,679
And get their approval

285
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,280
to be your husband.

286
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,839
Okay,

287
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,959
I believe you.

288
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,680
By the way,

289
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,719
-about the suit,
-Yeah.

290
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,040
if you don't
have any special requirements,

291
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll order the style I like.

292
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,640
Sure,

293
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,000
help me to choose.

294
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,599
But it's an old store,

295
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,640
I need to get your size first.

296
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,880
Don't you know my size?

297
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,199
Save it.

298
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:39,880
Suits are different from school uniforms.

299
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,560
Come on.

300
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,560
Suit must be tailored.

301
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,199
That shop has
a very complicated size chart.

302
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:49,640
So,

303
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I need to know the exact size
of every part of you,

304
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,319
it will fit you then.

305
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,439
Measure it, see if you're satisfied.

306
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,479
Lin Xi,

307
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,040
wait until the testing fair is over,

308
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,959
I'll be with you

309
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,359
wherever you want to go.

310
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,439
Okay.

311
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,719
That's all I wanna say.

312
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,199
Now it's the home stretch,

313
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,040
we should be fully prepared.

314
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,199
The last three days,

315
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
everybody, cheer up!

316
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,959
-Cheer up.
-Okay.

317
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,359
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

318
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,119
Excuse me, pretty,

319
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,920
-could you please leave your contact information?
-Pretty, please

320
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,560
-help with our close beta test.
-Yes.

321
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,280
Okay, no problem.

322
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:54,119
If there is any change,
we will contact in time.

323
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,119
Okay.

324
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,560
Excuse me, pretty.

325
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,760
-Chuan.
-Yes.

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
Didn't I tell you

327
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,959
not to work

328
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,359
while you are eating?

329
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,520
Why don't you listen?

330
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,359
Okay, I'll focus on work now.

331
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,479
No,

332
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,000
I want you to enjoy your meal.

333
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:26,760
Open your mouth.

334
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,599
Excuse me,

335
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,439
we're developing a new software.

336
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,239
-Will our information be leaked?
-No.

337
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,319
Don't be afraid, pretty.

338
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,680
-I don't have time.
-Just two minutes.

Sorry.

Just look for your keys.

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,839
Okay.

381
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,119
Brother Zheng,

382
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,920
did I

383
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,640
come at a wrong time?

384
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,239
Enough,

385
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,439
deduct your salary.

386
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,599
Mr. Jiang,

387
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,560
do I still have the salary to be deducted?

388
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,680
What a pity, you just

389
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,280
came in suddenly.

390
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,959
It sounds like

391
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,040
you even feel proud about it?

392
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,959
Is the office a place...

393
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,040
On purpose?

394
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,760
Compared with someone
who hasn't kissed any girls,

395
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,479
maybe I'm better.

396
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,599
It seems that I can't accept
such kinda corporate culture.

397
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:04,400
May I resign, Mr. Jiang?

398
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,439
Sure.

399
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,239
But still no salary.

400
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,400
-Work hard.
-Good luck.

401
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,319
Why are you looking at me?

402
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,920
I'm thinking that

403
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,800
you'll help me wear my tie every day.

404
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,319
President Xia,

405
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,520
thank you for

406
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,119
buying me this suit.

407
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,959
I've told you

408
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,599
this is my investment.

409
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,479
Well, in order to return your investment,

410
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,040
I've decided that I'll make you

411
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,400
awake from the aroma of food every day.

412
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,040
You're thinking too much.

413
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:19,239
Lin Xi,

414
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,439
I am really

415
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,319
thinking about our future every day,

416
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000

422

You go first.

423
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,400
I'll pack up the things
and meet you later.

424
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,280
Okay.

425
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,760
See you later.

426
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,000
See you later.

427
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,160
-Huai Wu, I'm coming.
-Okay.

428
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,760
How is everything going over there?

429
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,839
Almost ready.

430
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,680
Okay, I know.

431
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,690
Bye-bye.

432
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,040
Mr. Xu, do you
have confidence in this testing fair?

433
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,800
Well, this time, our product was
completely independently developed.

434
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,359
I'm sure

435
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,800
it will be one of the best in the industry.

436
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,640
I have absolute confidence in it,

437
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,400
also in our excellent team.

438
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,760
Mr. Xu, you're young and promising.

439
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Can you introduce that

440
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,640
what innovation you had
at the beginning of software development?

441
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,640
Well...

442
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,439
Since I was a child, I've hoped...

443
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,040
Wow, there are so many people at the fair!

444
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,079
These people must suffer defeats.

445
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,199
They're definitely not as talented as me.

446
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:47,880
Of course,

447
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,119
you are also the most handsome.

448
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,400
Let me see, this suit looks good on you.

449
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,319
Don't do this, so many people here.

450
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,400
I feel embarrassed.

451
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,439
Let's take a picture.

452
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,479
Take a picture.

453
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,800
-Come on.
-Okay.

454
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,800
One, two, three.

455
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,479
Come on, I'm gonna send it to our parents.

456
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:07,680
It's the first time you've worn a suit.

457
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,280
Come on, take a good one.

458
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,439
One, two, three.

459
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Attending such a big fair like this,

460
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,719
do you feel nervous now?

461
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,239
Of course not.

462
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,560
We attend this fair on merit.

463
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,040
Thank you for your time.

464
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:22,119
Thank you.

465
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,359
Wu,

466
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,119
what the hell are you wearing?

467
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,920
It doesn't seem to fit me, right?

468
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,479
It's like a cloth for washing feet.

469
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,880
Where did you find it?

470
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,000
My father's.

471
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,760
He said he wore this

472
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,479
when he's the dean of students,
it's of good luck.

473
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,040
So I had no other choice
since he said so.

474
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,239
Hearing that,

475
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,520
I think this suit

476
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,319
is not so ugly anymore.

477
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,640
Really?

478
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,160
Not bad.

479
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,199
Good boy.

480
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,520
Daddy loves you.

481
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,640
Cut it out.

482
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,839
-Mr. Jiang, may I have an interview with you?
-Sure.

483
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,000
Do you have faith in this testing fair?

484
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,959
This time, the product
we will show in the bidding

485
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,880
is the painstaking effort of our company.

486
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,640
-Our team has put a lot of effort into this.
-Yes.

487
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,920
-I'm confident.
-Okay.

488
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,719
Seems you have made full preparations.

How is it going?

492
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,119
Today is such an important day.

493
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,640
Why isn't Xia Lin Xi with you?

494
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,479
She said she would pack up things herself.

495
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,400
She'll come alone later.

496
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,079
You just agreed?

497
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,439
Or what?

498
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,199
You silly.

499
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,560
If Xiao Man said this,

500
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,880
I wouldn't agree with that.

501
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,719
I gotta have her with me anyway.

502
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:44,000
That shows our family status, you know?

503
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,160
You should learn from me.

504
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,560
Jiang Zheng Han...

505
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:53,040
-All right, I'll go in first.
-Wait.

506
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,199
Just say it.

507
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,079

Brother Zheng, take a look.

00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:06,839
Okay.

511
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,800
-Sign it if there's no question.
-It's all prepared.

512
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,640
Remember to put the documents in order.

513
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:13,839
Hey.

514
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,800
-Take care of it.
-Okay.

515
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,800
Why you came so late?

516
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:24,719
Nervous?

517
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,479
Your fingers feel so cold.

518
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,920
I think you're the one who is nervous.

519
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,599
Your hands are sweating.

520
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,160
Actually, a little bit.

521
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,479
But here you are.

522
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,439
I feel much better.

523
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,959
You even pretended to be my tutor
in high school.

524
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,640
In my mind,

525
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,719
you're quite bold.

526
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,959
I'll be as confident as I was

527
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,119
when I chased you.

Yes, please.

548
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,800
There were several mature projects,

00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,719
particularly, Mr. Xu's project.

550

important technical challenges
that need to be overcome.

556
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,319
Mr. Jiang, could you please tell us

557
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:36,560
if you have any good solutions
for this part?

558
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,520
Here I can tell you responsibly

559
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,280
that we've already overcome

560
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,880
these technical difficulties.

561
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,119
I'm confident that

562
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,359
our team

563
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,000
can be at the top of the industry.

564
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,920
How to prove it?

565
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,439
I'm sorry,

566
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,479
but you may not know him very well.

567
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,839
However, you might be familiar with

568
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:00,920
the information leak of XV.

569
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,880
Mr. Jiang Zheng Han, the one on the stage

570
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,239
is the leaker.

571
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,800
Besides, I'd like to ask you

572
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,439
such a person

573
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,719
said there's nothing wrong
with his security system,

574
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,280
do you believe it?

575
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,040
But as far as I know,

576
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,319
this case has been settled.

577
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,280
Jiang Zheng Han was framed.

578
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,719
Mr. Wang,

579
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,359
the information leak
is an undisputed truth.

580
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,439
If you have any doubts,

581
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,920
I can make a clarification.

582
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,239
Now I have the evidence to prove that

583
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,359
it's a repeat dirty trick again.

584
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,719
Someone did it on purpose.

585
00:32:59,239 --> 00:32:59,959
The purpose

586
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,479
is to make a startup company like us

587
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,319
never have a chance to
turn around in the industry.

588
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,079
And then purchase us at a lower price.

589
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,119
Mr. Jiang,

590
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,400
don't just say it.

591
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,239
Where is the evidence?

592
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:18,520
Ready.

593
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

594
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:26,479
this is the evidence we found
from the hired company.

595
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,470
<i>You'll see the effect tomorrow morning.</i>

596
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,680
From the records, we can clearly see that

597
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,239
someone hired some netizens to do register

598
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:35,119
and then leak the information.

599
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,640
To blacken our company.

600
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,040
This is only part of the evidence.

601
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:42,199
I think all of you here
don't have much time to waste here.

602
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,319
I won't tell you in details.

603
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,920
But if you have time and patience,

604
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,400
I can request,

605
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,079
right here,

606
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,439
to make an attack on our security systems.

607
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,560
Yes, we can win. Go ahead.

608
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,280
I think...

609
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:04,280
How about...

610
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,199
Mr. Xu's team? Please.

611
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,040
Do it.

612
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,060
Don't worry.

613
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,679
Ladies and gentlemen,

614
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,439
Heng Xia

615
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,360
is an ordinary

616
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:59,719
but unyielding young group.

617
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,080
We don't have a backer.

618
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,120
We don't have the capital.

619
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,600
What we all have

620
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,199
are the pure passion for the industry

621
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:11,120
and our most professional technology.

622
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,639
About the queries and slanders
from the outside world,

623
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:16,320
I don't want to say too much here.

624
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,520
But if in the future,

625
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,600
if someone uses this stupid,

626
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,639
dirty,

627
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,040
and immoral way to discredit our company,

628
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,560
I can only say that
we will not let you go.

629
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,520
Because we have the ability and confidence

630
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,560
to prove our innocence

631
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,879
and safeguard the interests
of our company.

632
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,959
We will make
all the evidence public later.

633
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,360
This thing...

634
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,800
I'm leaving.

635
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,439
We will be all over it.

636
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,479
I only hope

637
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Heng Xia and I

638
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,639
can be recognized by everyone again.

She didn't answer my call.
What is wrong?

if you keep being so dull,

00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,030

my sister made a deal with my aunt.
