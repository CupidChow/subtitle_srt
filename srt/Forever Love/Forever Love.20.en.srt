00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,400
Dad, what are you doing?
Why cross your legs?

21
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,279
Be serious.

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,399
Your name?

23
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't you just know it?

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
I didn't ask you.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,199
Jiang Zheng Han.

26
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,080
Gender?

27
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,080
What?

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,759
Dad,

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,679
should we go to see an eye doctor?

30
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,440
The interrogation goes like this
in those detective dramas.

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,520
Should be… male.

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,919
Okay.

33
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,119
Zodiac sign?

34
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,479
-He was born in the year of rat.
-Okay.

35

Xia Lin Xi.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,600
I am interrogating him.

37
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,759
Uncle, I was born in the year of rat.

38
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,080
Lin Xi, it's okay.

39
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,039
Keep asking, uncle.

40
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,080
Star sign?

41
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:57,919
Scorpio.

42
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,759
And rising sign?

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,559
I really don't know that, uncle.

44
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,800
Dad, why did you ask for such details?

45
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,520
Tell me
how many girlfriends you've had.

46
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,279
Lin Xi is my first girlfriend

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,960
and also the last one.

48
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,800
Be serious.

49
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,039
Keep going.

50
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:42,199
Which college you are in? What major?

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,199
I major in computer
in Jing Hua University.

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
Fixes the computer in Jing Hua University?

53
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,000
Not that, he studies programming.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,039
What is that?

55
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:06,360
Uncle, you play chess, right?

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,759
You got sharp eyes.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
Yes, I do. So what?

58
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,119
The chess is actually

59
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,520
one kind of computer languages.

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,720
By researching a kind of
established language

61
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,839
to figure out the movement of the pieces.

62
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,519
Then it will get different results.

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,679
They are essentially the same.

64
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,359
I got it.

65
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,480
I see.

66
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,359
Did you really get it?

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
I've figured it out.

68
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,000
Really?

69
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:38,959
Yes.

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,480
You know how to play chess?

71
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:43,839
Yes,

72
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640

If I purposely let uncle win,

82
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,040
it will make me look
hypocritical and worthless.

What do you think, uncle?

84
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,640
Is your dad that kind of person?

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,160
Even if I lose, I also wanna

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,239
Well done, Jiang.

90
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,200
Thank you, uncle.

91
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,279
I like those honest kids.

92
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:06,799
Uncle,

93
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
when you were playing the chess,

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
you could both attack and defend,

95
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,600
and dared to sacrifice to get the king,
quite like a composed general.

96
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,679
I just

97
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,519
won by a hair.

98
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,160
Well done.

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880

101
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,760
Where do you live?

102
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,600
No. 21 Dongning Street, Old Town.

103
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,600
It'll be a great hurdle to
make your mom say yes.

104
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,440
My mom cannot control me
for my whole life.

105
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:45,640
Uncle,

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,880
I am confident that aunt will accept me.

107
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,920
I did

108
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,959
go astray before,

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,600
and didn't focus on learning.

110
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,959
Also, I did something bad.

111
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,880
But after I met Xiao Xi,

112
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,519
I sincerely repent.

113
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,760
I also know

114
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,519
getting into Jing Hua University
is far from enough.

115
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,279
I will keep going.

116
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,200
And make you believe that
Xiao Xi made a correct decision to choose me.

117
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,200
I hope

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,359
uncle and aunt can give me another chance.

119
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,079
I understand that.

120
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
But her mother

121
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,160
is not a reasonable person.

122
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,959
You still got a long way to go.

123
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,399
Good luck, kid.

124
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,920
Thank you, uncle.

125
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,239
It's getting late, uncle, I might go now.

Tomorrow I will
pay New Year's greetings to relatives.

Yeah, it's rather late.

128

I won't keep you.

129

00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,640
I have arrived at the airport.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,960
I'll be home early tomorrow morning.

175
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
You failed your exam?

176
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:44,960
Dad,

177
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,479
this time,

178
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,799
I'm over.

179
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
No, no, don't...

180
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,679
Don't worry.

181
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,280
Even a vicious tiger
will not eat its cubs, relax.

182
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
Chen Yi Chuan.

183
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,559
This big mouth!

184
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,039
He is dead meat!

185
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,719
Hi, Professor Shi.

186
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,719
Happy New Year.

187
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,479
Happy New Year, Jiang.

188
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Jiang,

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,320
about the internship in XV,

190
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,679
they contacted me.

191
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,559
They are badly in need of hands.

192
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,880
They want you to report
on the seventh day of the lunar year.

193
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,200
The seventh day?

194
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,719
I just called you back
right after you got home,

195
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,799
and you don't wanna leave your family, right?

196
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,679
Do you want me to tell XV...

197
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,200
No, it's okay, professor.

198
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,479
I can go.

199
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,400
Okay, it's deal then.

200
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,080
Alright?

201
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:45,599
Okay.

202
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,359
Great.

203
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,320
Bye.

204
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,159
Okay, bye.

205
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,400
You're back.

206
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,000
Where is your baby girl?

207
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,000
It's Spring Festival,
just forget it, okay?

208
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,159
Mom, I am wrong.

209
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,880
Okay.

210
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,640
Then you should explain

211
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,880
why you would fail your exam?

212
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:23,320
Why were you so impolite
when we had dinner with Qin Yue's family?

213
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,039
Why you're no longer

214
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,200
the good daughter I taught
after going to college?

215
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,000
You are in a relationship, right?

216
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,400
With Jiang Zheng Han?

217
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,000
Who told you that?

218
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,719
You don't need to care about that.

219
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,479
Break up with him right now!

220
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,280
I think we can't be
that arbitrary on this issue.

221
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,919
You failed your exam
just because you were with him!

222
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,159
It has nothing to do with him.

223
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,799
Jiang Zheng Han is very good.

224
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,640
Good?

225
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,080
Is he as good as Qin Yue?

226
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,400
I acted as a go-between for you two.

227
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,080
You just ruined it!

228
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,679
Mom.

229
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm already in college.

230
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,679
I have my own judgment about some things.

231
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,159
You are still young, my girl.

232
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,919
Marriage is not like what you imagined.

233
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,640
It's not about love and romance.

234
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,320
In the end, it is all about

235
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,280
buying a car and buying a house,

236
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
and little nothings of life!

237
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,239
Mom, I don't care about the money.

238
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,159
But I do care.

239
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
You are my daughter.
I cannot watch you suffer.

240
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,320
I can't watch that freeloader
benefit from you!

241
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,320
If you're in love with Qin Yue,

242
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,960
based on his family background,

243
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,359
you won't suffer for the whole life.

244
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,159
Mom,

245
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,000
marriage

246
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,400
is the matter of two people.

247
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,479
Naive!

248
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,520
It is a matter of the two families.

249
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,960
I am not against your dating.

250
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,760
But you should find a decent person.

251
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,520
What's wrong with Qin Yue?

252
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,799
Look at yourself now.

253
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,760
You even failed your exam!

254
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,520
How can I let you study abroad?

255
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,599
How could you go?

256
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,559
Go abroad?

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
When do you want me to go abroad?

258
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,359
Before you arrange me,

259
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,559
can you discuss with me first?

260
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,840
I'm your mother,
do I need to discuss it with you?

261
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,280
And that Jiang Zheng Han.

262
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,200
Do you know where he lives?

263
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,760
Dongning Street.

264
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:39,400
You know?

265
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,479
You're clear
which kind of people live there.

266
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,559
He lied to you
when you were in high school,

267
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,760
still lies to you in college.

268
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,520
This brat...

269
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,200
He won the championship, so what?

270
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,559
Got the internship, so what?

271
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,039
He still works for others!

272
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,719
He doesn't like you.

273
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:56,960
He just wants to take favor of our family!

274
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,559
It can save him 20 years of struggle!

275
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,159
You investigated him?

276
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,599
So what?

277
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,039
Just call him and break up with him!

278
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,880
That's impossible.

279
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,599
Wait! Easy.

280
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,520
Don't do this during the New Year.

281
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,960
Xiao Xi,
don't speak to your mom like that.

282
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,320
Okay, let me say it again.

283
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,520
I would never break up!

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,239
You girl! Listen to me!

285
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,719
You have to stay at home this holiday!

286
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,919
Don't go anywhere, stay at home!

287
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
She is really something now!

288
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,239
How dare she!

289
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,100
<i>The Seventh Day of The Lunar Year</i>

290
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,679
I'm really in Beining.

291
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,440
I'm almost entering the dorm.

292
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,640
You see.

293
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,799
See?

294
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm entering the dorm.

295
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:49,719
Sir,

296
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:50,679
morning.

297
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,359
Morning.

298
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,960
Jiang,

299
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,599
why do you come back so early?

300
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,919
The dorm is still locked.

301
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,039
I already talked to the school about that.

302
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,520
OK, I'll go up and put my luggage.

303
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,599
-That's OK.
-Then...

304
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,719
I'll play chess with you later.

305
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,119
Okay.

306
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,520
<i>Switch To Voice Call
Switch Camera</i>

307
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,280
<i>Hang Up</i>
I'm at the door of my room.

308
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,520
See if anyone is inside.

309
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Nobody.

310
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,359
Your brother's bed, my bed.

311
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,799
I'm so lonely.

312
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,000
Xiao Xi, I'm here right now.

313
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,919
Why did you go back so early?

314
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,479
The internship at XV is ahead of schedule.

315
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,960
I had to come back.

316
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
I see.

317
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,359
Are you sad since you can't see me?

318
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,080
This is fine.

319
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,479
We won't see each other
even if you are in Jiangming.

320
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,039
I was grounded by my mother.

321
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,200
Why?

322
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,000
I failed the exam, it upsets her.

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,239
You didn't lie to me, did you?

324
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,880
That's the real reason?

325
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:03,679
Oh, wait.

326
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,559
I bought something for your parents.

327
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,280
You can tell them.

328
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,479
What did you buy?

329
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,479
Uncle is not well.

330
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,640
So, I bought an electric blanket for him.

331
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,479
Then he can cover his legs.

332
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
The weather in Jiangming
is gloomy and cold.

333
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
I bought a shawl for aunt.

334
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,880
It's quite warm and stylish.

335
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:29,119
Your family like tea, right?

336
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,520
Then I bought a new tea set.

337
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,640
They should be delivered soon.

338
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,359
Remind uncle and aunt

339
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,760
to pick them up.

340
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,239
My girlfriend,

341
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,679
you're so considerate.

342
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,919
After all,

343
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,039
it will be a hard way to go

344
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,039
to get my mother's approval in the future.

345
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,400
Think of it as the sweet comfort
before your hard time.

346
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,640
Xiao Xi,

347
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,239
you can make a table of the places

348
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,080
you want to go to during next holiday.

349
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,359
I will work hard

350
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,640
and prepare everything.

351
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,920
What to prepare?

352
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,959
Prepare to marry you.

353
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,920
Xiao Xi.

354
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,119
When I was looking for something,
I suddenly found this book for you.

355
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,520
My dad is here, I gotta hang up.

356
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,199
OK, go first.

357
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,479
I'm hanging up.

358
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,400
Bye-bye.

359
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,400
Bye.

360
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,480
<i>New Message</i>

361
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,090
<i>Contacts</i>

362
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,100
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>

363
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,140
<i>Hi, uncle, this is Jiang Zheng Han.</i>

364
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,800
Whose message?

365
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,520
New... New Year greetings.

366
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,760
On the seventh day?

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,800
A little bit late.

368
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,959
I am done, I still got some work
to do in the company.

369
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,719
Ask our unfilial daughter to eat.

370
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,520
Why you have to say it like that?

371
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,560
You don't want her to starve,

372
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,800
yet you cold-shoulder her.

373
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,400
Why are you doing this?

374
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,800
How stubborn she is.

375
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,599
She takes after you, doesn't she?

376
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,800
Does she have to
be in love with a poor boy?

377
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,359
Isn't she repeating the same mistakes?

378
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,839
It sucks.

379
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,479
What is the same mistake?

380
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,520
You are not happy with me?

381
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,520
Wait, make it clear!

382
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,280
Hello, are you Jiang Zheng Han?

383
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,640
Hello.

384
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,839
Come with me,
I'll take you to see Mr. Cao.

385
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,479
Okay.

386
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,400
Mr. Cao.

387
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,439
This is the student

388
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,560
from Jing Hua University,
the first place in ACP contest.

389
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,839
He comes to report for duty today.

390
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,760
Hello, Mr. Cao. My name is Jiang Zheng Han.

391
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,560
Jing Hua University? I have an impression.

392
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,400
There is a project evaluation meeting
this afternoon,

393
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,640
you go with me.

394
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,079
After that,

395
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,560
I'll put you on the project team.

396
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,479
Okay.

397
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,319
If there are project materials,

398
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,160
I can

399
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,400
prepare for it.

400
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,359
I just take you to gain experience.

401
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:13,359
What do you plan to prepare as an intern?

402
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,880
Moreover, about the materials,

403
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,800
should you ask me?

404
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,520
Take him to get his badge first.

405
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,479
Unruly.

406
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,640
Boss.

407
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Isn't this an internal meeting?

408
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,760
Why is an intern here?

409
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,040
It's fine to have him in today's meeting.

410
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:04,400
<i>Software Security Development</i>
Is everyone here?

411
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,959
Mr. Xie.

412
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,959
Do you want to say something first?

413
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,439
Since Mr. Xie has nothing to say,

414
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,319
let's start from our side here.

415
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,680
Let's start with

416
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,160
the security software
developed by Mr. Xie.

417
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,680
Did you all read the materials?

418
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,199
Talk about it.

419
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,880
Mr. Xie is quite capable.

420
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,160
We should learn from him.

421
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,719
For me,

422
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,119
I am not qualified.

423
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,359
I haven't seen any bug for the time being.

424
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,119
Anything else?

425
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,359
I...

426
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,400
I think this software

427
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,920
was perfectly designed, no problem at all.

428
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,920
After all, Mr. Xie designed it.

429
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,640
Exactly.

430
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,880
I agree.

431
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,560
Mr. Xie has spent

432
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:57,280
a lot of energy and time on this project.

433
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,719
So, I think,

434
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,880
next step,

435
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,760
let the product dept do the rest work.

436
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,079
In that case,

437
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,439
the meeting is over.

438
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait a second.

439
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,160
Sit down.

440
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,210
<i>Software Security Development</i>

441
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,479
What's your name?

442
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,479
Yes, you.

443
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,000
Jiang Zheng Han.

444
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,079
You are the new intern.

445
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,959
The first place of ACP.

446
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:51,839
Yes.

447
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,280
Tell me about this software.

448
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,479
What can an intern say?

449
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,479
Besides,

450
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,800
he and Mr. Xie are not at the same level.

451
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,280
Mr. Cao.

452
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,719
Can't I discuss work with the intern?

453
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,800
Mr. Xie is asking you.

454
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,119
What are you doing there?

455
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:17,719
Mr. Xie.

456
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:21,520
This is my first day at work,
so I haven't read the material yet.

457
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,199
Here it is.

458
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:24,479
Read now.

459
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,040
<i>Software Security Development</i>

460
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,239
Is this

461
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,400
XV's project?

462
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,719
The project shown in our meeting room

463
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,280
is surely ours.

464
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,040
The software is not yet complete.

465
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,520
What did I just say?

466
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,040
An intern cannot say anything useful.

467
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:11,920
Mr. Xie, it's late.

468
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,000
Let's end the meeting.

469
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,640
Go ahead.

470
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:24,920
This software

471
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,040
<i>Project Achievements Display</i>
lacks the most basic user data collection.

472
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,959
Without this step,

473
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,359
the biggest risk after the program is run

474
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,479
is the possibility of information leakage.

475
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,760
I have to say

476
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,000
this software is not done at all.

477
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,680
Its technical flaws are very obvious.

478
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,880
Why did you say so?

479
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,199
I think this software may

480
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:47,119
pass the preliminary test now,

481
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,280
but it still needs
more software package upgrades.

482
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,319
Also needs more testing.

483
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,680
Jiang Zheng Han, right?

484
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,280
Yes.

485
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,959
How many programming languages
do you know?

486
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,640
What operating system
are you familiar with?

487
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,839
I have written Java interpreter,

488
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,839
simulated script engine,

489
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,199
written 3D games
with open graphics library,

490
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,079
done some data analysis as well.

491
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,680
All done by yourself?

492
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,640
Partly.

493
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,000
I drew on open source code
to get the result.

494
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,839
You are a star user of GitHub?

495
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:20,400
Yes.

496
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Ninety stars.

497
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,640
I won't say much about other things.

498
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,280
A project meeting of our company.

499
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,520
I hope everyone can speak out freely.

500
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,800
Let's discuss together.

501
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,040
Talk more about the project.

502
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,599
About those useless holiday words,

503
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:42,079
you'd better not say it at the meeting.

504
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,719
Am I right, Mr. Cao?

505
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,119
Yes, Mr. Xie is right.

506
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,119
Look at yourselves.

507
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,719
You don't look like
regular employees at all.

508
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,040
Yes, Mr. Cao.

509
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,640
The youngest subordinate of yours
has been here for three years,

510
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,400
but still not as good as an intern.

511
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:18,760
Since Mr. Xie likes this intern so much,

512
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,800
then he'll be under your supervision.

513
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,160
Work hard with Mr. Xie from now on.

514
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,439
Sure.

515
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,479
Dismiss.

516
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,800
Talent Jiang, we meet again.

517
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,719
Why you are here?

518
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,520
I told you before

519
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,119
my dad sent me here to work.

520
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:09,719
When you participated in the ACP contest,

521
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,800
I have already been here.

522
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,040
Now we are colleagues.

523
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:15,319
This is an unexpected surprise for me.

524
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,800
I'm not a regular employee now.

525
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:21,000
Don't flatter me, Mr. Xu.

526
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,839
Well,

527
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,000
programmers are everywhere.

528
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,599
But not many talents like you.

529
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,359
Hey,

530
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,199
my previous advice
is always valid for you.

531
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,880
Consider it carefully.

532
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,599
Come to my company.

533
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,680
I will pay you as a regular employee.

534
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,199
I'm sorry.

535
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,719
I am not qualified yet.

536
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,800
Maybe there would be
a chance in the future.

537
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,760
Mr. Xie.

538
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,760
Based on the project materials
your secretary gave me,

539
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,920
I made a simple structure.
Please take a look.

540
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,479
Do you drive?

541
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,359
I don't drive.

542
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,560
So, you don't even know

543
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,599
the interaction between
in-vehicle intelligence and physical driving

544
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,760
can be widely used in what scenarios.

545
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,959
There are many ports in this program

546
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,640
that can be attacked easily.

547
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,880
Your design concept

548
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,040
only explains the intelligent interaction
between the car and people.

549
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,319
But how to deal with complex issues,

550
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,199
and protect information security?

551
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,000
You barely analyzed it.

552
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,239
The software we develop is
to provide comprehensive protection

553
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,119
for cloud services,

554
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,160
communication,

555
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,000
vehicle terminal and control system.

556
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,760
Do you understand that?

557
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,359
Okay.

558
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,119
But you are still young.

559
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,000
It's normal to lack experience.

560
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,400
I know, thank you.

561
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,640
Thank you for correcting me,
I'll go modify it.

562
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,680
The software security issue

563
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,319
you talked at the meeting,

564
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,000
how did you find it?

565
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,479
I did a similar project.

566
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,640
Just guessed by experience.

567
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,439
I think the maturity of the software

568
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,920
is only about 30% now.

569
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,760
In other words,
a slightly experienced hacker

570
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,719
can hack into the backstage
within half an hour,

571
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,439
and retrieve all users' data.

572
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,280
OK, show me.

573
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,359
Okay.

574
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,479
Mr. Xie, we...

575
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,560
If there is nothing else, I'm leaving.

576
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,439
Mr. Xie, we...

577
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,640
Postpone the meeting for half an hour.

578
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,199
Ask Zheng to see me here,

579
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
what the hell is this?

580
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,560
A college student just

581
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,000
hacked in half an hour.

582
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,520
Go!

583
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,959
Got it.

584
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,439
Jiang Zheng Han, how is your internship?

585
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,400
Jiang Zheng Han,

586
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,640
I'm asking you.

587
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,040
Pretty good.

588
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,520
How about the first day of the internship?

589
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,319
Pretty good.

590
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,599
It's strange.

591
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,839
Is the network on your side lagging
or my side?

592
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,560
I always feel that the signal is not good.

593
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,760
Yes.

594
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,920
Maybe the signal is not good right now.

595
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,359
Didn't you go back to the dorm?

596
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,239
Back to dorm?

597
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,479
It's 16 kilometers, how can I go back?

598
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:28,119
I'll probably be at my dorm past eleven
if I go back now.

599
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,359
Then...

600
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,680
You are going to stay overnight
at the company?

601
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,040
Alright.

602
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,280
Go to bed first.

603
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,439
Okay.

604
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,640
Then I won't bother you.

605
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:46,599
Wait.

606
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,880
What are you doing?

607
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:58,800
Recharge.

608
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,839
Good night.

609
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,680
<i>Zhishu Bu Dali</i>
I paid you all the money.

610
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,000

I'm sorry.

Refund.

631
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,439
Pearl became yellow, leaves withered.

632

636

Uncle, you described an ordinary breakfast

637
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:06,880
in such vivid language

638
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:10,560
to express your respect
and helplessness to aunt.

639
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,399
Good poem.

640
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,239
That Xu Zhi Li left a lot of mess.

641
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,760
Xie will be pretty busy this time.

642
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,159
The company always urges.

643
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:31,040
Otherwise, maybe we can catch up
staying up for days.

644
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,879
You are too naive.

645
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,520
I heard that the program integration
is quite complicated this time.

646
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,479
If someone helps him,

647
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,239
maybe he can catch up.

648
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Come in.

649
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,679
Mr. Xie, are you busy?

650
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,000
What's up?

651
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:34,520
I finished the project you gave me.

652
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:37,000
I made some optimization overall.

653
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,479
I will send you an email later.

654
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:39,760
Please have a look at the details.

655
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,360
So fast?

656
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,479
Did you just make short shrift of it?

657
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,399
Please have a look, you will know.

658
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,719
OK, you can go.

659
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,639
Alright.

660
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,120
Mr. Xie.

661
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:03,520
Is there a difficult project?

662
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,919
Can I help?

663
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Just those company projects.

664
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,639
Come and take a look.

665
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,600
Okay.

666
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:33,080
Never mind,
this is really difficult for you.

667
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,040
Look,

668
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,159
like this.

669
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,439
Will it be better?

670
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,800
Go get your laptop here.

671
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Go.

672
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,439
Okay.

673
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,919
You deal with problems clearly.

674
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,520
Skilled in programming.

675
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,439
Jiang Zheng Han.

676
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,959
Are you really a freshman?

677
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,560
Shouldn't you be

678
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,399
a technical spy from another company?

679
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,159
A spy?

680
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,760
You really think highly of me.

681
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,639
But you are definitely not a novice.

682
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,679
I started programming in high school.

683
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:27,959
So early.

684
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:29,840
Why?

685
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,959
Something happened to my family.

686
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:36,959
I needed money.

687
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:39,879
What happened?

688
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,239
My father's factory

689
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,080
had an accident.

690
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:53,040
My father is the manager.

691
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,239
He had to compensate many workers' family.

692
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,959
But his feet got hurt too.

693
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,919
I finally got enough money
to pay for his operation

694
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:04,679
until I got in university.

695
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:09,800
That's great.

696
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,199
Great?

697
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,760
Yeah.

698
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,199
The one bearing the burden is stronger.

699
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,560
What?

700
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,560
When I was at your age,

701
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,959
someone told me that

702
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,679
the heavier the burden,

703
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:29,800
the deeper the footsteps.

704
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,560
So, you mean

705
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,280
you had the same experience?

706
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:43,719
People have to be responsible for their lives,

707
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,600
sooner or later,

708
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,320
actively or passively.

709
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,239
Most people live their whole lives

710
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,040
all feeling they have no chance
to carry out their ideas,

711
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:55,600
and can't achieve their goals.

712
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,879
And then they start to

713
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,760
be cynical.

714
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:05,719
Fortunately,
we both take the burden actively.

715
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,560
Let me tell you.

716
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,199
I once washed 149 dishes

717
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,120
in a restaurant for four consecutive hours,

718
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,520
setting a record for that month.

719
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,000
Was I great?

720
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,199
If so,

721
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,360
although you make a lot money,

722
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,919
you also don't need
a dishwasher in your home.

723
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,239
I can't tell that you are pretty humorous.

724
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:35,959
Are you hungry?

725
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:37,479
Let's go eat some food.

726
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm not hungry.

727
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,040
I'm hungry if the company pays.

728
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,199
Sure.

729
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,040
This is a working meal.

730
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:49,399
It's on me.

731
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:50,639
Let's go.

732
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,919
But,

733
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,520
how much debt do you still owe?

734
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:58,600
All paid.

735
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,840
Then, why you are still penny-pinching?

736
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,120
I have a girlfriend.

737
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,360
I need to make money to keep her.

738
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,959
Are you young people
like that in a relationship?

739
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,560
What kind of girlfriend do you have?
Needs your support?

740
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:15,159
My girlfriend doesn't need me to support.

741
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:16,959
Her family is very rich.

742
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,520
But,

743
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,800
she understands me and supports me.

744
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,239
That's enough.

745
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,520
It's called...

746
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,080
Display of affection, right?

747
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,760
By the way,

748
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,879
do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Xie?

749
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:38,520
No, I don't.

750
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,239
Oh.

751
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,760
I don't have that much time.

752
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,479
No need to explain, I understand.

753
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,280
Don't show off in front of me.

754
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,520
Do you know what it is called?

755
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:52,800
It's called college love.

756
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,040
What's wrong?

757
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,679
You would break up after graduation.

758
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,439
You are a man.

759
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,919
Can it support your life?

760
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,760
Let me tell you.

761
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,840
I think it can indeed.

762
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,159
I used to work for my family.

763
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:09,080
Right now,

764
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,439
she is my motivation to work hard

765
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:13,199
to create miracles.

766
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,959
You, as my immediate boss,

767
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,760
should support my relationship.

768
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:20,560
Then I can create more value.

769
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,639
Alright, alright.

770
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:24,360
If I talk about relationship with you
in the future,

771
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,600
you just treat me as dumb.

772
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,280
I am hungry and want to eat.

773
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:27,919
Okay.

774
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,159
I don't wanna hear your love story.

775
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:30,159
Please.

776
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:47,183
