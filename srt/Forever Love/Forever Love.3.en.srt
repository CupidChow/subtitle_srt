Come one, sister Xia.

28
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,480
No, sister-in-law.

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,080
I think

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,040
bro Zheng must really want to know

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,440
what your first impression of him was.

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,120
- Right?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,000
- Sister Xia, you have to give us something.
- Tell us.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,080
-Come on, tell them!
- Yeah!

35
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,480
Say it!

Jiang Zheng Han,

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,000
my first impression
of him was a bit complicated.

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,800
A conman.

39
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,910
Good.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,000
A lazy student.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,830
- Yes, yes!
- Good!

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,270
Stingy.

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,910

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,520
What are you doing here?

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,270
Why are you following me?

47
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,360
This is my way home,
can't I walk this way?

48
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,600
Oh, what a coincidence.

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,080
Bye!

50
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,830
Hey.

51
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,080
Do you have any sympathy?

52
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,880
Move aside.

53
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,160
Move aside.

54
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,910
What?

55
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,110
Wipe your face.

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,270
I fixed your bike.

57
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,320
You still call me an idiot?

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,000
You're the smartest person I've ever met.

59
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,720
For fixing your bike,

60
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,320
and for the paper towels, too,

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,390
the total cost is

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
15 yuan 2 jiao.

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,040
Pay me.

64
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,390
Is there only the word "money"
in your brain?

65
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,880
You even count 2 jiao?

66
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,110
Missy.

67
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,830
There is no free meal in the world.

68
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,000
Fine.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,670
Then, give me your uniform fee first.

70
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,230
Then I will pay you right away.

71
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,160
What are you doing?

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,110
Going home, of course.

73
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,000
- Bye-bye.
- You can't go.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,070
Hey, give me the money for the uniform.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,160
Stop right there.

76
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,070
Hey, hey.

77
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,000
Can you stop following me?

78
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,790
Give me the money, then
I will turn around and leave immediately.

79
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,350
If I ever look at you again,
then I'm the loser.

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,390
I don't have any.

81
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,920
Bro Zheng is here.

82
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,000
- Bro Zheng.
- Bro Zheng.

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
What is it with that girl?

84
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,640
Isn't that...

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,790
That one...

86
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,720
You don't even know this?

87
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
It's definitely because bro Zheng
is too handsome that day,

88
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:43,790
so she is head over heels for him.

89
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,760
Shut up.

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,790
- Focus on your games.
- There's definitely something.

91
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,920
What?

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,480
You're not allowed.

93
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,880
You followed me here.

94
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,350
Such a persistent girl.

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,110
What?

96
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,480
What do you want?

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,350
OK, hurry up and leave.

98
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,600
It's 7 PM.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,270
You're such a stalker.

100
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,950
Want some snacks?

101
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,200
Here you go, good girl!

102
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,270
What did you just say?

103
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,600
Nothing.

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,720
Do you think I'm a puppy?

105
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,070
Jiang Zheng Han, let me tell you.

106
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,390
Don't think you can fool me.

107
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,790
I'm just here for the money.

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,070
Your uniform fee.

109
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,830
I have snacks,

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
but money,

111
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,790
I really don't.

112
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,480
You have to give it to me today.

113
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm warning you.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,510
If you don't pay me,

115
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,070
I'll call your family.

116
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,670
I have all parents'
contact information anyway.

117
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,270
I'm calling them for real.

118
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,640
Jiang Zheng Han's parents.

119
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,880
I will give you the money.

120
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,760
Don't call them.

121
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,670
But I really have
no cash on me right now.

122
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,350
- Wait until tomorrow.
- You can transfer through WeChat.

123
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,720
I saw you did that once.

124
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,480
OK, I will come right away.

125
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
Transfer me.

126
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,270
Boss, can I leave for today?

127
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,760
Sending money again, right?

128
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,110
Go.

129
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,520
Jiang Zheng Han.

130
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,760
Scan the code.

131
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,400
- Stop following me.
- Hey.

132
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,840
Grandma, this is for you.

133
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,470
Xiao Jiang, you can't keep doing this.

134
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,440
You give us money every month.

135
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,080
We can't just take it.

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,590
This is...

137
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,640
My dad asked me to give it to you.

138
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,670
Please accept it.

<i>Jing Hua University Enrollment Guide</i>

140
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,400
- Teacher Zhao.
- Yes.

141
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,030
This is Jiang Zheng Han's
school uniform fee.

142
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
With a class monitor like you,

143
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,320
I don't need to worry about a thing.

144
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,590
It's my duty.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,280
If there's nothing else,
then I will leave now.

146
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,590
Uh,

147
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,840
tomorrow, someone from the
Ministry of Education will come.

148
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,640
It's very important to our school,

149
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,400
so you must keep an eye
on the class discipline,

150
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
don't let anyone affect our rating.

151
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,710
I understand.

152
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,520
OK, you can leave.

153
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:11,910
OK.

Xiao Xi.

155
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,400
I failed Chemistry again.

156
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,520
I got almost all
the experiment questions wrong.

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,960
I wrote the equations in reverse.

158
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,320
You give us money every month.

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,280
This is...

161
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,960
My dad asked me to
give it to you. Please accept it.

162
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,350
- Xiao Xi.
- Huh?

163
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,230
What did you say?

164
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,150
I asked,

165
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,960
do you think science is not my thing?

166
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,710
If I say no, then can you
transfer to a Liberal Arts class?

167
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,000
At this point, how can I
even request a transfer anymore?

168
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,840
Then why do you even ask me now?

169
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
I can't stand it.

170
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,470
I work so hard

171
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,280
just to get into
a good university just like you.

172
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,960
Then keep working hard.

173
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,400
Aren't you so good at Chinese
because of your hard work?

174
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,470
Xiao Man.

175
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,840
Don't give up.

176
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,110
You guys,

177
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,710
look at bro Zheng.

178
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,790
Bro Zheng works hard every day,

179
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,080
he's always serious.

180
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,840
He uses all ink in the barrel every day.

181
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,520
Never stop working.

182
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,280
Yet,

183
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,280
he is still the dead-last

184
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,550
in our class.

185
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,150
He gets criticized,

186
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,840
gets punished by standing every day.

187
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,150
He is the typical "hard work doesn't pay off"
person in our class.

188
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,760
Bro Zheng must be bitter, too.

189
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,400
But still,

190
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,350
he never gives up.

191
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,590
Then we can't give up either, right?

192
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,030
Zhang, you're right.

193
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,760
Sometimes you are pretty smart.

194
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,030
Thanks to bro Zheng,

195
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,080
I'm not the dead-last.

196
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,350
Xiao Man, take this.

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,590
Come back to your seat.

198
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,440
Yes, teacher.

199
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,030
Yes.

200
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,760
My dad always looks so scary.

201
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,200
Look at that murderous look.

202
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,320
He is going to say,

203
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,230
"You are the worst class
that I have ever taught."

204
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,400
You are the worst class
that I have ever taught.

205
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,960
Our school, Jiang Ming No.1 School, is the

206
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,640
top high school in our province.

207
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,910
You are also the gifted class
in the top school.

208
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,280
To be in this class,

209
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,030
do you know
how big of an honor it is?

210
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,590
Do you know how many people have failed?

211
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,840
And then, in just a small weekly exam,

212
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,880
you only got third place.

213
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,520
Are you kidding me?

214
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,080
My dad is always like that,
this has nothing to do with us.

215
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,840
There are 7 science classes in our grade.

216
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,590
He even said we were kidding him.

217
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,790
How dare we do that?

218
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,320
- More like he's kidding us.
- Zhang Huai Wu.

219
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,030
Aren't you embarrassed? Stand up.

220
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Don't you know
there are only 3 gifted classes?

221
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,150
That means this class is the worst class.

222
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,320
Look at that.

223
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
How many days are left before
the College Entrance Examination?

224
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,030
Work hard, no distraction.

225
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,910
Wipe away that half-dead look.

226
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,840
Stand up, say it with me.

227
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,080
Work hard, no distraction.

228
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,760
Louder, put more energy into it.

229
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,520
Work hard, no distraction.

230
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,760
That's the spirit.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,710
Xia Lin Xi, from now on, every day,

232
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,670
tell the class to
repeat this sentence, understood?

233
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,550
Yes, teacher.

234
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Sit down.

235
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,110
Jiang Zheng Han.

236
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey, hey.

237
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,840
Stand up.

238
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,760
I take you to swim in
the ocean of knowledge every day.

239
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,790
We will reach the shore soon,

240
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,960
but when we look back,
we see someone swimming backward.

241
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:31,840
You understand?

242
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,710
You are that person.

243
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,030
What now?

244
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,110
Do you want to drown?

245
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,760
Do not laugh.

246
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,710
Let me see what you are writing.

247
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,400
Move.

248
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,440
Is this the time to
read this kind of book?

249
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,550
Look at your scores, do you
want to take the exam or not?

250
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,640
An 18-year-old boy,

251
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,670
all muscles and no brains,

252
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,520
what can you do when you grow up?

253
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,320
Being handsome is enough?

254
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,960
Then let me find you some pants
so you can be a model, yeah?

255
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,840
Look at Xia Lin Xi.

256
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,080
Look.

257
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,550
She sits in front of you.

258
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,880
She is in 1st place in Chinese.

259
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,550
I don't understand.

260
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,200
You are in the same class,

261
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,670
listen to the same teacher,

262
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,840
how did you do it?

263
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,910
Why there's such a big gap?

264
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,230
I confiscate this book.

265
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,280
Teacher, I won't read it in class anymore.

266
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,110
It's your last year,
there's no more break.

267
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,200
from now on, you
can't read this book anymore.

268
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,670
Xia Lin Xi, you
hold on to this book.

269
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,110
Everyone, class is about to start.

270
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,080
Can you tone down your arrogance

271
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,520
at school, please?

272
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,320
Teacher Zhang asked me
to take you back.

273
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,150
Let's go.

274
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,790
Return my book.

275
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,350
It's your last year already, and you are still reading
these nonsensical books.

276
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,640
You sure are idle.

277
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,670
You can't even understand the content,

278
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,440
how can you call it nonsensical?

279
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,080
Do you think I can't
understand this book?

280
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,350
Ah, you're Duo Duo's mom.

281
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Now?

282
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,520
OK, I will be there soon.

283
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,030
Give it back.

284
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,760
Where are you going?
Teacher Zhang is looking for you.

285
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,230
Do not give it to the teacher.

286
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,520
Xiao Xi, let's have pizza.

287
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,640
I heard that there's a new
claw machine next to it.

288
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,520
I have something to do.
I'll go first.

289
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,400
Hey.

290
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,400
What? You didn't say anything before.

291
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,520
Duo Duo.

292
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,430
Big brother Jiang.

293
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,470
Duo Duo.

294
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,070
What are you doing?

295
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
I'm waiting for you.

296
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,070
Waiting for me? Such a good girl.

297
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,950
- Duo Duo.
- Yes?

298
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,350
- Are you happy today?
- I'm happy.

299
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,110
Big brother, have a candy.

300
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,800
I don't like candy.

301
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,070
I might get tooth decay.

302
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,000
You too, eat fewer candies, OK?

303
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,920
What is this?

304
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,400
It's a bunny.

305
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,070
- Isn't it cute?
- It is.

306
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,280
- But not as cute as Duo Duo.
- Xiao Jiang, you're here.

307
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,430
- Miss.
- Hi.

308
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,830
Please play with her
for a while, I need to go inside.

309
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,760
- OK.
- Duo Duo, be good.

310
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,070
Who is that sister?

311
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,190
Your classmate?

312
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,350
Didn't I tell you?

313
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,920
Stop following me.

314
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,950
Here.

315
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,520
Xiao Jiang, don't just stand there.

316
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,760
Come inside, eat with us.

317
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:14,830
OK.

318
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,800
This book,

319
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,830
was it from when
you were in the IT team?

320
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,950
Yeah.

321
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,280
How do you know?

322
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,950
I don't know how
you can understand this.

323
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,070
Fourier Transform.

324
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,040
Dynamic.

325
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,430
Dynamic programming.

326
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,830
These aren't in the College Entrance examination.

327
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,640
So what?

328
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,230
Because it's not in there,

329
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,040
so we won't ever use it in the future?

330
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,590
So why did you quit the team?

331
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,880
Please have some drinks.

332
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,040
- Thank you, Duo Duo.
- Thank you.

333
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,280
Thank you, Duo Duo.

334
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,190
Come here, Duo Duo.

335
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,350
What did you learn in kindergarten today?

336
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,640
Duo Duo.

337
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,710
Did you make new friends today?

338
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,160
Hm?

339
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,710
Sister, you are really pretty.

340
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,950
Thank you, Duo Duo.

341
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,520
You are really cute, too.

342
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,040
OK.

343
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,800
Duo Duo, sit here with sister, OK?

344
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,590
I will go to help your mom.

345
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,830
OK.

346
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Sister, are you brother Jiang's classmate?

347
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,520
Why are your uniforms different?

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,880
Hmmm.

349
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,520
Duo Duo.

350
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,760
I will go over there to help him.

351
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,470
Can you

352
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,070
sit here by yourself?

353
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,830
I already told you, I can do it myself.

354
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,430
Miss, just let me help.

355
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,680
In the future,

356
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,230
I won't be able to help
even if you need me.

357
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,880
Why not?

358
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,350
If you want to come over,

359
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,310
you're always welcomed.

360
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,520
You're Lin Xi, right? Come here.

361
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,920
OK, auntie.

362
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,160
Can I help?

363
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,040
Just sit there,
that will help me a lot.

364
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,560
Who said I can't help you?

365
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,680
That's right.

366
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,880
Just sit there.

367
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,040
Have some tea,
dinner will be ready soon.

368
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,760
Mom, when are we going to eat?
Duo Duo is hungry.

369
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,680
Aw, you hungry kitten.

370
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,110
Duo Duo, we're almost done,
go sit over there.

371
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,640
Come on, let's wait for them inside.

372
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,800
Xiao Xi, make yourself at home.

373
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,280
Try this.

374
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,400
Thank you, auntie.

375
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,590
Thank you.

376
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,280
Xiao Xi, you don't like shrimps?

377
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,350
I don't really like things with shells.

378
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,000
Sister is just like me,
you can't peel the shells.

379
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,640
Duo Duo, eat that.

380
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,160
I peeled some for Duo Duo,

381
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
you can eat this first.

382
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,680
Whoa, brother is so good.

383
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,640
You do it better than mom.

384
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,350
Be patient, Duo Duo.

385
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,880
Now I will peel some for you.

386
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,680
- Is it good?
- Uhm.

387
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,640
It's really tasty.

388
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,800
Xiao Jiang made it.

389
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,430
Here, Duo Duo.

390
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,430
Thank you, brother Jiang.

391
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,560
Eat up.

392
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
Here.

393
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,800
Thank you, auntie.

394
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,230
Sorry for asking you to help
the first time you come here.

395
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,590
It's alright.

396
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,880
I want to do it, because
I don't know what else I can do.

397
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,950
It's the first time Xiao Jiang
has ever brought a classmate here.

398
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,590
When you came, I suddenly remembered

399
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,680
he was a high school student.

400
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,710
He really doesn't look like a student.

401
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,400
Since things happened in his family,

402
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,680
- I haven't seen him laugh.
- Put on a sweater.

403
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,280
Don't catch a cold.

404
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,470
Big brother, can we make paper crafts?

405
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,230
What happened to his family?

406
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,680
His father used to be
the director of our factory.

407
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,190
They lived quite comfortably.

408
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,230
Then, a worker made a mistake

409
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,230
and burned down the factory.

410
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,830
That worker died,
and many others were injured.

411
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,800
Chief Jiang's leg

412
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,680
was also injured.

413
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,880
But his father was very responsible.

414
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,950
Although, because of this, his family

415
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,920
was bankrupted and fell into debt,

416
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,680
he kept saying he still had money

417
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,400
and took all of his savings

418
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,040
to help the injured employees.

419
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,070
Xiao Jiang is also too nice.

420
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,800
This has nothing to do with him,

421
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,000
but he told us

422
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,680
we were the uncles and aunts
who watched him grow up together.

423
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,590
He can't bear to watch us suffer.

424
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,400
It's all ancient history.

425
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,190
Tomorrow,

426
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,680
I'm taking Duo Duo
to her grandma in Chengdu.

427
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,230
So I called Xiao Jiang over

428
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,800
to have a farewell dinner.

429
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,190
You are leaving?

430
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,430
All these years, Xiao Jiang and
his family have been helping us.

431
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,560
I don't want to be
a burden to them anymore.

432
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,640
Let's see what the second step is.

433
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,760
Glue.

434
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,880
I will be leaving now.

435
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,950
Duo Duo, big brother is going home.

436
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,280
Big brother, when I get to
grandma's house,

437
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,430
no one will play with me as you do.

438
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,560
No way.

439
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,680
You are so cute.

440
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,560
Everyone will like you.

441
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,230
They will play with you.

442
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,590
Will you miss me
if you stay here alone?

443
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,760
Duo Duo.

444
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,040
Can you give me this bunny?

445
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,950
Then whenever I look at this bunny,

446
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,920
I will think of Duo Duo.

447
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,470
Then what do I have to think of you?

448
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,680
Look.

449
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,230
I stamped myself on your hand.

450
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,880
So every time you look at your hand,

451
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,880
-you will think of big brother, OK?
-OK.

452
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,230
So,

453
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,190
you have been helping Duo Duo's family

454
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,640
and that old woman from yesterday, right?

455
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,710
Xia Lin Xi.

456
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,800
Can you just be like all other students,

457
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,350
study hard,

458
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,920
listen to others,

459
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,520
take care of your own business,

460
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,000
stop following me around, can't you?

461
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,800
Do you think I want to do this?

462
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,110
If it wasn't for you
skipping class to go to work,

463
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,830
not paying the uniform fee,
pretending to be my tutor,

464
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,350
causing me so much trouble,

465
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,920
I wouldn't even glance at you.

466
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,190
Today, I couldn't study and do my homework

467
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,760
because I needed to return your book.

468
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,350
How can you be angry at me?

469
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,160
Hey, don't you know

470
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,950
beating others is illegal?

471
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,830
Return my book.

472
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,800
It's your last year already, and you are
still reading these nonsensical books.

473
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,280
You sure are idle.

474
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,280
You can't even understand the content,

475
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,520
how can you call it nonsensical?

476
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,520
Can you stop following me?

477
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,040
Give me the money, then
I will turn around and leave immediately.

478
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,230
If I ever look at you again,
then I'm the loser.

479
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
I don't have any.

480
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,310
