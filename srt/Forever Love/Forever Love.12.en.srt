Shen Wen Yue?

21
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,400
Why are you here?

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,400
Surprise?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,080
I've been looking for you for a long time.

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,639
I wouldn't have even known
you're studying in Jing Hua University

25
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,319
if Qin Yue hadn't told me two days ago.

26
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:02,519
Come on, we grew up together.

27
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,080
You always left without telling me.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,239
Aren't we friends?

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,800
Not like that.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,039
Qin Yue told you
that I'm in Jing Hua University?

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,919
Yep.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,080
What?

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,839
Isn't this what you wanted most back then?

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,559
Is it cool? Do you like it?

35
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,160
Benelli 752.

36
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,039
Double cylinder 4-stroke.

37
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,919
Really cool.

38
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,839
Let me take you for a ride.

39
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,919
No, thanks,

40
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,440
I still have something to do today.

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,600
I can't ride.

42
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,970
How about

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,080
you give me a ride?

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's go,
just one circle and it won't delay you.

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,119
Okay.

46
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,479
Just a circle.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,399
Hey!

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,119
Brother Zheng

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,119
and my goddess?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,880
What's going on!

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,600
Leader Jiang.

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,440
Member Xia.

53
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,880
Oh my!
You two are not in a relationship yet.

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,000
-And you already have secret nicknames?
-What are you talking about?

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,520
Come on, it's obvious, okay!

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Jiang Zheng Han is worthy to be taught.

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,119
It's really worth it that
I have been helping him.

58
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,520
Anyway, don't talk about this topic

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,119
when we dine later, understand?

60
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,000
Lin Xi.

61
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,160
I don't feel well.

62
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,759
You guys go have lunch first.
I wanna go back to my dorm.

63
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,919
Xiao Xi.

64
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,720
-Jiang...
-It's Jiang Zheng Han, right?

65
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,000
Did you see a girl sitting behind him?

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Why didn't Xia Lin Xi answer my call

67
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,119
or reply my WeChat message?

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,880
Brother Zheng, don't you dine out?

69
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,320
Why are you in the dorm alone?

70
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,119
I should have gone,

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,720
but Xia Lin Xi said she wouldn't come.

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,959
Gu Xiao Man also called me a scumbag.

73
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,239
I even don't know what happened.

74
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,799
I feel a little bit confused.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, it's normal for girls to be emotional.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,320
Anyway, we'll go outing tomorrow.

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,559
You can just coax her.

78
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,920
Outing?

79
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,760
Who said that?

80
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,200
You don't know?

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,119
Professor Shi said in the group

82
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:58,359
that he financed our entire school team

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,440
to go outing

84
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,160
to celebrate the competition

85
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,480
of our computer team.

86
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,760
But he doesn't go with us.

87
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,839
I saw Lin Xi responded in the group

88
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,959
and she should go with us.

89
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,720
Lin Xi, let me get it for you.

90
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,119
Xiao Xi.

91
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,160
-Xiao Man.
-Xiao Chuan.

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,799
Brother Qin Yue.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,399
Gu Xiao Man, why are you here?

94
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,320
I accompany Xiao Xi.

95
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,040
You don't know how to program.
Why did Professor Shi ask you to come?

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,399
We don't go outing for programming, okay?

97
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,559
You really love to show your intelligence.

98
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,440
Xiao Man, let me help you.

99
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,119
No, thanks.

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,799
-Zhuang Fei.
-Sorry.

101
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,880
I'm late.

102
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,880
Well.

103
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,480
Let me introduce her to you guys.

104
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,359
This is Zhuang Fei from the News Dept.

105
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,200
She is also my roommate.

106
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,279
She is responsible for
the interview of our school team.

107
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,519
Okay. Welcome.

108
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,839
Zhuang Fei,

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,760
come sit with me.

110
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,440
Xiao Chuan,

111
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:32,160
I've read all the notes you gave me.

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,799
Your handwriting is so nice.

113
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,000
Of course.

114
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,160
But this is too difficult.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,640
I don't understand
many things in your notes.

116
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,160
What don't you understand?

117
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,480
All, can you help me learn that?

118
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,500
<i>Jing Hua University</i>

119
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,390
<i>Bubble Forest</i>

120
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,480
Wow, there is the sea not far away.

121
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,440
<i>Welcome to Bubble Hotel</i>
It's so romantic.

122
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,760
Let's go.

123
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,959
How is the place?

124
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,440
Lin Xi.

125
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,880
This environment is really good.

126
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,920
Great decoration style.

127
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,239
Senior, you've chosen a good place.

128
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,679
I have to choose carefully for you guys.

129
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,160
Wait a minute, I'll get the room cards.

130
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,559
Okay.

131
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,320
These are your room cards.

132
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you.

133
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,119
Xiao Man, Lin Xi, come here.

134
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,119
Come on, we'll separate the room.

135
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,920
All the rooms are allocated.

136
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
This one.

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,959
Duan Ning, it's yours.

138
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,399
Hey.

139
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,480
Let's put the luggage in the room first.

140
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,920
Remember to bring your room card.

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,679
Okay.

142
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,640
Didn't our whole team come today?
Where's Li Bo?

143
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,839
-I don't know.
-I heard he was sick.

144
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,839
Well, let's have a seat.

145
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,399
Come on.

146
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,440
You guys can sit down first.

147
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,640
Jiang Zheng Han!

148
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,839
Shen, why are you here?

149
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,839
Surprise!

150
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
What are you doing here?

151
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,559
I heard that your school team
is going here for an outing.

152
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,600
So I brought our team here.

153
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,359
That's a coincidence.

154
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,200
No, this is destined.

155
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,760
Zheng, who is this?

156
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,440
Oh.

157
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:16,959
-She is my friend.
-Hello, my name is Shen Wen Yue.

158
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,880
Also Jiang Zheng Han's childhood friend.

159
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,679
I'm one of the school computer team
in Cheng University.

160
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,600
Our two universities
are always on good terms.

161
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:29,079
I remember we formed a team
to compete abroad last time.

162
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,719
Why don't we
organize a sodality this time?

163
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
I think this proposal
is particularly good.

164
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,799
Our universities have good relations.

165
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,400
I remember we were together
during the contest.

166
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,320
Wen Yue, were you always with Zheng Han

167
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,679
during the last contest?

168
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,320
Yes.

169
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,919
Uh...

170
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,520
You're all Zheng's alumni, right?

171
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,840
Well,

172
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,919
I will treat you guys lunch at noon.

173
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:03,599
Great.

174
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,599
OK.

175
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,559
Then I will stand treat at night.

176
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,359
We won't go have lunch at noon.

177
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,599
Xiao Man, let's go back to the room.

178
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,080
-Don't count us in.
-Bye.

179
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,840
Bye-bye.

180
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,440
Lin Xi, why don't you have lunch?

181
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,719
So many people don't go to have the meal.

182
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,719
Zhuang Fei, let's go up too.

183
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,599
We will also go to our room.

184
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,320
See you at the restaurant.

185
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,119
Okay. See you later.

186
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:20,640
Okay.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,280
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

188
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,760
Why didn't you tell me
that you would come here?

189
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,200
Surprise, you know.

190
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Come on. Cheers.

191
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,039
Cheers.

192
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,960
Cheers!

193
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,119
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

194
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,679
Do you know

195
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,679
the finger-folding game?

196
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,400
What's that?

197
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
If you have never done one thing...

198
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,000
Say, whoever doesn't think
I'm handsome, fold one finger.

199
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,559
Xiao Man.

200
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,239
Zheng.

201
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,119
Next, I'm going to
ask you a tough question.

202
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,000
Everyone here,

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,119
who doesn't have the first kiss,

204
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,239
please fold the finger.

205
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,760
Oh, Xiao Man, you can't blame me.

206
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,239
We met too late.

207
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,359
Duan Ning.

208
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,479
Scumbag.

209
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,880
Hurry up, don't lie.

210
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,599
Yeah.

211
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,719
You must tell the truth for this game.

212
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,119
Don't lie.

213
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,400
Anyone else?

214
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,080
You.

215
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,280
So many people don't have the first kiss?

216
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,880
When did you have the first kiss?

217
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
When I was

218
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,200
six years old.

219
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,919
-Six years old?
-Six?

220
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,599
With who?

221
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,200
Who did you kiss?

222
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,200
The bro next to me.

223
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,320
Ah!

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,960
Jiang Zheng Han.

225
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,880
-Me?
-Zheng?

226
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,039
Jiang Zheng Han, you are amazing.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

228
00:10:59,239 --> 00:10:59,960
Never thought that.

229
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,880
Shouldn't he drink for kissing a girl at six?

230
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,799
Come on! Drink!

231
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,159
-Not such a thing.
-Xiao Xi,

232
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,159
why are you folding your fingers?

233
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,479
Xia Lin Xi, why? You...

234
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,080
Who did you kiss?

235
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,200
I'm sorry I misheard the question.

236
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,960
I'll punish myself.

237
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
You scared me!

238
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,359
One cup is not enough.

239
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,000
We start from three cups.

240
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,000
Stop talking. She can't drink so much.

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,080
My turn.

242
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,119
Who didn't take
the College Entrance Exam, fold a finger.

243
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,320
-Jiang Zheng Han.
-Jiang Zheng Han.

244
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,239
Jiang Zheng Han. Jiang Zheng Han!

245
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,039
-Jiang Zheng Han.
-Drink.

246
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,840
Jiang Zheng Han. Jiang Zheng Han.

247
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,559
Jiang Zheng Han. Have a whole cup.

248
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,760
Jiang Zheng Han. Jiang Zheng Han.

249
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,719
My turn.

250
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,119
If the person you like is here,

251
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,320
fold a finger.

252
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,479
Senior, good question.

253
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,559
To the one we like.

254
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,119
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

255
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,960
Xiao Xi, I wanna go to the toilet.

256
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,679
Okay.

257
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,080
Come on, Qin Yue.

258
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,200
Let's have a drink.

259
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:07,599
Come here.

260
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,119
Jiang Zheng Han.

261
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,440
Excuse me for a moment.

262
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Gu Xiao Man,

263
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:17,359
what are you sneaking around here?

264
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,000
Please do me a favor
and answer my questions.

265
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,280
Why is Xia Lin Xi angry?

266
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,840
Then why are you always
calling me a scumbag?

267
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,479
You are a scumbag.

268
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,239
How dare you ask me?

269
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:33,280
You just confessed love to Xiao Xi,

270
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,400
and then you rid a motorcycle
with another girl.

271
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,960
Are we blind?

272
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,479
Let's go,
just one circle and it won't delay you.

273
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,599
I understand.

274
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,159
Wait.

275
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,840
Don't try to explain.

276
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,559
Xiao Xi, Qiu Yan and I

277
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,719
all saw it with our eyes

278
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,840
that you took another girl
on a motorcycle.

279
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,440
The girl is Shen!

280
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,840
You, Jiang Zheng Han, did such a thing.

281
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,640
You got me wrong.

282
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,960
-What?
-I was...

283
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,479
That's the same excuse
you scumbags always use!

284
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,280
You even cheated
your high school classmates.

285
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,320
Don't follow me.

286
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,960
I don't want to talk with you, scumbag.

287
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,000
-You know what?
-Stop bragging.

288
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,280
-I'm the top scorer in Jiangming...
-Come on, drink.

289
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,840
-Among all boys.
-Drink.

290
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
-Drink.
-Drink.

291
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
And from elementary school...

292
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,719
Xia Lin Xi.

293
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,520
I have something to talk with you.

294
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,159
Don't drink so much.

295
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,640
Go on.

296
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,520
Xia Lin Xi.

297
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,159
Boys shouldn't be wordy

298
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,159
when we girls are drinking.

299
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,320
Leave me.

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,440
Okay, no more drink after this.

301
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,520
Stop drinking.

302
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,440
Watch them,
I'll go get some water.

303
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
Xia Lin Xi.

304
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,880
Don't follow me.
I'm gonna throw up.

305
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,760
Xia Lin Xi.

306
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,719
Are you okay?

307
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,320
Don't touch me.

308
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:34,559
Xia Lin Xi, stand firm.

309
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,479
Who gave you the courage

310
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,039
to drink so much?

311
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,799
You.

312
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,640
Me?

313
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't follow me,
I will get some air myself.

314
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Xia Lin Xi.

315
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,239
Please listen to me.

316
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,640
No. I don't want to listen.

317
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,919
Are you going to say
that you love me again?

318
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,200
I never want to hear what you say anymore.

319
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,880
You...

320
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,239
You...

321
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,640
You always do something dramatic

322
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,000
and say something that
makes me unable to sleep.

323
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,000
At last...

324
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,479
At last...

325
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,679
After I finally plucked up,

326
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,559
and wanted to respond to your love,

327
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,679
you just ruined all the hope!

328
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,359
Why are you laughing?

329
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,880
Xia Lin Xi.

330
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,679
Can you listen to me carefully?

331
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,520
Nothing happened

332
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,039
between Shen Wen Yue and me.

333
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,919
She was just a neighbor before.

334
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,719
Since she moved at six,

335
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,599
we've never met each other again.

336
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,159
And she came to me

337
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,400
in the last contest, so we met again.

338
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,359
We both like riding motorcycles.

339
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,119
Motorcycle is our common hobby.

340
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,400
But if

341
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,679
you don't want me to ride,

342
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,840
I promise you

343
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,960
I will never ride it again.

344
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
And,

345
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,560
she said that she kissed me at six,

346
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,119
I really don't remember that.

347
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,319
I just remember we kissed

348
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,479
in the high school graduation party.

349
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,000
That was my first kiss.

350
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,560
What?

351
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,800
Not angry now?

352
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,959
Do you know magic?

353
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,160
What magic?

354
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,560
Just...

355
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,680
Just...

356
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:51,000
You just touched me,

357
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,839
then

358
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,079
I feel my heart is like jumping out.

359
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,000
Xia Lin Xi,

360
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,599
you are not allowed to drink anymore

361
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,640
if I'm not with you.

362
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,920
Why?

363
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,439
Because you

364
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,719
would say and do something dangerous

365
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,439
when you're drunk.

366
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,560
Is this dangerous?

367
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,319
Be quick!

368
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Chen Yi Chuan.

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,479
This toast is to your low EQ,

370
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:15,160
your insensitivity and your stupid head!

371
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,040
-Why are you hard on me today?
-Hurry up.

372
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,760
You are really...

373
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,800
One more leaves.

374
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,680
Qin Yue.

375
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,719
Who is the person I love

376
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,520
in my heart,

377
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,359
you know that, right?

378
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,800
Who is the person I love in my heart,

379
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,599
you should know that, right?

380
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,719
Are you alright?

381
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,920
You have to rest early since you're drunk.

382
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,359
Let me help you up.

383
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,400
It's okay, I can do it myself.

384
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,199
Be careful.

385
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,439
OK?

386
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:58,760
Go back and have a good rest.

387
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,239
Do not think too much.

388
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,479
Drink some water.

389
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,319
Jiang Zheng Han.

390
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,839
Listen, don't laugh anymore!

391
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,959
Are you sober now?

392
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,599
Yeah.

393
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,280
Let me ask you a question.

394
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,719
Who do you like,

395
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Qin Yue or me?

396
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,160
I...

397
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,079
I've never liked others except you.

398
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
Me too.

399
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,319
Have you heard

400
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,599
a story about the ending of Doraemon?

401
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,359
What?

402
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,400
Well.

403
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,719
Doraemon has been with Nobita
for 80 years.

404
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,239
Nobita is gonna die.

405
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,839
He told Doraemon that

406
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,280
"go back to your own place

407
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,079
after I die."

408
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,040
Then Doraemon just said yes.

409
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,119
But after Nobita passed away,

410
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,959
Doraemon sat on the time machine again

411
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,439
and went back to 80 years ago,

412
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,680
told to the small Nobita

413
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,119
"Hello, I am Doraemon."

414
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,040
Why you told me that?

Orion?

473
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,920
Senior, you are back.

474
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Yes.

475
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,280
Well.

476
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:08,839

00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,959

Look.

481
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:22,359
Since we both couldn't sleep
after drinking too much,

482
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:25,079
why don't we have a heart-to-heart talk?

483
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,680
Senior, I can say anything to you.

484
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,199
When we played the game just now,

485
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,800
you meant

486
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
there was also someone you like.

487
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:46,239
Is that person Jiang Zheng Han?

488
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,280
How shall I put it.

489
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,839
Actually,
I always think you two match well.

490
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,359
Last time, you fell off your bike,

491
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,119
Jiang Zheng Han
sent you to the medical room.

492
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,680
He is such an indifferent talent.

493
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,079
How could he casually help one

494
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,239
that he doesn't like?

495
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,040
I believe you two

496
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,599
may have a lot in common.

497
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,920
But aren't Xia Lin Xi and Jiang Zheng Han
seeing each other?

498
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,239
Well,

499
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,640
on Lin Xi's birthday,

500
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:30,319
not only Qin Yue threw a party for her,

501
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,319
but also Jiang Zheng Han

502
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,400
hacked the screen to

503
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,760
send her birthday blessing.

504
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,719
That exaggerating?

505
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,239
That's nothing.

506
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,719
She refused both of them.

507
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,880
She ran away herself,
leaving everyone embarrassed.

508
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,199
Zhuang Fei,

509
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,199
I have to remind you that

510
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,760
if you really like Jiang Zheng Han,

511
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,479
you should try to make him fall for you.

512
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:58,920
Get up the courage.

513
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,479
Don't let him ignore you.

514
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,280
You drank so much today,
go back and rest well.

515
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,160
I didn't drink much, but you...

516
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,239
Don't forget what you promised me.

517
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,439
You can't drink when I'm not with you.

518
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:18,760
I was sober a long time ago,
and I won't drink so much from now on.

519
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,680
Here you are.

520
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:22,920
Go back.

521
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:28,079
-Chen Yi Chuan.
-Gu Xiao Man.

522
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,000
You are a shrew.

523
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,839
I just want to hit you.
Do I need a reason?

524
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,119
Who's that?

525
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,920
What's going on between you two?

526
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,719
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

527
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:42,479
-Don't touch me.
-Xiao Xi, let's go.

528
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,599
Go back.

529
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,079
Jiang Zheng Han,

530
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,719
I clearly saw that,

531
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,199
just now you...

532
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,839
Let's go.

533
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,560
Hey!

534
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,719
Chen Yi Chuan!

535
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,400
Duan Ning.

536
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,439
Oh my!

537
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:13,760
Zheng.

538
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,800
Take a look at yourself.

539
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,079
All the essence of tonight's dinner.

540
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,680
No more words.

541
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,359
Clean him up.

542
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,680
I gotta go.

543
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,199
Zheng.

544
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,119
If you want to get Lin Xi,
you must deal with your brother-in-law.

545
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,640
What a tough task.

546
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,640
I will go first.

547
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,040
-What?
-You got this.

548
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,680
Jiang Zheng Han, I want to drink juice.

549
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,680
Jiang Zheng Han, I want to drink juice.

550
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,800
Jiang Zheng Han, I want to drink juice!

551
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:10,680
Jiang Zheng Han,

552
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,160
I want juice!

553
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,520
I want juice.

554
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,599
No juice.

555
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,400
Only water, here you are.

556
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,199
What's wrong?

557
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,319
Although we are both men,

558
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,400
I don't want to see you naked.

559
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,599
Disgusting.

560
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,000
Naked? It sounds disgusting.

561
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,599
Close your eyes
if you don't want to see.

562
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:50,160
Why I should listen to you?

563
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,599
I will see.

564
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,079
Okay.

565
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,439
Oh my!

566
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,560
Jiang Zheng Han is really amazing!

567
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,680
Xiao Xi, what a treasure you got!

568
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,640
I have been writing the novel
for three years.

569
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,719
And I gotta change the leading role now.

570
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,119
Oh, no!

571
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,560
Sorry.

572
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,239
I just shook off your hand.

573
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,760
How do you plan to compensate me?

574
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:39,760
Jiang Zheng Han,
how dare you chat with that evil woman!

575
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,400
You have a death wish?

576
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,719
You're drunk?

577
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,319
I'm chatting with Zhang Huai Wu.

578
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:48,079
Impossible, show me your phone.

579
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,079
-Chen Yi Chuan!
-Give me the phone.

580
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,319
-You should sleep.
-Show me your phone!

581
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,880
-Chen Yi Chuan.
-I want to see your phone!

582
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,800
Go back.

583
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,959
-Chen Yi Chuan.
-Your phone...

584
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,119
-I want to see your phone.
-Go back.

585
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,640
Stop acting up, got it?

586
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
-Give me the phone.
-Sleep now!

587
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,079
I‘ve restrained myself from "killing" you.

588
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,680
Gimme your phone!

589
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,199
-Let me see your phone.
-In your dreams.

590
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,160
I know.

591
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,000
What do you know?

592
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You

593
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,359
and Xia Lin Xi

594
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:24,920
plan to hide from us

595
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,040
to learn secretly.

596
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:31,839
What?

597
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:35,079
I knew that!

598
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,319
Jiang Zheng Han.

599
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,199
You are coveting
my first place in the grade.

600
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,479
You're plotting bad things.

601
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,319
You are right.

602
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,640
I hold evil intent.

603
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,199
I don't care about my roommates,
I just want to take the first place.

604
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,760
I won't give you a chance.

605
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,280
I won't give you a chance.

606
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,400
I have to learn.

607
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,199
Calculus...

608
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:04,190
<i>Higher Mathematics</i>

609
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,760
Function...

610
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,520
Slope...

611
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:15,360
I was so scared
that I thought he found out.

612
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,080
I am a little sleepy.

613
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,120
Okay, go to bed first.

614
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,320
Xiao Xi.

615
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,199
I want to be your sister-in-law.
Please help me.

616
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,919
What are you thinking?

617
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,159
Help me.

618
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,360
But you must help me keep this secret.

619
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,120
Especially don't tell Chen Yi Chuan.

620
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,040
If my mother finds out,
I will be miserable.

621
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,239
Okay, my dear.

622
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,280
Mwah.

623
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,199
All right.

624
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,159
Mom. Mom!

625
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,560
-Mom!
-No. No. No.

626
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,199
Gu Xiao Man.

627
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:11,959
Gu Xiao Man.

628
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,230
<i>To Jiang Zheng Han</i>

629
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,810
<i>Don't let others know
we're in a relationship.</i>

630
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,290
<i>Especially Chen Yi Chuan.</i>

631
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,159
Don't let others know
we're in a relationship.

632
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,000
Especially Chen Yi Chuan.

633
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,439
I know.
