17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,360
Over here, over here!

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,830
Who did such an unethical thing?
Put it under the blanket.

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,510
Here, here, here!

20
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,000
I left it there.

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,830
Zhang Huai Wu said I was unethical,
what should we do with him?

22
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,870
Cut his pay.

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,590
-Cut your pay.
-You have no salary this month.

24
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,950
Brother Zheng, if you do that,

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,360
I won't give it to you.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Dare you!

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,590
Don't come here.

28
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm getting married now, you know?

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,310
Give me, quickly.

30
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,400
OK, OK, OK.

31
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,630
If you truly want it,

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,590
then answer a question from my father.

33
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,830
-Director Zhang?
-Director Zhang?

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,030
-Yes.
-Director Zhang?

35
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,670
OK, go ahead.

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,550
I represent my father to ask.

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
During high school, did two of you

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,960
see each other

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,550
already?

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,520
I didn't, I always followed
my teacher's words.

41
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,030
Loving early wastes our heart.

42
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,270
I guarantee.

43
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,720
We truly didn't fall in love early.

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,390
A social man like me

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,080
came back to school

46
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,390
just because of my Lin Xi.

47
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,670
Oh my.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,180
<i>Episode 5</i>
<i>Thank You For Making Me A Better Person</i>

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
Wow.

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
Wow.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,030
Is this your secret place?

52
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,160
Yes.

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,830
You have so many cubes,
why did you take mine?

54
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,080
Because

55
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,550
I don't deny

56
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,030
any booty.

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,630
Doraemon?

58
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,030
Wow.

59
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,520
When I was young,
I liked Doraemon the most.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,080
He can satisfy all the wishes of Nobita.

61
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,190
But,

62
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,000
it was confiscated by my mom
and she said I was naive.

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,830
If you like it so much,

64
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,640
I'll give it to you.

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,070
That generous?

66
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,550
You said you like it, didn't you?

67
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Make a wish

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,760
to see whether he can
make it true or not.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,110
You regard me as a child?

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,390
Ah!

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,230
Be careful.

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,110
At the beginning,

73
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,440
I really hated you.

74
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,600
What do you mean?

75
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,640
It means that you like me now?

76
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,920
Stupid, a bad student,
play truant to work.

77
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,880
Mean and cunning.

78
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,950
You're definitely a bad person with whom

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,830
I'm not allowed to make friends
in my mother's eyes.

80
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,350
So?

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,440
But,

82
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,480
it's because I don't
understand you completely.

83
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,000
You are an upright, kind

84
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,320
and responsible person.

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,830
But maybe because

86
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,390
sometimes you're so kind

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,350
that you just shoulder

88
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,720
everything alone.

89
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,790
You don't like to explain what you do.

90
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,640
But,

91
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,480
Jiang Zheng Han,

92
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,920
you're only 18.

93
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,600
You are just coming of age like me.

94
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,440
You don't need to be so tired.

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,790
You can ask others for help.

96
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,670
You can...

97
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,760
You know,

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,350
we're friends.

99
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
We can shoulder together.

100
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,270
Thanks for your compliment.

101
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,390
If you don't say, I won't know
that I'm such a good person.

102
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,160
And you?

103
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,070
Are you the same as what you behave?

104
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,440
What?

105
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,390
Tell me,

106
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,230
clearly, it's so good
to be the first in our grade.

107
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,110
Isn't it enough to just
please teachers?

108
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,950
Yet you keep coming to me
and messing around.

109
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,230
Right?

110
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,950
A

111
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,510
little

112
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,390
tail.

113
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,440
I suppose a good student, a genius

114
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,070
is just your outward appearance, right?

115
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,270
You're pretending

116
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,670
to be obedient

117
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,160
because of your parents,

118
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,200
right?

119
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,550
Maybe I'm wrong.

121
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,160
You're right.

122
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,390
It's because I don't want
my parents to get divorced.

123
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,350
But there's one point that you're wrong.

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,550
I'm not a genius.

125
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,950
I just make an effort
to compensate for my stupidity.

126
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,670
You're a genius.

127
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,320
Me?

128
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,470
The first prize in the National
Programming Contest for teenagers.

129
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,550
The first prize in a national competition.

130
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,470
You're impressive.

131
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Oh, by the way,

132
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,710
why do you always read that
"Introduction to Algorithms"?

133
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,030
What do you learn programming for?

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,790
To do this.

135
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,400
What is this?

136
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,200
This is a safety system that I'm making.

137
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,110
If it can detect the dangers,
it will report to the police.

138
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,760
But it's still not complete yet.

139
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,840
So I never show it to anybody.

140
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,840
Jiang Zheng Han.

141
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,000
Promise me one thing.

142
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,520
Rest assured.

143
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,080
I won't tell others
that you are two-faced.

144
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,670
Not that.

145
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,000
So?

146
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,200
I want to say that

147
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,030
no matter how many things you have to do,

148
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,030
you must go to school.

149
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,110
The College Entrance Examination
is coming soon.

150
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,150
Which university do you want to study at?

151
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,400
I've never thought of that.

152
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
So you should think now.

153
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,080
Or

154
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,880
you and I apply for the same university?

155
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,840
That isn't impossible.

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,230
It's a deal then.

157
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,400
Then we make a promise
to apply for Jing Hua University together.

158
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,670
Tutor Jiang.

159
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,000
Though Jing Hua University
is very hard to get in,

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,030
I believe that

161
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,400
if you try your best, you can do it.

162
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,110
Come on.

163
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,640
Let's pull hook.

164
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,710
We secretly become allies

165
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,080
at your secret base.

166
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,350
Come on, how old are you?

167
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,470
So childish, I refuse.

168
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,670
-Hurry up.
-No.

169
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,590
-Do that.
-No.

170
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,350
Now!

171
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,400
Seal.

172
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't lower your head.
Xia Lin Xi, look ahead.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,590
Hold on, you can do it, hold on.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,790
Are you OK?

175
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,280
I'm OK.

176
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,550
How much time left?

177
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,280
We've run for three minutes.

178
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,110
-Seven minutes left.
-Seven minutes?

179
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,200
That's very quick.

180
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,640
Four hundred and twenty seconds.

181
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,110
Four steps per second.

182
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,760
One thousand six hundred
and eighty steps!

183
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Xia Lin Xi.

184
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,440
Control your breaths.

185
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,670
Listen to my question.

186
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,880
In parabola,

187
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,550
Y squared which is equal to 4X
passing through two points.

188
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,200
The line through Y is equal to
symmetrical KX plus three.

189
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
Find the range of values of K.

190
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I can't do it.

191
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,550
My mind goes blank now.

192
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,030
-I can't think of anything.
-Stop thinking that you are running.

193
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,080
Listen to my question.

194
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,470
In parabola,

195
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,150
Y squared

196
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
which is equal to 4X
passing through two points.

197
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,150
The line through Y is equal to
symmetrical KX plus three.

198
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,960
Find the range of values of K.

199
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,840
What's the answer?

200
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,150
Do it, do it.

OK.

227
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,840
Let's start.

228
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,470
Today,

229
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,350
<i>High School Math Paper</i>
you have to finish this paper.

230
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,150
Ready to start.

231
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,710
OK.

232
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,470
Today,

233
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,520
<i>High School Chinese Paper</i>
you have to finish this paper.

234
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,470
One? This pile must be ten papers.

235
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,590
They are all important tests every year.

236
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,760
I specially selected them from
the teaching and research section.

237
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
Wow.

238
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,030
This must be

239
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,910
your reward for being a
good student in teachers' eyes.

240
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,550
Stop talking nonsense.

241
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,960
Study or not?

242
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,840
I'll study.

243
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,910
OK.

244
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,790
So tutor Xia,

245
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,710
I'll start.

246
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,150
-Good.
-Good.

247
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,470
-Good.
-Good, good.

248
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,200
Good.

249
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,760
Oh my.

250
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,840
Chinese!

251
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,790
Brother Zheng.

252
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,550
Look.

253
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,910
The PE teacher is a good job.

254
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,840
The class will be occupied
at every turn, is it right?

255
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,030
Earn money
without having to work.

256
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,350
You see, the job is just

257
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,910
to press the stopwatch.

258
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,710
This job is so simple.

259
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,840
You know what.

260
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,880
I want to be a PE teacher.

261
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,150
What are you watching?

262
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,790
Being a PE teacher

263
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,400
is very good.

264
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,150
Yep! I told you.

265
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,030
You see, being a PE teacher
is very good, right?

266
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,640
I really want to be a PE teacher.

267
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,110
I really don't want to be like my father.

268
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,440
Tell me, what's good
about being like my father?

269
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,760
Every day he has many things to do.

270
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,400
So tiring.

271
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,470
You see, being a PE teacher

272
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,000
is...

273
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,710
Zhang.

274
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
What did Jiang Zheng Han say?

275
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,670
Ah, he said to me

276
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,150
being a PE teacher was very good.

277
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,470
You also want to
become a PE teacher, don't you?

278
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,710
I don't want to be a PE teacher.

279
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,320
Zhang.

280
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,080
Do you see that Xiao Xi
is so mysterious recently?

281
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,790
-Xiao Xi?
-Yes.

282
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,230
-Mysterious?
-Yes.

283
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,994
What are you talking about?

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,840
She comes early
and goes home late every day.

285
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,640
She'll disappear if I
don't pay attention to her.

286
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,000
I've asked her to go running many times,
but she didn't come.

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,960
But you see.

288
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,280
Her performance has greatly improved.

289
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,440
Tell me, what did she do?

290
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,910
-She didn't come with you?
-Yes.

291
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Then her PE performance
has greatly improved?

292
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,470
That's right.

293
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,590
-Is it right?
-Yes.

294
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,110
I understand.

295
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,640
Maybe she's like me,

296
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,790
she wants to become a PE teacher.

297
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,880
Oh dear, what happened to your head?

298
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,800
How could she become a PE teacher
with such a poor performance?

299
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Even being a teaching assistant
is out of her depth.

300
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,800
But, tell me,

301
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,310
what is she doing?

302
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,640
Alas, I can't understand.

303
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,950
I understand.

304
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,040
I really understand.

305
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,000
Sis Xia

306
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,470
might change her love for you,
so she's leaving you behind!

307
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,190
Zhang Huai Wu, are you crazy?

308
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,470
Xia Lin Xi and I are best friends!

309
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,400
She can't leave me behind.

310
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,590
Leave me behind?

311
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,520
It won't be like what Zhang Huai Wu said,

312
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,280
she leaves me behind to make new friends?

313
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,230
<i>Message from Jiang Zheng Han</i>

314
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,830
Don't come to the internet cafe,
Zhang Huai Wu is there.

315
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,190
What happened?

316
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,920
You have to go.

317
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,310
I saw Director Zhang
going to the internet cafe.

318
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,350
Hurry up.

319
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,350
OK.

320
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,640
Brother Zheng, brother Zheng.

321
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,190
Today, thank you for
letting me know in time.

322
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,920
You are the sun in my life.

323
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,430
OK, OK.

324
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,310
Go quickly, I have to go to work now.

325
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,950
Brother Zheng, do you still work?

326
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,470
Isn't the exam coming?

327
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,040
Yet you
still come to the internet cafe?

328
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,110
You don't know.

329
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,800
Listen, my parents are very strict.

330
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,680
My dad will either scold me or beat me.

331
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
I feel as if I was in prison every day.

332
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,310
He even says that I'm the shame
of the Zhangs.

333
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,680
So I'm just

334
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,710
relaxing a little bit, right?

335
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,800
Why you told me that?

336
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,470
Brother Zheng.

337
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,950
Can you reach the top 100?

338
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,640
It's none of your business.

339
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,040
It's hard.

340
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,710
Approximately two times.

341
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,880
Done.

342
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,000
This is the second time

343
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,160
you've given the wrong answer
to this question.

344
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,880
If you still do it wrong next time,
I'll wake you up at five o'clock tomorrow.

345
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,230
I realize that I truly
don't like learning Chinese.

346
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,470
It's very difficult,
what should I do now?

347
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,640
How can there be so many
suitable and unsuitable things?

348
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,920
Alas.

349
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,880
Look at this reading comprehension.

350
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,920
Half of the class did this question wrong.

351
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,310
But your answer is correct.

352
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,040
It proves that

353
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,710
you're suitable.

354
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,920
Don't give up.

355
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,590
Oh, so this is the answer.

356
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,880
What are you doing?

357
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,950
One paper today, you promised me!
No more!

358
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,430
You!

359
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,040
You did it wrong,

360
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,590
so do one more.

361
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,590
Why?

362
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,640
Because I'm a good teacher.

363
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,920
Fine.

364
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,560
Here you are.

365
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,950
What's this?

366
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,230
A reward for doing all the exercises.

367
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,590
I give both rewards
and punishments, is it good?

368
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,560
Not bad.

369
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,160
Do it.

370
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,190
You also do it.

371
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,230
OK.

372
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,590
At sunset, the rosy clouds and
a solitary duck seem to fly together.

373
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,920
Hmm... The long sky emerges into one hue
with the autumn water.

374
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,950
Good boy.

375
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,400
And this one is all
the important knowledge I compiled.

376
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,880
Ah!

377
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,040
Are you alright?

378
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,070
Ah.

379
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,110
I'm OK.

380
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,710
Ah, by the way.

381
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,160
Don't hand in your papers in advance tomorrow.

382
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,430
Pay attention to your papers
before and after doing.

383
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,760
During the exam, you can't...

384
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,230
I know.

385
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,920
You are small but so talkative.

386
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
So...

387
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,800
By the way.

388
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,310
This is the exercise book I just edited.

389
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,560
Why have it with you?

390
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,040
Definitely, I have to
bring it along with me.

391
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,280
I just prayed.

392
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,800
What is your wish?

393
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,190
If I told you, it wouldn't work.

394
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,350
Let's go.

395
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,310
Brother Zheng, good morning.

396
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,760
What do you want?

397
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,000
Wait a second.

398
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,310
-Morning, teacher.
-Morning, teacher.

399
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,560
-I got something to tell you, let's go.
-What are you doing?

400
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,470
-Hurry up, hurry up.
-What are you doing?

401
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,710
You can say here.

402
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,310
If you have this, I guarantee
that you'll get a high score.

403
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,742
Then the guy who was in the second
place will be angry to death.

404
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:16,710
What's that?

405
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,950
Is your head squeezed by
the door or broken by your dad?

406
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,160
No, brother Zheng.

407
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,800
When my dad chased me yesterday,

408
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,040
you saved my life.

409
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,110
We're buddies then.

410
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,880
If you really want to thank me,

411
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,560
you just need to help me
earn two more stars.

412
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:38,430
You're crazy.

413
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,560
Brother Zheng, have a think.

414
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,470
Have you ever passed
the Chinese and Chemistry tests?

415
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,640
You and Chen Yi Chuan bet,
aren't you just waiting for a loss?

416
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,760
Listen to me, take this.

417
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,280
-Return it, do you hear that?
-Take it.

418
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,640
What are you doing?

419
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,190
What are you holding?

420
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,950
Ah.

421
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,800
What good weather.

422
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,470
Hurry up and go.

423
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,590
Brother Zheng.

424
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,160
Take it.

425
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,950
We can't be so stubborn.

426
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,560
How did you get this paper out?

427
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,920
Well, it's quite simple.

428
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,590
My father always sets the password 1234.

429
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,920
So I tried to unlock the safe,

430
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,280
and it opened.

431
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,710
Put it back like the way you take it out.

432
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,950
We haven't seen it yet.

433
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,950
We're not cheating.

434
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,520
Understand?

435
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,760
Please, brother Zheng.

436
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,800
Got it?

437
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,040
Yes.

438
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,000
<i>Citywide Mock Exam</i>

439
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,920
Little by little, this answer.

440
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,000
<i>Report Card of Grade 12</i>

441
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,520
<i>Xia Lin Xi: 715
Chen Yi Chuan: 707</i>

442
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,960

444
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,470
OK, our class is over.

445
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,520
Brother Zheng, you're excellent.

446
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,160
I can't imagine that
you're so talented!

447
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,310
So cool.

448
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,950
I admire you now.

449
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,190
OK, enough.

450
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,800
Brother Zheng, from now on,

451
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,590
I'll be your younger brother.

452
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,710
What is a younger brother?

453
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,560
That means
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

454
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,590
Is it right, brother Zheng?

455
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,000
Let's eat skewers.

456
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,520
So should Chen Yi Chuan...

457
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,110
Leapfrog!

458
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,230
Chen Yi Chuan, leapfrog!

459
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,230
-Leapfrog! Leapfrog!
-Forget it.

460
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,230
Stop kidding!

461
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,280
What leapfrog?

462
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,470
You don't know.

463
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,680
Chen Yi Chuan, leapfrog!

464
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,590
Leapfrog! Chen Yi Chuan!

465
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
It's impossible.

466
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Something must be wrong here.

467
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,040
What's wrong?

468
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,950
Right, what problems?

469
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,400
You're short-sighted.

470
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,950
Jiang Zheng Han.

471
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,000
He is a bad student. How come?

472
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,520
I know.

473
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,560
You cheated.

474
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,680
I saw Zhang Huai Wu stole
the paper and gave it to Jiang Zheng Han.

475
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,230
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

476
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,880
-Actually, that day...
-Chen Yi Chuan.

477
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,830
You have to take responsibility for

478
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,830
your words.

479
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,880
I've seen your previous results.

480
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,280
You never passed
the Chinese and Chemistry tests.

481
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,680
How could you get into the top 100?

482
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,280
Chen Yi Chuan, why do you think
that Jiang Zheng Han cannot pass?

483
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,190
What do you want?

484
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,430
I'll give you the questions directly.

485
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,000
You just need to answer the Chemistry
questions in front of everyone.

486
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,760
We'll believe you.

487
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,950
What? We won't compete with you.

488
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,430
Right?

489
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,070
OK, let's do that.

490
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,640
Let's let monitor Xia
give the question.

491
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,710
And they will compete

492
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,400
with each other.

493
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,640
-He has to compete?
-OK everyone, don't say anything.

494
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,430
Stop talking.

495
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,590
Listen to me.

496
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,400
Let's go now, we can't
compete with him, do you hear me?

497
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,230
Come on, don't make it big.

498
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,800
-Why don't you go?.
-We won't compete with you.

499
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,830
Compete with him.

500
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Xia Lin Xi, you'd better be fair.

501
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,230
I can see that.

502
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,040
Do you hear me?

503
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,830
-Xiao Man, go persuade him.
-You!

504
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,560
Xiao Man, is the question
sis Xia gave difficult?

505
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,520
Don't ask me, can't you see?

506
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,040
Oh no,
he definitely can't do it.

507
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,230
Did I do it right?

508
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,520
Hey, come on,
few rounds left!

509
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,920
Come on!

510
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,760
You okay?

511
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,310
Chen Yi Chuan!

512
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,800
A frog, a frog,
let's sing, ribbit, ribbit!

513
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,760
Let's sing!

514
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,470
Keep on jumping!

515
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,830
That's all the strength you have?

516
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,920
Come on, come on, jump!

517
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,190
How many rounds?

518
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,190
Seems he can't jump anymore.

519
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,230
I think so.

520
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,800
Continue!

521
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,310
-What are you watching!
-Which class, come here!

522
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,230
Chen Yi Chuan,
what are you doing? Stand up.

523
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,800
I still have one more round.

524
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,230
Get back to your class!

525
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,760
Which class!

526
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,400
It's OK, it's OK.

527
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,880
Jump! Keep going!

528
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,230
Keep going!

529
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,710
Stop watching!

530
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,350
Chen Yi Chuan, stand up!

531
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,640
-Stop jumping!
-Let's go.

532
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,520
Let's go.

533
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Go back to your class!

534
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,710
Chen Yi Chuan!

535
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,560
Stop watching!

536
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,230
Get back to our class!

537
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,800
Get back to your class!

538
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,190
Teachers will come here soon, let's go.

539
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,640
I won't go.

540
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,880
Get back to your class!

541
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,640
What are you doing? Stop watching.

542
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,310
Get back to your class, heard that?

543
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,520
Stop watching, get back to your class!

544
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,000
Which class?

545
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,320
<i>Two days later</i>

546
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:54,520
Come on.

547
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,160
The score of this test will be added
directly to the College Entrance Exam.

548
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,160
Try your best. Good luck.

549
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,680
Come on!

550
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,710
Get to your place.

551
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:40,830
Go for it!

552
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,680
Xia Lin Xi!

553
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,190
Adjust your breaths!

554
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,070
Adjust your breaths!

555
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,950
Hold on!

556
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,430
Hurry up, the endpoint
is in front of you, come on!

557
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,800
Go for it!

558
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,950
Sprint!

559
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,150
Xia Lin Xi, three minutes 24 seconds.

560
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,120
Enough to meet the standard.

561
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,230
Xiao Xi! Amazing!

562
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,760
You made it! Very good!

563
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,280
Very good!

564
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,910
I told you, you can do it.

565
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,950
Yeah!

566
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,560
-I have to go there.
-OK. OK.

567
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,190
Oh my.

568
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,910
Where is she?

569
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,040
Zhang, come here.

570
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,190
What's wrong?

571
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,390
Can you feel anything?

572
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Can you feel it?

573
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,000
-What?
-Something is going on between them.

574
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,230
What?

575
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,910
Something...

576
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,950
Oh dear.

577
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,950
That's it.

578
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,320
What is in your head all day?

579
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,230
Brother Zheng and sis Xia
are friends.

580
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,870
You're insane.

581
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,670
You mean whom!

582
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,190
Why don't I know that?

583
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,190
Chuan.

584
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,120
Are you working out?

585
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,320
Xiao Chuan.

586
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Let me take you to
eat fried chicken, OK?

587
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,120
I don't eat.

588
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,710
Hmm, so...

589
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,080
Ice cream?

590
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,390
No.

591
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,150
Come on, don't be angry.

592
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,040
Smile.

593
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,230
Smile.

594
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,800
Listen to me.

595
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,171
Actually, the problem between
you and Jiang Zheng Han

596
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:38,840
was really a misunderstanding.

597
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,390
Why do you all speak for Jiang Zheng Han?

598
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,870
I don't.

599
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,950
Ah, aren't you...

600
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,430
Hmm... what's your name?

601
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,760
Frog Chen, right?

602
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,950
Feng Tian Jun!

603
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,120
Do you know how to speak?

604
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,670
If not, shut your mouth!

605
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,150
Chuan, don't mind him.

606
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,910
-Ignore him.
-What are you doing?

607
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,840
From junior to high school,

608
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,950
you've always stuck with me!

609
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,230
Can you stay away from me?

610
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,560
Chen Yi Chuan, watch your words.

611
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,040
Apologize to Gu Xiao Man.

612
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,040
Xiao Man, don't mind him.

613
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,360
He has always been
like that since he was small.

614
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:24,320
I know.

615
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,840
Look at yourself.

616
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,040
For such a person,

617
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
it isn't worth it.

618
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,840
I feel sorry for him.

619
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,800
Can you help me think for him?

620
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,651
Such an arrogant person like him

621
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:40,670
was forced to make a fool
of himself in front of everyone.

622
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Xiao Xi.

623
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,950
Why didn't we tell him that

624
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,280
Jiang Zheng Han saved him,
so that he wouldn't have done such stupid things.

625
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,360
Aren't you stupid just now?

626
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,390
Moreover, will he believe what you say?

627
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,190
But if Chen Yi Chuan continues to

628
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,150
speculate on others maliciously,

629
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,080
one day when everyone knows
he has slandered Jiang Zheng Han,

630
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,150
they will look down on him.

631
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,280
I don't want to see that.

632
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,390
Well.

633
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,080
OK, OK.

634
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,630
Let's go, it's time for our class.

635
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,600
I just realized that
you have said that I'm stupid.

636
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,840
You always think for others all day.

637
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,000
Isn't it stupid?

638
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,150
I don't.

639
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,560
OK, though you're stupid,
you're still cute.

640
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,190
Today,

641
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,360
did I go too far?

642
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,190
What?

643
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,320
Nothing.

644
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,390
Are you talking about Chen Yi Chuan?

645
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,600
But I didn't expect that he would jump.

646
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,080
He failed, you know.

647
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,000
That's how we promised initially.

648
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,470
Yes.

649
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,230
I didn't expect my silly cousin
to be so brave.

650
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,230
I know everything.

651
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,360
I'm sorry.

652
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,360
Is he Chen Yi Chuan?

653
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,430
Maybe.

654
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,360
Although I did the leapfrog,

655
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,560
I still ranked the second place.

656
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,630
Yes, that's him.

657
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,870
Let's go.

658
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,080
Go, go, go.

659
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,560
What are you doing?

660
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,120
What?

661
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,760
-Xiao Xi.
-Yes?

662
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,120
Chuan

663
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,040
wrote me a small note.

664
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,630
"At one moment when looking back suddenly,

665
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,630
with no resentment,
the youth has no regret."

666
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,230
This is Xi Mu Rong's love poem.

667
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,080
Does he mean to confess his love to me?

668
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,670
-Confess love?
-Yes.

669
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,560
Huh!

670
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,150
Ah!

671
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,430
-Teacher.
-Teacher.

672
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,760
