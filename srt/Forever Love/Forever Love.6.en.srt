Chen Yi Chuan!

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,630
What's the matter with you?

20
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,550
You're an excellent student in our class,

21
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,550
why do you fall in love so early?

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,630
I...I don't.

23
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,910
Is that you who
wrote this piece of paper?

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,870
Yes.

25
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,510
It's early love, isn't it?

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,550
Let me use the voice
of the Chinese teacher to read it.

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,270
In the blink of an eye
when I turned my head,

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,440
a youth without resentment
has nothing to regret.

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,470
Have you got no shame?

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,080
I don't dare to continue reading.

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,390
Teacher! This is not what I mean.

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,630
No need to explain!

33
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,000
I used to be a teacher
of Chinese, I can understand.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,670
Mr. Zhang, let me take a look.

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,630
Actually, I don't think
it's a big problem.

36
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,440
The voice is just...

37
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,630
a little bit cheesy.

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,600
Oh, Mr. Zhao!

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,910
These students

40
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,131
are bullying you, a homeroom science teacher,

41
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:38,270
who don't understand Chinese.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,190
This is Xi Mu Rong's poem,
which talks about love.

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,880
The first sentence mentions

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,880
that at a young age,

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,630
if you love a girl,

46
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,910
you,

47
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,960
then you will definitely
have to treat her gently.

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,270
You see, is that love at a young age?

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,360
Yes! That's it!

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,190
Chen Yi Chuan!

51
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,320
You're making Mr. Zhang
disappointed in you.

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
See?

53
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,270
How many days left from now on

54
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,750
to the College Entrance Examination?

55
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,270
Tell me!

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,110
Two of you, in this very important time...

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,550
It's such a shame.

58
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,910
Mr. Zhang, it's not like what you think.

59
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,080
I don't know the meaning of this poem.

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,240
I thought this was

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,960
for apologizing.

62
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,910
Teacher!

63
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,110
This wasn't written by Chen Yi Chuan.

64
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,440
It's...me.

65
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,750
Don't say silly things!

66
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,830
Teacher, the poem was written by me.

67
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't blame her!

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,360
But I wrote this poem

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,830
to apologize to her.

70
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,110
Oh my God, shut up!

71
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,520
You, and you.

72
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,360
Why do you cover each other?

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,434
No!

74
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,800
Are two of you playing
a drama of bitter romance here?

75
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,600
Mr. Zhang!

76
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,110
If you want to blame this,
you can only blame me.

77
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,910
This is not related to Chen Yi Chuan.

78
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,320
It's me who likes him first.

79
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,720
He didn't do anything.

80
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,520
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,440
Do you understand this situation?

82
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,520
Chen... Chen Yi Chuan!

83
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Do you think that bonus points
on the College Entrance Examination

84
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,800
can help you take it easy at this time?

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
I...

86
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,550
Teacher... I...

87
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,470
Gu Xiao Man!

88
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,630
Aren't you fortune-telling every day?

89
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,440
Come on, tell your own fortune.

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,160
Can you pass the exam?

91
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,800
Yes!

92
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,960
Mr. Zhang!

93
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,000
Mr. Zhao!

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm sorry!

95
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,880
It's our fault.

96
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,000
We shouldn't have loved
at a young age, it's our fault.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,350
Gu Xiao Man, shut your mouth!

98
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,550
Who falls in love
with you at a young age?

99
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,760
Early love is a problem of two people,

100
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,350
have you asked me for permission?

101
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,440
What nonsense are you
talking about here?

102
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,040
That's it!

103
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,110
Sister Xia!

104
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,550
What?

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,600
- What happened with you?
- What?

106
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,790
Sister Xia!

107
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,760
I saw Gu Xiao Man admitted
her love to Chen Yi Chuan.

108
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,950
It's 100% correct!

109
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,880
My dad is mad.

110
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,270
Is she stupid?

111
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,645
That's it.

112
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:43,070
Anthomaniac regardless of
time, place and occasion?

113
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,350
How could I know? I just eavesdropped.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,950
Well, well, well.

115
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,160
This couple finally comes back.

116
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,670
Congrats, our class's brother
and sister-in-law!

117
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,070
Gu Xiao Man and
Chen Yi Chuan are a couple?

118
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,390
They're found out by teachers.

119
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,790
Oh my god, it's a shock!

120
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,350
Wow!

121
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,320
Okay! Okay! Okay!

122
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,110
Can you keep silent for a moment?

123
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,670
Class monitor Xia, this is break time,

124
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,600
can you stop being so serious like this?

125
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,640
Moreover, everyone is happy and noisy,

126
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,600
can you let us talk a little?

127
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,720
Right?

128
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,550
Feng Tian Jun.

129
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,270
If you want to talk,

130
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,320
you can talk with Mr. Zhao.

131
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,670
Xia Lin Xi!

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,390
Are you too addicted to
being an exemplary student?

133
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,040
Why do you just like
causing trouble for me?

134
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,550
Only you take the lead make the noise.

135
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,550
Let me tell you,

136
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,000
if you tell this to teacher...

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,200
- Xiao Xi, forget it.
- Then you wait and see.

138
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,040
Who, who?

139
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,200
Your grandfather.

140
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,160
Well, it's Chen-the second place.

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,070
What's wrong?

142
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,600
Sister-in-law is crying

143
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,000
and it makes you heartache?

144
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,440
I...

145
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,790
Chen Yi Chuan!

146
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,670
Stop fighting!

147
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,070
- Chen Yi Chuan.
- Stop it!

148
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,480
Stop it!

149
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,640
- Chen Yi Chuan.
- What happened with you guys?

150
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,270
Are you rebelling?

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Calm down!

152
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,320
So,

153
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,200
tell me,

154
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,230
what happened?

155
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,110
Jiang Zheng Han!

156
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,480
Why are you involved in everything?

157
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,230
Mr. Zhao!

158
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,600
Here's the story.

159
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,830
When Gu Xiao Man had
come back to the classroom,

160
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,390
Feng Tian Jun started to
make jokes about both of them.

161
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,000
He made his classmates unable to
concentrate on their studies.

162
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,720
That's why I stood up and prevented them.

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,000
Then Chen Yi Chuan...

164
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:52,880
Teacher, this is not
Chen Yi Chuan's fault.

165
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,230
It was Feng Tian Jun
who menaced Xia Lin Xi, he said

166
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,760
if Xia Lin Xi dared to tell this to you,

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,550
he will not forgive Xia Lin Xi.

168
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,200
You're slinging mud at me!

169
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,790
- Teacher, I...
- Feng Tian Jun!

170
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Didn't we say the truth?

171
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,110
It's the truth, right?

172
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,110
Good job, two of you!

173
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,550
What?

174
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,110
Fighting in class.

175
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,880
You made that girl
scared a lot, don't you see?

176
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,350
Do I need to

177
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,920
invite your parents to school to talk?

178
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,720
Teacher, honestly,

179
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,920
it is

180
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,720
Feng Tian Jun who left his seat,

181
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,040
he wanted to hurt Xia Lin Xi.

182
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,950
Then,

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,550
Chen Yi Chuan came and pulled him back.

184
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,440
- Feng Tian Jun hit Chen Yi Chuan...
- You...

185
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,760
You're on the same boat.

186
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,000
Feng Tian Jun!

187
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,760
Your idioms have been improved a lot.

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can stay here

189
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,920
and practice idioms with me.

190
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,200
You can go back to class.

191
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,830
- Teacher, they...
- Ah right.

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
Call your parents,

193
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,550
I have something

194
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,920
to tell them.

195
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,320
I just found out that being
the class monitor has such benefits.

196
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

197
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,350
Thank you, Xia Lin Xi!

198
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,510
Why are you so humble today?

199
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,230
Anyway, now I have lost
all my dignity in class.

200
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,550
Actually,

201
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,550
it's not that embarrassing
when you do the leapfrog.

202
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, stop mentioning it!

203
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,350
Jiang Zheng Han said it.

204
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,760
- He said...
- I said

205
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,950
if I were you, I would definitely
stay there and wouldn't jump.

206
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,320
You're more responsible than me.

207
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,030
Hello, mom?

208
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,880
I see!

209
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,470
When you were fighting,
you looked like a man.

210
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:42,840
OK.

211
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,760
- My younger brother is mature.
- I see.

212
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,230
Who lets you touch my head?

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,150
My God.

214
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,150
Don't think that you helped me this time,
and I'll treat you like my sister.

215
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,790
I have something to do, I have to go now.

216
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,670
Okay.

217
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,960
Can we study for one hour
earlier this evening?

218
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,320
Sure.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
- Mom.
- You are back?

220
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,590
Yes!

221
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,440
Mr. Jiang, welcome!

222
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,280
- Hello Madam!
- We just met downstairs.

223
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,840
Oh!

224
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,710
Sorry Mr. Jiang!

225
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,590
Today I have something to do,
so I have to go out now.

226
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,030
I can't make dinner for the two of you.

227
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,590
Xiao Xi, order takeouts for
the two of you to eat, OK?

228
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,550
Don't worry, mom.

229
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,670
Today we will look through all,

230
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,200
it's such a big mission,
so we are about to start.

231
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,110
OK, so I won't bother you two anymore.

232
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,640
- You should learn from Mr. Jiang.
- Yes!

233
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,230
- I have to go!.
- Yes!

234
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,200
- Be careful, madam!
- Okay!

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,670
I don't master cooking,

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,150
so we just have these.

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,790
You're excellent!

238
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,520
I thought last time at
Duo Duo's house was your best.

239
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,080
No!

240
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,280
Save the best

241
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,910
for last.

242
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,840
There's no reason for this kindness.

243
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,400
Do you want me to help you with anything?

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,440
Can you give me money? Or your beauty?

245
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,880
None of them.

246
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:01,760
Oh.

247
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,960
The meat is too fat.

248
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,030
Oh.

249
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,200
Good!

250
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,520
Try this dish!

251
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,640
Oh.

252
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,150
Delicious!

253
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,000
I give you only 99 points.

254
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,550
Why?

255
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,080
How about 1 point left?

256
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
I'm afraid that you will be so arrogant.

257
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh!

258
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,670
Nice.

259
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,520
Why don't you eat?

260
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,670
I'm not in a hurry.

261
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,000
Eat slowly!

262
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,760
After dinner,

263
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,550
I have something to tell you.

264
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,960
What? Can you tell me immediately?

265
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,640
Finish eating first.

266
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,550
Gosh.

267
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
That's not a big deal, it's just

268
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,520
maybe today's the last time
I teach Maths for you.

269
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,710
Why?

270
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,550
Actually, your Maths results are really good,

271
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
you don't need a Math teacher like me anymore.

272
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,590
I also cannot continue

273
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,000
to receive money from
your family with a thick face.

274
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,880
- Hi.
- Oh.

275
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,550
- Mom.
- I forgot my documents, oh!

276
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,320
Is this food that you ordered?

277
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,840
Oh, madam, this is me...

278
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
I had a drop in blood pressure earlier,

279
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,790
then it took time to wait for the ordered food,

280
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,110
so I had Mr. Jiang cook a little.

281
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,670
Ah...

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,520
Yes!

283
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,230
Thank you, Mr. Jiang!

284
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,640
No problem.

285
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,710
So continue eating!

286
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,670
And then study.

287
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,030
OK.

288
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,910
- I've been bothering you.
- Ah.

289
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,790
- I have to go!
- Yes! Yes!

290
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,760
Be careful, madam.

291
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,880
Okay!

292
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,840
Hurry up and continue eating.

293
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,280
Then we will study.

294
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,880
Why won't you keep on teaching?

295
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,910
I did tell you, didn't I?

296
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,710
Eat.

297
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,760
Eat.

298
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,470
If you don't eat, I will eat.

299
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,710
I'm eating.

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,910
Jiang Zheng Han!

301
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,470
Is this really the last day you teach me?

302
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,110
Really?

303
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,320
I honestly have nothing left to teach you.

304
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,960
You got the first position.

305
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,200
Who said you have nothing to teach me?

306
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,320
Now I have an unsolved
Mathematics problem, you can't go.

307
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,670
You have to teach me.

308
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,230
You know how to do it.

309
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,880
I don't know!

310
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,710
Give my notebook back to me!

311
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,030
Do you think I want to go to this hellish place?

312
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,670
Isn't it because of you?

313
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,030
Did you promise to come to
Jing Hua University with me?

314
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,670
We did hook our fingers.

315
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
Did you forget?

316
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,710
Go home, little tail!

317
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Or you can catch a cold.

318
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,590
Be good.

319
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,760
What's this? Xia Lin Xi!

320
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,550
What?

321
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,400
And this one, too.

322
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,710
I won't let you draw.

323
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,520
Mom!

324
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,080
- Give it back to me.
- How dare you!

325
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,590
Stop, stop, stop.

326
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,320
Can you respect me a little bit?

327
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,030
- Mom.
- How dare you stole?

328
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,030
I won't let you!

329
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,080
Don't! Don't! Stop! Stop!

330
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
I respect you?

331
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,230
Xia Lin Xi!

332
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,230
I respect you for you to fool adults?

333
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,670
It was strange when he cooked dinner for you.

334
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,760
Two days ago,

335
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,880
your uncle told me that
Yi Chuan loved at an early age,

336
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,550
I showed off that you had a late puberty.

337
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,880
Did you drop your brain?

338
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,350
Can you not be so agitated?

339
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,640
It's not that serious, can't you talk gently?

340
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,470
Not that serious?

341
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:14,840
What?

342
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,790
Do you have the capacity to blame me?

343
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,840
Every day, I am up to
my ears with work for this family.

344
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,440
Have you ever paid attention
to your daughter for one day?

345
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,030
No, what do you mean?

346
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,230
Only you are tired, only you resent?

347
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,710
I am also stressed with work.

348
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,760
For work?

349
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,350
Where is the money? Where?

350
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,550
All-day from morning to night,
you stare at the stones,

351
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,350
where is money?

352
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,880
I'm talking to you, are you listening?

353
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,150
I'm talking to you.

354
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,000
I let her play the piano to practice
her concentration and temperament.

355
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,400
What do you do with her? You take her out
to play when you go home.

356
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,910
Our girl does not want to learn to play
the piano, we don't need to force her.

357
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,760
Fostering hobbies, do you understand?

358
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,400
Don't just go home and take her out.

359
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,960
I have nothing to talk to you about.

360
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,110
Nothing to talk about? Divorce, then.

361
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,640
Living with me is too exhausted, right?

362
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,960
Yes! Very resentful!

363
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,640
Divorce!

364
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,440
Divorce then, as you wish.

365
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,640
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

366
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,520
Is there any place in this house
that doesn't cost me money?

367
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,590
Stand up!

368
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,710
Xiao Xi, stand up, hurry, stand up!

369
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,550
Mom!

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,590
It's my fault!

371
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,910
Mom, please don't fight with dad anymore.

372
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,320
I will follow your words.

373
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,320
I will concentrate on studying.

374
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,550
I will study hard.

375
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,520
I will pass the exam.

376
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,200
So, can parents not divorce?

377
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,000
Can you

378
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,030
make my dream come true?

379
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,070
So you...agreed with me.

380
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,590
Mr. Zhang, tell me,
is this a business fraud?

381
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,430
No!

382
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,880
This child's dignity matters.

383
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,280
No, I am talking about a 12th grade student

384
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,710
dared to pretend to be a tutor.

385
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,760
He pretended to be

386
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,560
a Math top student at Jing Hua.

387
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,560
Don't be angry!

388
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,280
It's not too late to ask for clarity first.

389
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Let me tell you,

390
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,560
if I hadn't caught them,

391
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,590
I wouldn't have known how long I will be fooled.

392
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,350
Calm down, calm down!

393
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,680
We will definitely investigate this.

394
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,190
We will also strictly punish him
as the school's discipline.

395
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,350
Mr. Zhang.

396
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,640
Tell me!

397
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,590
Regardless of performance
or attitude, our Lin Xi

398
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,800
is on top of the class, right?

399
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,160
Oh... yes, yes, yes!

400
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,040
She is also our beloved daughter we born

401
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,680
and foster.

402
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,880
That Jiang Zheng Han, I think he is not
a decent child at first sight,

403
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
he is also a good talker.

404
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,350
He even entices
our daughter to cover him up.

405
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,680
Mr. Zhang, this time your school
must give me a valid explanation.

406
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,590
So what do you want?

407
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
Kick him out of 12-1,

408
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,400
don't let him have chance to harass
my daughter anymore.

409
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,350
Okay, now I immediately go to see you.

410
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,520
We will talk about it at school.

411
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,470
Oh!

412
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,830
Please don't.

413
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,680
He has already quit school.

414
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,760
What?

415
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Class,

416
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,040
today we revise from the beginning

417
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,430
about optical knowledge topics.

418
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,950
First,

419
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,880
is the transmission of light.

420
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,520
In the same environment,
light travels in a straight line.

421
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
Light does not pass
through the openings to form shadows.

422
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,040
The phenomena of eclipses and lunar eclipses

423
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,190
are all concrete examples
of light transmission.

424
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,760
So, the shadow

425
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,988
is a dark area formed
when light is obstructed

426
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:14,470
by objects that do not
allow light to pass through.

427
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,070
Shadows are divided into
shadows and semi-shadows.

428
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,920
The shadow

429
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,350
gets absolutely no light
from the light source.

430
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,400
The semi-shadow

431
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,680
gets only a fraction of
the light from the light source.

432
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,760
From that day till today,

433
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,470
Jian Zheng Han hasn't come to school.

434
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,520
I don't know the reason.

435
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,700
<i>Jian Xi Internet Cafe</i>

436
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh!

437
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,070
It's Xiao Zheng's friend!

438
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,280
Why are you here?

439
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,760
Why don't you go to see Xiao Zheng off?

440
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,070
Where is he going?

441
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Don't you know

442
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,190
today he has to go?

443
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,760

at that southern station.

444
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,640

-Oh!
- Bro Da Fei!

446
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,190
What's up, girl?

447
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,950
Girl, it's too urgent that
we can not wear a helmet.

448
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,760
When we keep up with Xiao Jiang,
we will go to the traffic police to be fined.

449
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,280
Okay!

450
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,680
Safety in traffic is a big deal,
absolutely not to be underestimated.

451

In the test a few days ago,

525
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,070
your mental state was not very good,

526
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,070
were you ill?

527
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
No!

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,350
Ah!

529
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,230
In this test, the first position

belongs to Chen Yi Chuan.

Okay.

541
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,950
You have to adjust your mind.

who can pull you out of the abyss,

00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,190

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,880
take you to climb

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,710

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,560

Yes.

558

I'm okay.

559
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,190

567
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,800
Are you stressed?

568
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,800
Very exhausted!

569
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,920
-Stress?
- I'm normal.

570
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,000
When I sat in the exam,

571
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,590
I was also stressed.

572
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,190
Oh!

573
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,830
The year we took
the College Entrance Examination...

574
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,160
Was nearly 30 years ago.

575
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,310
- 30 years ago.
- No!

576
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,470
- More than 30 years ago.
- It was just some years ago.

577
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,040
Ah...

578
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,760
College Entrance Examination

579
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,880
is the first entry ticket

580
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,520
for you to enter life.

581
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,190
I'm sure a lot of people have told you

582
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,190
that College Entrance Examination
can change our lives.

583
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,920
Before, when you were reviewing,

584
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,280
I often told you that thing.

585
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,950
But what College Entrance Examination

586
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,800
really teaches us?

587
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,470
I think it really taught me

588
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,560
how to cope with

589
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,310
life's important choices.

590
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,590
Until you go out to society,

591
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,880
you will find out that

592
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,160
life has so many choices,

593
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,710
which are much more
difficult than the College Entrance Examination.

594
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,880
That time,

595
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,920
your teacher

596
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,950
will not depend on your scores

597
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
to arbitrarily criticize you,

598
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,430
I just hope each of you

599
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,160
will have a certain knack,

600
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,680
a stable job,

601
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,110
to apply the things you learned,
not forgetting the original intentions.

602
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,350
You must remember

603
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,230
to be human, you must have principles
and limits in doing anything.

604
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,070
I will borrow a quote from
the master Confucianist Ma Yi Fu:

605
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,110
Although ever experienced the sinking,

606
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,310
one can still give birth to compassion.

607
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,000
Hope that Number 1 Jiang Ming high school

608
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,400
is a place to keep the most
beautiful memories of your high school time.

609
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,110

I and Mr. Zhao

612
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,470
often say that you do not study well

613
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,560
but today I have to say frankly,

614
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,110
we fooled you.

615
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,000

617

Let's take a group photo together.

618
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,280
Can we shout victory together?

619
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,230

00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,000
The day we go back

626

everyone is very relaxed.

627
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,070
It seems to bring out all the anger,

628
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,640
resentment,

629
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,190
pressures and stresses for
College Entrance Examination review over the years,

through notebooks, exams,

631
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,520
and throw them hard into the air.

632
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,400
Turn hardships in the study time

633

into future expectations.

634
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,560

644
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,400
Yes! Yes! Yes!

In our class, who likes whom you all know.

648
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,830
Look at Zhang Huai Wu!

649
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,800
Such a waste of my youth.

650
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,640
I have known free love
since I was still in the eggs.

651
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,920
All right, lessen it!

652
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,800
- He also dares to love?
- Can you?

653
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,110
Can you?

654
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,310
Who is your dad?

655
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,160
Your dad is Zhang You Cai.

656
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,040
Chicken, do you dare?

657
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,520
Do you dare?

658
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,310
I don't mind telling you guys either. I

659
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,800
don't dare.

660
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,280
He doesn't dare.

661
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,190
Zhang Huai Wu, he...

662
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,710
Zhao, let me ask you
one more question.

663
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,110
In our class,

664
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,830
who is the most incapable of

665
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,590
having a relationship?

666
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,800
Who?

667
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,160
Can you guess?

668
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,350
That is...

669
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,950
- I think it's definitely not you.
- Who? Of course!

670
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,400
I have Xiao Chuan.

671
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,280
Xiao Chuan is so handsome.

672
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Okay, okay, please stop!

673
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,710
It's my sister Xia.

674
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,280
No!

675
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,800
No, no, honestly.

676
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,040
- Teacher, does she have a boyfriend?
- Does she have one?

677
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,800
Right.

678
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,950
Mr. Zhao, please don't
befriend them to bully me.

679
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,470
I... I... I haven't said anything, have I?

680
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,590
I haven't said anything.

681
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,110
- She is startled.
- I'm sure she has one.

682
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,520
- Sure.
- I don't have one, believe me!

683
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,880
Okay, okay!

684
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,830
You guys don't need to
make a noise, listen to me.

685
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,760
I know our Xiao Xi has someone she likes.

686
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
- Is that true?
- No!

687
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,230
- True?
- True?

688
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,160
Yes!

689
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,040
No!

690
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,760
Xiao Xi, you had graduated,

691
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,800
you can let go of
the pressure of being a goddess.

692
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,230
Listen to me!

693
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,830
Everyone sitting here has no hope.

694
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,000
Because

695
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
there is a handsome boy named Qin Yue

696
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,640
waiting for her at Jing Hua.

697
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,680
- Handsome boy named Qin Yue?
- Really?

698
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
It was the same person
who spoke at the oath ceremony.

699
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,520
Don't listen to Gu Xiao Man.

700
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,470
I don't have one.

701
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,470
Okay, drink it, no fun at all.

702
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,400
Xiao Man, what are you talking about?

703
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,280
This idiot, I don't mean to say you.

704
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,640
Yi Chuan is coming.

705
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,000
Gu Xiao Man!

706
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,350
This is for you!

707
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,070
Oh!

708
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,310
Before, because of early love,
I caused trouble for you.

709
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,520
That's my fault, I shouldn't have
written letters to you.

710
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,400
I made you be punished for me.

711
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,560
Sorry!

712
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,680
Not at all!

713
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,640
Not at all!

714
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,710
Do not worry!

715
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,470
You're not my type.

716
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,070
Chen Yi Chuan!

717
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,520
How can you say that?

718
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,880
Don't do it if you
don't know how to apologize.

719
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,350
Why don't I know how to talk?

720
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,590
Where did I go wrong?

721
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,760
I can't understand.

722
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,950
After graduating, do you even think
you are the class monitor, Xia Lin Xi?

723
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,680
I'm not the class monitor,
I'm also your sister.

724
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,760
Xiao Man!

725
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,520
Hey, don't listen to his nonsense!

726
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,880
He is the type of person
that will never grow up.

727
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,520
Stupid Chen Yi Chuan!

728
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,640
I want to drink treachery water
and forget him.

729
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,920
How crazy is he!

730
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,710
Xiao Xi, you know,

731
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,190
from secondary to high school,

732
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,950
I only liked Chen Yi Chuan.

733
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,560
I treated him so well, with all my heart.

734
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,040
Why does he keep treating me like that?

735
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,520
You also know that

736
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,000
Chen Yi Chuan is always
behaving badly from an early age.

737
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,840
Is Chen Yi Chuan an idiot?

738
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,630
I think you're also an idiot.

739
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,230
It's you who is an idiot.

740
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,910
Two of us don't have a future.

741
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,800
We've all graduated from high school,

742
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,150
we also cannot live as ourselves once.

743
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,870
Oh.

744
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,560
So

745
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,800
wish when we come into university,

746
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,080
we can live as we want.

747
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,390
University!

748
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,280
University!

749
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,630
Xia Lin Xi!

750
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,080
At university,

751
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,280
you have to become the freest Xia Lin Xi.

752
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,870
Freedom!

753
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,600
I also don't need to suffer like that.

754
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,600
Don't think about him anymore!

755
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,150
He's gone out of my mind.

756
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,190
Oh!
