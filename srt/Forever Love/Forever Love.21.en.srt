<i>Goodbye, Brother</i>

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,879
Come on.

21
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,720
Do you want some more?

22
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,679
-Waiter, get us some more beers.
-Okay.

23
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,759
-Sir, your beer.
-Thank you.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Enjoy yourselves.

25
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,360
It's your first time to
work in a company, right?

26
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,600
How do you feel?

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,479
Tell me about it.

29
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,279
Well,

30
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,240
I think

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,240
the work itself is interesting,

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,679
but the fights in the workplace

33
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,440
are boring to me.

34
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,039
Let me tell you.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,160
You should focus on

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,440
learning in the company.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,360
Nothing else matters.

38
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,679
Those

39
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,880
childish fights

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,600
have nothing to do with you.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Come on.

42
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,360
Jiang Zheng Han.

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,759
Do you know that

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,919
whenever I look at you,

45
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,000
it seems like that
I look at myself back then.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,880
Were you this handsome like me?

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,039
I was

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,360
the same as you.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,199
I've got talent.

50
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,600
I've got dreams.

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,039
I've taken up responsibilities.

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
I thought I could do anything.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,320
I wouldn't be restrained by any rules.

54
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,800
The whole world knelt at my feet.

55
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,160
Therefore,

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,800
we would easily get envied.

57
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,360
You have to be careful now.

58
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,360
Back me up

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,919
if I have some trouble with others

60
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,160
in the future

61
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,200
that I can't solve by myself.

62
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,799
You pick up the crooked things

63
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,760
quite fast.

64
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,119
What if I quit,

65
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,600
who can you count on to cover your back?

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,920
You have to learn to
deal with the problems yourself.

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,279
What do you mean by that?

68
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,040
It's just an example.

69
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,559
You're still so young.

70
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,959
You have a great future ahead of you.

71
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,320
Okay.

72
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,679
I

73
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,760
won't let you down.

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,799
It's not about letting me down.

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
You shouldn't let yourself down.

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,679
Cheers.

77
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,320
Come on.

78
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,480

<i>The Second Half of Freshman Year</i>
I was grounded the whole vacation by my mom.

80
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,399
-That's too bad.
-Xiao Man!

81
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,239
Xiao Xi?

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
-Qiu Yan?
-Qiu Yan! What a coincidence!

83
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
What a coincidence.

84
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,519
Well, Qiu Yan,

85
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,279
you've become even more beautiful
after the vacation.

86
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,519
That's so sweet of you.

87
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
By the way, haven't Chen Yi Chuan

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,000
and Zhang Huai Wu come together with you?

89
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,559
They're helping Xiao Xi
with her stuff now.

90
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,839
Qiu Yan,

91
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,079
can you take my case to the dorm for me?

92
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,160
I have something else to do
and will go to the dorm later.

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
Are you going to the gathering then?

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,640
Yes, but later.

95
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,679
And,

96
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,799
don't tell Jiang Zheng Han
that I've come back.

97
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,799
I see, you want to surprise him.

98
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,959
Well, you know it.

99
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,640
Thank you two for helping me.

100
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,959
-I shall go now.
-Go ahead, Xiao Xi.

101
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,320
-Okay, see you in the evening.
-Bye-bye.

102
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,079
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

103
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,000
-Qiu Yan, you're getting more beautiful.
-Let's ride in my car.

104
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,239
Xiao Man.

105
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,519
I've been wanting to ask you

106
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,440
why Duan Ning didn't come to pick you up.

107
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,880
He? Why would he pick me up?

108
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,079
I didn't tell him.

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,959
You fought?

110
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,519
No.

111
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,920
I haven't really replied his WeChat messages
during the vacation.

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,920
So,

113
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,959
you haven't been with Duan Ning at all.

114
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,959
Am I right?

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,959
You only did it

116
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,799
to upset Chen Yi Chuan.

117
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,239
How could I upset him?

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,959
I went to Sanya with my parents
for the Spring Festival

119
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,760
just to avoid thinking about him.

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,440
Don't mention him.

121
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,279
I'm so angry whenever I hear his name

122
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,679
that I don't want to
live on this planet anymore!

123
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,799
Xiao Man.

124
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,239
Yeah?

125
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,839
If you still like him,
just admit this feeling.

126
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,839
If you are over him, just let him go then.

127
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,839
Don't make yourself sad
because of a man, okay?

128
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,119
How about
having something delicious together?

129
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,760
You've got a point.

130
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,920
Let's go have a nice meal.

131
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,839
Food is the only thing

132
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,720
that can make me happy in this world.

133
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,600
-Right after dropping the luggage.
-Okay.

134
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,239
-Xia Lin Xi!
-Coming!

135
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,279
The last pieces, right?

136
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,279
Yes, the last.

137
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,359
Thank you both.

138
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,359
What are you doing now?

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,079
You've literally moved

140
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,480
brother Zheng's home
from Jiangming to here.

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,399
What do you think she's doing?

142
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,519
She just wants to be closer to the company

143
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,559
where Jiang Zheng Han
has been doing internship.

144
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,239
Well, are you going to
live with Jiang Zheng Han?

145
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,559
That's nonsense.

146
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,399
Chen Yi Chuan,

147
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,519
don't you start any rumors.

148
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,920
I just moved back to the dorm.

149
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm warning you,

150
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,000
if you tell others about this again,

151
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,040
I'm going to burn

152
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,399
all your Snoopy into ashes,

153
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,119
then put them in a little box,

154
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,720
and I'll hand-deliver them
to your dorm room.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,320
That's enough, sis Xia.

156
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,480
If you keep on frightening Chuan,

157
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,279
he's going to pee his pants.

158
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,679
Cut the crap.

159
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:12,279
How can you threaten me?
I've helped you a lot, okay?

160
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,160
I won't help you next time.

161
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,200
My smart brain

162
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
isn't created to lie to my aunt

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,119
every time you need help.

164
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,720
-Next time…
-My mom wouldn't know

165
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,000
that I failed my exam if not for you.

166
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,040
I didn't shove you off the train

167
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,920
only because you're my brother.

168
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
That's enough. That's enough.

169
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,239
You two are fighting
every time you see each other.

170
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,880
Come on, let's move all these stuffs.

171
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,359
Let's go. Come on!

172
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,359
You two can go ahead

173
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,559
to the gathering after this.

174
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Sis Xia, aren't you going?

175
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:39,719
Well,

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,440
I gotta unpack those stuffs first.
I'll go later.

177
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:42,760
Okay.

178
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,799
By the way,

179
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,919
don't

180
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,280
tell Jiang Zheng Han.

181
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,359
-Okay.
-Okay, I know.

182
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,679
Have a drink, brother Zheng.

183
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,840
Zhang, I want some ribs.

184
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,039
Ask Chen Yi Chuan! He's so close to you.

185
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,159
No, thank you.
It's too oily. I'm on a diet.

186
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,080
I...

187
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,919
I want salad instead.

188
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,039
-Xiao Man…
-Come on, everyone.

189
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,080
We haven't seen each other for so long.

190
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,119
Let me propose a toast to you.

191
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,400
-Long time no see.
-Come on! Come on!

192
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
Staying with you guys is so much fun.

193
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,599
-It's so boring staying home alone.
-Come on!

194
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,679
I've been waiting to
see you guys for so long.

195
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,359
Really, I've finished my drink!

196
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,559
Don't have so much.

197
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,799
Stop it.

198
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,559
Brother Zheng,

199
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,000
I heard that you abandoned sis Xia

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,359
and came back on the seventh day
of the Spring Festival.

201
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,559
Were there any problems at work?

202
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,039
What do you mean by "abandon"?

203
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,599
That was because of
an emergency of the company.

204
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,479
Okay.

205
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,119
But it will return to normal
after the semester begins.

206
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:50,359
Okay.

207
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,840
Well, absence

208
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,159
makes the heart grow fonder.

209
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Then do you know
when Xiao Xi's going to come back?

210
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,679
She told me she'd arrive tomorrow.

211
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,119
Don't you know?

212
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,799
No.

213
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,400
As long as I know.

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,520
Jiang Zheng Han,

215
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,159
you care about Xia Lin Xi so much,

216
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,080
even I can't stand that.

217
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,960
It's disgusting.

218
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,719
Wait a minute!

219
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,719
What is disgusting?

220
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,919
What happened?

221
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,599
He performed action art

222
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,919
in my uncle's Moments!

223
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,119
-Really?
-So disgusting.

224
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't.

225
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,359
Brother Zheng, well done.
You've impressed her parents.

226
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,200
Chen Yi Chuan, you…

227
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,799
Come on, tell us
what kind of action art that was?

228
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,860
-Poems!
-No.

229
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,080
-Poems?
-No.

230
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,559
Extremely embarrassing.

231
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,320
Come on. Show us!

232
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
-Let me see.
-Let me see.

233
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,159
-Come on! Show us.
-Let me see.

234
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,039
Chen Yi Chuan!

235
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,880
I said I didn't.

236
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,599
<i>Moments: Xia Bei Hai</i>

237
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,359
-It's meant to be...
-I have to go to the restroom.

238
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,960
No, you must stay here.

239
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,880
You have to hear this.

240
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,159
I hope you don't throw up
after reading this.

241
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,039
-It's meant to be...
-Let me see.

242
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,799
I met Lin Xi.

243
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,679
It's my turn.

244
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,080
Our beauty is

245
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,599
in her prime.

246
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm going to throw up.

247
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,880
I can't listen to it anymore.

248
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,159
I'm most fortunate

249
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,239
to meet uncle.

250
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,840
I won't regret to be a member of the Xias.

251
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,919
Period.

252
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,440
Wait!

253
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,640
Uncle Xia replied that

254
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,640
-"great poem, Jiang".
-"great poem, Jiang".

255
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,039
-Great poem.
-Great poem.

256
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,640
-It's so awkward.
-Come on.

257
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,479
-So awkward.
-Just eat.

258
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,280
For the first time

259
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,640
in my life,

260
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,599
I sympathize with

261
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,239
Chen Yi Chuan.

262
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,919
What do you mean?

263
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,200
I said that because

264
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,440
he suffered so much

265
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,919
from watching

266
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,880
this "action art".

267
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,840
Cheers.

268
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,760
Jiang Zheng Han,

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,440
if you do this kind of action art

270
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
in the Moments again,

271
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,159
my uncle would be

272
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,159
the 17th person I blocked.

273
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,599
Can you stop?

274
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,479
Mr. Jiang,

275
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,919
I suggest

276
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,400
you start a lesson in our Chinese Dept,

277
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,620
called "Embarrassing Poems Writing".
It would be very popular.

278
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,230
Let me tell you.

279
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,520
-It would be embarrassing enough.
-Of course!

280
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,479
Though the form remains to be discussed,

281
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,880
Jiang's love to Xiao Xi is rather pure.

282
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,159
It seems that

283
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,479
-uncle Xia was happy, too.
-Yeah.

284
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,359
Amazing.

285
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,080
I really can't bear with you.

286
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,919
What's wrong with you?

287
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,880
He's old.

288
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,039
Talent Jiang.

289
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,640
-What?
-Since Xiao Xi is not here,

290
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,159
tell us

291
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,159
what are the advantages and disadvantages

292
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,320
of having such a perfect girlfriend?

293
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,799
Right. Tell us.

294
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,760
We swear that

295
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,159
we would never tell Xiao Xi.

296
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:57,960
Right.

297
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,359
Disadvantages?

298
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,679
There are too many disadvantages.

299
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,320
Too many?

300
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,359
Like stars in the sky.

301
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,239
Stars? That's really a lot.

302
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,760
-What about advantages?
-Stars? That's a lot.

303
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,919
-No.
-No?

304
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,239
Just one.

305
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,919
She's like the sun.

306
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,320
When the sun comes out,

307
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,640
you can't see any stars.

308
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,320
That's so cheesy!

309
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,159
Oh no.

310
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,400
I can't eat anymore.

311
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,239
Don't tell Xiao Xi about this.

312
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,640
-She's going to be cocky.
-We won't.

313
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,559
-That's hard to say.
-We have to think it through.

314
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,440
My god!

315
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,119
-Whose hands? How dare you touch them?
-Right!

316
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,520
Whose hands are you touching?

317
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,799
Do you know whose hands?

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,599
Not only dare I touch them,

319
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,479
I dare kiss them as well.

320
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,919
I need to stay away from you two.

321
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,479
Are you surprised?

322
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,520
-Do you miss me?
-No.

323
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,880
Didn't you say that
I had many disadvantages?

324
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
Didn't you?

325
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Why did you tell me that
you would arrive tomorrow?

326
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,520
We haven't seen each other for so long,

327
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,840
have you missed me?

328
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,400
Have you?

329
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,200
Of course.

330
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,960
The internship must be very tiring.

331
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,039
It seems you've lost your weight.

332
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,200
You look toilworn.

333
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,679
Do you need to work overtime today?

334
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,760
Today...

335
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,559
I don't have to

336
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,400
work overtime today.

337
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,880
Really?

338
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,239
Let's have a walk.

339
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,679
Where do you want to go? Let's go.

340
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,400
Let's go together.

341
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,520
Well,

342
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,200
if you don't have to work,

343
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,840
let me take you to a place.

344
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Where are we going?

345
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,080
I've prepared a surprise for you.

346
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,640
Let's go.

347
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,760
Come with me.

348
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,000
Come on.

349
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,799
We're getting in.

350
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,159
-Come here.
-Slowly, slowly.

351
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,679
Just stay there.

352
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,280
Let me hang the coats first.

353
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Where are you?

354
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,239
Coming.

355
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,919
Coming.

356
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,400
Okay.

357
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,200
Have a guess.

358
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,719
We're not

359
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,239
in a B&B for couples, are we?

360
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,760
No!

361
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,359
Then, where are we?

362
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:05,799
Well.

363
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,840
Okay, let me take it off.

364
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,520
Okay.

365
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,599
Are you ready?

366
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:15,960
Yes.

367
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,119
Three.

368
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,159
Two.

369
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,000
One.

370
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,640
What do you think?

371
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:25,880
What do you think?

372
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,320
You know what,

373
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,200
these were all specially transported from Jiangming.

374
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,239
I did a great job restoring it, right?

375
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,479
And look,

376
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,640
it's only

377
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,359
five minutes' walk to XV.

378
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,960
And have a look at this street.

379
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,760
Turn right,

380
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,000
and you could
find a delicious breakfast diner.

381
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,280
And here's

382
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,760
a convenient store that
opens for 24 hours.

383
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,320
You don't know

384
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,520
how much trouble

385
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,880
I've gone through to get this closet here.

386
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,280
And this sofa.

387
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I especially went to

388
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,239
the flea market to buy this

389
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:04,199
to match the style of this secret base.

390
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,000
Lin Xi.

391
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,680
Yeah.

392
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,000
Thank you.

393
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,640
Xia Lin Xi,

394
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,839
how lucky am I

395
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,800
to meet you?

396
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,880
Why are you suddenly saying these?

397
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,000
Lin Xi.

398
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,000
It's been a year.

399
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,839
How did you think of this surprise?

400
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:09,520
It's close to your office,

401
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,880
so, you don't have to
sleep in the company.

402
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:15,160
It's more convenient for your internship.

403
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,800
Then am I

404
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,800
benefiting from you if I live here?

405
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,959
I have the contract for
the ownership of you.

406
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,400
Behave yourself.

407
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,479
I owe you too much.
I can never repay them.

408
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,160
I can only give myself to you.

409
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,640
You've done so much for me.

410
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,839
Is there anything I can do for you?

411
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:43,920
Yeah.

412
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,079
You just…

413
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,239
Just make much money,

414
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
and

415
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,160
repay me.

416
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,319
In the end,

417
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,680
you can

418
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,479
buy the stars as a gift for me.

419
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,640
Stars?

420
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,880
I'll remember it.

421
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,040
Are you nervous?

422
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,760
Are you not ready

423
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,199
to give yourself to me?

424
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,239
You took a cold bath?

425
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,359
How could you tell?

426
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,680
Because there's no heat around your body.

427
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,680
This is my pay card.

428
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,199
Here you are.

429
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,359
If you need money

430
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,719
in the future,

431
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,280
use it first.

432
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:54,680
Take it.

433
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,800
You don't have to.

434
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,400
You've given me a computer.

435
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,400
Why can't I give you a card?

436
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,239
I can't repay all once,

437
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,439
then pay by installments.

438
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:08,880
Here.

439
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:10,760
Take it.

440
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:19,000
Okay.

441
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,160
How did you know

442
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,239
that I would continue
the internship at XV?

443
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,760
Because

444
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,719
I can read your mind.

445
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,160
The internship at XV is a golden chance.

446
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,839
You could improve the ability there.

447
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,239
Participate in more projects.

448
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,160
You love programming, after all.

449
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,839
You can even read my mind now.

450
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,719
It's settled.
I'm going to have my internship

451
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,199
at Lion Group.

452
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:54,560
-That company belongs to Qin Yue, right?
-Qiu Yan.

453
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,839
-Lin Xi, long time no see.
-Shi Ying.

454
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,839
When did you come back?

455
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,359
I just arrived yesterday.

456
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:02,319
Isn't this lesson

457
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,800
only for freshmen?

458
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,959
How come you are here, senior?

459
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,319
I spent the second semester of my freshmen year
in Britain for academic exchange.

460
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,239
Therefore, I missed this lesson.

461
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,880
So I

462
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,959
come back here to

463
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,319
gain the credits

464
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,199
before the internship starts.

465
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,199
I see.

466
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:20,920
Guess at which company
she is having her internship?

467
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,520
Why should I guess?

468
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,160
Oh, could it be

469
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,199
that...

470
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,439
Lion?

471
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,119
Yeah, Qin Yue's company.

472
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,160
Wow, congratulations.

473
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,439
-Thank you.
-Does Qin Yue know about this?

474
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,839
He does.

475
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,400
But I didn't tell him
about this in advance.

476
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,560
I just sent my resume.

477
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,920
Shi Ying, you're so amazing.

478
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,359
You don't need to
pull strings with the boss.

479
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,920
Hasn't the teacher arrived yet?

480
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,760
Zhuang Fei.

481
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,199
The teacher is here.

482
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,520
Hello, all.

483
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,280
I'm Ms. Wu,
the teacher for your practice lesson.

484
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,760
I'd like you to
form groups of four people.

485
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,119
Then you could discuss and study
your projects in your groups.

486
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,959
To save your time,

487
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,280
let's form the group
on the basis of roommates.

488
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,000
If there're less than four people in a dorm room,

489
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,560
you could come to me to make some changes.

490
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,959
In this way, it's more convenient for you

491
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,640
to have discussion after class.

492
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,839
If you're clear with what I said,

493
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,719
you could change your seats.

494
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:28,719
I'm going to

495
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,640
distribute the materials to every group.

496
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:47,560
While you're changing the seats, I would…

497
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,959
How about us four
starting a group together?

498
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,800
In this lesson, we will mainly focus on

499
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,359
simulating an investment bank.

500
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,520
In this lesson…

501
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,000
Xiao Xi, I don't mean to be narrow-minded,

502
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,280
but why is she always in your sight?

503
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,160
We still have to
live together in the future,

504
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,640
just ignore her now.

505
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,439
Let's go.

506
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,439
Zhuang Fei.

507
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,280
You heard what Ms. Wu said, right?

508
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:16,839
Then how about us four starting a team?

509
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,760
Try to improve your abilities
of collecting data

510
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,400
-Okay.
-and analyzing problems

511
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,199
by analyzing the project.

512
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,199
Come on.

513
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Great.

514
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,199
The four of us are a team.

515
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,800
You're going to help me finish the project

516
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,119
and get me the credit, okay?

517
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,319
Okay, senior.

518
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,400
You're the team leader.

519
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,239
You're the boss.

520
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,000
Okay.

521
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,359
Xiao Xi.

522
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:48,239
Yes.

523
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:50,239
Are you really going to
move back to the dorm?

524
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,680
Then I would live more often
in the dorm, too,

525
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,560
in case you would get bullied.

526
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,439
-Really?
-Sure.

527
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,079
Thank you, Qiu Yan.
You're such a great friend.

528
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:00,680
Well,

529
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,359
you know I moved out of that apartment

530
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,439
for another one closer to
Jiang Zheng Han's company.

531
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,199
But that's too far from the university.

532
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,560
I can only spend the weekends there.

533
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,599
That's the surprise

534
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,119
for Talent Jiang you mentioned?

535
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:13,959
Yeah.

536
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,599
Does your mum know about this?

537
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
How could I let her know?

538
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,560
I'm just a freshman, and she already
arranged blind date for me.

539
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,760
She would punish me severely

540
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,800
if she knows that
I'm still with Jiang Zheng Han.

541
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,079
Blind date?

542
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,280
Xiao Xi,

543
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,199
you've had quite an exciting vacation.

544
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:33,839
Yeah.

545
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
With whom?

546
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,119
With your childhood sweetheart, Qin Yue,

547
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,119
right?

548
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,760
So smart of you.

549
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,199
-Really?
-Yes.

550
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,079
But I messed it up.

551
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,199
You don't know

552
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,560
how I felt when I came home

553
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,959
and saw the whole family of Qin Yue there.

554
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,760
I was almost crazy!

555
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,599
Tell me about it, god!

556
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,239
Nothing much.

557
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,959
I just pretended to be an alcoholic
and a shrew the whole time.

558
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,280
Qin Yue.

559
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,880
Hello, Shi Ying.

560
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,400
-You...
-Long time no see.

561
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,199
I heard that you're here for the credits?

562
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:26,599
Right.

563
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:27,880
By the way,

564
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,239
I didn't see you

565
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,359
when I reported at Lion that day.

566
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,040
Oh.

567
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,439
I've heard about it.

568
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,640
I wasn't at the company for a few days.

569
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,359
How about you tell me in advance

570
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,199
before you go to the company next time?

571
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,040
Sure.

572
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,280
How about

573
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,800
dining together?

574
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,280
Well, I…

575
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,439
I'm going to…

576
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,959
Hello, Qin Yue!

577
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,359
Long time no see!

578
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,359
Yes, long time no see.

579
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,160
Qin Yue,

580
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,560
why didn't you come to

581
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,640
the gathering of
the Student Union last time?

582
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,800
I…

583
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,640
I have an idea.

584
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,239
How about we all dine together today?

585
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:02,199
Qin Yue's treat, I will pay.

586
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,880
Senior Shi Ying is
always thinking for Qin Yue.

587
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,640
What a perfect match.

588
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,760
I'm very sorry,

589
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,040
but I already had plans today.

590
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,439
Therefore,

591
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,839
let me treat you all another day.

592
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,959
Sorry. Sorry for today.

593
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,000
-Sorry.
-What is going on?

594
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,800
-Senior.
-Xiao Xi.

595
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:18,640
Hi.

596
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:19,560
Xiao Xi.

597
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,160
-Brother Qin Yue.
-Hello, senior Qin Yue.

598
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,880
What is going on here?

599
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,359
Isn't Xia Lin Xi's boyfriend

600
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,760
Talent Jiang?

601
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,959
The girl really got something.

602
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,359
The two dreamy boys
of Jing Hua University.

603
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,959
Shi Ying,

604
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,319
isn't she your roommate?

605
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,959
What kind of person is she on earth?

606
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,920
Sorry,

607
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,959
I still got things to do, gotta go.

608
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,880
-Wait, Shi Ying. She's gone?
-Shi Ying!

609
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,640
I was having a lesson just now.

610
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,040
I didn't check my phone. Sorry.

611
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,160
Do you want to

612
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,839
dine together?

613
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,400
Well, I have already asked Qiu Yan
to dine with me.

614
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:01,239
Yeah, we'll dine together.

615
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,800
Then how about having me in?

616
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,920
I can use this chance

617
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
to know Qiu Yan better.

618
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,119
Okay.

619
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,400
What do you prefer then?

620
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,479
Seafood or Japanese cuisine?

621
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,920
Brother Qin Yue, you don't have to
take us to such expensive places.

622
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,560
Let's just go to the cafeteria.

623
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:20,920
Okay, sure.

624
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,239
Then let's go.

625
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,239
Okay.

626
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,599
Senior, are you okay?

627
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,079
I'm okay.

628
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,920
I'm just feeling a little uncomfortable.

629
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,359
I'm going back to rest.

630
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,719
Senior, do you know that

631
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,079
Qin Yue and Xia Lin Xi had a blind date?

632
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,350
<i>Cafeteria</i>

633
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,920
Let's sit here.

634
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm going to get us trays.

635
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,959
Let me get it.
You two can have a talk.

636
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,160
Xiao Xi,

637
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,319
the credit of the program
is going to be recorded.

638
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,520
You can ask me anytime

639
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,719
if you have any questions.

640
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,479
Thank you.

641
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,800
I can do it myself.

642
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,880
You're already a senior.

643
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,319
You must be very busy.

644
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,959
Don't bother yourself to help me.

645
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,760
I think you may

646
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,439
have some misunderstandings about me

647
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,680
from the gathering last time.

648
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,839
-I was…
-It has already passed.

649
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,280
It's my mum's fault, too.

650
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,400
She tried to make a wrong match.

651
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,680
I acted very weirdly that day.

652
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,839
You parents must be
very unsatisfied with me.

653
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,599
But I don't want to apologize, either,

654
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,520
because I don't want
any other misunderstandings.

655
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,400
They've known you since you were little,

656
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,280
-your behavior that day wouldn't make them…
-Brother Qin Yue.

657
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:51,239
I believe I've made it
very clear to you last time.

658
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,920
Let's just have a meal.

659
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:54,640
Okay?

660
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,599
Okay.

661
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,920
Let's go get something to eat.

662
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:15,599
Let me do it. Wait a minute for me.

663
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,640
How did it go?

664
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,439
We've talked it out.

665
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,959
Hello, Xiao Xi.

666
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,880
I've just received my new clothes.

667
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,199
But it doesn't fit me.

668
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,680
Come to my dorm and try it on
when you're free.

669
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,319
I haven't gained weight!
I just bought the wrong size.

670
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,920
Yes, the class just finished.
I'm at the cafeteria now.

671
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
The cook is already off duty.

672
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,920
I almost missed dinner! I'm so hungry.

673
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,119
Okay then. Don't forget about it.
Love you!

674
00:31:59,479 --> 00:31:59,920
Alas.

675
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,199
-Hello.
-Hello.

676
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,040
Xiao Man.

677
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:11,319
Slow down. It's all yours.

678
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,199
Why are you here?

679
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,800
Didn't I tell you

680
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,079
that I had lessons tonight,

681
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,719
and I would go straight back
to dorm after dinner?

682
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,719
You don't have to accompany me.
Just take care of your own business.

683
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:22,560
I'm glad to accompany you
as long as I can.

684
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:28,760
Don't eat this.

685
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:33,599
This!

686
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,439
Isn't this my favorite Dongpo Pork

687
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:37,000
from the restaurant outside the east gate?

688
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,160
A new branch in the university?

689
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,479
No, I especially
went there to buy you this.

690
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:43,280
Have it while it's still hot. Have a try.

691
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:49,119
How is it?

692
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:50,920
Nice.

693
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,760
Duan Ning, thank you.

694
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,640
You're welcome.

695
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:04,640
Chen Yi Chuan can never do this for me.

696
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,640
It's nothing.

697
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,880
Running errands for my fairy

698
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,239
is what I should do.

699
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,119
Wait.

700
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,560
Hello, there are still people here!

701
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Why did she turn the light off?

702
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,319
I... I haven't finished my dinner yet…

703
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,280
Wow,

704
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,319
Prince Duan, you even prepared this?

705
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,199
It's quite amazing.

706
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:40,439
Wait.

707
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,479
When the flowers and sages
in the plain are decaying,

708
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,199
in the temple on the mountain
is the peach blossoming.

709
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Smell it.

710
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,800
Does it smell good?

711
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,280
It smells like peach flowers.

712
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,719
Yes. Do you like it?

713
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,959
Come on, have your meal.

714
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,520
Is it the same taste as you remembered?

715
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:14,320
Duan Ning.

716
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,439
I think we should end it.

717
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,479
I mean, we should break up.

718
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,199
Sure.

719
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,479
Wait,

720
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,760
aren't you upset?

721
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Come on,

722
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
why would I be upset?

723
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:38,560
I knew it from the beginning

724
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,199
that you agreed to be with me

725
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,919
because you wanted to

726
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:42,959
upset Chen Yi Chuan.

727
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,120
You've known it all the time?

728
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Of course.

729
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,639
I brought it up

730
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,439
to go along with your plan
and teach him a lesson.

731
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,879
Well,

732
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,760
now that you don't want to
do this anymore,

733
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,280
of course, I could drop the act.

734
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,919
You should have told me earlier,
I was so nervous.

735
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
You have

736
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,719
always been so naughty.

737
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,520
Tell me how much it cost.
I'll transfer it to you.

738
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,040
You can

739
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,320
take the candle back

740
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,159
and attract some other girl with it.

741
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,479
Well,

742
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,080
no matter what you say,

743
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,639
this is a so-called break-up meal.

744
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,879
It sucks to talk about money.

745
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,760
And you

746
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,800
could keep the candle.

747
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:26,360
I bought it just for you.

748
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,879
Don't you like the scent of peach flowers?

749
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,479
Okay.

750
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,719
Thank you, Duan Ning.

751
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,639
You're welcome.

752
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,919
It's pretty late now.
You may go back first.

753
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,719
I can go back to the dorm myself.

754
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,280
Sure.

755
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,040
Okay.

756
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,280
Then I'll go. Have a great meal.

757
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,719
Okay.

758
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,439
Enjoy yourself.

759
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,520
Okay.

760
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,840
Ma'am.

761
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:07,679
Yes.

762
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,199
Thank you.

763
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,080
Lin Xi.

764
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,639
I've made a plan

765
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,679
for our recent working arrangement.

766
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,840
Qiu Yan and Zhuang Fei
have already got their assignments,

767
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,239
have a look at your part.

768
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,239
Okay.

769
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,679
Senior,

770
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,919
the data on the report

771
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,320
is different from what I've found.

772
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,439
There might be some mistakes.

773
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,840
Maybe you need to
check the data more carefully?

774
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,000
I understand what you're talking about.

775
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,959
This is the next step in my plan.

776
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,360
It would be difficult for me

777
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,679
to finish the work within today
according to the form.

778
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,840
Really?

779
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,719
According to the form,

780
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,760
I've only asked you to organize the data.

781
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:23,439
Going by the current situation,

782
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:25,120
I have to redo loads of data comparison…

783
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,600
Lin Xi, everyone was assigned with

784
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,760
heavy work.

785
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:30,199
I hope you could think more for the team

786
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,000
instead of trying to
evade your responsibility.

787
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,760
Okay?

788
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,050
<i>Jiang Zheng Han</i>
I have to work overtime today.

789
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,500
You can go home first.

790
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,679
You could sleep first if you're tired.
Don't wait for me.

791
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,159
I would finish work late, too.
