00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:59,319
Wow, president and vice-president
appear at the same time.

23
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,919
Yeah, this is the top
dream couple of Jing Hua University.

24
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,559
Wow, really a perfect match.

25
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,720
I wonder what their daily life looks like.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,080
Judging from this,
it must be like an idol drama.

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,000
Dear leaders, teachers,

28
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,119
classmates.

29
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,199
-Good evening.
-Xiao Xi.

30
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,919
How could senior Qin Yue do that?

31
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,160
How could he partner with
anyone other than you?

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Don't just set up couples as you like.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,839
-I'm Qin Yue from the Computer Dept of Year 2012.
-What?

00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,080
Nothing. Keep watching.

It's a moment to highlight
our Jing Hua University's vision.

41
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:41,759
-Also a moment to show our university's spirit.

in the ACP contest this time.

49
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,800
As an eighteen-year-old main force

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,279
exceptionally admitted by
Jing Hua University's Computer Varsity,

51
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:06,679
Jiang Zheng Han's problem-solving ideas
are like bamboos sprouting.

52
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,839
He is even more
adept at facing difficulties.

53
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,399
His performance has won not only praises

54
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,919
from many domestic colleges
and universities,

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,039
but also compliments from
top ACP players abroad.

56
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,919
In the contest, he perfectly shows
the spirit of Jing Hua University.

57
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,639
It's Jiang... Jiang Zheng Han...

58
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,559
It's Jiang Zheng Han!

59
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:30,880
Next, let us invite
the protagonist of this video,

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,080
also the representative of freshmen
in the Computer Dept,

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,360
Jiang Zheng Han to deliver a speech.

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,639
Applause please.

63
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,399
Thank you very much for your
warm applause to Jiang Zheng Han.

64
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,320
Among young and talented students,

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,960
I have to say that freshmen of Year 2014...

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,520
-...are really talented.
- It's really him!

67
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,880
-Not someone with the same name.
-Especially Jiang Zheng Han standing next to me.

68
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,839
He's not only specially admitted by

69
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,559
the Computer Dept of Jing Hua University
through his computer expertise,

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,320
but also becomes the first freshman player

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,559
in the history of
Jing Hua University's computer varsity.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,759
Congratulations on our computer varsity
entering the National Finals.

73
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,759
Let's expect better results
from them in the future.

74
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,920
Sit down! Hurry!

75
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,399
Hmm...

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,760
Hi, everyone.

77
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,559
I'm Jiang Zheng Han,
a freshman of Year 2014.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,839
First of all, I want to say that

79
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,440
this honor

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
doesn't belong to me alone.

81
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,720
It belongs to all members of
Jing Hua's computer varsity.

82
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,320
Under the help of them,

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,279
and also because of

84
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,600
a very important promise I made,

85
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,920
I've become a better me.

86
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,839
Thanks to Jing Hua's computer varsity
for recruiting me exceptionally,

87
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,559
which gave me the opportunity
to improve myself

88
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:00,040
by competing with top players
in the computer programming contest.

89
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,519
I also appreciate it that Jing Hua
admits me exceptionally,

90
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,320
-so that I can stand here now.
-Professor Shi spent three days persuading him!

91
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
As a member of Jing Hua University.

92
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,640
Thanks to the inclusive
and liberal philosophy of Jing Hua,

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,519
we were enabled to

94
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,920
achieve such a good result
in the ACP contest.

95
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,320
Here,

96
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,359
I want to say thanks to
Jing Hua University's computer varsity.

97
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a warm team.

98
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,760
That we won the gold award

99
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,600
results from our hard work together.

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,079
Actually, being able to
enter Jing Hua University

101
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,200
has a very special meaning to me.

102
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,000
Because it represents

103
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
the completion of

104
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,399
the most important promise in my life.

105
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,839
It's a deal then.

106
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,839
We will go to Jing Hua University together.

107
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,399
Mr. Jiang.

108
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,440
It's pretty hard to
get in Jing Hua University.

109
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,679
But I believe if you work hard,

110
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,000
you can get in eventually.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,480
Hey.

112
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,959
Pink promise.

113
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,920
Let's secretly ally at your secret base.

114
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,920
How old are you now?
Still pink promise? So childish.

115
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,440
No.

116
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,799
-Come on, let's do it!
-No.

117
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,760
-Do it!
-No.

118
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,359
Do it!

119
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,440
Deal.

120
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:17,119
Our varsity needs a substitute.

121
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,640
So I recommended you to Professor Shi.

122
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
He is pretty interested in you.

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,760
And he hopes you can
take part in our training

124
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,359
-and join the ACP Contest...
-Sorry.

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
It will delay me to earn more money.

126
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,119
I've given you enough money
to pay for your father's surgery.

127
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,920
Are you going to do
part-time jobs for a lifetime?

128
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,920
It's my own business.
I will handle it by myself.

129
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,000
Zheng Han, Jing Hua has a precedent
of admitting varsity members exceptionally.

130
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,239
As long as you can play, you'll get
a chance to be admitted.

131
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,279
You really don't want to
go to the college?

132
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,480
How many precedents

133
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,559
for exceptional admission?

134
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,839
Only one.

135
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,239
Thanks, everyone.

136
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,040
-Bravo!
-Bravo! Bravo!

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,720
Next, let's welcome
the freshmen representative,

138
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,000
Xia Lin Xi from
the Dept of Economics&Management,

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,079
to deliver a speech.

140
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,239
Please applaud.

141
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,279
Go for it! Come on!

142
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,160
Xiao Xi.

143
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:19,720
Bravo!

144
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,399
Here she is.

145
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,880
Hello, everyone, my name is Xia Lin Xi.

146
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm a freshman from
the Dept of Economics&Management.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,799
First of all, I'm particularly honored
to represent freshmen of Year 2014

148
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,640
to give a speech in the entrance ceremony.

149
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,519
When I entered
Jing Hua University yesterday,

150
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,320
I felt extremely proud.

151
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,359
I believe you all feel the same way.

152
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,160
In my opinion,

153
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,760
we should cherish the learning conditions
created by Jing Hua University

154
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,160
work hard,

155
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,279
and stay positive.

156
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:22,880
Xia Lin Xi.

157
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,399
Xia Lin Xi.

158
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:29,880
Xia Lin Xi.

159
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,400
Wait.

160
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,479
Jiang Zheng Han,
didn't I make it clear to you?

161
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,440
We should stop
interfering with each other.

162

Why do you keep following me?

163
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,159
I just want to tell you.

164

I'm here just for you.

165

was all for you.

I came to Jing Hua University.

170

What is our relationship?

00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,679
Are we classmates, or friends?

Have you done that?

177

You just left.

178
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,719
You didn't reply to any messages
throughout the summer vacation.

179

You disappeared for no reason

180
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,520
and didn't contact anyone.

181
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,280
You think that is extremely cool?

182
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,280
And stylish?

183
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,280
And it will make me remember you for good?

184
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,679
Lin Xi, I actually ran into
a special situation back then.

185
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,440
My dad...

186
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,119
My family was kind of in trouble.

187
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,880
So I had to come to Beining first.

188
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:58,159
But then,

189
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,799
after I knew I had a chance
to get in Jing Hua University,

190
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,960
I went to the training camp.

191
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,479
But since then, my phone was confiscated.

192
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,479
-So I...
-So you entered Jing Hua University.

193
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,520
And successfully became a computer talent.

194

You are so mysterious yet eye-catching.

195

But for all the honor,

196
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,679
since you don't need my participation,

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,559
I'm not interested in it in the future.

198
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,440
No, Lin Xi.

Look at you.

204
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,719
Were you rejected
when confessing your love?

205
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,159
I didn't.

206

She didn't even give me a chance.

Haha.

you young people can't work, either.

328
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,400
Now you don't want to?

329
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,200
Don't you want to lose weight?

330
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:59,559
No, no, I really can't bear this.

331
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,679
I admit that my idea of ​​losing weight
is a bit overestimated.

332
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,680
Between food and Xiao Chuan,

333
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,800
let me think about it for two more days.

334
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:09,719
Alas.

335
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,800
Xiao Man.

336
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,640
Ah?

337
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,920
Let's pick food.

338
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,640
Sure.

339
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
Let's pick food.
I don't want to run anymore, either.

340
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,800
Yeah, food, food. You're the boss.

341
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,079
-Alas.
-Come on!

342
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,319
I can't run anymore.

343
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,280
Gu Xiao Man.

344
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:31,920
Um?

345
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,760
I will never listen to you again.

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
You only mean it for three minutes.

347
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,560
I will listen to you from now on.

348
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,880
I'll pick food.

349
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,839
I'm so exhausted.

350
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,439
I was woken up by you early in the morning.

351
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,640
Yes.

352
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:45,880
Um?

353
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:47,959
Good morning.

354
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,719
Jiang Zheng Han?!

355
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,719
Good job.

356
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,119
Stuffed buns!

357
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Thank you, old friend.

358
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,760
Um.

359
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,280
Well...

360
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,760
Why didn't you
attend the graduation party?

361
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,319
You didn't
take the graduation photos, either.

362
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,800
But now, look at you.

363
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,239
You've become the computer talent
of Jing Hua University.

364
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,160
Amazing.

365
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,000
Just eat it. I bought it for you.

366
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,360
A relationship is about buying breakfast,

367
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,400
picking her up and sending her back.

368
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,800
In short, step by step. Daily happiness.

369
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,959
What's going on?

370
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,119
Stuffed buns?

371
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:37,959
Haha.

372
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,920
There must be something
going on between them.

373
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
I don't like stuffed buns.

374
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,959
But now I...

375
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,319
I can only get stuffed buns.

376
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,479
Try it. Maybe you will like it.

377
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,640
There are a lot of things to expect.

378
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,599
But this, definitely no.

379
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,920
But... I... This is...

380
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,400
Hey, don't!

381
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,079
Alas.

382
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,079
Xiao Xi, stuffed buns are good.

383
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,640
I think it's great.

384
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
As long as there is food,
everything is good to you.

385
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,880
-Zheng! Zheng!
-You have no principle.

386
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,439
-Zheng! Zheng!
-I heard stuffed buns here are delicious.

387
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,479
Why are you here?

388
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,640
We come here to see you.

389
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,439
Yeah, we're here for you.

390
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:13,119
Well, this...

391
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,000
This...

392
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,359
This is your girlfriend?

393
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,119
Wow.

394
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,719
She is great.

395
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,719
Yeah, she's great.

396
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,880
She's indeed beautiful.

397
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,800
What are they talking about?

398
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,920
It's worthy that Professor Shi
scolded us for half an hour.

399
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,280
You single loser.

400
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,760
Hey.

401
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,560
You really don't
have anything serious to do?

402
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,760
Hi, seniors.

403
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,959
Hi. Hello.

404
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,359
I don't know what Jiang has told you.

405
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,319
But I think
he hasn't made it clear to you.

406
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,959
Or you guys have misunderstood something.

407
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,719
I'm not his girlfriend.

408
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,119
And I barely know him.

409
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,479
It's not possible.

410
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,439
I'll show you something.

411
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:40,920
Right!

412
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:42,880
Hey, hey, hey!

413
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:43,680
Wait.

414
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,520
See?

415
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,839
Is this you?

416
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,119
-Right?
-Yes!

417
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:49,719
Hey!

418
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,640
-Wow.
-I told you, I've seen her on this.

419
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,880
That's right, I assure you.

420
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,880
Hey.

421
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,439
-See? This is also you.
-Don't hush.

422
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,959
Yes, isn't it you? Isn't it?

423
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,479
Yes, this is definitely you.

424
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,119
There must be a misunderstanding
between you and him.

425
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:03,760
Right.

426
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,959
You are mad
because Zheng didn't do it enough.

427
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:06,359
Yes, that's right.

428
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,040
Listen to me.

429
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,239
This thing was made by Zheng's own hands.

430
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,439
Right. Right.

431
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,760
-Look, here's more.
-Wow.

432
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,359
Look.

433
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,760
-So detailed!
-Yes.

434
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,560
This...

435
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,280
What is this?

436
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,199
Parametric equation of the cardioid line.

437
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,880
And 3D parameter proxy.

438
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,199
Yes.

439
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,680
Simply, it is a love shape

440
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,280
expressed in numbers.

441
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:33,920
What is the chemical equation behind?

442
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,599
I also asked this question back then.

443
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,040
Do you know the answer?

444
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,119
It's the chemical formula of...

445
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,119
-Hey, hey, hey!
-What are you doing?

446
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,000
Xia Lin Xi.

447
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:48,599
I need an explanation,
right now, right here!

448
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,839
I don't know anything. I'll go to class.

449
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:52,760
Mrs. Jiang!

450
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,640
Xiao Xi!

451
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,479
-She's leaving?
-Bye-bye.

452
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,680
Hey, don't be mad.

453
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:01,800
Hey.

454
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,160
Zheng!

455
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,160
-Which one do you refer to?
-Him!

456
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,920
So good-looking and handsome.

457
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
-Hey, I'm here.
-Coming, coming.

458
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,160
Qiu Yan.

459
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,599
Qiu Yan, Qiu Yan,
anyone sitting beside you?

460
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,860
<i>Xia Lin Xi</i>

461
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,439
Sit there.

462
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,040
It's you again.

463
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:38,880
Sit down.

464
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,439
How did you know my class is here?

465
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,199
Network technology.

466
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,800
Jiang Zheng Han,
stop making trouble, okay?

467
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,160
I won't sit there.

468
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:53,319
You are not allowed to
investigate me again.

469
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,160
Stop doing such boring things.

470
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,719
Lin Xi, it is already taken.
Just sit down.

471
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,000
Wow, he is so handsome.

472
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,800
What are you doing?

473
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,439
Anyway, this is the seat
that I've taken for you.

474
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,800
Wherever you go, it'll always follow you.

475
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,119
Just sit.

476
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,040
I took it specially for you.

477
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,199
The seat you are most used to.

478
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,040
The one who was speaking
as a representative.

479
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,640
It's her.

480
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,460
<i>Xia Lin Xi</i>

481
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:49,680
Ouch.

482
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,599
I'm sorry.

483
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,079
Huh?

484
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,400
Come in, please.

485
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,599
Hello, senior.

486
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,280
It's you.

487
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,160
Hey, aren't you Jiang
from the computer varsity?

488
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,839
This is my application
form to reopen the Math club.

489
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,239
A senior said
that I need to hand it in to you.

490
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,479
Please register for me.

491
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,800
Your application is not qualified.

492
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,640
It can't pass.

493
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:35,719
Go back.

494
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,479
Why does it fail?

495
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,199
I can change it right now.

496
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,520
Well, can't you understand me?

497
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,079
Unqualified, can't pass.

498
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:58,560
Got it?

499
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,839
I fill in every column
on the form as required.

500
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,640
What do you mean that it's unacceptable?

501
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:05,920
Junior man.

502
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,880
Let me tell you the truth.

503
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,839
A new club here is not something
you can apply to open as you like.

504
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,359
There are so many clubs.
I have to review one by one.

505
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,560
It's all about work.

506
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,160
Just leave your form here.

507
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,319
Then god knows.

508
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,000
Give me a convincing reason.

509
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,000
Otherwise I can only take it as
you taking advantage of your position

510
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,479
to make trouble for me.

511
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,640
Whatever you said.

512
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't need to explain it to you.

513
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,239
Alright, alright, I got it.

514
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,640
-Okay, on my way.
-Ah, ouch!

515
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-You!

516
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,719
It's okay. Keep going.

517
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,280
Hi.

518
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,359
Hi, are you okay?

519
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,439
No worries.

520
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,359
Let me see.

521
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,079
Let me take you to the infirmary first.
Come.

522
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:09,839
Be careful.

523
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,760
Wait for me, hold on.

524
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,640
Come.

525
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Give me your hand.

526
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,599
Slow down.

527
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,479
Let's go.

528
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,280
Sit well.

529
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,560
Thank you.

530
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,479
It's okay.

531
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:39,839
Be careful not to fall off.

532
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,079
Does it hurt?

533
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,880
No, no.

534
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,520
Xia Lin Xi.

535
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,599
In my novel, the hero is always Qin Yue.

536
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,119
I've supported
a wrong couple for so long?

537
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,760
Talk about it.

538
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,439
What happened in high school
that I didn't know?

539
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:25,280
What romantic story?

540
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,280
You got it wrong.

541
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,239
There is nothing between me and him.

542
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,479
Xiao Xi, you've changed.

543
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,599
You've really changed.

544
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,760
Now, you are even lying to me.

545
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,359
Won't you feel sorry about it?

546
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,599
No, you won't.

547
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:47,280
But if you could tell me now,

548
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,479
I will still forgive you.

549
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:52,280
Xiao Man, what can I say to you?

550
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,239
Okay, how about this.

551
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,400
Let's dine out tonight. My treat.

552
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,359
Hmm...

553
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:02,119
Don't you want to use dinner
to stop me digging this time.

554
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,079
Okay, you said that.

555
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,199
It's not that I didn't invite you.

556
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,199
Don't regret.

557
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:06,920
Hmm...

558
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,680
I'll go back to the dorm
to get the textbook.

559
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,000
Hey!

560
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,760
Xiao Xi! Xiao Xi!

561
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,280
I was just acting,
why did you leave?

562
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:20,839
Alas...

563
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,199
Poor Qin&Xia couple.

564
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,079
I have to write a bad ending for you.

565
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:27,680
Ah.

566
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,000
Hi, Lin Xi.

567
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,359
-You come back.
-Yes.

568
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,880
Look, the doctor said that

569
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,479
you should move as less as possible.

570
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,920
Remember?

571
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,640
Zhuang Fei.

572
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,680
What's wrong with you?

573
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,479
It's okay. I just fell down.

574
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,119
Shall we go to the school infirmary?

575
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,560
She has already been there.

576
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,079
Our new computer talent helped her.

577
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,280
Zhuang Fei got rescued on time.

578
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,800
The talent that she mentioned

579
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,000
is Jiang Zheng Han.

580
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,000
Have you adjusted to life here, Lin Xi?

581
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,400
I'm doing great.

582
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,719
Are you moving back to the dorm?

583
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:23,079
I worked too late
on something in the Student Union.

584
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,719
So, I'll stay with you in the dorm today.

585
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:26,319
Oh, right.

586
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,839
From now on, if there are classes at night,
I won't go home.

587
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,239
Alright.

588
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,479
Well,

589
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,640
as you see it,

590
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,199
should I

591
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:38,959
specially say thanks to Jiang Zheng Han?

592
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,839
Of course.

593
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,000
Oh, right.

594
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,119
Lin Xi, I heard that

595
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:47,760
Jiang Zheng Han was also
from Jiangming No.1 high school.

596
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,280
So you're supposed to know him, right?

597
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:49,640
Ah?

598
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,160
I don't know him.

599
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,479
He...

600
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,239
He was actually my high school classmate.

601
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,800
But I was only focusing on studying.

602
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,520
So I didn't know too much
about my classmates.

603
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,880
Also he rarely came to school.

604
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
So, I'm not familiar with him.

605
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,239
What are you talking about?

606
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,479
Food?

607
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,560
Xiao Man.

608
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,520
Are you familiar with Jiang Zheng Han
since high school?

609
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,040
No, I'm not.

610
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,000
But someone is.

611
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:25,000
Why does everyone suddenly
care about Jiang Zheng Han?

612
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,119
Zhuang Fei sprained her ankle.

613
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,400
Jiang Zheng Han got her to the infirmary.

614
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,640
Zhuang Fei wants to thank him.

615
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
Jiang Zheng Han?

616
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,520
Is he so warmhearted and friendly?

617
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,160
Ah, my high school classmate,
Jiang Zheng Han.

618
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,079
Since he came to Jing Hua University,

619
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,520
he has surprised me a lot.

620
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,560
What... What's wrong?

621
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,520
What's wrong?

622
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,400
How could I know?

623
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I only know

624
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,839
that Jiang Zheng Han

625
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,239
was a trouble in our school.

626
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:05,280
He fought with teachers and didn't study.

627
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
He was the worst student in the class.

628
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,000
So, it truly surprised me that

629
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,079
he could come to Jing Hua University.

630
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,479
How about you, Xiao Xi?

631
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:15,880
Ha...

632
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,880
Enough, let's stop talking about him.

633
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,319
Alright, my dear freshmen girls.

634
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,839
As a tradition of Jing Hua University,

635
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,400
I will treat

636
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,719
all the freshmen girls
in our dept to dinner.

637
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,680
Come join us.

638
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,119
Okay.

639
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,920
Senior, I'm not in your dept.

640
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,680
May I join you?

641
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,640
Shi Ying.

642
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,199
Sorry about that,
she has always been like this.

643
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,680
Of course, come join us.

644
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,959
Senior,

645
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,959
I have a date with my boyfriend tonight.

646
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,520
We can dine another day.

647
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,839
-Then it's a deal.
-Alright.

648
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:44,959
Okay.

649
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,680
Just be careful.

650
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,760
You will be fine a few days later.

651
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,359
Okay.

652
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,199
What did you just do?

653
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,599
What? Did I say anything wrong?

654
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,000
Alas.

655
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:54,760
Anything wrong?

656
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,359
Xiao Man, you know how to read palmistry?

657
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm good at it.

658
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,959
Please help me take a look.

659
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,490
<i>Message from Qin Yue</i>

660
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,640
Xiao Xi, don't forget that
we'll dine together tonight.

661
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
I'll pick you up.

662
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,530
<i>Sorry...</i>

663
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,550
<i>Xiao Xi, don't forget that
we'll eat together tonight.</i>

664
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,920
I'm sorry.

665
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,079
Brother Qin Yue.

666
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,040
I almost forgot.

667
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,959
I will be late for a while.

668
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,439
Just send me the address.

669
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,520
I'll go by myself...

670
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,280
Who is that?

671
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,959
No one.

672
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,280
Zhuang Fei, please help me
get some drinks over there.

673
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,680
Okay, thank you.

674
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,119
Hold on a second.

675
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,439
-Lin Xi, Xiao Man, you are here.
-Senior.

676
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:45,880
Hey.

677
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,319
Right.

678
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,199
I'll introduce to you,

679
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,760
they're our fellows.

680
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,680
This is Lin Xi, and this is Xiao Man.

681
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,719
-Today you know each other.
-Hello.

682
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:55,599
Okay, I'll take you over there.

683
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,560
-You guys go and sit there.
-Sure.

684
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,239
Wow.

685
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,959
How is it going? Come.

686
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,400
So you guys talk first.

687
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,839
-I'll go over there and take a look.
-Okay.

688
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,359
-Okay, bye. Thank you.
-Okay.

689
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,319
So fancy!

690
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:08,959
Xiao Xi.

691
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,560
I think it may not be good for me to
profit from you every day.

692
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:16,680
Hey, how come I didn't find
you're so thin-skinned just now?

693
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,560
Don't try to fool me.

694
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,280
Our friend-ship is about to sink.

695
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Tell me the truth.

696
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,319
-You, Jiang Zheng Han and Qin Yue...
-Gu Xiao Man.

697
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,680
If you bring his name up again,
I will really get mad at you.

698
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,239
Anyway, I'm leaving soon.

699
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,479
You just eat by yourself.

700
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:38,400
You know the people in my dorm anyway.

701
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:41,040
Wait, where are you going?

702
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,359
Qin Yue asked me to have dinner today,
but I forgot.

703
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,719
Qiu Yan just said she couldn't come.

704
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,880
I'm afraid senior will think
we don't respect her.

705
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,000
So, I want to stay here for a while
and then leave.

706
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,560
Why you're laughing? Just eat.

707
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,000
You can go.

708
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,719
It's great that the couple I support
didn't break up.

709
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:00,760
-I know you...
-Gu Xiao Man.

710
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,400
I didn't mention Jiang Zheng Han.

711
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,760
Two more cups of juice.

712
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,520
Okay, I'll see.

713
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,439
Greeting, boys and girls.

714
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,880
Why you come to the dinner of our dept?

715
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,280
He Guang Yu, you are so boring.

716
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,800
Why?

717
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,599
Is it fun for a group of girls
to eat together?

718
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,839
Moreover,

719
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:27,520
hey,

720
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,599
do me a favor.

721
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:32,839
I'm particularly interested in
one of your new girls.

722
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,239
I got attracted.

723
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,880
But she told me
she has a boyfriend.

724
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,839
I don't know if it's true or not.

725
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,800
I have to figure it out today.

726
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,920
Here he is, Xiao Xi.

727
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,280
What are you doing?

728
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,319
Lin Xi,

729
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,719
we meet again.

730
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,359
Hey,

731
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,880
you said that you have a boyfriend.
Is it true?

732
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,520
Let me be your boyfriend,
what do you say?

733
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,159
Do you want me to
give you an answer today?

734
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,479
Yes.

735
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,840
Whether I have a boyfriend or not,

736
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,239
you are not my type.

737
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,120
And I advise you not to confess to a girl

738
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,520
in public like this next time.

739
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,719
You will be embarrassed,
so will everyone else.

740
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,120
Let's go.

741
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,479
I'm sorry, senior.

742
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:41,120
I have a friend waiting for me.
I'm leaving now.

743
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,000
Sure, off you go.

744
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,840
We can choose another day.

745
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,840
Lin Xi.

746
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:44,919
Hey! You!

747
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,919
How about this?

748
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,760
A toast to you, as my apology.

749
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,320
May I?

750
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,159
I can't drink.

751
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,159
No one can drink at first,
but gradually they can.

752
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,120
My apology.

753
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,120
-Senior.
-Gu Xiao Man.

754
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,239
If you want to apologize,
why do you make Xiao Xi drink?

755
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,439
I'll drink, too.

756
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:07,800
You!

757
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:12,040
Is it funny
to bully freshmen girls like this?

758
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,120
Who are you?
Are you invited here?

759
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,560
I'm sorry, senior He.

760
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,840
Xia Lin Xi and Gu Xiao Man
were my high school classmates.

761
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:57,320
There was a rule in our high school class.

762
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,639
Girls don't drink.

763
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,199
If you really want to drink,

764
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:05,840
then beat me in drinking at first.

765
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:09,120
Jiang Zheng Han.

766
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,239
Xiao Xi, he comes to help us.

767
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,040
Just let him be.

768
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:35,959
Senior He.

769
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:39,560
Next,
a toast to our thriving college life.

770
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,159
Jiang... Jiang Zheng Han.

771
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,040
You're just a freshman,
save that social style.

772
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,800
Look.

773
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:48,879
I will be unconscious
if I drink this bottle out, you know?

774
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:49,600
Senior.

775
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,320
What?

776
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,879
Didn't you suggest that first?

777
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,439
Well, let's stop drinking.

778
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,840
It's so tedious.

779
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,959
I'll pay all the bills today, okay?

780
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,719
We have to make the girls happy, right?

781
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,479
Senior, you at least drink up this first.

782
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,679
Otherwise, I will have regrets

783
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,239
in my college life.

784
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,719
Enough, stop drinking.

785
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,879
Jiang Zheng Han, you should stop, too.

786
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,280
Everyone is here for the party,
not for drinking.

787
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,679
Senior, don't rush to drink.

788
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,399
We got enough time in the future.

789
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,959
Why don't you drink?

790
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,840
Keep going?

791
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,719
Come.

792
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:58,879
Jiang Zheng Han, it's not easy for you
to enter Jing Hua University.

793
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,919
Don't make trouble.

794
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,479
What?

795
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,760
Caring about me?

796
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't be crazy.

797
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,919
Senior, I'm sorry, I gotta go now.

798
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,560
Wait.

799
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,800
Xiao Xi, you're leaving now.

800
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,879
But Jiang Zheng Han is still inside.

801
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:29,600
That's his business.

802
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:32,040
I'm going to meet Qin Yue now.

803
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,399
If you don't want to stay there,

804
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,919
go back to the dorm and wait for me.

805
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:39,159
Hey!

806
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:41,639
But, but Jiang Zheng Han...

807
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,000
Don't you worry about him?

808
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,760
Xiao Man.

809
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:50,959
You... You should go back.

810
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:53,760
We're all from the same high school.

811
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,080
You...

812
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,040
Just go back and take care of him.

813
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,320
Don't let him get into trouble.

Gotta make Jiang Zheng Han suffer.

-Go, go, go.
-Careful.

Are college students so scary now?

00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:46,360
Damn it! Xiao Xi!

824

He Guang Yu is going to beat
Jiang Zheng Han with another four boys!
