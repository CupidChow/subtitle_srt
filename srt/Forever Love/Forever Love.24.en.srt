Are you tired?

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,000
I took some time to
go shopping this afternoon.

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,040
Plus,

22
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,199
a project meeting.

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,480
I have worked there

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,879

There is a clue.

-Steamed crab dumplings.
-Okay.

-Hot-pot.
-Hot-pot.

-Every single one.

I did, actually.

Tell me the truth.

46
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,960
Is it a bad thing that I failed

00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,279
to make you chubby?

48
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:40,080
I think you are more like a bad guy now.

49
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,240
Just write down
whatever you want to eat on it.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,440
I can't think of anything else.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,600
What's this?

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,919
Caramel macchiato.

53
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,360
This is definitely not caramel macchiato.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
Tiramisu. Tiramisu.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,880
Is this tiramisu?

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,559
This is chocolate cake.

57
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,160
Chocolate cake looks like this.

58
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,199
Shall we go to try this barbecue?

59
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,039
We can roast by ourselves.

60

-It's delicious with the sauce.
-By ourselves?

61

No.

73
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,559
A project?

74
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
It's just...

75
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,040

Is the money enough?

79
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,760
If not,

80
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,040
use the pay card that I gave you.

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,799
How could I be short of money?

82

You encounter any problems
with the project,

85
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,480
feel free to let me know.

88

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,839
any findings recently?

Aunt, here is the thing.

140
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,840
I know I've lied to you
back in high school,

141
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,440
which made you misunderstand me.

142
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,159
I admit that it was my fault.

143
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,840
But please let me explain it.

144
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,159
It was because
my family was in a bad situation.

-I...
-Your family live in the old town.

you sold out the company's data.

There's a serious problem
with your character.

-Aunt...
-I'm not biased against you

152
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,479
due to what happened back in high school.

153
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,200
I just feel that a breakup

154
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,239
is good for both of you.

155
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,719
Although you two are
living in harmony now,

156
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,520
I'm sure that within a few years,

157
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,159
there will be conflicts.

158
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,320
Then you'll regret it,
have fights and even cold wars.

159
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,200
Finally you'll say good-bye to each other.

Although I have nothing now,

167
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,280

168
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,880
Understand?

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,479
Sure, aunt.

170
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,479
I know you don't want Lin Xi to suffer.

171
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,320
I don't, either.

172
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,039
If you can think more for her,

173
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,080
just break up with her.

174
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,039
I assure you that

175
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,200
my current situation will not last long.

176
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,960
I know what you are thinking now.

177
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,880
You must be cursing me.

178
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,799
So don't pretend in front of me.

179
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,239
I am not.

180
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,239
Aunt.

181
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,239
You gave Lin Xi her appearance.

182
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,280
You educated her personality

183
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,080
and cultivated her hobbies.

184
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,359
The more I like her,

185
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,719
the more I respect you.

186
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,320
If so,

187
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,840
there is nothing to talk about between us.

188
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,799
Jiang Zheng Han.

189
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,719
If you still have self-esteem,

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,039
you should break up with her tonight.

191
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,630
<i>...XV has made a decision
about the leak...</i>

192
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,150
<i>...an intern from Jing Hua University...</i>

193
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,670
<i>From Jiang Zheng Han:
Lin Xi, I gotta leave for days.</i>

194
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,170
<i>Can't wait for you,
but I've cooked dinner...</i>

195
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,599
Hey, Miss Xia.

196
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Miss Xia, why are you in such a hurry?

197
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,559
What's up?

198
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,679
Between a student and a teacher,
what else can it be?

199
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,840
I have a few questions unsolved.

200
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,479
So I want to ask you for help.

201
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,479
I have something urgent to do.
Let's talk later.

202
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,440
Hey. Hey.

203
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,200
Didn't you tell us in the first class

204
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,880
to feel free to ask you any questions?

205
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,239
So you were lying.

206
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,840
Okay, what's the question?

207
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,799
This page, and this page.

208
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,559
And all these pages.

209
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,119
I can't solve any one of them.

210
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,840
Miss Xia, please

211
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,799
write down all the answers for me.

212
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,239
Isn't this your homework?

213
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
You should finish your homework first,

214
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,200
and then ask me questions
that you don't know.

215
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,239
Am I clear, Xu?

216
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,039
I came to ask you just because

217
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,440
I knew nothing about them.

218
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,039
My mom told me,

219
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,359
we've paid for it,

220
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,559
we should get the best teaching service.

221
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,320
Miss Xia.

222
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,679
I really don't want my mom

223
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,159
to complain about you again.

224
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,719
Xu Fan.

225
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,239
The teaching level of Miss Xia

226
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,400
is just average.

227
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,239
She can not explain well

228
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,840
the questions that I left for you.

229
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,159
If you have any confusion, just ask me.

230
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,719
Besides, Xia Lin Xi,

231
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,080
since Xu Fan has been
transferred to my class,

232
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,039
he is my student.

233
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,200
You should not be the one to teach him.

234
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,400
I came here earlier than you,
I'm more experienced.

235
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,320
And I teach better than you.

236
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,080
Stop showing off your IQ here.

237
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,400
What?

238
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
What what?

239
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,799
He is on me now.

240
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,719
Just go.

241
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,559
Xu Fan, since you have many questions,

242
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,320
let me teach you one by one
in the classroom.

243
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,440
Where are you going?

244
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
Why are you back?

245
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,640
Where are you going?

246
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,640
I'm going on a business trip.

247
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,000
Is... Is it really

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,559
a business trip?

249
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,119
What's up?

250
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,520
What happened?

251
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,400
Nothing.

252
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,320
I feel a little panic

253
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,679
because of your sudden leave.

254
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:14,280
Xie Ping Chuan and I
have some work to finish.

255
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,320
I will be back in about a week.

256
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,599
Our schedule is very tight.

257
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,159
Sometimes we have to work
in the computer room,

258
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,200
where the signal is bad.

259
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,520
If I fail to reply your WeChat messages

260
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,039
or phone calls,

261
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,000
it's normal.

262
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,719
I will reply to you as soon as I see it.

263
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:30,760
Okay?

264
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,640
Well...

265
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,400
I'll wait for you to come back.

266
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,039
Remember to use

267
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,320
the pay card that I gave you, understand?

268
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,479
Understand?

269
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,239
Have meals on time.

270
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,640
Go to bed early.

271
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,200
-Okay?
-Don't worry about me.

272
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,320
You are going away
on business for so long.

273
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
Take good care of yourself.

274
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
I will be back soon.

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,760
Hug.

276
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,760
Hug.

277
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:38,400
Xiao Xi.

278
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,040
Slow down.

279
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,400
You were absent-minded in class.

280
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,199
And you look so depressed now.

281
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,040
Are you too tired from working?

282
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,160
I am not tired from working.

283
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,839
I'm just worried about Jiang Zheng Han.

284
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,800
He is really in trouble.

285
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,079
I've read the news.

286
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,920
XV now is investigating him.

287
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,719
Now everyone on the Internet
is scolding him.

288
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,079
So annoying.

289
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,640
We can't just await our doom like this.

290
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,560
What can we do now?

291
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,079
He is on a business trip.

292
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,839
When will he be back?

293
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,239
I don't know.

294
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,199
Xiao Xi.

295
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,800
Listen,

296
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,040
I... I don't know if I should say this.

297
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,640
In case... Just in case...

298
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,479
If Jiang Zheng Han

299
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,640
can't prove his innocence,

300
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,280
would you still be with him?

301
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,839
Yes.

302
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,079
Then if he can't be clear of suspicion,

303
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,839
or get a foothold in the industry,

304
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,880
but has to bear a lifetime of infamy?

305
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,239
Even if he is universally condemned,

306
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,439
I will bear it with him.

307
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,680
It's okay.

308
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,839
Xiao Xi, don't worry.

309
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,400
No matter what happens,

310
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,920
I will always be by your side.

311
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,560
Let's go.

312
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,280
I really admire Jiang Zheng Han.

313
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,760
And you.

314
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Zhang Huai Wu?

315
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,319
Why is he calling you?

316
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,640
-Hello.
-Hello, sis Xia.

317
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,719
Sis Xia, I'm so wronged.

318
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,560
They framed brother Zheng.

319
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,599
So I scolded them online.

320
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,719
-Now so many people are scolding me.
-Hold on.

321
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,719
Are you... Are you crying?

322
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,079
Take it easy.

323
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,839
It doesn't matter that I am scolded.

324
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,400
But if they don't believe what I said,

325
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,119
how can I get justice for brother Zheng?

326
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,520
No worries.

327
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:45,959
Well...

328
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,920
Listen,

329
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,760
the article slandering brother Zheng

330
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,800
is so terrible and groundless.

331
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,719
I scolded hundreds of people alone.

332
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,239
And they fought back.

333
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,959
Anyway, listen to me,

334
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,439
I've already called Duan Ning.

335
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,599
I've been waiting for you two.

336
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,520
We should unite and scold them back.

337
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,599
Understand?

338
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,400
Understood.

339
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,640
By the way,

340
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,719
Shen Wen Yue said that

341
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,319
according to her judgment,

342
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,920
this was an

343
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,079
organized

344
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,640
and tactic

345
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,760
cyber slander.

346
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,800
Is Shen Wen Yue still in touch with you?

347
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,239
We have always been in touch. Quite good.

348
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,920
She is now an exchange student, right?

349
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,680
She will be back soon.

350
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,959
Good for you, Zhang.

351
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,920
Why didn't you tell us?

352
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,239
It's not a big deal.

353
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,160
Enough, enough.

354
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,199
Stop it. Let's get down to the business.

355
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,599
Yes, yes.
Why did I start talking about that?

356
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,599
Forget it.

357
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,079
Look.

358
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,040
<i>Shocking inside information.</i>

359
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,130
<i>An intern of Jing Hua University
revealed XV's business secrets.</i>

360
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,119
<i>XV SOFTWARE SYSTEM CO. LTD</i>

361
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,000
Inserted a mole?

362
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,620
<i>...the student will be
banned from the industry...</i>

363
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,800
Ran away with money?

364
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,599
And this.

365
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,460
<i>Didn't expect that he's such a person.</i>

366
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,330
<i>A shame to our Jing Hua University!</i>

367
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,430
<i>How could he do such a shameful thing!</i>

368
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,959
Why is it getting more and more serious?

369
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,520
Why are there so many
versions on the Internet?

370
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,160
Come up with a solution now!

371
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,160
No wonder you can't fight anyone!

372
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,760
You can't even scold them back!

373
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,160
Look at this!

374
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,800
-What can I do?
-What can we do?

375
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I can only be anxious here.

376
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,959
Xiao Xi.

377
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,479
How about giving him a call now?

378
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,280
We are all worried.

379
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,839
Jiang Zheng Han definitely

380
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,000
has read these articles as well.

381
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,719
He might be annoyed now.

382
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,560
If I call him now,

383
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,719
he will be even more upset.

384
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:48,439
You just said that we couldn't await here.

385
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,719
Then what can we do now?

386
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,800
Let's scold them back.

387
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,959
-Yes, scold them back.
-Scold them back.

388
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:57,800
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

389
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,520
Let's go.

390
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,239
Can you be faster?

391
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,719
Why are you typing like a granny?

392
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,640
I am so worried.

393
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,719
Here, this.

394
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,319
What?

395
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,920
Xia Lin Xi.

396
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,719
I called for support for Jiang Zheng Han
from everyone at the gate of our university.

397
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:22,959
And I got so many signatures this morning.

398
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,760
I know you did it out of kindness.

399
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,079
But can you find out

400
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,800
the IP addresses of these posters?

401
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,239
What?

402
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,319
This is easy for me.

403
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,760
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

404
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,719
-You... Come here.
-Hurry, hurry.

405
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:36,839
Come on.

406
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,420
<i>Jing Hua University Baidu Tieba</i>

407
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,470
<i>Anyone reads the news
about Jiang Zheng Han?</i>

408
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,839
Does it work?

409
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,439
So, any findings?

410
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,160
<i>Jing Hua University Baidu Tieba</i>
Seventy percent of them

411
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,000
are paid posters.

412
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,400
The remaining thirty percent
are following the trend?

413
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
Duan Ning,
could you please help me with this?

414
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,239
I think it's more than that.

415
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:56,920
What's up?

416
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,959
I don't know.

417
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,079
Maybe I used some uncivilized word?

418
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,400
It's easy.

419
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,959
But brother Zheng is quite popular.

420
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,560
Who on earth
has such a big grudge against him?

421
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,160
Done.

422
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,959
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

423
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,319
What can we do?

424
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,239
In case brother Zheng
is really blocked by them...

425
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,959
But brother Zheng is just a student.

426
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,880
What benefit could it bring them
by blocking him?

427
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
They want to drag others down...

428
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,560
Xiao Man.

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,160
-by blocking Jiang Zheng Han.
-Leave this to me.

430
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,640
Let me help Xiao Man.
Mind your own business.

431
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,239
What can you do?

432
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,359
Xiao Man, leave the technical work to me.

433
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,400
You two can do it together.

434
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,040
I know nothing about this.

435
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,760
Duan Ning.

436
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,839
Summarize the evidence
I collected and post it.

437
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,359
Hum.

438
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,319
I am talking to you.

439
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:51,520
What?

440
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,239
What did you say?

441
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,680
I asked you to do a summary and post it.

442
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,400
Okay then.

443
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,800
Where to post it?

444
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,199
Where to post it?

445
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,640
You even don't know that?

446
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,160
Post it online and expose them.

447
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,880
Well, enough.

448
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,959
You guys first post this analysis
in my name

449
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,640
to the forum on our university's intranet.

450
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,839
Tell our classmates to help forward it.

451
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,160
Stop playing games.

452
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,920
Do you know there is a reverse?

453
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
So strange. Wasn't it confirmed before?

454
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,319
Why is it now...?

455
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,680
You can't see it through?

456
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,400
It's obvious that Jiang Zheng Han is hiring
some supporters to whitewash himself.

457
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,520
By virtue of Jiang Zheng Han's ability,

458
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,839
he does not need to steal the codes!

459
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:37,920
He is capable after all.

460
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,079
Yes, I am Jiang Zheng Han's classmate.

461
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,040
In terms of his capability,

462
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,760
there is no need to do that.

463
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,330
<i>Forward it! So shocking.
Anyone seen this?</i>

464
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,800
<i>How could he do such a shameful thing!</i>

465
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,599
Hello.

466
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,239
Qin Yue, what's wrong with Xia Lin Xi?

467
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,680
Does she also want to try

468
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,199
the taste of being wanted
by the whole network?

469
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,599
Xu Zhi Li.

470
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,640
Stay away from Xia Lin Xi.

471
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,520
Wake up.

472
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,959
Xia Lin Xi is
Jiang Zheng Han's girlfriend.

473
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,599
Now her posts have been
posted on the headlines

474
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,880
of Jing Hua University's forum.

475
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,719
Now, you must

476
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,439
hack in there

477
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,160
to delete all the posts immediately.

478
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,079
I can't manage this.

479
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,760
You can't delete them all?

480
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,079
Qin Yue, you can't even
manage this little thing.

481
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,760
You've ruined my perfect plan.

482
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,079
I advise you to be obedient.

483
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,520
You have written many posts

484
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,000
to defame Jiang Zheng Han.

485
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,800
Now,

486
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,199
you have no right to say no.

487
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,359
Otherwise,

488
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,880
don't blame me for turning against you.

489
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:22,520
By virtue of Jiang Zheng Han's ability,
he doesn't need to steal the codes.

490
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,560
Yesterday, I studied the number
of page views of the article

491
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,400
and the recognition of WeChat images,

492
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,079
which are completely consistent with
the information provided by this poster.

493
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,199
XV needs to give Jiang Zheng Han

494
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,479
a reasonable explanation.

495
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,640
Jiang Zheng Han and I
were high school classmates.

496
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,520
He is not such a person at all.

497
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,959
This kind of false accusations should

498
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,800
make the slanderer be sentenced to prison.

499
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,560
The most unjust case in the IT industry.

500
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,079
Senior executives of XV fought for power

501
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,359
by hiring netizens to
defame an innocent intern.

502
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,520
Jiang Zheng Han
should not be the scapegoat.

503
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,079
Qin Yue.

504
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,959
I thought that between us,

505
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,719
there was either a decent loser

506
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:08,680
or

507
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,040
an honest winner.

508
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,880
<i>Deleting...</i>
Because I think a man

509
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,239
<i>Deleting...</i>

510
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,760
should at least keep the bottom line.

511
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,160
I don't think that I've lost.

512
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:39,010
<i>Dad calling...</i>

513
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Hello, dad.

514
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,040
Hello, Xiao Xi.

515
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,439
What are you doing?

516
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:47,280
I am working on the computer.

517
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,800
Is Jiang with you?

518
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,959
He is on a business trip.

519
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:56,599
On a business trip?

520
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,839
Is everything going well between you two?

521
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,079
Why did you ask?

522
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,520
I just knew that your mom went to Beining

523
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,280
to talk with Jiang alone some time ago.

524
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,680
She might have forced
Jiang to break up with you.

525
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,560
I dare not ask her what they talked about.

526
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,239
I just wanted to inform you.

527
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:18,400
Mom talked to Jiang Zheng Han?

528
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,959
I heard it from your mom that

529
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:25,000
Jiang was in trouble.

530
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,680
Didn't Jiang tell you about

531
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,119
your mom talking to him?

532
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,400
Hello, Xiao Xi.

533
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Are you still with me?

534
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,160
Dad.

535
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
What's up, Xiao Xi?

536
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,280
My heart aches for him. What should I do?

537
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,479
Stop crying.

538
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,959
Dad is with you.

539
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,760
Dad.

540
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,599
What?

541
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,280
Jiang Zheng Han...

542
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,160
What happened to him?

543
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,800
He didn't tell me anything.

544
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,959
He is in a great deal of trouble now.

545
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,640
I know. I know.

546
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,280
And my mom

547
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,280
forced him to leave me.

548
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:10,359
Yes, I got it.

549
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:14,680
He is under tremendous pressure.

550
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,400
But he didn't tell anyone.

551
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:21,760
And he acted like nothing happened.

552
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,280
I am so worried about him.

553
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
I understand.

554
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,040
What should I do?

555
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,280
Good girl.

556
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,640
You have to know that

557
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,479
love

558
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,239
actually contains a lot,

559
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,160
including

560
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,239
selfless help, endurance, giving,

561
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,959
and waiting.

562
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,880
If you firmly choose

563
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,280
to stand by Jiang's side,

564
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,640
you must be ready to suffer

565
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,959
and meet setbacks.

566
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,599
It's really hard.

567
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,280
But I will support you.

568
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,959
I am in favor of you and Jiang.

569
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
Dad.

570
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,319
Thank you.

571
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,359
Why are you back so soon?

572
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,119
Lin Xi.

573
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,760
I have something to tell you.

574
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,839
I have lied to you so many times,

575
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,599
and you must be very tired.

576
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,359
Sorry.

577
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,359
If you continue to be with me,

578
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,479
you will only get more tired.

579
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,199
We should break up.

Lin Xi.

598
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,160
What's wrong, Lin Xi?

599
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,199
What's wrong, Lin Xi?

600
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:14,520
I thought you would never come back.

601
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
How could I not come back?

602
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,439
I thought my mother scolded you away.

603
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,079
How did you know that?

604
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,719
If my dad hasn't told me,

605
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,800
would you choose to never let me know?

606
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,760
Isn't it cold?

607
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,359
Come here.

608
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,280
What did my mom tell you?

609
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,199
Nothing special.

610
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,679
She asked me to work hard

611
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,879
and give you a better future.

612
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,520
I don't believe you.

613
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,199
She wouldn't say so.

614
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,360
I was so scared just now.

615
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,239
I thought you would give up on me.

616
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,360
I am back.

617
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,320
How would I leave you?

618
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,959
How come my independent

619
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,090
and confident Xia Lin Xi

620
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,439
becomes a cry baby now?

621
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:54,719
Stop crying.

622
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,320
Okay?

623
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,639
It's late.

624
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,879
Why didn't you sleep?

625
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:00,399
Um?

626
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,959
Just now,

627
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:05,560
I had a nightmare.

628
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,399
What nightmare?

629
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,959
You were so bad

630
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,199
in the dream.

631
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,679
What did I do?

632
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,439
You said you wanted to break up with me.

633
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,080
In the concept of mathematics,

634
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,560
that is a matter of zero probability.

635
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,959
My mom

636
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:49,840
didn't say anything that hurt you?

637
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,919
Don't worry.

638
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:58,600
No matter what my future mother-in-law

639
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,639
said to me,

640
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,479
she couldn't change my mind

641
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,800
to marry Xia Lin Xi.

642
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:07,040
Be serious.

643
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,360
My problem is solved.

644
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,159
In fact, over these years,

645
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,000
I...

646
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,959
I have earned much money

647
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:17,479
from programming.

648
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,679
My dad's debt is also paid off.

649
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,959
So let me

650
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,399
support you in the future,

651
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,080
okay?

652
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,479
Lin Xi.

653
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Quit the tutor's job.

654
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,719
How did you know that?

655
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,080
I knew it long ago.

656
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,439
But I didn't ask because

657
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,760
you didn't want to say it.

658
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,959
I will be responsible for
your life in the future,

659
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:06,959
okay?

660
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,280
What's going on?

661
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:13,840
Have you read too much
about bossy president novels?

662
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:18,800
I can handle my job.

663
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,439
I don't want to resign.

664
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,639
You can be Mr. Jiang.

665
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,479
But I can't be Miss Xia?

666
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,080
I am worried that you will be tired.

667
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,959
Every job is tiring.

668
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,919
Well, how about this?

669
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,919
I promise you that

670
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:43,479
I will only give three classes a week.

671
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,879
But I won't resign.

672
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,520
Okay.

673
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,800
Sure, you're the boss.

674
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,919
It's up to you.

675
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,399
By the way,

676
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,760
you said the problem was solved.

677
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,000
How?

678
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:07,840
You will know tomorrow.

679
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,679
It's too late today.

680
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,639
You have to go to bed.

681
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,080
Just go.

682
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,600
I'll tell you tomorrow.

683
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,360
Get in the quilt.

684
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,520
Go to sleep.

685
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,199
Have a good dream.

686
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,959
Can I be a good man

687
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,959
in your dream this time?

688
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:51,360
How to be a good man?

689
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,600
Love you.

690
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,040
Love you forever and as always.

691
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,840
It's a deal then.

692
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,479
Pinkie.

693
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,600
Seal.

694
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,239
Go to sleep.

695
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,000
What are you doing?

696
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:44,280
Nothing. I am just practicing typing.

scolding others for me?

700
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,080
If it was not against the law,

701
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,199
their accounts would have been
made disappeared.

702
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,320
I just don't get it.

703
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,439
Why do they dare to
scold you just with a keyboard?

704
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:10,840
I can't hack you,

No.

solved the XV problem?

713

It's eight o'clock.

714
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:41,639
It should be searchable.

715

Is this the result of your business trip?

720
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,520
Yes.

721
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:00,120
Xie is usually unreliable,

722
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,399
but still useful at critical moments.

Breakfast time.

Put down the phone. Breakfast time.

728
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,840
Wait a moment.

729
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,439
I want to forward this clarification post

730
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:56,360
to WeChat Moments, groups of alumni,

731

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,639
Are you really so happy?

733
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,399
Sure.

734

You are finally vindicated now.

735
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:05,760
I wish the whole world would know it.

736
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,159
By the way,

737
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,800
I am curious about

738
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,199
how you did it.

739
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,719
We went to Shenzhen

740
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,280
to find a former subordinate of Xie.

741
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,760
Then we traced back

742
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,800
the process of the leak

743
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,679
and found that the IP address

744
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,919
has nothing to do with us.

745
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:28,560
Then we handed the evidence to XV.

746
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,439
They released the news

747
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,360
in order to calm down the situation.

748
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,040
Eat now.

749
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,840
Well, look.

750
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:46,879
Should I @ my mom?

751
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:49,439
Xia Lin Xi.

752
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,239
I'm going to be jealous of your phone.

753
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:56,520
Can you take a good look at me

754
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,239
and have a meal with me?

755
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,040
Okay.

756
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,959
But we have to eat quickly.

757
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,360
Because I have to
give a class for students

758
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,040
at ten o'clock this morning.

759
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,360
Hurry up then.

760
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:09,479
I will send you there.

761
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,800
Well...

762
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:13,439
Have a try.

763
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:15,840
Although it may be a little burnt.

764
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:18,399
A little burnt...

765
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,280
Yes.

766
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:19,959
Huh?

767
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:22,040
Eat it.

768
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:32,560
Good.

769
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,439
Really?

770
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:52,199
Lin Xi.

771
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,120
Do you think that I can't support you?

772
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:58,000
I trust you.

773
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,719
Although I went to work

774
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:01,199
because my mom refused to give me money

775
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:02,520
at the beginning,

776
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:05,199
after a month of working,

777
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,360
I've found that

778
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,800
behind one's life, action should be given

779
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,159
and price be paid.

780
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,600
Although it is very hard,

781
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,439
I still enjoy

782
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,120
this feeling of self-reliance.

783
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,679
All right.

784
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,399
How did you know that?

785
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,040
I know everything about you.

786
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,439
No matter what choice you make,

787
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:35,199
I will support you.

788
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Finally it's your turn
to do the logistics for me.

789
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,719
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

790
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:41,679
You are welcome.

791
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,919
-I am going to give a class.
-Just go.

792
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:44,879
I am leaving.

793
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,679
Just go.

794
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:51,360
Bye-bye.

795
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:06,679
Coffee for you.

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,479

797
