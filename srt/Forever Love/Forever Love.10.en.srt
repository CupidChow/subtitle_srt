<i>Episode 10</i>
<i>Only Want To Talk To You</i>

20
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,599
-Xiao Xi.
-Yeah.

21
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,400
Look! What happened?

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,639
<i>Xia Lin Xi, you are the firework.</i>
What?

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,639
What?

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,519
Thank you, senior.

25
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,839
-Hello, senior.
-Hi.

26
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,039
Well, then we'll leave this to you.

27
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,919
We might go now.

28
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,479
OK, bye-bye.

29
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,759
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

30
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:19,160
These kids are really dramatic.

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,639
Ah?

32
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,000
Look.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,119
What?

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,759
It seems that your little sister

35
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,440
<i>Xia Lin Xi, you are the firework.</i>
has a boyfriend now.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,759
Here you are.

37
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,520
Please help to take care of
the things here.

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:42,839
Okay.

39
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,160
Hey.

40
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,119
Zheng, Zheng!

41
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,199
Come on, come here.

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,679
We did something

43
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:05,919
big for you.

44
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,960
Look, look.

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,440
See?

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,199
Xia Lin Xi,

47
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,720
you are the firework.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,640
<i>Xia Lin Xi, you are the firework.</i>

49
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,800
It's just that Meng's not good with words.

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
It's the only disadvantage.

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,279
We should find someone from
literature academy to polish it up.

52
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,119
However,

53
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,279
look at this.

54
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,199
Look.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,320
Hey.

56
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,039
Look at the picture.

57
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,160
Isn't it just so awesome?

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,759
What a perfect match you are!

59
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,479
Yeah!

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,880
Whose idea?

61
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,800
A collective idea.

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,559
Yeah.

63
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:48,160
We all talked about this.
Meng's the one who put out the post.

64
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,320
But,

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,240
he used your cellphone.

66
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:54,839
Eh.

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,839
You stole my password?

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,639
Did you?

69
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,679
Um, well...

70
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,440
It's not that complicated.

71
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,759
I was just...

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,880
I noticed your password unintentionally.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,720
So we just typed in.

74
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:07,960
Zheng.

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,119
Take it easy.

76
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,759
After we've watched
dozens of overbearing CEO dramas,

77
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,160
the result predicts that

78
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,640
in less than an hour,

79
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Mrs. Jiang is gonna show up
in front of you, blushing.

80
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,399
Blushing?

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,320
You don't even know her.
She's more likely to be furious!

82
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,200
No, Zheng.

83
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,679
I've already confirmed that

84
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,119
she is just shy with you.

85
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,359
Jiang Zheng Han.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,320
Come out here.

87
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,679
Okay.

88
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,079
Zheng...

89
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,160
<i>Xia Lin Xi, you are the firework.</i>
Explain it to me.

90
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,320
Why would you post something like that?

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,320
Yes,

92
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,799
I know it's childish.

93
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,839
What do you want by posting this?

94
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,679
Are you trying to make fun of me?

95
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm not.

96
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,679
I...

97
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,079
Yes,

98
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,160
it was all my fault.

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,880
My seniors

100
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,480
saw you

101
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
didn't respond to my crush on you.

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
That's why they did that.

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,079
But they really meant no harm.

104
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,959
They don't know you.
They don't know...

105
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,760
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,200
It's all my fault anyway.

107
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,279
But can you just take this as my first

108
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,959
love confession to you?

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,119
It was a bad attempt.

110
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,839
But I'm serious.

111
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
Xia Lin Xi.

112
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I don't wanna just be your
high school classmate.

113
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,480
I mean...

114
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I don't wanna be just a friend to you.

115
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,880
May I chase you?

116
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,119
I want to chase you.

117
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,679
Would you stop making jokes like that?

118
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,320
And,

119
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,839
did you ask me

120
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,480
before you do all this?

121
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,880
Well, then let me ask you this.

122
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,640
Xia Lin Xi.

123
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,720
May I chase you?

124
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,679
Just answer the phone.

125
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,600
Xiao Xi.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,320
Brother Qin Yue?

127
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,640
Xiao Xi?

128
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
You know her?

129
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,640
I grew up with her.

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,959
There's a girl I have to see tomorrow.

131
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
So that girl you were talking about

132
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,359
is her?

133
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,399
Yes.

134
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,839
You guys know each other?

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,880
I said I was staying with a friend.

136
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,479
That's him.

137
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,799
Jiang Zheng Han.

138
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,919
You intentionally posted

139
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,159
that blog.

140
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,599
It wasn't me.

141
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,039
But I'm willing to take responsibility.

142
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,000
I believe you didn't post it.

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
But how would you take responsibility?

144
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,080
I grew up with Xiao Xi.

145
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,679
I know all about her personality.

146
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,400
And I know how much
your childish behavior

147
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,359
would hurt her.

148
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,359
She's a freshman.

149
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,919
How would the teachers and classmates

150
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,799
think of her with a post like that?

151
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
Do you want her to live
her whole college life

152
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,280
with this kind of scandal?

153
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,599
Alright.

154
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,799
You said you'll take responsibility.

155
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,280
Then how?

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,599
If you really mean that,

157
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,280
just delete this post immediately!

158
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,799
Qin Yue,

159
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,239
please stop.

160
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,960
I'm doing this for you, Xiao Xi.

161
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,799
Thank you.

162
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,119
I gotta go.

163
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,719
When did you meet Xiao Xi?

164
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,119
That's also my question for you.

165
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,719
We went to the same high school.

166
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,080
Well, then I probably have met her
a little bit earlier.

167
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,919
I've known her for 15 years.

168
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
I haven't known her that long.

169
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,039
But that doesn't change the fact

170
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,239
that I like her.

171
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,520
What?

172
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,000
You couldn't beat me by strength.
So you came here to run?

173
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,719
I've got a lot of energy.

174
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,000
And you followed me here.

175
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,880
If you're confident,

176
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,359
let's see who gives up first.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,799
Alright then.

178
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,280
Hey, I'm being serious.

179
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,200
You have to delete this post.

180
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,559
I know.

181
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,400
Hey.

182
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,719
You said that

183
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,840
you grew up with Xiao Xi.

184
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,080
Yeah.

185
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,320
I watched her growing up.

186
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,280
Then I'm still one step ahead of you.

187
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,039
After I kissed her,

188
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,559
she doesn't remember it anymore.

189
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,760
Xiao Xi's great.

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,320
It's perfectly normal to be popular.

191
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,479
If I'm gonna be intimidated
when someone else shows up,

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,440
I wouldn't have waited until now.

193
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,520
Well, I'll take a stand if you won't.

194
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm not waiting anymore.

195
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:50,960
Good.

196
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,000
It's a fair fight,
and the lost one quits.

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,599
Then how to determine that?

198
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,520
Love is just a feeling.

199
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,039
There is no win or lose.

200
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,320
You're persistent.

201
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,280
You too.

202
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,080
All right.

203
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,640
I gotta go.

204
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,080
I'll see you later.

205
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,400
Don't run away.

206
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,479
I won't run.

207
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, we'll see what we can do.

208
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,479
See what we can do.

209
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm so touched.

210
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,719
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,840
But can you just take this as my first

212
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,640
love confession to you?

213
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,640
This actress's crying is so fake.

214
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,840
Come on, she's a veteran actress.

215
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,159
Lin Xi.

216
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,400
I feel like something's wrong
with you today.

217
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,520
Nope.

218
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,919
No.

219
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,559
Nothing.

220
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,000
It's a sign of guilty to
repeat a sentence three times.

221
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
Was the post deleted?

222
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,640
Did you ask Jiang Zheng Han about that?

223
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,200
Did you beat the crap out of him?

224
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,000
Or

225
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,719
something else special happened?

226
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,039
Be honest with us.

227
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,080
What are you doing?

228
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,080
A clean hand needs no washing.

229
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,679
This kind of boring gossip

230
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,359
has been strongly condemned by me.

231
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,400
Right?

232
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,520
Hum.

233
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,039
I don't buy that.

234
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,119
-Tell us the truth.
-Tell the truth.

235
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:25,479
Hey.

236
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,719
Who's it?

237
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,359
Gu Xiao Man.

238
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,679
At such late hour.

239
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,280
Why are you still here?

240
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,239
Don't you have a dorm room?
This isn't your home!

241
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,119
What's wrong with her?

242
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:43,960
Ah.

243
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,799
Sorry, I'm leaving now.

244
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,479
Bye.

245
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:02,719
Alas.

246
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,559
Let's get back to our own seat.

247
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,719
Xia Lin Xi.

248
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,960
I don't wanna be
just your high school classmate.

249
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,760
I mean

250
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,520
I don't want to be a friend to you.

251
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,440
Xia Lin Xi.

252
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,840
I want to chase you.

253
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,080
What are you looking at?

254
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,239
Nothing.

255
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,039
Zhuang Fei.

256
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,599
Is there anything wrong with you today?

257
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,800
Let me peel you a pear
and you try to calm down?

258
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,280
Do you think I can't afford a pear?

259
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,520
I'll spend the night at the library.

260
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,520
What's wrong with her?

261
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,839
Who knows.

262
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,260
<i>To Xia Lin Xi: Why you...</i>

263
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,790
<i>Talk to me please. I'm sorry.</i>

264
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,400
Pass it on.

265
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,199
Pass it, pass it.

266
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,000
She's a freshman.

267
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,239
How would the teachers and classmates

268
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,199
think of her with a post like this?

269
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,079
Do you want her to live
her whole college life

270
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,839
with such kind of scandal?

271
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,239
Take the shot.

272
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:09,920
Brother Zheng.

273
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,359
What's wrong with you?

274
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,319
You got piles?

275
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,319
Let me ask you something.

276
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:19,640
Yeah?

277
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,479
-I have a friend.
-Yeah?

278
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:26,199
Someone else is chasing the girl he likes.

279
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,880
What would you do if it was you?

280
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,119
Hit him!

281
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,199
What else to do?

282
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
He couldn't do it.

283
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,800
Scold him then.

284
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,959
He can't either.

285
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:38,479
Then how about

286
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,560
you just throw money at him?

287
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:42,560
Hey.

288
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,959
Can you tell me something useful?

289
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,439
Wait,

290
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
why does it sound like it's about you?

291
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,520
Look, if it was me...

292
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,319
Eh!

293
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,199
Keep your eyes open.

294
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,000
Keep your eye on the ball.
Don't let them go through.

295
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,319
Pass it on.

296
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,479
-Pass the ball.
-"Keep your eyes on the ball."

297
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,079
-"Don't let them go through."
-Shoot!

298
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,640
That makes sense.

299
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,800
Don't let them go through.

300
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,680
I want to chase you.

301
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,239
Oh god.

302
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,400
What is this? Is this real?

303
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,719
I'm gonna chase you.

304
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,880
What's going on?

305
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,640
I'm gonna chase you.

306
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,880
I'm gonna chase you.

307
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,520
I'm gonna chase you.

308
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:46,400
Oh my!

309
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,839
What are you doing?

310
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,040
The English teacher
is doing a recite quiz.

311
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,479
Oh god.

312
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:52,400
Ah.

313
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,079
Recite, recite.

314
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Where?

315
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,800
Here.

316
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,560
Zhuang Fei.

317
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,719
I want you to recite this passage.

318
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,599
OK.

319
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,000
That's enough.

320
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,479
Where are you from?

321
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,439
Your accent...

322
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,439
She's got a good accent, ma'am.

323
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,839
Don't laugh.

324
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,800
Wu Yu Tong.

325
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,920
She took a leave of absence.

326
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,479
Xia Lin Xi.

327
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,719
You continue to recite.

328
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, OK.

329
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,520
All right, enough.

330
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,839
You did great. Sit down, please.

331
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,479
Okay.

332
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,839
Nice job.

333
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,520
Let's do it like this.

334
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,079
We learn in groups today.

335
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,119
And you two team up.

336
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:58,400
Xia Lin Xi.

337
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,800
You're gonna help Zhuang Fei
with her accent.

338
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
OK.

339
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,000
Zhuang Fei, just sit down.

340
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,400
Today we're going to review unit five.

341
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
Please open your book.

342
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,400
Professor,

343
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,839
I can only

344
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,719
get to this stage for now.

345
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,239
I've got a thought,
but haven't found a way

346
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,560
to prove the next steps.

347
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,839
You're a freshman.

348
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,040
It's already beyond my expectation

349
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,640
for you to get this far.

350
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,599
You know,

351
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,239
I made an exception to get you here.

352
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,400
I guess I have a sharp eye.

353
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,040
Professor, you're just
bragging about yourself at last.

354
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,319
Stop.

355
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:55,880
Hi.

356
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,439
Professor Shi, Zheng, you're both here.

357
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,920
I didn't see you just now.

358
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,760
Please keep talking.

359
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,520
I'll leave you two.

360
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,839
-Take your time.
-Get back.

361
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
Did you guys post that blog for Jiang?

362
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,479
No way, Professor. I swear!

363
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,199
I didn't know about this.

364
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,880
It was Meng Zhi Xing.

365
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,640
Yeah, he did that.

366
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,079
Professor, you don't even know.

367
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:26,160
I saw him type the post

368
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,400
with my own eyes.

369
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,920
And you know what!

370
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,400
He even stole Zheng's cellphone password.

371
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,040
That really pissed me off.

372
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,760
But I failed to stop him.

373
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:43,680
Zheng, don't get me wrong.

374
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,599
Jiang.

375
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,959
Do you think it's working?

376
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,599
It came out of nowhere.

377
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,719
Now...

378
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,479
The results are unclear.

379
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,160
What?

380
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,920
How come?

381
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,439
She didn't say yes after all this?

382
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,719
I knew that
you and Meng Zhi Xing are not reliable.

383
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,839
You...

384
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:04,560
Neither of you two had been
in a relationship.

385
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:07,599
You are pure theoreticians
who have never been in love.

386
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,880
What a bad idea you got for Jiang!

387
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,359
I...

388
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,000
I haven't...

389
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:12,959
No...

390
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,880
I mean, why didn't you come and ask me

391
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,800
for matters like this?

392
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,560
What?

393
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,199
I sent someone to get
the girl's academic records.

394
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,079
It's pretty good.

395
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,640
The teacher in her department said

396
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,479
she competed in high school math contest

397
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,680
and won the first place in the province.

398
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,680
She's also the top scorer
of your Jiangming city.

399
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,239
She's very smart

400
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,199
and promising.

401
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,119
Why don't you invite her to our team?

402
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,319
Zhuang Fei.

403
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,040
Zhuang Fei.

404
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,599
Don't mind what just happened.

405
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,839
I'll help you with your English
back in our dorm.

406
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
I'm not like you guys.

407
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,839
You don't have to work that hard.

408
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,439
I'm very tired having studied all night.

409
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:57,199
I'll go back to the dorm now.

410
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,359
Xiao Xi.

411
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,719
Brother Qin Yue. What are you doing here?

412
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,680
I came to see you.

413
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,479
And I wanted to talk to you
about something.

414
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,319
Do you have time?

415
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,640
Mind your own business.

416
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,640
Let's go.

417
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,599
Oh, OK.

418
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,680
Xiao Xi.

419
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,479
Are you alright with that classmate?

420
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,400
It's fine.

421
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:30,920
That's good.

422
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,520
It's your birthday in a few days.

423
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm gonna throw you a birthday party.

424
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,400
What?

425
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,680
Oh, it's the seventh today.

426
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,079
There's so much going on here.

427
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,479
I even forgot my own birthday.

428
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,359
Don't worry.

429
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,800
I'm gonna invite your

430
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,479
classmates and friends.

431
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,439
You don't have to do that.

432
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,719
That's too much trouble.

433
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,520
Xiao Xi.

434
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,680
Things about you

435
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,119
could never be trouble for me.

436
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:58,920
Besides,

437
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,839
as the student union president,
I've organized two entrance ceremonies.

438
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,359
You don't think I can't
throw a birthday party, do you?

439
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,359
Of course no.

440
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,280
Well, thank you then.

441
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,479
Just tell me.

442
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,160
What gift do you want this year?

443
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,359
I love the gifts you gave me every year.

444
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:16,800
Good.

445
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,040
Well, I hope the gift this year

446
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,959
could be your favorite.

447
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,959
Brother Qin Yue.

448
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,319
You know, you don't have to
be so nice to me.

449
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,920
I'd be flattered.

450
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:32,239
It's all right. Let's go.

451
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,520
Wow, it looks so good.

452
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,520
What's wrong with you guys?

453
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,000
Nothing.

454
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:05,880
Wow.

455
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,560
Are you going out dressed like that?

456
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,119
No, it's just a student union meeting.

457
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,160
I ran into brother Qin Yue just now.

458
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,920
He went to the student union office.

459
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,959
Well, I better hurry.

460
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,240
<i>My dearest little friend,
Xia Lin Xi's birthday party</i>

461
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,300
<i>is on this Friday night.</i>

462
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,070
<i>Sincerely invite you
to come and celebrate.</i>

463
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,199
Xiao Xi.

464
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,239
Happy birthday!

465
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,040
I'll be at your birthday party.

466
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,199
Thank you.

467
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,119
Don't mind her.

468
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
Who else did Qin Yue invite?

469
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,959
I don't know either.

470
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,959
Wow, there're a lot of people.

471
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:57,719
<i>Lin Xi's birthday party group</i>
So many people.

472
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:59,640
He probably invited all of my

473
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,000
friends and classmates.

474
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,800
That's good.

475
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,839
I will go too.

476
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:07,160
Lin Xi.

477
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,760
Happy birthday to you in advance.

478
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,239
Thank you, senior.

479
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:10,959
I have to go.

480
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,680
Xiao Xi.

481
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,199
Don't mind her.

482
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,400
What gift do you want?

483
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,119
Dude.

484
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,719
Dude.

485
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,599
How can I get to 143?

486
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,439
It's over there.

487
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,239
There, right?

488
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:37,719
Yes.

489
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,479
Thanks.

490
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,160
It's okay.

491
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,430
<i>My dearest little friend,
Xia Lin Xi's birthday party</i>

492
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,410

493
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,350
<i>Sincerely invite you

494
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,880
Sis Xia is quite popular.

495
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,119
She even got Qin Yue's help
for her birthday party.

496
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,079
Listen, brother Zheng.

497
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,719
You have to listen to me on this matter.

498
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,319
You have to confess to her again.

499
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,479
You have to get her answer face-to-face.

500
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,520
I can't.

501
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,920
-Brother Zheng!
-I can't...

502
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,880
Zhang Huai Wu.

503
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,520
All right, all right.

504
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,560
Aren't you coming tomorrow at noon?

505
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Why are you here now?

506
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,319
I miss you.

507
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,400
What do you

508
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,800
mean by that?

509
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,560
It's not what you think.

510
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,040
Those two in my dorm
fight all the time.

511
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,199
One is opposite to me,
and the other one is next to me.

512
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,599
They are just fighting every day.

513
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm kind of scared.

514
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,640
I just...

515
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,199
Didn't you say you have
an empty bed the other day?

516
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:37,479
I just thought I'd stop by
for a few days.

517
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,959
Now I see.

518
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,160
Brother Zheng, please.

519
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,719
Help me.

520
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,640
Well, I got no problem, but...

521
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,839
-Hello.
-Hi.

522
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,599
Hello, I'm Zhang Huai Wu.

523
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,760
My high school classmate.

524
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,959
Duan Ning.

525
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,560
You can also call me Prince Duan.

526
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,359
No problem.

527
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:57,760
Brother Duan.

528
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,040
You're pretty good-looking.

529
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,439
Hey.

530
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,040
How about this?

531
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,479
Tell me what you want to eat or drink.

532
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,520
My treat!

533
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,560
I can do the cleaning and make the beds.

534
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,920
I'll do it all, OK?

535
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,359
Of course I'm okay with that.

536
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,280
Bro, just make yourself at home.

537
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,199
Thanks.

538
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,920
That's it. There's only one person left.

539
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:23,760
Who's that? I got him.

540
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,880
<i>Chen Yi Chuan</i>

541
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,560
Zhang Huai Wu?

542
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,520
Brother Chuan.

543
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,239
Hey.

544
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,239
What are you doing here?
Don't touch me.

545
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,560
-You're back.
-You'll make me a bad student.

546
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,359
You live in the same dorm
with brother Zheng.

547
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,119
Jiang Zheng Han came first,
and you followed.

548
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,439
Am I in Jing Hua University or
the No.1 high school?

549
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:53,439
Chuan,

550
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,199
there're serious conflicts in his dorm.

551
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,920
To avoid unnecessary bodily harm,

552
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,520
he came to stay with us for a few days.

553
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,760
Just for a few days.

554
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,800
Did I say "yes"?

555
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,319
Chuan,

556
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,079
we were high school classmates.
Please help me.

557
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,719
Okay?

558
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,319
That's a great merit if you help me.

559
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,640
Oh.

560
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,959
You guys are high school classmates?

561
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,520
Yeah.

562
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:18,719
Chen Yi Chuan.

563
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,160
Even I helped.

564
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,760
Can't you say yes?

565
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:25,560
Chuan.

566
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,640
I heard that

567
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,199
you're the top scorer
in the university, right?

568
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,760
I figured you'd be.

569
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,800
You have to let

570
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,199
your old classmate witness

571
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,199
your progress of getting onto the top.

572
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Well, since you're all begging me.

573
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,599
So be it.

574
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:47,079
But I'll tell you one thing.

575
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:49,040
Don't influence my study.

576
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,680
No problem.

577
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,160
If I don't get the first place this year,

578
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,000
you have to move out.

579
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,479
OK, thanks, Chuan.

580
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,119
Thanks.

581
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,160
Thank you, Duan.

582
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,040
Alright then. Stay here.

583
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,079
Do you know
sis Xia's birthday is upcoming?

584
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,560
I'm all set.

585
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,920
So handsome.

586
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,239
Is Chen Yi Chuan in?

587
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,079
I don't know.

588
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
Senior Qin Yue.

589
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,160
It's so sweet to pick you up.

590
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,000
Hey.

591
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:35,640
Hi.

592
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,280
-Brother Qin Yue.
-How's the couple that I support?

593
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:39,959
Let's go.

594
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,199
Isn't this a little high-profile?

595
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,880
All right, Xiao Xi.

596
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,079
It's your first birthday
in the university.

597
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,839
Just allow me this time.
There won't be next time.

598
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,560
Then let's go.

599
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,520
Well.

600
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,599
I got friends and senior Shi Ying.

601
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,920
Are there enough seats in your car?

602
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,160
Sure.

603
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,479
Where is Shi Ying?

604
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:09,959
Senior.

605
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,079
Come on.

606
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:12,880
Okay.

607
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,119
All right, let's go.

608
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,839
Let's go.

609
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,199
Xiao Xi, here.

610
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:17,479
Ah?

611
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,239
Careful.

612
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,959
-Buckle up.
-Okay.

613
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,719
Put your seatbelts on.

614
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,719
All right.

615
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,239
Dear me.

616
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,319
Brother Zheng!

617
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,520
This is bad, Zheng.

618
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,359
Something bad happened.

619
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,439
What's wrong?

620
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,000
I just saw Xia Lin Xi get into
Qin Yue's car.

621
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,800
He's one step ahead of you now.

622
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:12,839
What?

623
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,239
Senior.

624
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:55,280
Qiu Yan.

625
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,800
I'll go in first.

626
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,680
All right.

627
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,640
Oh dear.

628
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,040
You know what this is?

629
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,520
Champagne.

630
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,719
I've never had a drink before.

631
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,080
This time

632
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,239
it has cost Qin Yue a lot of money.

633
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,479
I've been here before.

634
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:14,639
It's expensive.

635
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
It tastes so good.

636
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,159
Look at this.

637
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,399
So beautiful.

638
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,520
Cheers!

639
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:22,840
Wait.

640
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,080
Xiao Man.

641
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,239
Where is Jiang Zheng Han?

642
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,520
What Jiang Zheng Han?

643
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,719
I don't care about him right now.

644
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,840
But this champagne and

645
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,520
that couple.

646
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,399
Hehe.

647
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,919
Boy crazy.

648
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,479
Xiao Chuan.

649
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,479
You're reading a book here?

650
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,479
Yeah.

651
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,760
I wouldn't be here if Qin Yue hadn't
forced me to come.

652
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,679
Try this.

653
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,280
Isn't that Xia Lin Xi?

654
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,639
President Qin, you're so handsome.

655
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,959
Happy birthday!

656
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,360
Just got here?

657
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,239
Here.

658
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,840
Sit here, Xiao Xi.

659
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:27,840
Thank you.

660
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,360
Mr. Qin.

661
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:35,919
Oh.

662
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,959
Wait a moment.

663
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,360
I'll be back soon.

664
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,040
-I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

665
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,879
Why isn't he here yet?

666
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:01,879
Zheng.

667
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,520
Why aren't you here yet?

668
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,080
It's about to start.

669
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,879
Zhang Huai Wu.

670
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,199
What the hell is going on now?

671
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,239
Have a look.

672
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,159
Look what a wonderful party that
Qin Yue prepared for sis Xia.

673
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,919
It's so grand.

674
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:15,000
Of course I know about her birthday.

675
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,360
But I wasn't invited to the party.

676
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,600
What? Didn't you say you knew it?

677
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,879
Okay, can you just text me the address?

678
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,360
I'm coming over right now.

679
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,159
Okay, alright.

680
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:33,600
Xiao Man.

681
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,120
Xia Lin Xi.

682
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,239
Happy birthday!

683
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:38,320
Congratulations on getting a year older.

684
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,919
I'll take that as a blessing.

685
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:44,560
Our Xiao Xi is the prettiest
as it's your birthday today.

686
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,959
Try the champagne.

687
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,120
No.

688
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,919
Sis Xia.

689
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,679
Why you?

690
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,040
Zhang Huai Wu?

691
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,800
-What are you doing here?
-Zhang.

692
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,959
What are you doing?

693
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,679
Zhang, Zhang.

694
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,040
-What are you...
-Why would I see you twice a day?

695
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,159
-What?
-What are you doing?

696
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,520
Are you out of your mind?

697
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,840
Hi, long time no see.

698
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,199
Is everyone here?

699
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,080
Yeah.

700
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,199
Where is Jiang Zheng Han?

701
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:19,760
I don't see him here.

702
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,600
Wasn't he your high school classmate?

703
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,320
He probably doesn't want to come.

704
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:27,879
Not that, brother Zheng
didn't know about the party.

705
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Yeah.

706
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:31,040
I don't suppose he was invited.

707
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,360
I just took a look
and he wasn't in the group.

708
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,879
He doesn't know anything about this.

709
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,520
Who doesn't know?

710
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,719
Brother Zheng didn't come
because he wasn't invited.

711
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,840
I did forget to invite him.

712
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:53,919
Oh.

713
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,760
I see.

714
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,280
Xiao Xi.

715
00:37:58,959 --> 00:37:59,919
Your hair.

716
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,439
Thanks.

717
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,479
Xiao Xi.

718
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:17,679
Come on, get up.

719
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,479
You're so beautiful today.

720
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:25,719
Thank you all

721
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:26,959
for making time

722
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,479
to attend Xiao Xi's birthday party.

723
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:30,959
Today

724
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,239
is a special day for Xiao Xi.

725
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,520
She's also the most special girl to me.

726
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,959
Qin Yue is so handsome.

727
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,120
Xiao Xi.

728
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,440
<i>Hacking failed</i>

729
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,350
<i>Hacking failed</i>

730
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,980
<i>Hacking failed</i>

731
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,520
I want to...

732
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,600
Xia Lin Xi.

733
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:46,040
Xia Lin Xi, it's me.

734
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,560
Xia Lin Xi.

735
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,000
-Jiang Zheng Han?
-Isn't that Jiang Zheng Han?

736
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,040
Xia Lin Xi.

737
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,320
Can you see me?

738
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:57,679
What?

739
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,919
Xia Lin Xi.

740
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,639
I've always considered myself
as a very unlucky man.

741
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,840
The thing about my father's factory,

742
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:18,719
about everyone's getting hurt and
me dropping out of school.

743
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,360
I really think I spent all my luck

744
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,639
that I've had to meet you.

745
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,919
You're the reason I started to
take school seriously again,

746
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,919
and to plan my future.

747
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,919
Thank you, Lin Xi.

748
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,199
Thank you for changing my life.

749
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,840
Jiang Zheng Han is out of his mind?

750
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,600
What is he trying to do by

751
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,159
saying "thank you" to Xia Lin Xi on TV?

752
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,600
What is he doing?

753
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,360
I think he is expressing his love to you.

754
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,439
I don't think so.

755
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,199
Xiao Xi, I support the two of you.

756
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,120
We only went to high school together
for one year,

757
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,639
but we have a deeply bonded

758
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,040
friendship.

759
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,600
The time that we first met

760
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,879
at Duo Duo's home, in the internet cafe,

761
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,719
and at our secret base.

762
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,719
I...

763
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:24,639
I think those are
the best memories of my life.

764
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,239
I left without saying good-bye,
and I admit it was my fault.

765
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:38,600
But that's because

766
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,320
I didn't want you to fail your
College Entrance Exam because of me.

767
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,159
Lin Xi.

768
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:51,000
I really didn't mean to fool you.

769
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,239
I'm sorry.

770
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,760
I hope you'll accept my apology.

771
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,719
Let me tell you in person.
I'm on my way over there right now.

772
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,800
Wait for me, okay?

773
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,199
Do wait for me.

774
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Jiang Zheng Han apologized to you.

775
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,479
You think I wanted to
come to this damn place?

776
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:58,000
I did it for you.

777
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,320
Please stay.

778
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,840
Jiang Zheng Han!

779
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,639
Please stay!

780
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,280
-Xiao Xi!
-Xiao Xi!

781
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,360
Is everything OK?

782
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,280
Zhang Huai Wu, is there something wrong?

783
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:40,399
Xiao Xi!

784
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:55,623
