<i>Missed Call, Xia Lin Xi</i>

23
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,320
Why are you here?

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,479
Well,

25
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,000
why didn't you tell me in advance?

26
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,240
You didn't answer my call.

27
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,800
I didn't know what to do,
so I sneaked in.

28
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,559
You didn't go to the dancing party?

29
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,919
I returned the dress to brother Qin Yue,

30
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,720
and I also explained our relationship
to him clearly.

31
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,479
So as to avoid that

32
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,240
my boyfriend will be jealous.
He'll disappear and not answer my call.

33
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,959
Well, do you like me to be jealous?

34
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Or, don't?

35
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,720
Sometimes, you can feel a bit.

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Okay.

37
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,720
I'll get the rhythm right.

38
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,720
I really didn't mean to
miss your call just now.

39
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,119
I was revising the program.

40
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
I believe you.

41
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,239
Is this your boys' dorm?

42
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,880
It's much cleaner than I thought.

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,679
Is there anything you want to hide?

44
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,279
Anything you can't show me?

45
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
I don't have any.

46
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,119
Duan Ning has.

47
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,200
You don't have? I don't believe you.

48
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,239
Why don't you believe me?

49
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,239
Jiang Zheng Han, where's Duan Ning?

50
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,600
Xia Lin Xi, why are you here?

51
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,279
-She...
-Me…

52
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:43,920
It's not important.

53
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,399
Xia Lin Xi, have you seen Gu Xiao Man?

54
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:49,519
Didn't she go to see you?

55
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,839
Why do you look for her?

56
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,519
Oh no! Crap!

57
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,480
Gu Xiao Man
must have run away with Duan Ning.

58
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,959
I have searched the whole place
but couldn't find them.

59
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,920
Duan Ning, such a bad man,

60
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,839
he didn't do anything to Gu Xiao Man,
did he?

61
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,959
What are you saying incoherently?

62
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,720
Why did Gu Xiao Man leave with Duan Ning?

63
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,679
Where did they go?

64
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,480
Oh my! Don't care about these details.

65
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,640
Xia Lin Xi, call Gu Xiao Man now.

66
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,679
Ask her to hurry back!

67
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:18,119
The most important thing now is
to find them both.

68
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,040
It's so late now.

69
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,279
A playboy like Duan Ning,

70
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,760
he must have had an ulterior motive
for Gu Xiao Man.

71
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:24,359
Don't worry.

72
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,839
Duan Ning
is a little unfaithful ordinarily,

73
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,720
but he won't bully girls.
Don't worry about it.

74
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:31,880
No.

75
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,359
-I can't rest assured.
-Wait.

76
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,799
Didn't you
invite Gu Xiao Man to the party?

77
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,320
How could Duan Ning take her away?

78
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,600
I invited Shi Ying.

79
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,440
Why do you all think that
I invited Gu Xiao Man?

80
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,760
Shi Ying?

81
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,559
Why are you interrogating me?

82
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,959
Come with me to look for them now!

83
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,959
If not you,
who else should I interrogate?

84
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,480
You can go look for them by yourself.

85
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,040
You two aren't coming with me, right?

86
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,160
Then I'll tell my aunt that

87
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,559
you two are in love.

88
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,320
No.

89
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't sling mud at us. We are not in love.

90
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,880
Jiang Zheng Han and I...

91
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:16,040
-I just, Jiang Zheng Han, I wanna borrow…
-Borrow a book.

92
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,720
-Yes, yes.
-This one, right?

93
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,279
Come on, stop acting!

94
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,119
I saw everything downstairs that day.

95
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,640
I knew it.

96
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,359
There must be something.

97
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,359
Duan Ning hasn't returned to the dorm yet.

98
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,279
It's so late now.

99
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,959
Where do you think they can go?

100
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,399
It's so late, where can they go?

101
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,399
No, no, no, it's absolutely impossible.

102
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,359
It's impossible for them to go to a hotel.

103
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,480
It's impossible for Gu Xiao Man
to like Duan Ning.

104
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,160
But it's so late. These two,

105
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,480
but Duan Ning went down on his knee
to Gu Xiao Man just now.

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,160
And he said so many disgusting words.

107
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,959
Really, Jiang Zheng Han,

108
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,239
I'm dying.

109
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,720
So suddenly?

110
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,640
My heart hurts a lot.

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,959
I seem to have a heart attack.

112
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,799
If I passed away unfortunately,

113
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,039
please help me to inform my parents.

114
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,080
And,

115
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,960
there is a bunch of codes
in my dorm memo.

116
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,599
The codes are for what?

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,039
That's the password to my room safe.

118
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,760
Okay, then, don't say anything.

119
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,559
I'm not interested in
those Snoopy products in your safe.

120
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,200
Chen Yi Chuan,

121
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
have you ever thought about it seriously?

122
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,039
Why do you want to
find Gu Xiao Man so eagerly?

123
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,119
Because we were high school classmates.

124
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,280
That simple?

125
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,559
Would you like to praise me

126
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,559
for being kind and friendly?

127
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,239
Are you sick?

128
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,280
I'm really sick.

129
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm going to ask you a serious question.
Just answer it honestly.

130
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,840
Okay?

131
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,359
When you think of it that

132
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,479
Duan Ning went down
on his knee to Gu Xiao Man,

133
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,640
are you very angry?
Do you want to beat him?

134
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,919
If you think of it that Duan Ning and Gu Xiao Man
have dinner together,

135
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,840
wouldn't you like to drag Gu Xiao Man
back to your side immediately?

136
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,039
Xiao Man, what are you eating?

137
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,400
The beef looks good.
Does it taste good?

138
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,479
How do you know it?

139
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:37,080
You didn't study heart surgery
on your own, did you?

140
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,840
As expected.

141
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,320
Jiang Zheng Han,

142
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,200
just tell me,

143
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,679
what kind of incurable disease do I have?

144
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,719
Chen Yi Chuan,

145
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,880
you like Gu Xiao Man.

146
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,679
What? I like Gu Xiao Man?

147
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,840
How would I like

148
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,760
Gu Xiao Man?

149
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,559
Impossible! Impossible, impossible.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,479
I'm sure.

151
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,520
When you like a person,
the most intuitive expression

152
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,239
is that you want to touch her now,
but you withdraw your hand.

153
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,200
You're wrong.

154
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,559
I didn't even stretch out my hand,

155
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,760
what did I withdraw?

156
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
Okay, then don't look for them.

157
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,640
I'm leaving.

158
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,919
-I think they're safe staying together anyway.
-No.

159
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,239
Wait with me.

160
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,200
Do you admit it or not?

161
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,320
Anyway, you can't tell anyone
about what happened tonight.

162
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,919
It's okay not to talk about it.

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,679
Let's make a deal.

164
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Okay, I swear.

165
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,679
About your relationship with Xia Lin Xi,

166
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,039
I promise not to tell my aunt.

167
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,919
Deal.

168
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,119
Since it is so,
I'm going to give you a family reminder.

169
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,280
Who is your family?

170
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,799
If you like a girl,

171
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,159
you can't hesitate,

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,200
you can't wait,

173
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,400
and you should be shameless.

174
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,599
Otherwise,
this girl will go to another man.

175
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Okay, you wait here.

176
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm leaving.

177
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,359
Drink less.

178
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't drink it.

179
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:36,039
It's not good for your health.

180
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,080
I'm drinking here,

181
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,359
why are you here with me?

182
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,159
I...

183
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,280
Well...

184
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,039
I...

185
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,200
I worry about you.

186
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,320
We're in the same university,

187
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,400
I'm just accompanying you.

188
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,640
Accompany me?

189
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,359
Then, drink it. Come on.

190
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,239
Drink it.

191
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't drink.

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Either you drink it or you leave.

193
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,400
Okay, stop drinking, okay?

194
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,359
If I drink too much, I will act like this.

195
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,599
I want to drink. I'm thirsty.

196
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,200
Wen Yue, is it because of brother Zheng?

197
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,599
Tell me.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,599
Jiang Zheng Han,

199
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,679
how could he like
that useless loser, Xia Lin Xi?

200
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:51,520
-No, Wen…
-I know.

201
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,719
Does she know hexadecimal notation?

202
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,320
Wen Yue.

203
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,760
Does she know what HTML is?

204
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,599
Does she like Jiang Zheng Han
more than I do?

205
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,159
Is she qualified
to be with Jiang Zheng Han?

206
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,599
Actually, sis Xia is quite nice.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,239
For brother Zheng,

208
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,760
she has worked day and night
to prepare for ACP Contest.

209
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:20,280
She majors in the Economic&Management.

210
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,159
Does she also
want to participate in the ACP Contest?

211
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,960
Yes, and she's on brother Zheng's team.

212
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,200
Shameless!

213
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,200
She pulls the string.

214
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,919
No,

215
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,520
I can't see Jiang Zheng Han
go astray like a fool.

216
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,280
Wen Yue.

217
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,960
Get out of the way.

218
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,880
The woman's jealousy

219
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,359
is too terrible.

220
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:12,919
Did you sleep late yesterday?

221
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:17,640
Yesterday, you texted me that
Gu Xiao Man had gone back to the dorm.

222
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,799
He then let me go back to sleep.

223
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,080
However, when we returned to the dorm,

224
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,310
he found that
Duan Ning was still not back.

225
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,670
Then he clamored to go out to look for him.

226
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,000
I almost went crazy.

227
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,200
Really.

228
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,520
Are you okay?

229
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,000
-Brother…
-I feel very sleepy.

230
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
Brother,

231
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,020
do you want me to
say thanks for Gu Xiao Man

232
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,460
for your concern yesterday?

233
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:40,479
I don't have any strength to
fight you right now.

234
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,840
Last night consumed a lot of my energies.

235
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,679
I only want to sleep now.

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,039
Who's to blame?

237
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,799
If only you had invited Xiao Man
to be your dance partner.

238
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,280
Don't be smug here.

239
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,679
Be careful, I'll say something to my aunt
that I shouldn't say.

240
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,320
I'm telling you, I'm for your own good.

241
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,960
My aunt doesn't want to
have a grandchild so early.

242
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,320
In your opinion,

243
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,559
can we have a grandchild
just by holding hands?

244
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,000
If I hadn't gone to your house
and stirred things up on that day,

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,080
maybe, I will become an uncle next year.

246
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,840
Chen Yi Chuan, watch your tongue!

247
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,200
Don't talk nonsense!

248
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,719
You can attack me, why can't I?

249
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,239
Do you want to die?

250
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:17,599
You're really something now!

251
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,400
Don't really do it.

252
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,679
I'm in such a condition.
But, she still bullied me.

253
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,239
We're all brothers from the same trench.

254
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,400
Can't we be more tolerant of each other?

255
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,440
She's your sister.

256
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,270
<i>I'm Shen Wen Yue.</i>

257
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,039
<i>Let's meet in ten minutes.</i>
Don't make a scene!

258
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:29,719
<i>Only two of us. Xia Lin Xi, do come.</i>
Let's have lunch together.

259
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,840
-I'll take you to try a good meal.
-I'll go to the third classroom first.

260
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,320
You guys go to the cafeteria first.

261
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:36,960
What's wrong?

262
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,599
Nothing serious.

263
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,799
If there's nothing,
let's go to the cafeteria.

264
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,320
Then I'll see you in the cafeteria.

265
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,880
Okay, I'll wait for you in the cafeteria.

266
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Xia Lin Xi.

267
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
What's up?

268
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,440
ACP Finals.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,479
Jiang Zheng Han and you are on a team.

270
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,679
What are you in charge of?

271
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,280
Being a drag on him?

272
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,080
In what capacity
are you asking me this question?

273
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:07,080
My status is that
I've known him longer than you.

274
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,159
If you really have ability,

275
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,000
let's have a match now.

276
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,239
Why should I compete with you?

277
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:16,919
What?

278
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
Are you scared?

279
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,039
You don't have either the strength
or the guts to do it, do you?

280
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:22,919
Come on.

281
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,280
Let me see your strength,

282
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,679
and find out what makes you
team up with Jiang Zheng Han.

283
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,159
Shen Wen Yue,

284
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,270
you're Jiang Zheng Han's childhood friend.

285
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,170
I don't want to
put him in an awkward situation.

286
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,919
You really have an

287
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,239
attitude showing that you're a winner.

288
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,760
You usually look so gentle and mild.

289
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,559
I didn't expect you to be so competitive.

290
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,159
A winner?

291
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,239
Competitive?

292
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,640
I can compete with you.

293
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,840
But whether you win or lose the match,
what do you want?

294
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,919
I hope that

295
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,440
he likes you

296
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
because you are really good.

297
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,839
Not just a fancy frame.

298
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,160
Okay.

299
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,530
<i>One hour</i>

300
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,839
We'll see how it goes in one hour.

301
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,560
As expected, you lost.

302
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,000
Do you know how important
this contest is for him?

303
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,280
It's hard for him to make money
writing programs every day.

304
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:43,880
And this contest

305
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,359
is a chance for him
to get a seat in XV in advance.

306
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,160
You just rely on
the facts that he likes you,

307
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,640
he protects you in all respects.

308
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,560
He recruited you, a newbie, into the team.
Do you have the nerve?

309
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,280
Yes.

310
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,719
Even if he is willing to
teach you hand by hand,

311
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,079
step by step,

312
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,319
except the facts that
you're wasting his practice time,

313
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,599
and you'll use his strengths to make up
your weaknesses during the game.

314
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,880
What else can you do?

315
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:08,560
Duan Ning, you continue to
attack the program. Lin Xi,

316
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,280
try to solve the last problem by yourself.

317
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,760
I'll do the next problem now, okay?

318
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,520
Okay, I'll give it a try.

319
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
Also solve this problem.

320
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:18,439
Okay.

321
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,239
I'll do the hardest part.

322
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,239
Okay.

323
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,280
You help Lin Xi,

324
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,920
and give me all the hard parts.

325
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,199
I've been making great efforts on it.

326
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,439
Efforts?

327
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,359
To attend the finals,

328
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,479
efforts

329
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:46,079
are the least worthy thing to be boasted.

330
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,520
Xia Lin Xi,

331
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I'm telling you,

332
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,119
whether in the contest or in the life,

333
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,479
I can help him solve any
difficult problems of programming.

334
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,520
How about you?

335
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,199
What can you do?

336
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,760
You don't just

337
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,239
shout making great efforts by his side?

338
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,280
Shen Wen Yue,

339
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,599
if I can't achieve
the level of the finals,

340
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,079
I will automatically withdraw
from the contest.

341
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,199
But it doesn't affect the fact that

342
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,760
I'm his girlfriend.

343
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,719
-And you're his childhood friend.
-I'm his childhood friend.

344
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,560
I hope he will succeed.

345
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,839
I know it.

346
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:34,400
If it wasn't this reason,
I wouldn't come to see you today.

347
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,760
But I don't think your way

348
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,520
will affect our relations.

349
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,839
Shen Wen Yue,

350
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,199
if you try to remind me to work hard

351
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,640
to match Jiang Zheng Han
through our meeting today.

352
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,880
You've already achieved your goal.

353
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,439
Jiang Zheng Han, he's lucky

354
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:52,359
to have a friend like you
to do this for his good.

355
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,280
About the contest,

356
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640
I don't want to say too much.

357
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,800
I'll see you at the ACP Contest.

358
00:20:59,199 --> 00:20:59,760
Okay.

359
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,959
Then, strength matters.

360
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:20,680
<i>Cafeteria</i>
Jiang Zheng Han.

361
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,439
Where have you been for so long?

362
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,119
A friend told me
something about the contest.

363
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,199
Nothing important.

364
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,280
Contest?

365
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,079
What's that?

366
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,839
Don't be nervous. Nothing important.

367
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,880
All right, let's have a meal first.

368
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,119
I'm not going with you.

369
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,800
I've got some other things to do.

370
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,479
I have to get back to work on them.

371
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,400
No, you haven't eaten yet.

372
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,000
I had some snacks. I'm not hungry.

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,719
No way.

374
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Have three meals a day.
Snacks don't count.

375
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,079
Jiang Zheng Han,

376
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,920
you don't leave each other personal space

377
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,000
just because we're in love?

378
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,000
Eat my share for me. I'm leaving.

379
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,760
So, you're leaving?

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,760
Let me take some for you?

381
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
No need.

382
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,599
I'm leaving.

383
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,850
<i>XV Software Systems Co. , LTD.</i>

384
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,560
Our Lin Xi is
also a member of the contest.

385
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,359
I should do what I could for the contest.

386
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,160
-Xiao Man, thank you.
-It's okay.

387
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,199
-Xiao Man,
-Yes, sir.

388
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,479
Put this on there.

389
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,599
Okay.

390
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,239
-And put the chair over there.
-Okay.

391
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:24,280
Come on.
You can put this one over there.

392
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,119
Okay, sir.

393
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Xiao Man.

394
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,719
You scared me to death.

395
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,760
Why are you here?
Don't you need to train?

396
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:43,280
After all, I'm a conscientious dance partner
who spent the night with you.

397
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,040
Can't I sneak away to see you?

398
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,439
Who spent the night with you?

399
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,319
If you have nothing to do,
you may leave.

400
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,760
I have a lot of work to do.

401
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,319
Tell me the truth.

402
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,479
You haven't been to a bar with a guy?

403
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,800
No sooner had we reached the door
than you sneaked away.

404
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,920
I've never been to a bar.

405
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,719
What's wrong?

406
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,359
Unexpectedly,
there is such an innocent girl like you.

407
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:15,640
So, the date with me

408
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,719
was your first one?

409
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,479
Are your high school boys blind?

410
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,680
What's wrong with our high school boys?

411
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,319
Nothing. What are you doing here?

412
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,959
I'm here to see the venue.

413
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,040
What are you doing here?

414
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,880
Of course, I'm here to accompany Xiao Man.

415
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,239
Gu Xiao Man,

416
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,520
where did you two go

417
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:49,920
last night?

418
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,040
What I did with Xiao Man
is none of your business.

419
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,520
Gu Xiao Man,

420
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,280
come here.

421
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,680
I'm warning you to stay away from her!

422
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,839
Chen Yi Chuan, who are you to warn me?

423
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,560
I remember,
at the dance party yesterday,

424
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,560
didn't you have a goddess sis?

425
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,599
Instead of going to find your goddess,

426
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,199
why are you here bothering Xiao Man and me?

427
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,319
Are you kidding me?

428
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,839
-What's the logic between these two things?
-Don't talk to me about logic.

429
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,280
I don't feel like arguing with you.

430
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,719
I'm not as blind as you are.

431
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,079
Who are you calling blind?

432
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,400
I'm talking about you.

433
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,040
-Say it again.
-What are you arguing about?

434
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,119
Don't you have a contest?

435
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,680
Excuse me.

436
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,079
Xin Yan, where should I put this keyboard?

437
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:04,839
Just put it over there.

438
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,040
What are you looking at?

439
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,680
Okay.

440
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,839
Xiao Man.

441
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,599
How much industrial sewage
has Gu Xiao Man got in her head?

442
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,119
How could she disappear
for so long at such late hours

443
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,359
-with someone like Duan Ning?
-Chen Yi Chuan.

444
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:34,800
Xia Lin Xi?

445
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,040
What are you doing?

446
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
Hello, Dad.

447
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,439
Don't tell anyone about

448
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,160
the capital chain ruptures of company.

449
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,160
Dad,

450
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,959
don't worry too much.

451
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,199
We'll solve this together.

452
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,000
Xiao Yue,

453
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,280
originally, I didn't want to tell you
these company's things.

454
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,160
But this time, several of the companies
that have invested us

455
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,439
are the sponsors of
your university's ACP Contest.

456
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,640
During your training,

457
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,199
if you have a chance to meet them,

458
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,000
it's good to give it a try.

459
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,199
But, don't feel stressed.

460
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,160
I will also think of other ways.

461
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:56,359
Dad, what did the previous investors say?

462
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:57,880
No reply for now.

463
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:04,160
I also need to talk with my old friends.

464
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,800
The general environment is bad.

465
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,560
Maybe next month,
the company will have to move.

466
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,319
Dad,

467
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,479
do you still remember the Xu family?

468
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,239
They are also
the major shareholders of MC Investment.

469
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,719
I'm on friendly terms with his son.

470
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:23,199
Maybe he can help us.

471
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,760
The Xu family?

472
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,920
I even stole a project from him before.

473
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,040
We've been out of touch since then.

474
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,000
Anyway, Dad, we have to try.

475
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,199
I'll ask his son out to dinner.

476
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:42,680
And then ask them the propagation
and investment plan's criteria.

477
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,439
Okay.

478
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,599
If it works, that will be great.

479
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,599
If not,

480
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,040
don't force it.

481
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,000
Dad,

482
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,680
there is always a way out.
Everything will be fine.

483

00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,820
<i>VIP Seats, Chu Qiu Yan</i>

495
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,319
I'm not an investor,
how come my name is there?

496
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,800
You're my girlfriend.
You surely have to sit with me.

497
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,359
If you don't like it,
I can also take a student seat,

498
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,199
as your boyfriend. It's up to you.

499
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,079
The first row,

500
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,560
good view.

501
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,239
Just sit here.

502
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,239
Thank you.

503
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,479
It seems that our company has sponsored

504
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,560
this ACP Contest.

505
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,880
In that case,

506
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,839
I need to thank Mr. Xu
for Jing Hua University.

507
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,400
Ah, I'm flattered. How dare I.

508
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,680
It's an honour for our company.

509
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,760
This is my girlfriend's university.

510
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,599
You should keep a low profile.

511
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,920
Yes, I'll follow my girlfriend's order.

512
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,520
Don't talk glibly.

513
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:47,640
Qiu Yan,

514
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,719
let me tell you something serious.

515
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:53,920
I'm here as a representative of
my father's company.

516
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,680
Haven't you always hoped me to
make a career for myself?

517
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:03,319
So this time, I thought whether I could
make some benefits for the new company.

518
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,439
The company was just established,
and was short of talents.

519
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:08,479
I want to see
if there are any potential talents

520
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,199
in this contest.

521
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,520
Give me some advice.

522
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,239
You mentioned your roommate's boyfriend last time.
Will he participate in this contest today?

523
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,640
He's here.

524
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,160
He's preparing for the contest
in the backstage right now.

525
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,439
Well, why don't you take me to meet him?

526
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,040
No problem. My roommate
happens to be there too.

527
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,359
-Really?
-I'll introduce them to you.

528
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,079
That's good.

529
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,239
Let's go.

530
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,959
Duan Ning, look at this.

531
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,439
How could we solve this kind of
data structure problem?

532
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,800
-How's it going?
-You can try to

533
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,959
use the AC algorithm to handle this data.

534
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:02,599
Let me have a look.

535
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,400
Fill in more details here.

536
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,599
If the data is not accurate,
there will be many problems.

537
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,319
Okay.

538
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,839
Qin Yue, have a look.

539
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,880
I've already organized all the data.

540
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,920
Confirm it again.

541
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,160
I've marked the key points as well.

542
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:15,800
Okay.

543
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,359
Listen to me.

544
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,439
At the beginning of the contest,

545
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:20,560
I'll do the first question first.

546
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,719
Shi Ying, Yi Chuan,
you do the second one.

547
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,239
Okay.

548
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,359
When you're done,
hand it over immediately.

549
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,119
If you get stuck in the middle,
do tell me.

550
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,199
Don't waste your time.

551
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Okay.

552
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,959
Just follow our usual state,

553
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,400
keep it steady,

554
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm sure
we'll be the champion in this game.

555
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,520
Of course.

556
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,479
I must beat this scumbag, Duan Ning.

557
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,439
Okay.

558
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:40,800
Lin Xi,

559
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,040
you haven't seen me for the past two days,
except for training.

560
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,959
Are you sick?

561
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:48,719
And you don't wanna tell me.

562
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
I'm not sick, don't worry.

563
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,880
-Mrs. Jiang, go through this process.
-Okay.

564
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,439
What strategy will we follow later?

565
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,199
Have a look at what I've prepared…

566
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:58,839
Lin Xi,

567
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,199
are you hiding something from me?

568
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,119
Can you not be distracted
before the contest, Talent Jiang?

569
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:08,719
Look at this,

570
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:12,560
-I've prepared the simple data structures.
-Xiao Xi.

571
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,479
Xiao Xi.

572
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,040
Qiu Yan, why are you here?

573
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,640
I'm here to cheer you up.

574
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,160
Let me introduce him to you.

575
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
This is my boyfriend, Xu Zhi Li.

576
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,239
Hello.

577
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,760
This is my roommate, Xia Lin Xi.

578
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:25,820
-Hello.
-This is Duan Ning.

579
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:26,194
-Hello.

580
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,087
This is the famous talent of computer
in our Jing Hua University,

581
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:30,952
Jiang Zheng Han.

582
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:33,520
Talent Jiang, I've heard a lot about you.

583
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:35,350
Hello, I'm Jiang Zheng Han.

584
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,319
I heard you make programming on your own.

585
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,640
I just study it casually, kind of.

586
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,119
Talent is very modest.

587
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,959
Are you free now? Let's talk alone.

588
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,119
Right now?

589
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,560
Is it convenient?

590
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,319
Go ahead.

591
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:52,880
Sure.

592
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:53,959
Let's go.

593
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,800
Today is the contest?

594
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,280
Yes.

595
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:00,839
How's the preparation?

596
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,640
Not bad.

597
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:05,680
What do you wanna talk with me?

598
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:08,400
Here's the thing.

599
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,640
I have my own company.

600
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,119
At the moment,
I'm still in the start-up stage.

601
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,839
So I want to find a campus talent like you

602
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,079
to help me take the charge.

603
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,760
I wonder
whether you'd like to give it a try.

604
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:22,719
Mr. Xu,

605
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,760
Qiu Yan and Lin Xi are roommates.

606
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,880
We are kinda like friends.

607
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,160
I gotta be blunt.

608
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,959
Yes, let's be frank.

609
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,079
After all, I'm a student now.

610
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,319
So, even if I work in your company,
I can only work as an intern.

611
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,520
I'm not good enough to
help you take the charge.

612
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,280
And I have my thoughts as well. I think

613
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,800
XV might be more suitable for me.

614
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,719
So I appreciate your kindness.
Thank you very much.

615
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,239
Don't call me Mr. Xu.

616
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,439
We're doubly related, right?

617
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
I'll tell you what, if you want to

618
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,119
do your own projects.

619
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,760
You can come to me with your project.

620
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,119
I won't treat you badly in terms of money.

621
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,680
University students like you,

622
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,040
I often ask them to do some private work.

623
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:08,840
Okay.

624
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,159
By the way,

625
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,520
do you have the GitHub forum account?

626
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,040
Yes.

627
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,320
My ID is Positive Function.

628
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,280
You can see the related programs
I made before.

629
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,479
Positive Function.

630
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:19,040
Yes.

631
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,470
<i>The software is only a quarter written
as you requested,</i>

632
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,710
<i>please make up the final payment.
From Positive Function.</i>

633
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,479
Well, the contest will begin soon.
Let's talk about it later.

634
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,280
Okay.

635
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:44,020
<i>GitHub, Positive Function</i>

636
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,199
Xu Zhi li?

637
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,919
You're here too?

638
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,879
It's you.

639
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,639
We agreed to have dinner tonight,
but I didn't expect to see you here.

640
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,840
I'm not sure whether I'll be free tonight.

641
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,560
Are you a contestant too?

642
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,199
Yes.

643
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,040
Come with me.

644
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,159
-Mr. Xu, you asked me specifically…
-You want to have dinner with me

645
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:27,320
because you want me to
fill the hole of your company?

646
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,080
No, it's just a meal between old friends.

647
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,520
-We won't talk about the company's affairs.
-Don't play dumb.

648
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,679
Everyone in the industry knows it.

649
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,439
Really?

650
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,800
Well,

651
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:45,760
that's true.

652
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,800
The situation of our company
has been critical lately.

653
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,399
But Mr. Xu, I believe

654
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:54,479
if we can cooperate,

655
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:57,479
it could be a win-win situation
with our strength.

656
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,280
And I have
our new project proposal with me.

657
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,760
If you are interested in it, now, I can…

658
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,040
Hey!

659
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,280
Come back first.

660
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:04,879
Cooperation is fine,

661
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,479
but I have a condition.

662
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,879
If

663
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:16,919
I can

664
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:17,959
do it,

665
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,399
I'm okay.

666
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,800
I'm sure you can do it.

667
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,879
Then, say it.

668
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,690
<i>GitHub, Positive Function</i>

669
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,800
This ID is Jiang Zheng Han, right?

670
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,239
Yes,

671
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,679
this is Jiang Zheng Han.

672
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,879
You...

673
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,719
Did you ask him
to do the program before, or?

674
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,879
It's none of your business.

675
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,520
My condition is

676
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,639
you have to beat him in this contest.

677
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,560
Why?

678
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,320
This contest is sponsored by XV.

679
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,840
As long as you can win him,

680
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,919
he won't work for XV.

681
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,000
How is it? Do you have confidence?

682
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,760
Or,

683
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,000
do you need me to help you?

684
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,080
No, no need. It's just...

685
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,159
Mr. Xu,

686
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,919
if you're looking for someone
to do the program,

687
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:27,800
I can find someone else.

688
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,199
Or I can do the program by myself.

689
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,840
Am I short of people to do the program?

690
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,040
-You certainly aren't.
-Qin Yue.

691
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,520
You're no longer the superior Mr. Qin.

692
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,439
But in business,

693
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,280
there are ups and downs.

694
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:52,560
It's good that you can also feel

695
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,040
the taste of
being suppressed by someone else.

696
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,840
I've given you the opportunity.

697
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,239
Whether you can grasp it or not,
it depends on you.

698
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,000
Anyway, I know that

699
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,199
there isn't so much time left
for your company.
