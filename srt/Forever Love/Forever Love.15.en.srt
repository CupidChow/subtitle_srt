20
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,599
Xia Lin Xi.

21
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:48,919
Shush.

22
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,120
Xia Lin Xi, open the door.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,239
Don't pretend that you are not home.

24
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,440
I'm here today to impose an order.

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,519
You'll bear the consequences by yourself
if you don't open the door.

26
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:03,720
Xia Lin Xi, I will count down from ten.
Quickly open the door for me.

27
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,400
Ten.

28
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,239
Nine.

29
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,399
Eight.

30
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,039
Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three.

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,639
Xia Lin Xi, what are you doing?
Open the door!

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,880
Xia Lin Xi.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,479
Two point five.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,960
Two point four.

35
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,880
Xia Lin Xi, what are you doing?

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,119
I'm going to rest. Let's talk tomorrow.

37
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,479
Why do you open the door so late?

38
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,119
Huh?

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
What were you doing?

40
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,479
It has nothing to do with you.

41
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,919
You think I want to
meddle in your business?

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,600
My aunt sent me here to watch you.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,440
Why didn't you answer her calls?

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,520
She asked me to come here
to see what you're busy with.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,160
Well, look, I'm doing well.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,639
Can you go back to tell her now?

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,520
Why are you so anxious today?

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,279
You are being sensitive.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,919
Just go.

50
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,000
Why is there a pair of
man's sneakers there?

51
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,440
That is...

52
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,639
Last time...

53
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,160
When I moved in here, well,

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,199
a senior left it here.

55
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:21,639
Oh.

56
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,800
He wore a pair of shoes
with another pair in his hands?

57
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,639
Everyone has his own habit for daily life.

58
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,160
All right?

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,559
I see.

60
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Okay. Just leave.

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,600
-You think I will buy that?
-What are you doing? This is my house!

62
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,039
Chen Yi Chuan. Leave.

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,960
Enough? Nobody else is here.

64
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,600
Enough!

65
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,759
You are so annoying.

66
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,520
Did you find anyone else?

67
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,440
Are you here?

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,839
Look.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,479
All right. No one.

70
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,760
Hurry, go back to your dorm to sleep!

71
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,359
Hey.

72
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,000
No entry.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,920
Is he hiding in this room?

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Whom are you referring to?

75
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,640
Listen, Chen Yi Chuan.

76
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,959
Don't go too far. I am very angry now.

77
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,559
You are angry?

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,799
Are you really angry or

79
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,239
nervous about that
I may find someone in this room?

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Why am I nervous?

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,040
Listen to me,

82
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,640
you are seriously infringing
on my privacy.

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
I may call the police
to arrest you, you know?

84
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,279
Okay, go ahead.

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,920
See if the police will arrest me
or the one in your room.

86
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
Chen the second.

87
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,279
If no one is in this room,
how will you apologize to me?

88
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,480
If no one...

89
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,440
I will do everything you ask me to do.

90
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,160
Hey!

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,640
Enough! You...

92
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
Go back to the university right now!

93
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
Hey, Jiang Zheng Han?

94
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,440
Ah?

95
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,760
Chen Yi Chuan, what are you doing?

96
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:26,119
You even search my toilet?

97
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,839
Are you done? This is a girl's room.

98
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,000
I told you.

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,959
What are you doing?

100
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,480
How could you
open a girl's wardrobe at will?

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
I give you one last chance
to tell the truth.

102
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,600
I...

103
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,839
Impossible.

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,320
Now you can go back to your dorm?

105
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,600
I won't.

106
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,760
Didn't you just say you'll
do everything I ask you to do?

107
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,519
I won't, anyway.

108
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,559
All right.

109
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,279
Forget it this time.

110
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,040
-Don't let me catch you in the act next time.
-Hold on.

111
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,239
Buy me a new handle.

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,640
I want a same one. Take this back.

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
Jiang Zheng Han.

114
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:59,200
Jiang Zheng Han.

115
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,359
Where are you?

116
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Jiang Zheng Han.

117
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,959
I am here.

118
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,839
Look,

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,799
we're seeing each other legally.

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,679
Why do we have to
act like we're cheating on someone?

121
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,279
For the sake of our ultimate victory,

122
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,000
sorry that you have to
play hide-and-seek for a while.

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,000
So hard for me.

124
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,079
It's late, and you should go.

125
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you driving me out so soon?

126
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,160
Just go.

127
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,600
I think it's good to sleep here.

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
No way.

129
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,519
-I think it's good to sleep here.
-No, you can't.

130
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,600
Just go.

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
-Go.
-I am leaving then.

132
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,160
I am really leaving.

133
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,040
-I am really leaving
-Just go.

134
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,279
Off you go.

135
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,239
You can't tell your husband

136
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:22,119
what happened today.

137
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,720
Hurry.
Don't let it be aware by your wife.

138
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,519
Okay.

139
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
All right. I am leaving.

140
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,719
-Bye-bye.
-Let me see you off.

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,119
and become a junior to brother Qin Yue?

169
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,840
♪I rewind every day♪

170
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,960
♪Hoping we could go back
to the beginning of happiness♪

171
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,210
♪Like a kite straying off the string♪

172
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,900
♪I can no longer smell your existence♪

173
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,719
Hi, senior.

174
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,159
Qin Yue.

175
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,760
Come and check this out.

176
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,440
It's a poster for the costume ball.

177
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,479
What do you think of it?

178
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,400
This was carefully prepared by everyone.

179
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,840
Okay, that's it. Good.

180
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,239
Okay.

181
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,559
By the way,

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,359
the ball is hosted by the Student Union.

183
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,239
As President of the Student Union,
you'll take part in it, right?

184
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,080
I will.

185
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,119
Oh.

186
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,919
Do you have a dance partner?

187
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,440
Not yet.

188
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,799
-I...
-I haven't figured out how to ask her.

189
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,640
What's up?

190
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,799
Lin Xi?

191
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:38,479
Yes.

192
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,320
If you want to ask her,
you have to do it early.

193
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,359
Otherwise it will be too late.

194
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,479
What about you?
Do you have anyone in your mind?

195
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,000
I do have one.

196
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,080
However...

197
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,520
The one that
I want to invite isn't available.

198
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:01,960
Okay.

199
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,359
I'll go to do my work.

200
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,679
Um, okay.

201
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,359
Graph algorithm is also
a difficulty in the ACP Contest.

202
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,599
You can use
the augmented path algorithm of maximum flow

203
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,640
or topological sorting
to solve this problem.

204
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,200
-Xiao Xi.
-The path...

205
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,280
The costume ball has always been
a tradition of Jing Hua University.

206
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,640
I specially prepared this for you.

207
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,239
I guess you will like it.

208
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,640
-Brother Qin Yue, we are...
-We are busy with training.

209
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,039
I think

210
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,679
we have no time for the ball.

211
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
Xiao Xi.

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,200
You just got enrolled as a freshman.

213
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,760
It's good for you
to participate in campus activities.

214
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,520
If you're afraid

215
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,479
that it might affect the upcoming contest,

216
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,840
I will spend more time coaching you.

217
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,200
Lin Xi is my team member.

218
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,119
As a senior member of the varsity,

219
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,159
and an elder brother
who grows up with Lin Xi,

220
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,679
I don't need your consent

221
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,919
to coach her, okay?

222
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,559
Jiang Zheng Han.

223
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,840
Jiang Zheng Han.

224
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,880
Come downstairs.

225
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,159
Don't make me upstairs for you.
I will count down from ten.

226
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,799
Ten.

227
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,000
Nine.

228
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,280
Eight.

229
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,640
Seven.

230
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,039
Six.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,840
Five.

232
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,880
Four.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
Three.

234
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:07,919
Two.

235
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,080
-Xiao Xi, don't mind her.
-One.

236
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,039
Alas, your debt of love...

237
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,719
You'd better go downstairs.

238
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,479
There are so many people watching outside.

239
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,400
Jiang Zheng Han.

240
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,119
Why didn't you reply to me on WeChat?
I have something to tell you.

241
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,479
Go pay back

242
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,400
whatever you owe her.

243
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,119
I owe her nothing.

244
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,159
Xiao Xi, trust me.

245
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,799
I... I'll go downstairs
to make it clear to her.

246
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,239
Wait for me.

247
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,159
Why didn't you answer
my WeChat messages and calls?

248
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,280
I was in the ACP Contest. So I
didn't want to answer irrelevant calls.

249
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,200
How could my phone calls be irrelevant?

250
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:08,479
Enough.

251
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,039
Just tell me what's up.

252
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,239
What, I can't turn to you
if there is nothing?

253
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,719
Nothing?

254
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,760
Um.

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
Come with me.
I have something to tell you.

256
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,280
Shen Wen Yue

257
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,679
is really a special girl.

258
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,359
Oh.

259
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:36,119
Brother Qin Yue, thank you for your gift.

260
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,080
But...

261
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,119
-Xiao Xi.
-I... I...

262
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,880
That is your favorite princess dress
when you were a kid.

263
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,960
I remember, one day,

264
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:46,640
when your dad accidentally
spilled ink on your dress,

265
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,520
you burst into a rage of tears.

266
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,119
I coaxed you for a long time.

267
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,359
When I got home, I found

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,599
your snot and tears on my clothes.

269
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,640
But you have grown up now.

270
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
You probably forget what happened before.

271
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,760
Well, I haven't forgotten that.

272
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:09,000
I still remember,
my mom told me since childhood

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,960
that I was not as good and sensible

274
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,359
as brother Qin Yue.

275
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,559
This is the last time

276
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,520
that I give you a present as your brother.

277
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,880
I hope that from the next second,

278
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,159
you will treat me
as a man who always likes you.

279
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,799
And I can wait for you
to reconsider my identity.

280
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,799
-But I already...
-Xiao Xi.

281
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,280
You don't have to reply to me right now.

282
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,919
You can consider it carefully

283
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,000
before telling me your answer.

284
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,640
I hope I can see you in that dress

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,880
on the day of the costume ball.

286
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,440
I have to go.

287
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,560
What's up?

288
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,520
Shen.

289
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,959
I have a girlfriend.

290
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,239
What you are doing will mislead her.

291
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,880
Don't come to me.

292
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,680
Is she

293
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
Xia Lin Xi?

294
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:24,199
Yes.

295
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,160
The contest is coming soon.

296
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,599
You just... Stop contacting me.

297
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,079
I think I have no time to reply to you.

298
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,359
Hurry back to your university.

299
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,359
Be careful riding back.

300
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,760
Nice dress.

301
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,640
You're done

302
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,880
chatting with your
childhood sweetheart so soon?

303
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,640
Yes.

304
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:47,160
I mainly told her

305
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,359
that I have a girlfriend.

306
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,560
And I asked her to

307
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,479
keep a distance from me.

308
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,599
What about you?

309
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,959
Well...

310
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,560
You know that

311
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,800
brother Qin Yue
is very close to my family.

312
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,319
I can't make it too clear.

313
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:18,079
-I am afraid that my mom...
-Got it.

314
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,239
Anyway, being with me

315
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,359
always gets you in a dilemma.

316
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:46,079
Are you going to the costume ball?

317
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,640
I am not.

318
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,680
What's up?

319
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,239
Did you take in dynamite?

320
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,640
You did!

321
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,599
What's the matter?

322
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,359
Well...

323
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,319
I have something to ask you.

324
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,680
I have a friend who...

325
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,560
You have a friend?

326
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,280
Can you stop interrupting me?

327
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,439
I...

328
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,880
My friend wants to participate

329
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,520
in the costume ball

330
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,359
and invite a girl.

331
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,680
Do you think I... he

332
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,880
needs to buy a gift

333
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,680
to show sincerity?

334
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,160
The most important thing in

335
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,119
giving a girl a gift is your sincerity.

336
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,319
You can just
give her a necklace and stuff.

337
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,479
It should be fine.

338
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,880
But I don't know how to buy necklaces.

339
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
Didn't you say it was your friend?

340
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:26,800
I...

341
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,680
None of your business.

342
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
I... I will buy one for my friend.

343
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,319
Okay?

344
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,040
Unbelievable.

345
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,719
Senior.

346
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,640
Senior.

347
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,359
-Yi Chuan, what a coincidence.
-Senior.

348
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,439
I...

349
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,199
I am

350
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,359
waiting for you here specially.

351
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,199
Huh? What's up?

352
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,040
I want to invite you

353
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:10,239
to be my dance partner
in the costume ball.

354
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,400
That's why you are looking for me.

355
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,560
Senior, I'm an excellent man.

356
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,400
I scored 711 in the College Entrance Exam,

357
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,119
which was the second place
in Jiangming City.

358
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,640
Only one score lower than the first place.

359
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,040
And my IQ is at least 140.

360
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,640
By the way,

361
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,640
as a thank you for
your meticulous care and consideration...

362
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,880
Senior Shi Ying.

363
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,000
I also got

364
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,880
a gift for you.

365
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,920
Xiao Man, let me tell you something.

366
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:55,079
Chen Yi Chuan may give you a necklace.

367
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:55,800
What?

368
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,719
Chen Yi Chuan will give me a necklace?!

369
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:00,000
Then he will take me to the ball?!

370
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,839
I have to lose weight.

371
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,719
Then my collarbone will look better.

372
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,640
Well, how should I dress up at the ball?

373
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,400
-Gu Xiao Man. Gu Xiao Man.
-I haven't prepared yet.

374
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,520
Lessons from the past.

375
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,800
Don't cook up a Korean drama

376
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,760
just because Chen Yi Chuan
makes a little move.

377
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,199
Come on, this is such a big surprise.

378
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:20,920
Since Xiao Chuan will give me a necklace,
I need to give him something in return?

379
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,239
-Let's go.
-Hold on.

380
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,760
I want to give him
the best gift in the world.

381
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,119
-Let's go. Stop thinking.
-Thank you, Xiao Xi.

382
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,940
<i>Sculpture Training Room</i>

383
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,520
Beauty.

384
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,839
This is for you.

385
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:57,160
From now on, I will hold your hand.

386
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,760
Would you give me a chance

387
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,640
to go to the costume ball with me?

388
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,800
No.

389
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,959
Get out to hit on some other girl.

390
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,599
I have to concentrate on
making a gift for Xiao Chuan.

391
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,920
What are you making?

392
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,599
Don't you have eyes?

393
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,760
Figure it out by yourself.

394
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,319
You are making a...

395
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,160
How to say...

396
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,040
Cute

397
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,239
and fat rat.

398
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,359
Don't touch it.

399
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,160
This is a rabbit.

400
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:34,920
A rabbit?

401
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,239
Yes.

402
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:40,439
To be honest, if you don't tell me,
I really can't tell.

403
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,160
I find you very interesting.

404
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,880
You are a grown-up now.

405
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,239
Why do you still
make such a token of love?

406
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,319
I advise you to

407
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:54,079
pick up less girls and read more books.

408
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,199
Ceramic rabbit

409
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,520
is the protagonist of a fairy tale.

410
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,079
It finally learned how to love someone

411
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,560
after wandering for many years.

412
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,640
For me,

413
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,880
Xiao Chuan is such a rabbit.

414
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,560
He doesn't know
how to love anyone at first.

415
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,359
But one day,

416
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,880
he would become a rabbit with a heart

417
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,239
and be together with me.

418
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,760
So cute.

419
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,560
Xiao Man.

420
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:28,800
You look pretty when you are serious.

421
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,599
But it's a pity.

422
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,640
What pity?

423
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,800
You are blind.

424
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,160
You are crazy! Leave me alone!

425
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,479
This bunch of flowers is for you.

426
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,719
I am willing to give up all other girls,
just to be your dance partner.

427
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,239
Think about it again.

428
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:54,040
No way. Leave.

429
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,400
Fine.

430
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,959
I have to go. See you.

431
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,319
-Consider it again.
-Come on!

432
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
So annoying.

433
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,920
Have you finished the essay of last class?

434
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,079
I wrote for a day,
but still not satisfied.

435
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,160
Why?

436
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,079
Xiao Xi. Qiu Yan.

437
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,319
-Xiao Man.
- Xiao Man, here you are.

438
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,400
What's this?

439
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,280
Take a guess.

440
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,079
A gift for someone?

441
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,839
What's this?

442
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,520
A ceramic rabbit made by myself.
Does it look good?

443
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,800
Ceramic rabbit...

444
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,640
-It looks good.
-Nice!

445
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,839
I'm going to give it
to Xiao Chuan tonight.

446
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,199
This is my gift full of love.

447
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:54,040
If you didn't tell me,
I thought it was a rat.

448
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,400
Come on, don't you say
it looks like a rat.

449
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,359
I made it by myself for a long time.

450
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,719
Nice.

451
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,040
So nice.

452
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,640
The masters of abstract art
will surrender to you

453
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,239
when seeing the rabbit you made.

454
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,560
-Things made with heart are most beautiful.
-Sure.

455
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,239
By the way, tonight,

456
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,040
what are you going to wear?

457
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,079
My boyfriend won't be there.

458
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,479
I haven't decided whether to go or not.

459
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:23,160
Qiu Yan, why are you doing this again?

460
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:25,000
Xiao Xi, what about you?

461
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,719
I might not be there, either.

462
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,199
Hey, what's wrong with you two?

463
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,000
This is a major
annual event of our university.

464
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,599
Qiu Yan.

465
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,079
Consider it as an exam to take down.

466
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,359
Go outshine those girls tonight.

467
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,920
Are you going to dance or fight with them?

468
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,000
Oh, dance? No wonder you don't want to go.

469
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,760
Listen to me,

470
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,280
-Xiao Xi has no motor cells.
-Gu Xiao Man.

471
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,400
-Her limbs are not coordinated.
-I got it.

472
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,239
Tell me the details.

473
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,400
-Back in high school...
-Gu Xiao Man!

474
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,199
University is a place to learn.

475
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:02,359
Is it interesting to idle around
and disturb others' learning?

476
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,280
How did I disturb you?

477
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,319
Zhuang Fei.

478
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,000
The door of the library is open for you.

479
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:12,040
The classroom is a public place.

480
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,719
It's not a self-study classroom.

481
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,640
Besides, it is still break time.

482
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,400
It seems that no rule goes like

483
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,959
we can't speak loudly
in the classroom, right?

484
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,319
Why is she doing this again?

485
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,079
Brother Qin Yue.

486
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,319
This...

487
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,560
This is the dress I gave you.
You don't like it?

488
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,199
No.

489
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,319
I can't make it to the ball
because of something.

490
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,199
So I return this to you.

491
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,479
All right.

492
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,479
I got it.

493
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,079
Brother Qin Yue.

494
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,520
Actually,

495
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,959
I am not as good as you think.

496
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,079
What's more,

497
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,439
since childhood,

498
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,119
I've regarded you as an elder brother

499
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,560
who is responsive,

500
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,560
and always makes me feel at ease.

501
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,880
So there is no way for me

502
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:54,760
to get on with you
not treating you as my brother.

503
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,719
Most importantly,

504
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm seeing Jiang Zheng Han now.

505
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
Understood.

506
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,199
Although it just starts,

507
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,239
I like him

508
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,800
very much.

509
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,520
Xiao Xi.

510
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,479
This is a slow letter

511
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,119
that I sent to myself a year ago.

512
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,560
I want to give it to you.

513
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,959
Open it.

514
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,020
<i>I hope that in a year, Qin Yue can
stand next to Xia Lin Xi as her boyfriend.</i>

515
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,640
In fact, scoring 59 in a test

516
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,640
feels more uncomfortable than 0.

517
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,239
The most painful thing
is not having never had it,

518
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,760
but almost being able to make it.

519
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:05,959
I'd like to know

520
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,119
if Jiang Zheng Han hasn't appeared,

521
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,280
would the one next to you be me?

522
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:18,359
I have no way to assume that he hasn't.

523
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,719
Do I still have a chance?

524
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:28,920
I have promised to
be Jiang Zheng Han's girlfriend.

525
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,719
If I just tell someone if he has a chance,

526
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,599
it will be very unfair to him.

527
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,719
It's not fair to you, either.

528
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:38,880
Yes.

529
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,319
I wasn't being thoughtful enough.

530
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,479
Sorry.

531
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,439
No, you shouldn't apologize.

532
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,760
I am sorry for you.

533
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,079
Brother Qin Yue.

534
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,199
If there is nothing else, I will leave first.

535
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,239
Chuan.

536
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,599
What are you doing?

537
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,959
Are you cos-playing the loyal dog Hachiko?

538
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:49,280
Who are you waiting for

539
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,079
downstairs the girls' dorm?

540
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,560
My dance partner.

541
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,000
Really?

542
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,400
Which girl has such a good taste?

543
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,719
So she does, my dance partner.

544
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:04,959
She is the goddess of Jing Hua University.

545
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,680
Look how proud you are.

546
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,839
The girl is probably blind.

547
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
What are you talking about?

548
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:12,680
I didn't say anything.

549
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,199
Xiao Chuan.

550
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,439
Xiao Man.

551
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,719
This is the ceramic rabbit for you.

552
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:33,400
It's a bit ugly, but I made it by myself.

553
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,199
Why are you giving me a gift?

554
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:44,280
If you have a gift for me,

555
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,959
you can give it to me.

556
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,439
I have no present for you.

557
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,880
My gift has been
given to my dance partner.

558
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:57,439
Hi.

559
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,680
Senior Shi Ying.

560
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,800
-Yi Chuan.
-Here you are.

561
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:02,959
Xiao Man.

562
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,760
You two...

563
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Senior Shi Ying is my dance partner
for the costume ball.

564
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,080
So you gave the necklace to her?

565
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,239
What?

566
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,840
Yes, how do you know that?

567
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,679
Duan Ning, is your dance partner
Gu Xiao Man?

568
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,040
Chuan, you are really good.

569
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,120
Enough. Be quiet.

570
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,280
Chen Yi Chuan and I

571
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,560
became partners
because neither of us had one.

572
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,840
It seems that now
I am the only one with no partner.

573
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,000
Xiao Man.

574
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:57,320
You two's outfits match well.
I will leave you alone.

575
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,280
Senior.

576
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,360
Forget her. I have nothing to
talk about with her.

577
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:04,879
Let's go.

578
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,040
Go back to her.

579
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,919
Chen Yi Chuan,
how can you just leave like this?

580
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,159
Watch out.

581
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,320
-Xiao... Xiao Man. Let me pick it up for you.
-No, thanks.

582
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Don't touch it.

583
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,679
It's broken. Leave it aside.

584
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,000
You are always so careless.

585
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,360
Don't let it hurt your hands.

586
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,919
Don't talk to me.

587
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,439
Xiao Man.

588
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,719
This may be a misunderstanding.

589
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,080
Not misunderstanding.

590
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,040
Senior.

591
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,959
You look so beautiful today.

592
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,840
The necklace looks good, too.

593
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,120
I told you not to pick it up.

594
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,439
Why don't you listen to me?

595
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:44,479
It's not something important.

596
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,879
Why do you have to pick it up?

597
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,600
You are right.

598
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,000
It's already broken. Why to pick it up?

599
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,719
Anyway, it's just
a damn rabbit looking like a rat.

600
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,520
It's not important.

601
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,280
Well...

602
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,879
Hi, little red riding hood.

603
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,639
Is it way too boring here?

604
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,760
Please accept my sincerest invitation.

605
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,399
Would you like to
join me for a dance on the floor?

606
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,280
No.

607
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,199
I am so ugly.

608
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,879
You are still beautiful.

609
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:30,120
Trust me, okay?

610
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,120
It is my honor

611
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,800
to invite you.

612
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,520
Let's go.

613
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,040
Gu Xiao Man.

614
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,679
-You forget your rabbit!
-Xiao Man.

615
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,919
Yi Chuan.

616
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,239
Does this dog head necklace

617
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,800
have any special meaning to you two?

618
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:21,439
What?

619
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
Dog head?

620
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:25,439
This is Snoopy.

621
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,120
Didn't you give me

622
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,239
a limited Snoopy doll in the infirmary?

623
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,760
Did you misunderstand something?

624
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,120
I've never given you any Snoopy thing.
