00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,919
Hi, morning.

21
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,360
Hi.

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,239
Morning.

23
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:07,199
Well, do you want some soup to sober up?

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,240
Oh.

25
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,039
Well,

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,960
have you made extra amount?

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,639
I...

28
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,960
This is all I made.

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,320
I know.

30
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,160
Then have it yourself.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,520
I didn't drink that much last night.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,759
-Hi, morning!
-Thank you anyway.

33
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,080
Morning.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,479
Morning.

35
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,160
Do you want some soup to sober up?

36
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:27,960
What?

37
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,279
-Soup…
-Can you teach me to make it?

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,440
I...

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,479
What?

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,199
What did she say?
She didn't look very happy.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,119
Maybe we all
drunk a little too much last night.

42
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,000
When did you go to bed last night?

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,320
Three in the morning.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,880
That late?

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,119
Yeah.

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,960
Aren't you sleepy?

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,720
I wasn't sleepy,

48
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,199
but seeing you now,
I suddenly wanna go to bed.

49
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,559
What nonsense are you talking about?

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,000
It's the nonsense
I want to say to my girlfriend.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,919
Wait,

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,000
why?

53
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,800
Okay, come here.

54
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,639
Let me teach you.

55
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,279
You teach me?

56
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,199
Here you are.

57
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,399
See, watch closely.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,160
How did you do that?

59
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,399
Call me Mr. Jiang,

60
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,440
then I'll teach you.

61
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,039
Mr. Jiang.

62
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,760
Can you be more sincere?

63
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,880
Mr. Jiang.

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,320
Come.

65
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,720
-Hold it.
-Yeah.

66
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,119
Hold it, and what?

67
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:30,519
Like this.

68
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,480
How should I do it?

69
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,959
Hold it in your palm.

70
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,839
-Here it goes.
-Okay.

71
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,679
Like this?

72
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,040
What are you two doing?

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,359
I…

74
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,679
-We…
-We…

75
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,600
We…

76
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,720
Therefore, the force that enables the bamboo copter to fly

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,799
is the propulsion that
comes from the rotatory force

78
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:09,200
through the spinning of the peddles, right?

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,600
Actually, this is because…

80
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,440
How could you two discuss Physics
when playing with the bamboo copter?

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,799
Don't you think you could be the first
in the mid-term exam then!

82
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm in, too!

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,320
What's wrong with you?

84
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,079
Hey!

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,920
Well, look at my brother.

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,760
The others could have gotten up now.
Let's head back.

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,880
Okay then.

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,679
I'm going to make you breakfast.

89
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,359
Here, Xiao Man,

90
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,399
your milk.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,559
Thank you.

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,880
You're welcome.

93
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,799
How did you sleep last night?

94
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm feeling so dizzy now.

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,040
You drank too much.
Have some milk, you'll be fine.

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,440
Breakfast is coming!

97
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,559
Qin Yue and Shi Ying
sent me WeChat messages

98
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,040
that they've headed to book the rafts.

99
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,160
And Zhuang Fei got something to do at school,
so she went back.

100
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,720
Is she going to be fine on her own?

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,559
Well, don't worry.

102
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,160
Someone will drive her to the school gate.

103
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,279
God!

104
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,279
Who made this black eggs?

105
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,399
What's that?

106
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, I fried the eggs.

107
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,440
What? I find it pretty good.

108
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,000
What're you eating?

109
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,359
Wow! What the hell is that?
It's all burnt!

110
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,480
Who's that silly to make it like that?

111
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,720
Shut your mouth up!

112
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,079
You did it, Xia Lin Xi, right?

113
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,279
I knew it.

114
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,799
-It's so gross.
-It's delicious!

115
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,160
Jiang Zheng Han, how could you eat this?

116
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,959
It's so gross.
You really have a weird taste.

117
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,200
It's more delicious when it's burnt!

118
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,399
What do you know?

119
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,959
This salad tastes quite good.

120
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,519
Really? I want some, too.

121
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,839
Gu Xiao Man, get me a glass of milk later.

122
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,279
How's the salad I made?

123
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,040
Tasty, as always.

124
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,720
Next time, better luck with the eggs.

125
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,880
Xiao Man, there! Sea gulls!

126
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,920
I saw them!

127
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,239
<i>Da Bai Cheng
Ferry Terminal</i>

128
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,359
We're going to have fun today!

129
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,760
But the waves are extra heavy today,

130
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
you have to be more careful.

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,440
Every two people can start a group

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,959
according to your wishes.

133
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,239
Then, let's become a team, Xiao Chuan.

134
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,559
Jiang Zheng Han, let's stay together.

135
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:49,959
What?

136
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,559
Let's go!

137
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,559
Lin Xi, let's be a team.

138
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,880
-Okay, sure.
-Let's go.

139
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,040
Then we two could be one team.

140
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,679
What, what do you mean?

141
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,200
I had a drowning experience
when I was a child.

142
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,279
I still have the PTSD.
Have a great time yourself.

143
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,040
Aren't you a tough guy?

144
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,440
Why're you so weak today?

145
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,320
Let me tell you,

146
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,839
a man should know when to lie low

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,040
and when to walk tall.
Do you understand?

148
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,920
Hey, Xiao Man.

149
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,399
How about having a walk with me
along the beach?

150
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,040
No.

151
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,640
The water is so cold.
How dangerous it'd be if the boat overturned?

152
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm not afraid of that!

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,799
Then, do you want to go with me?

154
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,840
Yeah!

155
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Well,

156
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,960
I'll just have some fun myself.

157
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,320
Xiao Chuan, I can't really swim.

158
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,200
I can swim.

159
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,760
Then you would surely save me
if I fall into the sea?

160
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,919
No.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why?

162
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,400
Your weight, the speed of the boat

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,880
and the resistance of the water

164
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,280
would make it impossible for me

165
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,880
to save you even if I tried,

166
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
if you would fall into the sea.

167
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,080
Chen Yi Chuan!

168
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,119
Then I don't want to play anymore!

169
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,479
Wait.

170
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,039
Wait!

171
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,880
Why's she acting like that?

172
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,880
So emotional.

173
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,359
Why did you ask me to row with you?

174
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I was worried that you're too eager for success
and don't understand the rule of rowing.

175
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,119
What are you laughing about?

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,080
Sometimes

177
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,880
it shouldn't be called
being too eager for success,

178
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,919
it's called seizing the opportunity.

179
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,960
Basic rules must still be obeyed

180
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,919
when one tries to seize the opportunity.

181
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,520
-What do you think they're talking about?
-What?

182
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,719
What did you say?

183
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,000
Nothing.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,159
I just think

185
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,960
that boys can be childish sometimes, too.

186
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,239
Ah!

187
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,919
Shi Ying!

188
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,479
Shi Ying!

189
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,520
Qin Yue! Lin Xi is closer to you!

190
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Go save her first!

191
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,440
-Okay!
-I'll save Shi Ying!

192
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,760
Brother Qin Yue!

193
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,000
Hold on tight!

194
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,119
Xiao Xi! Are you alright?

195
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm alright.

196
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,200
-Have you choked on water?
-I know how to swim.

197
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,159
I'm okay. I didn't chock on water.

198
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
I'm relieved then.

199
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,799
Senior, how do you feel now?

200
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm okay.

201
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,960
Thank you.

202
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,840
Okay.

203
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,039
Then I shall check on Lin Xi.

204
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,200
Xiao Xi, are you okay?

205
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,239
Yeah.

206
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,640
You must be frightened.

207
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,640
It's okay. I'm fine.

208
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,039
Then I shall check on Shi Ying.

209
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,400
Are you really okay?

210
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,320
-Let's go check on sis Shi Ying.
-Okay.

211
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,880
Are you alright?

212
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:56,159
I... I'm sorry.
Under that emergent situation, I just…

213
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,640
I understand.

214
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,760
I know that you were closer to her.

215
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm okay.

216
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,359
-Senior, are you okay?
-Let me help you stand up.

217
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,679
I'll keep her accompany,
you guys go change clothes.

218
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,719
Don't catch a cold.

219
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,440
-Okay.
-Let me take you to change clothes.

220
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,679
Let's go.

221
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,159
Are you upset, Xiao Xi?

222
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,919
Xiao Xi, please let me explain.

223
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:39,080
Though I jumped into the water
earlier than Qin Yue,

224
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,479
judging by our position

225
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,000
and the speed of the current,

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,479
I could've saved you first,

227
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,559
but if I would let Qin Yue

228
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,039
go save Shi Ying,

229
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,000
there wouldn't be enough time.

230
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:52,000
Therefore, judging by the priority,

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,479
I saved Shi Ying first.

232
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,239
Otherwise,

233
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,719
she would definitely drown.

234
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,200
Come on.

235
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:06,840
Xiao Xi, I meant it. I'm not lying.

236
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,200
Come on.

237
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,919
I'm not angry.

238
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,520
Huh?

239
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,000
You're not angry?

240
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah.

241
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,760
Because I know how to swim.

242
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,239
Besides, even if I couldn't swim,

243
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,479
I still agree with your decision.

244
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,640
My girlfriend is so reasonable.

245
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,520
As long as you know it.

246
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,479
What's wrong with you?

247
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,080
How could you fall on the flat ground?

248
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,719
Do you think you're the heroine
in an idol drama?

249
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,479
Ouch!

250
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,919
Are you okay?

251
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,280
You've been asking so many questions!

252
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,359
Can't you tell that I'm in great pain?

253
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,440
Don't you know why I fell?

254
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,080
How could I not go rafting

255
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,760
if you didn't say that
you wouldn't save me?

256
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,039
If I would have gone rafting,

257
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,479
how could I fall on the flat ground
and hurt myself?

258
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,280
But,

259
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,559
you fell on the flat ground,

260
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,559
how could you blame me for that?

261
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,039
It's not like that I tripped you.

262
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,119
Sure. It's not your fault at all!

263
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,320
Then go away!

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,760
Oh my.

265
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,840
What are you still doing here? Go away!

266
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,599
Forget it.

267
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,000
Come on.

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,840
What are you waiting for?
Didn't you twist your ankle?

269
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,239
Come on, let me carry you.

270
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,000
Come on!

271
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,440
I wear a skirt today.

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,520
Women are so troublesome.

273
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,960
Take it.

274
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,119
Cover with it.

275
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,359
Okay.

276
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,679
Slow down.

277
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,719
Gu Xiao Man, why're you so heavy?

278
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,280
Can you eat less in the future?

279
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
You're already so fat,
why still eat so much?

280
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,559
I mean it, Gu Xiao Man.

281
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,719
If I see you order so much food again,

282
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,159
I would throw them all away!

283
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,320
I've been really unlucky

284
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,599
whenever I'm with you.

285
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,840
What is happening here?

286
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,000
Jesus.

287
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,799
My waist is going to snap!

288
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,719
I've told them that
we are heading back now.

289
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,479
I've rented a car.

290
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,400
Let's drive back.

291
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,799
Thank you.

292
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,119
That's a great arrangement.

293
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,559
You don't have to thank me.

294
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
I just did what I should do.

295
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:24,840
Let's go.

296
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:26,799
Okay.

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,719
I...

298
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
I just felt a little dizzy.

299
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,599
Don't get me wrong.

300
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,760
You felt dizzy?

301
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,000
-Anything else wrong? Do you wanna…
-I'm okay.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,599
I'm much better now.

303
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,039
You can go start the car.

304
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,960
You're really alright?

305
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,919
Yes.

306
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,200
Okay.

307
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,640
Then wait for me here.

308
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,920
Okay.

309
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,430
<i>Welcome to Bubble Hotel</i>

310
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,280
Xiao Man,

311
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,119
how did you fall?

312
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,599
How could you be so careless?

313
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,479
I'm fine.

314
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,680
I just fell on the beach.
It only hurts a little now.

315
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,319
How did you come back
with your feet hurt like this?

316
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,680
I carried her back.
It's over one kilometer.

317
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,239
Put this on your feet.

318
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,479
Why don't you put it on for her?

319
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,199
I'm already so tired.
You asked me to put it on?

320
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
You should help her with that.

321
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,959
It's okay. I can do it myself.

322
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,359
The bus to pick us up is arriving soon.

323
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,000
We still have to pack the luggage.

324
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,079
Well,

325
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,079
why can't you, a man,
help a girl to apply medicine?

326
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,520
Take care of her.

327
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,599
-We gotta go now.
-We shall go pack the luggage.

328
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,920
Okay.

329
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,439
Wait.

330
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,839
I... I can do it myself.

331
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,000
What film are we going to watch?

332
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,359
I heard that the recent films

333
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,719
don't have many good reviews.

334
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,640
I don't care.

335
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm not here to watch a film anyway.

336
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,599
Hello.

337
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,800
How could I help you?

338
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,079
Hello, please get me two tickets

339
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,760
to the film which is about to begin.

340
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,880
Couple's seats.

341
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,400
Sure. A moment, please.

342
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,280
Do you like this part?

343
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,760
It's too vulgar.

344
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,479
I don't like it.

345
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:08,400
But you've been watching it without a blink,
are you sure you don't like it?

346
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,119
Get away from me.

347
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,800
Why? I seated according to my ticket.

348
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,439
My seat is this close to you.

349
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,840
<i>Professor Shi</i>

350
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,319
Something happens?

351
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:32,920
Yeah.

352
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,000
Something happened.

353
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,000
There's something
I want to discuss with you.

354
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,880
What?

355
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,920
Like this.

356
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,920
You said that
you wanted to discuss with me.

357
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,640
But you didn't ask for my permission.

358
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:43,160
Well,

359
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,959
I don't really know how to do this.

360
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,920
Is it okay to ask for your permission now?

361
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,359
I didn't use this excuse

362
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,280
when I scored 100 points.

363
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,719
You scored me 100 points?

364
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,160
You failed.

365
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,079
It would be better next time.

366
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,839
Next time,

367
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,239
you don't have to ask for my permission.

368
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,439
Are you asleep?

369
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,880
No.

370
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,280
Why are you still up?

371
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,520
Missing you.

372
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,520
<i>Missing you.</i>

373
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,760
<i>Chu Qiu Yan</i>

374
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,640
Didn't you go out in the afternoon?

375
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,040
Where did you go?

376
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
The cinema.

377
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,839
With whom?

378
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,199
Zhuang Fei.

379
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,160
Zhuang Fei.

380
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,040
Don't make loud noise.
Senior Shi Ying is sleeping.

381
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,280
Now you know that?

382
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,920
Then why you came back so late
and annoyed the others?

383
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,040
Have you ever thought for others?

384
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,719
Zhuang Fei.

385
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,560
Have I offended you somehow?

386
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,079
Why have you been
so virulent against me?

387
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,560
I asked you to be quiet.
What's wrong with that?

388
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,119
You think I was too loud?

389
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,920
Have you thought about the others
when you were chattering?

390
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,520
When did we chatter?

391
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,479
We talked in such a low voice!

392
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,959
Can you be reasonable?

393
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,599
Xia Lin Xi.

394
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,520
You're so disgusting!

395
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,719
Such a love rat like you

396
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,800
is really beyond my level!

397
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,160
What are you doing?

398
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,400
Zhuang Fei!

399
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,560
How dare you hit her!

400
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm going to

401
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,920
the security tomorrow.

402
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,560
Zhuang Fei must
get recorded a demerit this time!

403
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,640
Are you alright?

404
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,040
Lin Xi,

405
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,880
you really don't know the reason

406
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,119
why Zhuang Fei acted so abnormally today?

407
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,719
Senior, please tell me,

408
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,319
what reason I should've known?

409
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,640
Zhuang Fei...

410
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,560
She likes Jiang Zheng Han.

411
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,520
Did Zhuang Fei tell you this herself?

412
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,400
It doesn't matter if she said it.

413
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,479
Can't you feel it?

414
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,959
What should I feel?

415
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,119
Senior,

416
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,680
don't you think it was us
who were mean to her today?

417
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,199
No, I didn't mean that.

418
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:46,680
I mean, we are all roommates.

419
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,520
There's no need to make a scene.

420
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,640
Okay, okay.

421
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,839
Don't think about it.

422
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:53,599
Don't be upset anymore. Go to bed.

423
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,479
I feel really sorry for her.

424
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,920
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

425
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,199
Do you need to apply any medicine?

426
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,319
Qiu Yan,

427
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,599
don't tell
Jiang Zheng Han about this, okay?

428
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,000
Go to bed.

429
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,760
It's okay.

430
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,180
<i>Dorm</i>

431
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:35,150
<i>Video call from Dad</i>

432
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,479
Dad.

433
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,640
Xiao Xi, I miss you so much!

434
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:57,199
Are you in the dorm? No class today?

435
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,199
Yes. I don't have classes today.

436
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,839
<i>College English</i>
I'm reviewing in my room.

437
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,439
Xia Lin Xi,

438
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,479
turn your face to us.

439
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,079
What happened to your face?

440
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Come on!

441
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,880
Let me see! Get your hair aside!

442
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,760
Come on!

443
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,000
I fought with my roommate today.

444
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:30,959
Roommate?

445
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:34,119
There's such a rude student
in Jing Hua University?

446
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,040
I'll go talk with your counselor tomorrow.

447
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,319
-How could it happen?
-Mum!

448
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,880
Xiao Xi is a grown-up now.
She can handle it herself.

449
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,599
Don't meddle with it.

450
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,199
Aren't you flying to Russia tomorrow?

451
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:46,640
How could Xiao Xi handle this herself?

452
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,400
That kind of bad person can do anything!

453
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,839
Easy, easy.

454
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,920
Well, Xiao Xi,

455
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:54,079
tell me what exactly happened,

456
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,599
let me help you analyze the situation.

457
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,719
Say it.

458
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,079
Dad,

459
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,040
I can't explain it in a few words.

460
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,800
I'm telling you,

461
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,640
this won't be over so easily.

462
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,520
Where's Qin Yue?

463
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,839
I'm calling Qin Yue right now.
I'll ask him to help you.

464
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,239
I'm fine, Mum.

465
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,599
Don't tell brother Qin Yue.

466
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,239
Didn't I tell you

467
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,040
that all kinds of person
exist in the university?

468
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,520
I asked Qin Yue to look after her,

469
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,479
where has he been?

470
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:20,680
Calm down. Calm down.

471
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,479
Mum!

472
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,920
I'm begging you to promise me one thing.

473
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Don't ever tell brother Qin Yue.

474
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,680
He has his own life.

475
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,760
I don't want to trouble him.

476
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,000
Besides, this isn't something
worth telling.

477
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,880
The situation is already so awkward now.

478
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,719
I just want this to be over.

479
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,280
Okay. It won't do you any good
if more people know about it.

480
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,040
Then,

481
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:42,959
don't live there anymore.

482
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,160
Let's move!

483
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,119
Move?

484
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,400
Your feet are hurt so much.

485
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,640
I must help you move.

486
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,079
Xiao Xi.

487
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,560
Yes?

488
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,520
Though I support your decision
of moving out of the dorm,

489
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,599
I still hate to part with you

490
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,239
now that you really are moving out.

491
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,880
My door is always open to you.

492
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,359
Xiao Xi,

493
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,400
where could I find you
if I want to hang out with you

494
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,160
after your moving out?

495
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,560
Xiao Xi's bed is still there,

496
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,439
and we could still hang out together
during the breaks.

497
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:21,560
Then, could I go hang out with you
at your place on the weekends?

498
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,839
Of course!

499
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,479
Why are you wearing a mask today?
Did you get a cold?

500
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,319
Well,

501
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,839
it's nothing.

502
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,359
You don't have to hide the truth.

503
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,239
Zhuang Fei slapped Lin Xi on the face.

504
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,359
Xiao Xi's face is still swollen now.

505
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,640
How dare Zhuang Fei hit you!

506
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,839
No wonder you're moving out!

507
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,000
Do I look too weak?

508
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,280
-I must avenge you!
-Xiao Man, come back!

509
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,920
Don't forget about your hurt leg.

510
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,079
But,

511
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,920
but you can't just
let her be so mean to you!

512
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,040
Let's tell Jiang Zheng Han!
Let him avenge you!

513
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,880
I don't want him to be worried.

514
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,199
Besides, this is between our girls.

515
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,239
I don't want him to meddle with it.

516
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,359
But…

517
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,959
Xia Lin Xi!

518
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,160
This is definitely the last time
that I serve you!

519
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,079
Even if my dad kills me,

520
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,239
I will never serve you!

521
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:17,119
Xiao Chuan! Xiao Xi! She…

522
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:19,479
What?

523
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,520
Come on. Give me the water.

524
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,359
I'm so thirsty.

525
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,599
What are you doing here?

526
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,839
-Hello, senior.
-Lin Xi.

527
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,359
Are you moving out?

528
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,319
You're not going to live
in the dorm anymore?

529
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:36,719
Yes.

530
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,000
Well, since we're already here,

531
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
let us do the work, okay?

532
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,959
Just leave it with us men.

533
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,160
We can help you move.

534
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,119
Senior, you don't have to.

535
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:47,079
-My things…
-We don't have anything else to do, anyway.

536
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:47,640
Yes.

537
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,719
Then thank you so much.

538
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,599
-Thank you, senior.
-You're welcome.

539
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,520
Xiao Xi.

540
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,719
Thank you, senior.

541
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,760
You're welcome.

542
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,400
Jiang Zheng Han is no helping here.

543
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,319
It seems that

544
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
she's running away from home.

545
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,760
Come on, give me that.

546
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,760
Zheng Han, what is happening?

547
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,439
Lin Xi is moving out of the university.

548
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,640
Meng and I are going with her.
I'll send you the address later.

549
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
Senior, sorry for the trouble,

550
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,479
and thank you for helping us move.

551
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,400
You're welcome.
The environment is quite nice.

552
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,160
Really?

553
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:20,920
Looks good.

554
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:21,959
Yeah.

555
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,839
-Thank you so much.
-Xia Lin Xi!

556
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,079
You have too much luggage. I'm beat.

557
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,520
You can die whenever you want
after moving all my luggage.

558
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,319
Chuan, well.

559
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,000
Lin Xi,

560
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,400
Chuan is already so tired,

561
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,520
give him a break.

562
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,760
-Go with Meng and buy some drinks.
-Yep.

563
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,439
What do you want? It's my treat.

564
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,199
-I want to have milky tea.
-Let's go!

565
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:42,599
Go!

566
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,359
Hey, you have to finish this.
Don't you go away.

567
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,439
You can move the rest yourself.

568
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,079
Lin Xi,

569
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:49,079
why couldn't you talk the problems
between the two of you out?

570
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,280
Why do you have to move out?

571
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,719
Has he been mean to you? You can tell me.

572
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:54,599
I'll help you. I'll teach him a lesson!

573
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,319
No, you've misunderstood.

574
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,000
Misunderstood?

575
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,479
Yeah.

576
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,680
Zheng, Zheng! You're here.

577
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,400
You two could talk.

578
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,479
Goodbye.

579
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,400
Why you're here?

580
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,199
Are you sick?

581
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,359
Why are you wearing a mask?

582
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:19,719
And,

583
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,000
why didn't you tell me that you moved out?

584
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,479
We're going to take the exam soon,

585
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,199
and my mum worried about
my study efficiency in the dorm.

586
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,199
Therefore, she rented me
an apartment here.

587
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:38,920
It's the first time for me
to have a personal space.

588
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,479
Don't move.

589
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:46,959
Let me see.

590
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,560
Who hit you?

591
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,359
Who hit you?

592
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:01,319
It's my own business. I can handle it.

593
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,560
Your roommate, right?

594
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,000
Therefore, you moved out, right?

595
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,239
This is a small issue

596
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,000
among our girls.

597
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,599
I don't want you to meddle with this.

598
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:18,520
But if there's any trouble
that I can't deal with,

599
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,079
I would ask you for help.

600
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,400
But I should have the right
to know about this.

601
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,239
It all happened

602
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,880
so suddenly.

603
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:32,760
Everything was so unreasonable.

604
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,000
I didn't know what she's thinking about.

605
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,319
Anyway, I don't live in the dorm.

606
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,000
We can't see each other

607
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,719
and this is over.

608
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:50,119
I won't ask

609
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
if you don't wanna talk about it.

610
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,160
But you have to know

611
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,160
that you're not alone, right?

612
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,560
Yeah.

613
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,760
Come on, I'm fine.

614
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,719
Help me unpack my luggage.

615
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,439
Let's go.

616
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,840
Come on!

617
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,239
Wu, I'm going to show you

618
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,879
a precious version of my collection!

619
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,439
Great! There's no one else in the dorm.

620
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,439
No, wait.

621
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,040
Let's use Chuan's computer.
It doesn't matter even if it gets a virus.

622
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,970
<i>How many different shoe styles of AJ1?</i>

623
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:50,520
Down there! Down there!

624
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,679
Don't touch my computer.

625
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,919
My god.

626
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,320
God.

627
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,679
Zhang Huai Wu?

628
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,360
What are you doing here?

629
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,520
Chen Yi Chuan.

630
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,199
Why didn't you make a sound
since you're here?

631
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,600
You didn't talk back to me?

632
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,320
It's not like you, Chuan.

633
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,120
Stop it.

634
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,239
Chuan, are you okay?

635
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,600
Is there anything wrong?

636
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,239
There might be
something wrong with Xia Lin Xi's house.

637
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,159
-What happened?
-I was cursed.

638
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,439
It's so hot.

639
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:34,760
He's got a fever.

640
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,760
Got a fever?

641
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Let's get him to the infirmary!

642
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,120
Chuan! Chuan!

643
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,199
Don't sleep, wake up!

644
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:43,800
How could Chuan run a fever so suddenly?

645
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,159
He's too weak
because he doesn't ever work out.

646
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,000
-Zhang, Duan Ning, have you seen Xiao Chuan?
-Xiao Man.

647
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
He didn't reply to my WeChat messages.

648
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,360
Oh, he's fine.

649
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,199
He's now in a coma in the clinic.

650
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,399
-What happened?
-No, wait.

651
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,719
I mean he's resting in the clinic now.

652
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,639
Wasn't he fine yesterday?

653
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:02,000
He's just too weak.

654
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
He helped sis Xia move yesterday,
maybe he was too tired.

655
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,600
Too weak.

656
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,719
Okay. Then I'm going to check on him.

657
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:07,520
Hey!

658
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,840
Is your foot okay?

659
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,879
It's okay!

660
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,679
There's nothing serious with him.
He just got a fever!

661
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,719
But your foot

662
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,719
-hasn't recovered! Don't walk too much!
-Don't worry about me.

663
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,280
Your foot is hurt like that,
how could you care about him?

664
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,679
This is…

665
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,879
Okay, come on, let's go.

666
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,399
Well,

667
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,040
I heard that
Chen Yi Chuan has got a fever.

668
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,360
It's kind of serious.

669
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,879
Is it?

670
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,560
Then I'll go check on him this afternoon.

671
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,399
Qin Yue.

672
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,760
It not time to think about
Chen Yi Chuan now.

673
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,560
He's sick,
but the doctors will look after him.

674
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,000
You should think about yourself!

675
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:22,919
You're already a junior.
And it's your last time to be in this competition.

676
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,600
If Chen Yi Chuan can't train for sometime

677
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,679
because of his illness,

678
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,000
our team's ability would be weakened.

679
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,159
I hope

680
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,239
you could think it through.

681
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,000
Should we expel him in Plan B?

682
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,600
I can't do this

683
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,360
even if he couldn't make it.

684
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,320
Because of Xia Lin Xi? Again?

685
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:00,199
Sorry.

686
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,959
I said too much.

687
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,479
But I thought

688
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:09,760
you wouldn't stop for any girl.

689
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:12,600
Maybe I was wrong.

690
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,080
Shi Ying.

691
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
You don't have to always think for me.

692
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,959
I'll visit Chen Yi Chuan in the afternoon.

693
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,360
I'll do what I should do.
You don't have to worry about it.

694
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,719
Xiao Chuan,

695
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,679
I used a bunch of accounts
and went through much trouble

696
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,560
before I got you
this limited version of Snoopy.

697
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,080
I've blessed it.

698
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,879
You'll recover soon

699
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,840
with its companion.

700
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,399
Everything will go smoothly.

701
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,840
You will be able to
realize all your dreams.

702
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,879
I hope…

703
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,639
Gu Xiao Man, you must be crazy!

704
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,879
Yi Chuan.

705
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,439
Senior.

706
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,120
Are you feeling better?

707
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,439
I heard that you're sick.
So, I'm here to see you.

708
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,399
I've brought you something.
It's on your bedpost.

709
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,679
And,

710
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,399
just rest well.

711
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,840
I want to talk about

712
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,439
the varsity…

713
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,399
Senior,

714
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,159
rest assured.

715
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,280
I'll try to recover

716
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,719
as soon as possible.

717
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,679
I won't hold you back.

718
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,679
Okay.

719
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:39,959
Then, best wishes to your recovery.

720
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,040
Okay.

721
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,520
Have some rest. I won't disturb you.

722
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,000
I shall leave now. Goodbye.

723
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:27,154
