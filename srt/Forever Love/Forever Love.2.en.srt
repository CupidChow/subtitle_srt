Go inside.

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,480
Are you OK, Huai Wu?

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,510
Why were you giving such a special salute?

20
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,360
Stand up.

21
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,440
Jiang Zheng Han,

22
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,510
there's something wrong.

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,440
You've loved our Xiao Xi since high school,

24
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,950
but your answer
is different from our bride's.

25
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,550
You must be punished.

26
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,680
- Yeah.
- 30 press-ups.

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,760
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,440
I have to keep my strength. Tonight...

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,160
You're so sensible.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,080
Stop, stop, stop.

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,630
How about this? How about this?

33
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,440
Let's give him a chance, OK?

34
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,910
Let him say something

35
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,440
about his first impression of sis Xia.

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,550
OK?

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,470
That's great.

38
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,630
Ladies,

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,910
just be generous!

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,880
-I had the first impression
-Thank you.

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,880
that she was a crafty

42
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,240
but irresistible tail.

43
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,000
Hold on, hold on.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,390
Is this still the class monitor
that I've known?

45
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,080
She was a top but domineering student.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,800
That's right. How is it, Xiao Xi?

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,470
It's something that only I know.

48
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,670
Dear me!

49
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,080
That's enough.

<i>Episode 2</i>
<i>The Girl Tamed By The Lion</i>

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,880
I'll ask you one more time.

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,190
Where is my laptop?

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,800
Your... Your laptop...

54
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,110
You won't say it, right?

55
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,320
What are you doing?

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,030
This is the women's washroom.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
What?

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,190
The crafty top student wants to shout out?

59
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,030
The rubbish stupid student
wants to fight a duel with me?

60
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,110
What?

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,670
Come out.

62
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,390
No.

63
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,030
Come out.

64
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,000
I... I won't go out.

65
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,960
OK.

66
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,110
Come out

67
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,030
or I'll go in.

68
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,800
You choose.

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,320
Anyway, I won't go out.

70
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,600
If you don't come out, I'll kick the door.

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,440
Then you have to compensate
the school for the door.

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,270
This door costs at least more than 1,000.

73
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,800
OK.

74
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,720
Just wait and see.

75
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,080
The sewerage has been broken.

76
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,390
Oh!

77
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,470
Go downstairs and turn left.

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,960
OK, thank you!

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,480
Oh!

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
Here you are.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,160
What are you going to do?

82
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:28,920
Hey!

83
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,790
Hey!

84
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,510
Where is my laptop?

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
At Mr. Zhang's office.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,390
Just ask him for it.

87
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,640
You dared give it to our teacher?

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,070
Mr. Zhang.

89
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,000
You were lying to me, right?

90
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,480
Return the notebook to me.

91
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,790
Let me tell you.

92
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,480
If you were not a girl,

93
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,350
I would hit you so hard.

94
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,110
Hey!

95
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,480
Where are you going?

96
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,670
Bring my laptop back.

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,640
The teachers have already gone off duty.

98
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,920
The office door is definitely locked.

99
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,440
Why are you forcing me to steal
the laptop with you?

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,950
Could it be that
you did something wrong?

101
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,200
What does "steal the laptop" mean?

102
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,830
It's my laptop.
Why do you use the word "steal"?

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,230
How about this? I'll bring it back
from the teacher tomorrow.

104
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,160
That's enough for today.

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,160
No.

106
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,040
I have to bring it back today.

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,550
Why?

108
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,950
I need my laptop. I have to work.

109
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,110
Otherwise, I will lose 5,000 RMB.

110
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,950
Can you compensate me?

111
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,600
Follow me if you can't.

112
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,790
Where are we going?

113
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,760
Prepare the props.

114
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,550
What... What props?

115
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,720
Hey!

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,110
Is it OK?

117
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,640
Be quiet.

118
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,760
Just follow me.

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,230
Are you sure?

120
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,510
Jiang Ming No.1 High School
has a total of four floors.

121
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,670
Cameras are set in the
corners of each floor.

122
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,780
<i>The office building</i>

123
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,000
According to the map,

124
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,760
there are 4 large corners,
16 narrow ones.

125
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,480
There're a total of 20 corners
for each floor.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,110
The four floors have
a total of 80 monitor areas,

127
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,830
but there are
5 blind spots among them.

128
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Honey, I've finished the lesson plan.

129
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
I'll go home right now.

130
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,920
Bye bye!

131
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,200
Hey.

132
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,510
Someone's here.

133
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Shush!

134
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,830
Shush!

135
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,320
There is a camera here.

136
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,320
Be careful.

137
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,920
That familiar?

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are you a thief who has probed the school?

139
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,390
What do we do next?

140
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,950
Hold it.

141
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,760
I've covered it up.

142
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,320
Be careful.

143
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,840
You see, I said it.

144
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,470
What are you doing?

145
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,960
Jiang... Jiang Zheng Han.

146
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,150
Just tell the truth.
Are you a habitual offender?

147
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,400
Is this school the target
for your thievery?

148
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,670
A habitual offender?

149
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,080
Come in.

150
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,550
Come in.

151
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,200
It's much easier for the teachers
to find out if you don't come in.

152
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,550
Where did you learn this cheap trick?

153
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,790
This cheap trick?

154
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,590
It's called the technique.

155
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,840
Thank you!

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,150
Hurry up.

157
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,150
You've found the laptop.
Return the notebook to me.

158
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,280
Ah, the notebook?

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
What are you doing?

160
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,350
I'll ask you a question.

161
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,550
Do you know

162
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,230
why Mr. Frank Yang
is already 90 years old,

163
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,230
but he still has a quick wit
and good health?

164
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,760
Keep your voice down.

165
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,440
I don't know.

166
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,400
Because

167
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,960
he focuses on scientific research,

168
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,840
never has a finger in the pie.

169
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,200
Your ability to lie
is unbelievably awesome.

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,150
Therefore,

171
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,960
I hope Ms. Xia has

172
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,960
learned a lesson this time.

173
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,670
Please keep your nose out of my business.

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Jiang Zheng Han,
are you playing tricks on me?

175
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,400
So, I'm leaving.

176
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,150
Goodbye!

177
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,470
Hey!

178
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,590
A desk is over there.

179
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,150
Be careful. Don't fall down.

180
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,350
Go for it, the top-ranked student.

181
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,550
Hey, what are you doing?

182
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,910
Step down.

183
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Xia Lin Xi.

184
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,710
If you want to take
the previous exam paper,

185
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,030
just tell me.

186
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,760
Why did you do so?

187
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,080
I won't retrace this because of
your excellent academic performance.

188
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,590
Just write a self-criticism report.

189
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,760
Xiao Xi.

190
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,230
Bro Qin Yue.

191
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,550
What's wrong with you?

192
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,320
I seldom see you being like this.

193
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,760
The bicycle is broken.

194
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,840
It won't run if I don't kick it hard.

195
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,150
Bro Qin Yue, why are you here?

196
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,440
I’m waiting for you.

197
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,520
Waiting for me?

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,550
What's wrong? Why don't you eat more?

199
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,640
Oh!

200
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,030
I don't eat too many sweets
in the evening.

201
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,350
OK.

202
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,110
Ah,

203
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,910
Bro Qin Yue, will you return
to the university tomorrow?

204
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,960
We're having a competition tomorrow,
so I must go back.

205
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,760
Xiao Xi.

206
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,670
Grade 12 is a very important year.

207
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,840
Whenever you don't understand
anything about your schoolwork,

208
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,320
I hope you can ask me.

209
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,840
I'll make an effort

210
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,280
to become your schoolmate.

211
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,320
I believe you can make it.

212
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,470
Sorry to trouble you,

213
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,960
but our shop is holding
an event called "Slow-Sending Letter".

214
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,670
You can write what you wanna say,

215
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,710
we'll help you send it
to yourself one year later.

216
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,670
That's interesting.

217
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,790
Do you want to have a try?

218
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,550
I'll give you the pink one.

219
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,590
To myself one year later?

220
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,350
One year later.

221
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,280
<i>One year later, I hope Qin Yue</i>

222
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,740
<i>could become Xia Lin Xi's boyfriend</i>

223
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,440
Bro Qin Yue, what did you write?

224
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,880
One year later, you'll know.

225
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,030
My mom.

226
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,910
Hello!

227
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,110
I said I had employed a maths tutor
for you, why haven't you come home?

228
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,400
Don't worry, mom.
I'll come home right now.

229
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,200
Hurry up.

230
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,710
Let's go.

231
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,200
OK, I'll be right there. I'm on the way.

232
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,080
- OK, let's go.
- Let's go.

233
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,590
I want to know the fate
of this guy and me.

234
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,780
<i>Chen Yi Chuan</i>

235
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,030
Let's start.

236
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,280
It...

237
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,880
doesn't seem ideal.

238
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,350
How could it be?

239
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,230
Why are you so late?

240
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,200
The teacher has been
waiting upstairs for a long while.

241
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,790
Hurry up!

242
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,350
Hello. I'm so sorry.

243
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,520
Our class finished late.
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

244
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,030
It's you?

245
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,880
Why are you here?

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,670
You're Xia Lin Xi, right?

247
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,350
Do you know me?

248
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,440
Huh?

249
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,760
Jiang Zheng Han.

250
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,150
You're even pretending not to know me?

251
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,400
Ah,

252
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,670
you must be mistaking me for someone else.

253
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,230
Jiang Zheng Han is

254
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,200
my younger brother.

255
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,110
I'm

256
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,470
Jiang

257
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,000
Zheng

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,790
Re.

259
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,880
Nice to meet you.

260
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,110
<i>"Re" means "hot"</i>
I... Hot my foot!

261
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,960
You really dare do anything

262
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,640
to earn money!

263
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,800
What are you doing?

264
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,640
Could it be that my naughty brother

265
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,110
treated you badly?

266
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,470
Mr. Jiang Zheng Re, right?

267
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,520
Yes.

268
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,400
Do you know how "lucky" was I today?

269
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,110
Because of your brother,

270
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,470
I lost 205 RMB at the internet cafe today.

271
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,230
Then, I had to write the very first
self-criticism report in my life.

272
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,310
- Then, I...
- Hey.

273
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,350
Your friend is entering an adventure.

274
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,160
Also, she could meet

275
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,230
a special person.

276
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,070
A special person?

277
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,680
I see.

278
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,110
My brother sometimes

279
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,280
goes too far.

280
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,560
I'll definitely teach him a lesson.

281
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,470
Today, let's finish the homework first

282
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,710
so I could receive my wage.

283
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,230
- OK?
- You don't admit, do you?

284
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:55,640
OK.

285
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,430
OK.

286
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,430
Since such a fateful coincidence happens
to you, your brother and me,

287
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,400
I'll ask my mom right now.

288
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I wonder if she had confirmed
your identity before.

289
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,190
Wait a second.

290
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,430
Could you give me
10 minutes to explain?

291
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,230
You could expose me later.

292
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,000
It was you who
put this image here, right?

293
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,430
Despite knowing who your student is,
you still dare appear.

294
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,070
You are so courageous.

295
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,070
As a tutor,

296
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,400
I could ensure the quality of my work,

297
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,000
and improve your maths performance.

298
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,560
With your performance,

299
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,230
how could you teach me?

300
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,520
Actually, I'm very puzzled.

301
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,040
You see,

302
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,230
the top student also
needs to employ a tutor.

303
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,830
I understand why you don't trust me.

304
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,640
How about this?

305
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,350
Let's

306
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,680
compete.

307
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,920
If I lose, it's up to you.

308
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,230
OK?

309
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,070
You're challenging me, right?

310
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,590
I'll make you admit defeat completely.

311
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,430
What if

312
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,040
I win?

313
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,230
What idea do you have?

314
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,110
A wise

315
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,710
but gentle girl

316
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
who can beat a lion.

317
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,000
Tell me,

318
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,560
what if you lose?

319
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,110
I'll tell your mom the truth immediately.

320
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,830
Of course, I'll apologize to you.

321
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,070
However, if I win,

322
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,230
you have to let me

323
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,920
continue this job.

324
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,920
OK.

325
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,830
That's settled then.

326
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,430
The one breaking the promise

327
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,950
will be a dog.

328
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,430
OK.

329
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,800
The girl's courage

330
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,430
is truly admirable.

331
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,070
I'm afraid that

332
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,800
ordinary people don't even dare
to come close to the lion.

333
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,230
Of course.

334
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,520
My friend

335
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,190
is just great.

336
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,880
I don't care whether you are
Jiang Zheng Han or Jiang Zheng Re,

337
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,640
you must admit defeat.

338
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,350
Even if you have the correct answer,

339
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,430
I'm the winner

340
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,520
because I've finished it first.

341
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,520
But you haven't seen my answer,

342
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,070
why do you know I would lose?

343
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,310
Not necessarily.

344
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,280
I used the simplest vertical forms.

345
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,710
In this question, the distance between
the points P and Q is 3 cm.

346
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,520
Just admit defeat.

347
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,220
<i>Solution 1 Solution 2 Solution 3</i>

348
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,640
1 minute 30 seconds.

349
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,760
You found three solutions.

350
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,950
Otherwise,

351
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,920
how can I become a teacher?

352
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
This is

353
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,800
the class 2003's practice test.

354
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,350
Perhaps you have done it before.

355
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,520
How about this?

356
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,310
Let's

357
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,070
compete in something else.

358
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,110
What is it?

359
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,230
Except for learning.

360
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,230
How about time?

361
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,230
The faster one will win.

362
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,800
OK!

363
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,560
Let me mix it up.

364
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
Ready.

365
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,950
Go.

366
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,230
Hello!

367
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,400
Hey, Xiao Xi.

368
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,640
I consulted a fortune-teller
for you today.

369
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,950
You are a courageous girl

370
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,110
who can tame a lion.

371
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,190
The lion has already eaten the girl.

372
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,470
That's it. Goodbye!

373
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,430
Write it.

374
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,040
The one breaking
the promise will be a dog.

375
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,310
Write it.

376
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,000
OK.

377
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,310
What should I write?

378
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,000
I...

379
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,350
Xia Lin Xi.

380
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,760
From today on,

381
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,640
I'll address

382
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,560
Jiang Zheng Han as Teacher Jiang.

383
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,190
Don't go too far.

384
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,000
From today on, I will

385
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,000
willingly obey Mr. Jiang's orders,

386
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,880
respect the teacher, study hard,

387
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,160
attempt to improve my maths performance.

388
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,830
I, Jiang Zheng Han, will willingly accomplish
my responsibilities as a teacher.

389
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,280
Make a duplicate.

390
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
Could I ask you a question?

391
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,520
Say it.

392
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,350
Your ability is so great,

393
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,400
but why are you still ranking last?

394
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,710
Maybe...

395
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,110
Being a slack student
makes me more comfortable.

396
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,190
This one,

397
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,000
please give it to me.

398
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,190
Why?

399
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,590
I'm afraid you will be
upset when seeing it.

400
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:46,950
Alright.

401
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,430
There's half an hour left.

402
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,110
Let's take the time and study,

403
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,110
Xia.

404
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,640
OK.

405
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
Teacher Jiang.

406
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,560
OK, come on.

407
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
With your academic performance,

408
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,280
how dare you go to school late?

409
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,640
Where did your courage come from?

410
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,000
Zhang Huai Wu, is your performance

411
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,280
worthy of the care of Mr. Zhang?

412
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,710
Well, where is

413
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,040
the new transfer student?

414
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,110
I'm here.

415
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,950
Bro Zheng.

416
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,280
Well, Jiang Zheng Han.

417
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,880
Please stand up.

418
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,800
Why are you wearing
the old school's uniform?

419
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,760
What I said is

420
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,920
water off a duck's back to you?

421
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,000
Teacher, I think

422
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,310
it's pretty.

423
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,880
Me too.

424
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,160
I definitely wear
it better than he does.

425
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,920
Do you wear a school uniform
because it's pretty?

426
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,560
Coming to our school,

427
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,430
you must wear our school uniform.

428
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,110
Pay for the school uniform,

429
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,680
then get the new one after school.

430
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,920
Yes!

431
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,160
Please stand up.

432
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Do you see the three
students standing at the back?

433
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,230
Stand with them.

434
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,950
Hello, bro Zheng.

435
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,920
Later on, let me see

436
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,680
if whoever dares to go to school late.

437
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,680
Guys,

438
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,040
please ponder over the two questions

439
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,710
on the board carefully.

440
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,310
In a while,

441
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,400
I'll pick two students to solve them.

442
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,110
Gu Xiao Man.

443
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,880
Go and write the answer on the board.

444
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,430
Who else wants to write the answer?

445
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,950
Me.

446
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,350
Come here.

447
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,830
What a top student!

448
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,590
Hey, will he

449
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,520
pick us to write the answer?

450
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,160
We're standing here as
a punishment. How can he?

451
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,400
Even if he picks me, I can do it.

452
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,710
Leave it out!

453
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,830
What can the one
ranking second-to-last like you do?

454
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,950
It's you. I'm ranking third to last.

455
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,310
That's fine.

456
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,830
How about having
a try to see who is better?

457
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,640
Xiao Xi.

458
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,760
Our class's transfer student
is a prominent figure.

459
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,310
I heard

460
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,560
he was a "Mr. Perfect"

461
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,400
at his old school.

462
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,230
He was also a member
of the school computer team.

463
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,920
Both intelligent and handsome.

464
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,280
I wonder why he left the team,

465
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,680
then moved to our school.

466
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,040
Where did you hear the news?

467
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,710
It's my professional skill.

468
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,470
He is our class's disaster.

469
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,400
Knowing that A is equal
to a square root of 7.

470
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,125
Everyone could learn
from Xia Lin Xi's solution.

471
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,110
What a fool!

472
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,430
It's X.

473
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,560
Xia Lin Xi, Gu Xiao Man.

474
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,640
Return to your seats.

475
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

476
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,590
It's called Alpha.

477
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,280
Stand still.

478
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,190
What are you whispering?

479
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,470
Xi, why do you feel sleepy?

480
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,430
This bad habit
of oversleeping is really...

481
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,710
Today I slept at 2 AM.

482
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,040
Xiao Xi, don't risk your life.
You're already number one.

483
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,350
No.

484
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,160
I'm sleepless.

485
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,430
Sleepless?

486
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,560
The top student is...

487
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,040
Qin Yue has tamed you
and touched your heart, right?

488
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,760
Gu Xiao Man,
I think you're out of your mind.

489
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,920
Take it.

490
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,880
Wait a second.

491
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,000
9 RMB in total.

492
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,040
OK, wait a second.

493
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,350
I said it.

494
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,190
There is something weird
between Qin Yue and you.

495
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,560
Gu Xiao Man, you...

496
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,590
Gu Xiao Man, Gu Xiao Man.

497
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,280
You even said that there's nothing.

498
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,520
Could it be love among top students?

499
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,950
So sweet.

500
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,040
This is even more high-class
than ordinary love letters.

501
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,760
When will our Xiao Chuan
write such a sketch for me?

502
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,350
The fourth.

503
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,470
Qin Yue gave a sketch to Xiao Xi.

504
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,000
He hoped Xiao Xi
would attend Jing Hua University.

505
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,710
The romantic life of top students

506
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,430
is admirable.

507
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,430
If you focused on studying like this,

508
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,800
you wouldn't cry
hard when seeing the ranking.

509
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,280
How could studying
be as interesting as gossip?

510
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,470
Also,

511
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,160
my dream is to be a novelist.

512
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,520
Now, you are my source material.

513
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,190
Xia Lin Xi, I want to ask you a question.

514
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,070
I won't answer any questions
unrelated to studying.

515
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,640
Look at me, please answer honestly.

516
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
How could

517
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,160
the lion named Qin Yue

518
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,830
eat such a perfect girl like you?

519
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,520
Huh?

520
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,680
It's time to attend the class.
Stop talking nonsense.

521
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,040
Hey.

522
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,160
Time's up.

523
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,160
Class monitors,
collect all the exam papers.

524
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,830
Let me have a look.

525
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,430
What are you saying?

526
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,950
Xiao Chuan, please tell me
the answer to question 18.

527
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,070
I'll tell the teacher
if you keep talking.

528
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,310
Chen Ze, Chen Ze.

529
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,040
Let me see the answer, Chen Ze.

530
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,710
This question.

531
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,640
Don't let him see.

532
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,640
Hey, hey.

533
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,400
Zhang.

534
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,310
The answer to this question is...

535
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,430
2.

536
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,590
Damn it.

537
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,470
Don't confuse me.

538
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,000
Trust me! That's correct. Just write it.

539
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,040
9 and 3/4.

540
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,950
Oh my god! Bro Zheng, don't tease me.

541
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,560
Don't say anything when you
hand over the blank exam paper.

542
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,110
That's it.

543
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,350
You're ranking last,

544
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,520
so don't involve yourself

545
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,280
in the interactions of top students.

546
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,800
Sis Xia.

547
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,640
Sis Xia! The answer to
this question is 9 and 3/4, right?

548
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,400
Please take a look.

549
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,350
I beg you, just tell me.

550
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,710
9 and 3/4.

551
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,680
Right.

552
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,230
You have to monitor the cost of
Jiang Zheng Han's uniform.

553
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,830
Give it to me tomorrow.

554
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,520
Yes.

555
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,160
Why is it me again?

556
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,040
Hey!

557
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,590
Jiang Zheng Han, don't make it difficult for me.
Just pay for the uniform.

558
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,000
Aren't you tired?

559
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,310
I'm tired.

560
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,280
I won't be tired if you pay.

561
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,830
I have no money.

562
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,710
You're doing so many jobs,
both a tutor and an internet cafe cashier.

563
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,920
The uniform just costs 200 RMB.
Why do you have no money?

564
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,950
Mr. Jiang.

565
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,070
You're a teacher too.

566
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,760
Don't make it difficult
for students like us.

567
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,520
Xia Lin Xi, are you crazy?

568
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,710
Chen Yi Chuan,
could you keep yourself away from me?

569
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,640
Jiang Zheng Han.

570
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,760
Xia Lin Xi is the famous lackey in our class.

571
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,950
Very obedient to teachers.

572
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,110
She never dared to displease them.

573
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,400
What are you gonna do?

574
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,470
If you dare bully me,

575
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,160
I'll tell my aunt.

576
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,350
3-year-old Chen, what can you
do except from snitching?

577
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,950
Jiang Zheng Han, pay for it.

578
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,860
<i>You must pay for the uniform today</i>

579
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,360
Give the correct answer first.

580
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,940
<i>Give the correct answer first</i>

581
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,390
Xiao Xi, it's our turn to clean
the classroom today.

582
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,120
Xiao Man, please help me.

583
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,600
Two MiMi prawn
crackers plus a cup of Xingqiu.

584
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,430
How is that?

585
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,280
You said it. Okay then.

586
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,760
Sis Xia, let me help you.

587
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,000
- I can do it myself.
- Let me, let me.

588
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,080
Let me, let me.

589
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,910
- I can do it myself.
- Let me, let me do it.

590
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,190
I'm not busy today.

591
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:44,950
Hey.

592
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,840
Hey, hey!

593
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,430
Oh!

594
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,080
Oh!

595
00:36:56,104 --> 00:37:06,104
