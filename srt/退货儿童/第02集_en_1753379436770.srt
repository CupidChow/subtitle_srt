On the Yanghyeon Bridge in Wonpo, Gyeonggi-do

74
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:12,381
A major accident occurred in which a passenger bus crashed into a guardrail and caused an explosion

75
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:14,511
Fortunately, there were few vehicles on the road in the early morning.

76
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,081
No secondary damage

77
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:18,411
The driver of the accident vehicle is missing

78
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,951
The possibility of falling under the bridge cannot be ruled out

79
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,481
The police are currently searching

80
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:27,611
The police said the items in the car were severely damaged by the fire.

81
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:31,151
It's hard to confirm the identity of the victim, so it's probably not her.

82
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:33,351
The same goes for the fire department... That's not my uncle, right?

83
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:36,281
This undoubtedly makes it more difficult to search for victims.

84
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:40,381

Pastor, you must be very busy. Thank you very much.

187
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:46,611
No, this is what I should do.

188
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,451
I received a call from Ms.

189
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,281
We agreed to meet at the church

190
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:51,351
Is that so?

191
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,781
Congratulations on your behalf

192
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:55,211
Let's go

193
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,351
Please go slowly

194
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,781
Request for special law to be enacted by Kwon Kang-man

195
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:03,611
Special laws are enacted...

196
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:15,411
Where's the driving?

197
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,451
It must be nearby

198
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:31,981
Use this to check your identity

199
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,111
Yeah, faster.

200
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:51,451
explain

201
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,381
wait for me

202
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,611
I confirmed this.

203
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:41,451
There's no one here because they're demolishing the house.

204
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,311
Are you sure?

205
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,481
right

206
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,611
Those children shouldn't exist in this world.

207
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,411
So where did they go?

208
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,251
A place that does not exist in this world

209
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:10,751
Listen carefully

210
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,711
Once you leave here

211
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:16,251
Let's forget the memories of the past

212
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:18,751
Sister Ya Hyun

213
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:19,851
What about uncle?

214
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:23,451
Is my uncle really dead?

215
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:28,581
What do you think?

216
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:31,051
What does uncle want us to do most?

217
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,151
Going out without reason

218
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:42,051
We don't need to hide anymore.

219
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:44,611
We'll go to a safe place where no one will recognize us.

220
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:46,281
Just go there

221
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:49,051
We can go out freely.

222
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:52,411
Enjoy water fun

223
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,351
Can also eat...

224
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,451
What? Are you okay?

225
00:16:58,411 --> 00:16:59,381
Is everyone okay?

226
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:01,980
Ready to blast

227
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,111
Get out of here!

228
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,111
We have to get out quickly and get everyone out.

229
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,581
hurry up

230
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:25,151
Follow me here

231
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:26,551
hurry up

232
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:36,451
Guitai

233
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:40,811
Come in

234
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,011
Yes Yes

235
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,651
Get it open

236
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:55,281
Catch up

237
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,951
Are you okay?

238
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,281
What to do next?

239
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:12,581
Come on, follow me.

240
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:40,811
Walk carefully

241
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:41,681
Hey, find it for me.

242
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:42,611
yes

243
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,181
Where did these guys go?

244
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,581
Go fast…

245
00:18:58,251 --> 00:18:59,481
Go fast

246
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,281
hurry up

247
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,481
Come here soon

248
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,451
It's okay. Come here.

249
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:20,781
Is Shiyu okay?

250
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:22,211
I'll take Shi Yu with me

251
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:25,711
what to do

252
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:31,711
They are over there

253
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:37,351
U-turn

254
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,411
Lift it up

255
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,181
Find someone quickly. No one.

256
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:52,211
Come here, you go down

257
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:05,011
Are you okay? Is Shi Yu okay?

258
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,151
Let's go.

259
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,951
Shi Yu, please bear with me

260
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,851
Go inside

261
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:40,651
Ma'am, nice to see you.

262
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,181
I heard you need my help

263
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,781
You are here

264
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:09,551
I've always wanted to see you.

265
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,311
God

266
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:17,381
Advise me to see my sister

267
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:20,751
I see

268
00:22:21,451 --> 00:22:26,811
He is a perfect person

269
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:30,351
If only I wasn't there...

270
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,511
I can't get pregnant

271
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:40,881
Please don't say that.

272
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:43,411
Didn't you come to see me?

273
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,151
I want to find a child worthy of him.

274
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:56,081
Perfect Child

275
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,851
Shi Yu didn't come to school today.

276
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:08,881
My mom said Choi Si-woo is in a mental hospital

277
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:09,951
Really

278
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:12,481
I heard Choi Si-woo is missing

279
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:14,481
That's a fucking lie.

280
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:17,211
My mom said she was chatting and laughing happily in the cafe.

281
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:18,351
It's so unreasonable.

282
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,651
How can I not be anxious when my child is missing?

283
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:24,351
I mean, it doesn't mean it's missing.

284
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:28,184
(Choi Si-woo)

285
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,451
daughter

286
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:34,681
mom

287
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:41,481
Get in the car and let's go

288
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:53,681
daughter

289
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:55,251
What's up

290
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:57,151
What did mom say?

291
00:23:57,151 --> 00:24:01,111
Always pay attention to your manners when you are outside

292
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,251
sorry

293
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,311
Whose daughter is my daughter?

294
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,581
Mom's daughter

295
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,311
Who does it look like?

296
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:10,811
mom

297
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:15,211
Then you are the best wherever and whenever you are.

298
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:17,611
Like mom

299
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:21,281
daughter

300
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:25,311
Mom is in a great mood today

301
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,211
I'm so happy I want to fly to the sky

302
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:30,911
Because the moment I've been dreaming of is coming

303
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:31,951
daughter

304
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:34,111
Do you want to hear my mother's childhood story?

305
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:35,151
good

306
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:38,881
When I was still studying

307
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:42,481
I thought I would die if I didn't get first place.

308
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:45,651
But what happened later?

309
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,251
I'm not dead

310
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:48,711
right

311
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,681
It's too much to die without getting first place

312
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,481
Because I...

313
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:00,711
Never missed the first place

314
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:03,511
So I didn't die

315
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:09,811
I'm kidding.

316
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,551
uncle

317
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:27,451
You are here

318
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:31,251
Did you have meal

319
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,981
And you

320
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:38,251
Stop eating this.

321
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:41,881
Just keep it a secret for me.

322
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,251
What's going on

323
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:50,911
Exercise should be moderate

324
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:58,081
No matter what

325
00:25:58,081 --> 00:26:00,611
If you overdo it, you'll get hurt

326
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:02,581
You have to overdo it to win

327
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:06,011
But uncle...

328
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,411
My mom

329
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:12,851
fine

330
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:16,851
Actually...I've said this before.

331
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,211
My best classmate in our class

332
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:24,481
But he hasn't been to school for several days.

333
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:28,281
What's wrong?

334
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,781
only

335
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:33,151
I heard all kinds of rumors about him.

336
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,351
Some say he's in a mental hospital.

337
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:39,851
Some say he's missing.

338
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:44,811
He should be fine.

339
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:47,781
Go back soon

340
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:49,581
Dinner time is coming

341
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:07,611
Let's go

342
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:16,011
"I don't know why"

343
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:22,611
"You're not going to say it"

344
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:27,311
"Let go of my hand"

345
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:28,811
Why don't you keep up?

346
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,711
Don't you think this place is beautiful?

347
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:38,251
after…

348
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:41,711
Although I don't know how long it will be

349
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,851
Let's come here together again.

350
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:58,411
Okay, let's go together again.

351
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:00,811
It's settled. Make a promise.

352
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:05,011
Check it, hurry up

353
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:06,251
Okay

354
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:13,884
(Giant sashimi)

355
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,551
what to do

356
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:26,011
Is there no one inside, Yahyun?

357
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:30,811
Do we have to stand here forever?

358
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,111
Is there an express boat?

359
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:43,451
Where is Tae-sik?

360
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:48,951
Come in. Come in first.

361
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:15,751
You must have suffered a lot on your way here.

362
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:27,281
We can't collect

363
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,551
The road is steep

364
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:32,181
It will also require money

365
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:34,151
This is for Tae-sik.

366
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:35,911
Don't refuse it. Take it.

367
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:10,011
Take good care of the children and be careful along the way

368
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:27,911
Go inside

369
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:32,881
Wait, is this really the place?

370
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,311
Sister Yahyun...

371
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:49,081
Sister Ya Hyun

372
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:58,551
Run faster

373
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:16,681
Run in separate directions

374
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:17,811
good

375
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:50,551
Where are you from?

376
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:00,381
Are you okay?

377
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:02,911
Let's go

378
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:17,881
Where did you go?

379
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:22,951
So Mein

380
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:24,781
Why give me a minute?

381
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:31,781
good

382
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:38,951
I'm here, I'm there

383
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:40,681
Catch Her

384
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:45,581
Lord,

385
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:49,511
Wait a minute.

386
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,081
Let me say something before I die.

387
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:53,381
Look around.

388
00:32:54,851 --> 00:32:55,981
What?

389
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:00,951
Run

390
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:25,581
You are all defective.

391
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:29,451
There is no value in living

392
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:02,111
Sister Ya Hyun

393
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:29,981
I, Kwon Kang Man, agree to abandon and destroy Kwon Sung Woo, whom I adopted eighteen years ago.

394
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:33,251
Reason: Dissatisfied with product quality

395
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:36,381
Damn, do I have to do this?

396
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,781
I, Yin Shixun, agree to abandon and destroy Yin Zhishuo, who I adopted seventeen years ago.

397
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,781
You say it too.

398
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,051
I agree

399
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:50,881
I, Han Zhexiu, agree

400
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:58,751
Abandoned and destroyed Han Youna, who was adopted 17 years ago

401
00:35:01,381 --> 00:35:02,651
The reason is…

402
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:10,151
I thought…

403
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,351
At least there will be a last resort

404
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,151
For example, there is no money to support us

405
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:21,651
Or I just can't develop feelings.

406
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:24,181
But it is not like that

407
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:25,911
We are just commodities

408
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:28,811
After spending money to buy it

409
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:30,711
If you are not satisfied, ask for a return

410
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,181
It's just a commodity

411
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:36,051
commodity…

412
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:41,181
We are just commodities.

413
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:46,911
I'm going to kill them

414
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,781
Kill them all.

415
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:53,281
I want to know the truth

416
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:56,211
Those who were our parents

417
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:59,181
Why do you want to kill us all?

418
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:02,051
Why do we have to hide like this?

419
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:05,381
Those who trade children as commodities

420
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:07,651
besides…

421
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:11,051
Uncle couldn't find it in the end.

422
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:13,451
The Monster

423
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:18,111
I have to find it.

424
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:23,781
This shouldn't be easy.

425
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:26,414
(Han Cheol-soo, principal of Dahan Korean Elementary School-Sumei)

426
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:27,451
Look

427
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:30,514
(VIP membership system)

428
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:30,481
Isn't this a card?

429
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:34,551
I think I need to find this first.

430
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:38,811
Yes

431
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:40,411
But how to find it?

432
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:49,951
I think I have seen

433
00:36:54,784 --> 00:36:57,244
(A happy school full of dreams and love)

434
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:00,781
I love you, principal.

435
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:09,381
Hello, principal. Hello, everyone. I love you.

436
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:15,211
Hello, principal. Hello, everyone. I love you.

437
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:16,451
yes

438
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:19,011
Hello I love you

439
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:22,084
(Principal Han Zhexiu)

440
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:23,251
After-school tutoring will start next week

441
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:25,351
Okay, let's do it.

442
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:28,481
Announce recruitment of teaching assistants now

443
00:37:28,481 --> 00:37:30,151
OK

444
00:37:47,814 --> 00:37:49,914
(big Korea small)

445
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,511
Yes, please come in

446
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,751
headmaster

447
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:59,811
Please be sure to attend today's dinner

448
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:03,181
Oh, is it today?

449
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,551
The teachers will probably feel uncomfortable if I go there.

450
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:08,581
How come?

451
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:12,081
We are looking forward to your participation

452
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:17,811
What should I do? I already have a date tonight.

453
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:21,081
Even if you only come for a short while

454
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:25,181
The principal will also be very encouraging to teachers

455
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,751
So

456
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:29,411
I'll try to squeeze out some time.

457
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:30,911
Good principal

458
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:32,711
I'm leaving now.

459
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:46,081
Take slow, deep breaths

460
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,351
Why do you want to do this?

461
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:54,251
Yoona's mom is sorry

462
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,881
Can you come out for a moment?

463
00:38:58,181 --> 00:38:59,681
mom

464
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:22,811
Lord, can you hear me?

465
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:24,511
Yeah, I heard it clearly.

466
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:38,781
He got in the car.

467
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:42,981
We will follow

468
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:46,051
Let's go

469
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,111
It's okay to keep smoking

470
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:08,851
No

471
00:40:08,851 --> 00:40:10,651
Why put out the cigarette?

472
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:17,411
I heard you guys are going to a nice place.

473
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:18,651
What

474
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:20,351
No

475
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:22,551
The Vice-Principal might also...

476
00:40:22,551 --> 00:40:24,551
Stop talking nonsense.

477
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:28,681
I didn't know the principal smoked

478
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:30,751
Occasionally I smoke

479
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,251
Are you guys going to continue the party?

480
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:34,981
No

481
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:37,181
Have fun then.

482
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:38,651
Take care

483
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:40,711
Go back.

484
00:40:40,711 --> 00:40:42,281
I passed by

485
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:51,381
You need a driver, right?

486
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:05,911
Let's go

487
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:29,411
The driver looks very young.

488
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:34,481
Don't worry, I have a driver's license.

489
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:35,881
How old are you?

490
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:41,311
Why do you ask this?

491
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:44,911
Excuse me

492
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:10,651
Already arrived

493
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:20,484
(Born in 2008, please note that outcall massage is always on call)

494
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:22,751
Miss

495
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:26,051
Can I see your driver's license?

496
00:42:26,051 --> 00:42:27,551
What

497
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:30,881
How old are you

498
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,811
I'm just curious

499
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,711
Why are you asking these questions?

500
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:38,581
You look so young

501
00:42:38,581 --> 00:42:41,651
At most, I'm 20 years old.

502
00:42:41,651 --> 00:42:43,111
Still 21 years old

503
00:42:43,111 --> 00:42:46,081
Not long after graduating from high school

504
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:48,381
What are you talking about?

505
00:42:58,151 --> 00:43:00,411
They haven't moved yet.

506
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:12,981
Do you want to go upstairs for a cup of coffee?

507
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:15,351
Don't worry

508
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:17,351
I live alone

509
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:23,381
Coffee is fine.

510
00:43:27,011 --> 00:43:30,611
Actually, I’m short of money.

511
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:33,681
I'll do anything as long as there's money to be made.

512
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:38,951
You look younger without your hat.

513
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,481
I like young girls like you.

514
00:43:43,481 --> 00:43:47,011
It would be better if it was a really young girl

515
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:50,481
But I prefer

516
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:53,781
A girl like you who is young and says she is short of money

517
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:55,811
It's just awesome

518
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:59,351
Of course it's good to have money

519
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:06,251
But I know a girl you'd like better.

520
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:09,281
Younger than me

521
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,481
But she's not yet an adult.

522
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:16,081
Is it too young?

523
00:44:16,081 --> 00:44:17,181
Won't

524
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:18,251
very good

525
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:19,581
marvelous

526
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:21,181
How old is she

527
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:24,744
(Born in 2008, please note that outcall massage is always on call)

528
00:44:23,681 --> 00:44:25,511
Born in 2008

529
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:27,651
How about it

530
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:29,081
Should I call her over?

531
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:32,051
Call her over here.

532
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,711
Where is the Lord?

533
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:49,651
Lord's peace

534
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:52,581
Are you really okay?

535
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:54,081
Um

536
00:44:59,181 --> 00:45:00,781
Where is Shi Yu?

537
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,351
He fell asleep

538
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:04,181
let's go

539
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:12,481
Lord's peace

540
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,781
Be careful

541
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:17,281
don’t worry

542
00:45:17,811 --> 00:45:19,411
I'm leaving

543
00:45:58,681 --> 00:45:59,781
Um

544
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:01,881
Come in

545
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:05,481
There is nothing unusual in Han Zhexiu's customer's home

546
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:08,051
There is nothing unusual at Quan Kangman's customer's home

547
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:10,881
Now we are heading to Choi Hyun-kyu's customer's home

548
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:28,411
Why don't you take off your scarf?

549
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:31,051
Is it cold?

550
00:46:35,481 --> 00:46:37,881
You're really shy

551
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,511
Are you really a high school student?

552
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:42,111
High school freshman?

553
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:43,711
Still in high school

554
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:47,211
How do students put on such heavy makeup?

555
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:49,681
Do you want to take a bath with your brother?

556
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:53,981
No, I'm kidding.

557
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:05,881
Don't move...

558
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,981
Brother, shit

559
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:21,781
Oh shit

560
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:24,151
You love hearing people call you brother so much, you're a pervert

561
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:26,151
Who are you...

562
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:27,951
What do you want to do?

563
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:29,411
Hey you bastard

564
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,281
Kneel down, you are...

565
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:34,511
Yoo...Na

566
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:36,511
I told you to get down on your knees, bastard.

567
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:47,581
I'll go outside to keep watch

568
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:49,051
Deal with it quickly and leave.

569
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:58,781
Where is the membership card?

570
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:02,611
What are you talking about

571
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:06,451
I asked you where your membership card is.

572
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:07,811
I…

573
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:09,511
I really don't know

574
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,511
I don't know anything

575
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:14,851
Where is Lin Jingmei?

576
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:17,011
Where is that bitch?

577
00:48:18,651 --> 00:48:19,551
Yuna

578
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:20,981
Yuna

579
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,451
Damn

580
00:48:23,251 --> 00:48:26,411
Don't call me that name.

581
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:30,951
Take a deep breath when you are angry...

582
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,781
Yuna

583
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,781
I told you to control your breathing when you are angry.

584
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,351
Very good. Take a deep breath slowly.

585
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:52,511
That's it

586
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:55,211
My Yuna is so good

587
00:48:58,551 --> 00:49:00,451
You're a scumbag

588
00:49:01,011 --> 00:49:02,811
Do you think I'll be fooled a second time?

589
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:04,451
Where is Lin Jingmei?

590
00:49:05,581 --> 00:49:07,111
Where is Lin Jingmei?

591
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,151
I asked you where Lin Jingmei is.

592
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:11,451
She...she went back to her parents' home.

593
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:14,281
How could Lin Jingmei make such a mess at home?

594
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:17,811
I've never seen her away from home for so long.

595
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:22,851
You'd better tell the truth

596
00:49:22,851 --> 00:49:26,251
Otherwise I will take the photos from your phone

597
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:28,051
Spread all

598
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:30,611
Are you crazy?

599
00:49:30,611 --> 00:49:34,481
Do you think you can have a good life after doing such a thing?

600
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:36,881
It's bad enough now anyway.

601
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:38,351
We have this one on hand.

602
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:43,981
You look younger without your hat.

603
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,151
I like young girls like you.

604
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:51,451
It would be better if it was a really young girl

605
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:55,511
But I prefer

606
00:49:55,511 --> 00:49:59,551
A girl like you who is young and says she is short of money

607
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,211
It's just awesome

608
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:03,181
Hello

609
00:50:08,181 --> 00:50:09,251
I know

610
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:11,111
I know where Lin Jingmei is

611
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:12,581
mental hospital

612
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:14,781
I put her in a mental hospital.

613
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:15,451
What

614
00:50:15,451 --> 00:50:16,551
She's crazy

615
00:50:16,551 --> 00:50:18,151
She finally went completely crazy

616
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:20,951
Please explain it to me clearly from beginning to end.

617
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:26,311
When she heard you were missing

618
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:30,111
I'll run all over the country looking for you

619
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:34,511
I ended up going completely crazy so I...

620
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,551
What did you say

621
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:39,911
The one who returns your goods

622
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:43,651
It's not your mom, it's me

623
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,411
Yoona's mom is sorry

624
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:59,051
Can you come out for a moment?

625
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:03,951
mom

626
00:51:18,781 --> 00:51:20,751
mom

627
00:51:46,684 --> 00:51:49,614
(I’m sorry, Yuna’s mom, can you come out for a moment?)

628
00:51:49,614 --> 00:51:50,814
(deleted)

629
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,611
I'm so busy.

630
00:52:02,611 --> 00:52:04,611
Forgetting things

631
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:06,081
Where is Yuna?

632
00:52:06,551 --> 00:52:07,951
She just went out.

633
00:52:07,951 --> 00:52:09,011
Honey, I'm going out.

634
00:52:09,011 --> 00:52:11,911
Wait for Yuna to come back and tell her that I will check her essay assignment.

635
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:13,211
good

636
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:14,511
Driver, let's go.

637
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,781
I don't even know this.

638
00:52:31,751 --> 00:52:33,811
Cursed my mother

639
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:36,611
Quick

640
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,711
Where is Mom?

641
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:39,981
Tell me quickly

642
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:41,251
Sumei, calm down.

643
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:42,911
Speak up! Speak up!

644
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,951
Come on, you can't kill him.

645
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:47,981
Tell me quickly, which hospital is your mother in?

646
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:48,711
I'm going to kill him

647
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:50,281
no

648
00:52:54,414 --> 00:52:58,384
(Postscript to "Returned Children")

649
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:04,251
daughter

650
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:05,251
What

651
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:09,081
Don't worry too much about Shi Yu, he will be fine.

652
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:27,944
(Kim Ah-hyun)

653
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:37,444
(Kim Ya-hyun Kim Ya-hyun)

654
00:54:03,014 --> 00:54:05,584
(Thanks to actor Yoo Seung-moo and actor Kim Soo-ro for their special guest appearance)

655
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:08,644
(Return children)

656
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:09,711
How many children did you say?

657
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:10,881
There are five in total

658
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,211
You should have seen her face.

659
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:14,251
Does it look like me?

660
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,711
I found it

661
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,751
Please confirm the situation at Han Zhexiu's home

662
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,051
Get out of there immediately

663
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:21,081
What kind of people are your parents?

664
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:24,781
That woman wants to be the most dazzling person in the world

665
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:26,451
Please give me something as a guarantee

666
00:54:26,451 --> 00:54:28,811
Ya Hyun's mother wants to ask you a favor

667
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:30,011
Will you agree?

668
00:54:30,011 --> 00:54:31,681
Let's go find Sumei's mother.

669
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:33,711
We don't know how to use that card.

670
00:54:33,711 --> 00:54:36,511
It's easy to imagine why those guys would be lying in ambush there.

671
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:38,081
Sumei's mother must know

672
00:54:38,081 --> 00:54:41,051
Why do you always try so hard to survive?

673
00:54:41,051 --> 00:54:42,311
If you get caught, you're dead.

674
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:43,711
