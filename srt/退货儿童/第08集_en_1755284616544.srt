Hello

10
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,170
Is it today?

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,170
Cleaning Day

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,130
Yes, we will be fully prepared.

13
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,570
are you sure

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,130

I have enough headaches just worrying about my daughter.

Is my situation getting better?

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,269
I heard that early pregnancy is very difficult.

19
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,030
Should I go see her?

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,430
She's fine.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,170
Fortunately, she is strong

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,570
When she is in a more stable condition, I will invite you to my home.

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,930
OK

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,830
I'm waiting for your news, sister.

25
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,430
Are all the children here?

What does this mean?

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,200
There were some troubles before

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,930
Everything will be solved

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,600

38

40
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,130
Dear parents, please follow the staff's instructions and we will go there first.

41
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,600

I advise you not to open it.

56

85
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,730
Please follow our instructions from now on.

86
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,530
What are you doing? Why are you making us walk around all the time?

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Why do you keep us walking around?

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,270
Please get out quickly

89
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,170
You'll be abandoned eventually anyway.

90
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,330
You know

91
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,930
I know too

92
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,070
It was I, Liu Hanjie, who agreed

93
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,530
Abandoned and destroyed Liu Huiyun, who was adopted 17 years ago

94
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,870
I honestly agree

95
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,929
Abandon and destroy Zhao Yala

96
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,070
There are many reasons for return.

97
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,330
Because the child has too many acne

98
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,200
I heard that acne is also related to genetics.

99
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,070
I was wondering what the problem was.

100
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,970
How ridiculous

101
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,170
No wonder I feel flawed.

102
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,100
Frequent colds and fevers

103
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,800
My wife is too tired to take care of me.

104
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,370
And since you want to change

105
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,730
I hope this time I can change to a child with good fortune.

106
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,200
You'll also help us look at the synoptic chart, right?

107
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,100
I…

108
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,170
There's nothing special to say

109
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,230
Our child is very sick

110
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,200
It was normal when I first brought it home.

111
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,470
But she was suddenly diagnosed with an incurable disease

112
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,130
Although there are medicines that can cure

113
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,200
I heard that a few injections will cure it.

114
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,600
But the asking price is 1 billion yuan

115
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,930
Do you know what the first thing that came to my mind when I heard it?

116
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,800
The price I paid for Eunjo

117
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,230
The first thing that comes to my mind is the price

118
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,770
That money

119
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,530
Adding the 1 billion in medical expenses, how much is the total?

120
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,300
I am so tired of calculating numbers first.

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,830
Feeling quite sick

122
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,430
In the process of raising children

123
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,170
Even if it costs hundreds of millions of yuan,

124
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,670
You will definitely not get it

125
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,100
Precious touching moments

126
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,530
Me

127
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,330
In the process of raising Eunjo

128
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,600
I've really experienced many such moments.

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,170
But I...

130
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,500
What do you think of first when you hear 1 billion?

131
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,600
But I won't think that way anymore.

132
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,700
After thinking carefully

133
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,100
I just realized that I am Eunjo's mother

134
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,170
How is it handled?

135
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,770
It should be sorted soon.

136
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,200
Let's go

137
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,700
Here we go…

138
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,570
She finally arrived...

139
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,730
Everyone is here

140
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,700
We're done, right?

141
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,400
This is the last one anyway.

142
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,070
At least say goodbye properly.

143
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,830
What goodbye

144
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,300
Just being here makes me feel uncomfortable and awkward.

145
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,970
Are you asking us to feel guilty?

146
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,870
Do you feel guilty?

147
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,130
I haven't even started yet, how can I feel guilty so soon?

148
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,700
We need to first clearly distinguish your crimes.

149
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,470
What

150
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,230
Let's share this guilt.

151
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,870
Everyone today

152
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,870
To kill your own child

153
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,970
This is different from what we agreed

154
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,230
If so, I will cancel the return.

155
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,730
Is it reasonable to ask us to kill people?

156
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,200
I want to cancel my return

157
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,730
We are also canceling...

158
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,670
They were just objects.

159
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,530
You bought it with your money.

160
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,200
Why are you treating them as human beings and trying to evade responsibility now?

161
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,600
But how can you ask us to kill people?

162
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,430
You're totally crazy.

163
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,570
You don't have to think it's a big deal.

164
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,030
There is no need to be afraid

165
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,330
Come

166
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,400
Even animals are judged by their usefulness.

167
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,930
Divided into domestic animals and wild animals

168
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,800
The same is true for humans

169
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,300
If you want to take it home, it must be useful.

170
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,370
Don't think too complicated

171
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,670
Once they have lost their usefulness, they can be slaughtered.

172
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,170
I plan to start from today

173
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,970
Finish this dirty business cleanly and neatly

174
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,930
That’s why we need the cooperation of our customers.

175
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,700
kill

176
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,070
Incitement to murder

177
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,300
Death by inaction

178
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,300
You should know this, right?

179
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,970
These are all serious crimes

180
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,230
We're already in the same boat

181
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,830
I'm going crazy.

182
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,500
All the rumors about transactional adoptions

183
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,830
Will disappear here

184
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,430
Of course I will join you.

185
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,900
Because today I...

186
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,070
It will kill my child too.

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,130
I can't do it

188
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,330
I'm leaving here

189
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,600
This is not right, is this reasonable?

190
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,870
Let me go

191
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,070
Bring her here

192
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,270
Let me go

193
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,030
Ma Enzu

194
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,000
Enzu

195
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,030
Don't touch

196
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,200
Please

197
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,270
Later, we will conduct a study with Dr. Jin Se-hee

198
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,570
Healing camp activities are about to begin

199
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,930
Everyone please gather in the center of the campground

200
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,700
Go to the campfire

201
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,700
What can you bring to your parents?

202
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,000
What kind of children can you be?

203
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,130
Let's share it together

204
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,330
Who wants to speak first?

205
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,670
I'll say first

206
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,370
My parents really love me very much

207
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,200
When did you feel the love of your parents?

208
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,770
When I pitch well

209
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,270
My parents will be very happy

210
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,630
Whenever I see them happy, I feel more motivated.

211
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,470
I see

212
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,530
Although I can't practice now.

213
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,970
I think whatever I do

214
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,130
They will all cheer for me and support me wholeheartedly.

215
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm a former professional baseball player.

216
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,230
I worked so hard to finally join a professional team.

217
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,100
I just found out that I have to be promoted from the Second Army to the First Army.

218
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,770
It's not something you can do by hard work

219
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,470
No matter how hard I try

220
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,070
Can't catch up with talented players

221
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,830
So I gave up my dream of becoming a baseball player

222
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,830
What do you want to do next?

223
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,130
Actually, I haven't thought about it specifically.

224
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,800
But I seem to like taking pictures

225
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,300
When I was practicing, I would take pictures for my friends whenever I had time.

226
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,130
I thought it was interesting at the time

227
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,670
My wife and I's dream

228
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,900
They all sent their sons to the major leagues.

229
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,570
so

230
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,230
We want a new

231
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,870
A child who can do this

232
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,430
What's this

233
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,100
I am not pregnant

234
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,270
I didn't have an abortion.

235
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,870
What does this mean?

236
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,070
but…

237
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,600
Maybe a child will be born

238
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,800
I asked you what this means

239
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,170
My mother from the beginning

240
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,200
I don't plan to use my eggs to create a child.

241
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,530
But use her own

242
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,000
What did you say

243
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,130
There should be hundreds of...

244
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,569
No

245
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,300
There are thousands of mother's eggs

246
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,230
The mother collects sperm from men with good genes

247
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,599
Combined with your own eggs to create an excellent child

248
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,599
Created using countless surrogate mothers

249
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,130
Then discard

250
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,400
Then created

251
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,900
Abandoned again

252
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,230
This is how I was created.

253
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,670
And the lady’s children too...

254
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,470
Wait, stop talking.

255
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,270
So now sisters...

256
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,930
No

257
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,130
That woman

258
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,370
Not the one who created my child

259
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,730
But she boldly tried to deceive me and my husband

260
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,470
Create her own children?

261
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,630
She's a crazy woman indeed.

262
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,800
I'm speechless, damn.

263
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,730
But why are you telling me?

264
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,070
What's going on?

265
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,930
What happened again?

266
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,100
Brat

267
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,630
hateful

268
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,630
Hello

269
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,930
Were you beaten?

270
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,530
Sorry for the long wait.

271
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,330
Now the game will begin

272
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,000
Start the survival game now

273
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,970
mom

274
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,130
mom

275
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
The rules are simple

276
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,670
Just survive without getting killed.

277
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,870
If you get shot, your dad will die.

278
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,370
Try your best to avoid being shot and escape. Listen carefully.

279
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,370
You will understand Mom...

280
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,400
It turns out that surviving is so difficult

281
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,330
That's right

282
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,970
There is another rule

283
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,200
No matter what happens

284
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,370
Never call "Mom and Dad"

285
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,900
If the person holding the gun doesn't shoot, he will die.

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,630
Don't run, I told you not to move.

287
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,270
dad

288
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,400
The game is about to begin.

289
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,100
Prepare

290
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,900
start

291
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,170
don't want

292
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,430
five

293
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,030
I will study hard

294
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,000
mom

295
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,330
Four

296
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,300
three

297
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,970
mom

298
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,500
2. I'm sorry

299
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,470
one

300
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,170
Daoxuan

301
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,500
What is this doing now?

302
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,070
Are you crazy?

303
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,130
What about me

304
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,100
Will become a selfish mother who saves Eunjo

305
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,800
Eunjo is here

306
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,500
They said just shoot you.

307
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,870
Will spare our ancestor's life

308
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,600
Eunjo...

309
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,300
Eunjo can't...

310
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,500
Didn't you say you would spare her life?

311
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Isn't she still alive?

312
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,170
Get out of the way

313
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,930
Get out of the way

314
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,570
Kill me

315
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,200
Eunjo is my daughter

316
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,770
My daughter

317
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,870
mom

318
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,500
Wife

319
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,400
Enzu

320
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,600
Mom, I'm sorry.

321
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,230
mom…

322
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,130
sorry

323
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,030
Failed to be a good mother

324
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,800
mom…

325
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,830
No, wife

326
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,130
Wake up...

327
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,400
Wife

328
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,030
Catch Kim Ah Hyun

329
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,570
So beautiful

330
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,200
I show off...

331
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,630
So beautiful

332
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,600
stop

333
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,500
I show off

334
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,730
Stop it

335
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,970
What is a mother?

336
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,300
Mother

337
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,430
If you have nothing to say, just hang up.

338
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,070
Useless girl

339
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,700
What is Mom?

340
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,070
But Se-hee

341
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,230
I don't need you anymore

342
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,270
There are mothers like me in the world.

343
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,370
Of course there will be a daughter like you

344
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,500
Death at the hands of a mother like me

345
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,770
We are the police

346
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,570
Ms. Jin Se-hee and her organization members

347
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,800
Suspected of child kidnapping and captivity

348
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,830

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,000
Please lay down your weapons and surrender. This is a warning.

352
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,870
I hope you will lay down your weapons and surrender.

353
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,570
Please put the gun down

354
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,170
Lay down your weapons and surrender immediately

355
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,070
Warning again

356
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,100
If you don't lay down your weapons and surrender, the police will open fire.

357
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,700
You have to leave quickly.

Hello

Director

364
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,370
You have to help me deal with this.

365
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,300
Didn't you agree not to send anyone?

366
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,500
What's going on?

367
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,330
The police shouldn't be here.

368
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,500
Really... let's get this clear

369
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,800
The police are out to catch the criminals

370
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,300
Any questions?

371
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,770
You have to go

372
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,030

As long as you are willing to help me, I will keep it a secret for life.

377
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,200
You have to help me

378

If you don't surrender, the police will open fire.

383
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,730
Hello

384
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,300
I believe you will handle it well.

385
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,030
Be neat and tidy

386
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,000
Yes, of course.

387
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,700
Please rest assured

388
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,300
Must be clean and neat

389

390
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,430
If you don't surrender, the police will open fire.

391
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,570
Uncle, it's all over.

392
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,670
Surrender

393
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,630
Warning again

394
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,430

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,330
You can throw me away now

398
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,730
walk fast

399
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,100
uncle…

400
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,830
uncle…

401
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,600
Can't

402
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,030
uncle

403
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,570

uncle

405
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,030
What to do if I can't

00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,230
Hello

409
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,470
Ladies and sisters

410
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,330
Now…

411
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,870
Things seem to be getting a little weird

412
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,400
It seems the police chief misunderstood something.

413
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,030
What misunderstanding?

414
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,330
Now the police say they want to arrest me

415
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,370
Then just shut up and die quietly.

416
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,400
Then you won't be caught.

417
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800

Hello, Kiss Tea Room

Mother

421
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,230
Who are you

422
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,170
Mother

423
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,730
I am Se-hee

424
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,330
There are so many people named Se-hee

425
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,170
Child, which Se-hee are you?

426
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,670
Ahn Se-hee, Kim Se-hee, or Choi Se-hee

427
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,600
Kim Se-hee

428
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,300
Why are you calling?

429
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,200
Are you short of money?

430
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,330
It’s not me…

431
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,300
If you have nothing to say, just hang up.

432
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,100
Useless girl

(Kiss Tea Room)

434
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,200
Damn, are you complaining to the bitch in the tea room?

435
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,430
Do you know why her name is Jin Se-hee?

436
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,170
The dean told me

437
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,870
Mother

438
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,170
Um

439
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,070
Mother

440
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,500
for you

441
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,530
Se-hee

442
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,400
Do you know why your name is Se-hee?

443
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,600
have no idea

444
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,600
Mom mentioned

445
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,270
My former colleague Ms. Park

446
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,199
The one who turned her life around after meeting a rich man

447
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,469
Her name is Se-hee.

448
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,469
I also want to be like her

449
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,530
That's why I named you Shixi

450
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,370
If I call you like this often, maybe I can become like her.

451
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,270
But Se-hee

452
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,500
I don't need you anymore

453
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,470
My life is about to turn around

454
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,770
There will always be someone to take care of you

455
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,900
You have to be good and obedient. Mom is leaving.

456
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,830
Mother

457
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,730
Mom, where are we going?

458
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,700
I worked so hard to build all this.

459
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,170
I…

460
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,400
But I worked so hard to get to this point

461
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,830
What can those guys do to me?

462
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,600
Do you think this can bring me down?

463
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,500
Do you think that's perfect?

464
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,000
daughter

465
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,100
my daughter

466
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,530
You are here

467
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,870
You just want to believe it's perfect.

468
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,030
You are just...

469
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,570
Just create a child that looks like you.

470
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,670
What you call a perfect human being

471
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,500
Not your kind at all.

472
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,930
Born in a family with healthy parents

473
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,070
Different from you

474
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,730
Growing up loved by parents

475
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,130
Different from you

476
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,630
A person who radiates shining light

477
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,000
Shut up

478
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,170
You smell like rot

479
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,170
Foul, pungent smell of decay

480
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,630
No

481
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,070
You think I don't know?

482
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,670
The inferiority complex that accumulates in you

483
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,000
The stench of decay is disgusting

484
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,730
No, that's not it.

485
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,930
No...

486
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,230
Didn't you say that all we need to do is love our children?

487
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,800
Just look at them with loving eyes.

488
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
Why didn't you do this to me?

489
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,000
I thought

490
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,770
You will regret abandoning me.

491
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,670
I hope you've at least thought about it.

492
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,500
Am I still alive?

493
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,430
I knew you were such a bad person.

494
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,500
I won't miss you anymore

495
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,100
I might as well hate you completely

496
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,030
Hate to the bone

497
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,930
I regret having any hope for you.

498
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,370
You lose

499
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,730
Completely lost

500
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:13,970
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office raided the SH Medical Foundation this morning.

501
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,770
(The illegal sale and adoption of Kim Se-hee's medical foundation was investigated)

502
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,470
Regarding the late CEO Kim Se-hee's operation of an illegal adoption trafficking organization

503
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,600
Also known as the "Kim Se-hee scandal" after it was exposed

504
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,730
Political and financial circles are in panic

505
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:26,470
The outside world is paying close attention to whether more doubts will be exposed one after another.

506
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,200
Help them untie it quickly

507
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,870
Act quickly

508
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,200
That guy kidnapped us.

509
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
He is a psychopath

510
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,530
Arrest him now

511
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,300
Don't move

512
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,900
Don't move

513

(University entrance examination)

514
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,100

my daughter

521
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,400
Thank you for your hard work. How are your studies going?

522
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,830
No, it's too difficult. What's difficult?

523
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,300
Math is too difficult

524
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,300
But you still have to learn

525
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,370
Let's go eat

526
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,630
Let's go

529
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,100
Concentrate on eating or singing, don't eat while singing

530
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,970
I've auditioned so many times, why am I still so nervous?

531
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,530
I'm super nervous too.

532
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,930
Shi Yu, I will behave well this time.

533
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,500
Of course you are my sister

534
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,800
Of course you are my daughter.

535
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Shi Yu, after we sent my sister in

536
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,000
How about going to the amusement park?

537
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,870
Really

538
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,930
How can I go with you?

539
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:06,370
We're going to play on our own today.

540
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,230
So should we wait for sister?

541
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,300
All right

542
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,700
OK, then we can go together after you finish the audition.

543
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,070
OK

544
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,030
What's going on?

545
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,400
Uncle, does prison life suit you?

546
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,600
How come you look better every time we meet?

547
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,230
Stop talking nonsense over there.

548
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,570
Nothing happened recently?

549
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,300
Is there anyone bullying you in there?

550
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,630
If you have any, tell me and I will solve them all.

551
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,670
How about you? How are you doing in school?

552
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,130
When it comes to studying, of course I...

553
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,230
How can I possibly read it?

554
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,930
Just force yourself to try harder.

555
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,700
What's interesting recently?

556
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,800
Recent words...

557
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,030
Electronic game consoles are super fun

558
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,870
I bought a lot of game discs to play with my uncle

559
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,370
Wait a minute, when uncle is released from prison...

560
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,870
It should be two or three...

561
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,170
Maybe it's already the fourth edition.

562
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,400
Are the other kids doing well?

563
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,470
Of course

564
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,330
We agreed to go see Seoksu together tomorrow

565
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,900
It would be great if I could go with you.

566
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,170
Next time

567
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,930
We must go together next time

568
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,930
Check

569
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,370
Check it out…

570
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,770
Check

571
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,770
good

572
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,600
Seoksu hyung, this place is really nice

573
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,300
We follow the agreement

574
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,630
Came here

575
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,330
I really miss you, Seoksu.

576
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,000
Take it

577
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,400
Sent...

578
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,900
Wow looks awesome

579
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,330
This is for eight people.

580
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,070
Although there is a lot of meat

581
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,100
But the dishes for a housewarming banquet seem a bit limited

582
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,970
Is it really okay to have all meat?

583
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:15,830
I think it's great.

584
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,770
But the dishes are a bit limited

585
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,000
How about cooking some instant noodles?

586
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,130
I almost vomited just now

587
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,700
Just hearing the word "Pao" in instant noodles...

588
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,230
I'm done

589
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,270
But I seem to smell fried chicken

590
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,300
Shi Yu is really amazing. How did you know?

591
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,300
What's going on, my sister Xuan

592
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,370
What?

593
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,400
Thanks, is this really for me?

594
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,170
Why don't we eat together like this?

595
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,500
Who should I give the chicken leg to?

596
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,400
Give me

597
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,130
Good for Shi Yu and...

598
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,600
My sister Xuan

599
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,900
Okay, I'll have a chicken drumstick too.

600
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,200
Our youngest

601
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,400
Sumei is this

602
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,630
This is also the leg

603
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,470
It feels like dry meat.

604
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,670
Another one I'll show you: chicken wings...

605
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,900
My sister Xuan, the night view here is really beautiful

606
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,430
Do you want to take a picture together?

607
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:10,930
OK

608
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:12,970
Good to shoot

609
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:15,430
one two three

610
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:47,270
(Postscript to "Returning Children")

611
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,700
You lose

612
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,700
Completely lost

613
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,600
I love you

614
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,970
mom

615
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,730
Crazy Woman

616
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:19,000
(Thanks to all the viewers who loved "Return Kids")

617
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:40,730
"One night when I thought of you"

618
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:54,800
"I remember the way you held my hand"

619
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,770
"I don't know why."

620
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,370
"You're not going to give a reason."

621
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:17,400
"Let go of my hand"

622
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:23,970
"Look into my eyes"

623
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:32,770
"That's when I knew it was over."

624
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:39,600
"The one who once looked at me and held my hand"
