1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,306
Brother! Oppa!

2
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,608
Brother! Oppa!

3
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,200
Oppa, hyung

4
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:46,112
Are you okay? Hyung!

5
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,214
Oppa

6
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,182
How did you know about this place?

7
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:55,655
Bro, why are you like this?

8
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,191
Say something!

9
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,066
Brother! What should I do, Oppa?

10
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,162
brother

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,430
Why is my brother...

12
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,132
What should I do, oppa, what should I do! Hyung!

13
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,234
What about the children?

14
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,908
Wait, I'll kill them all at once

15
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,397
brother!

16
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,133
brother!

17
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,469
Let go of this

18
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,238
Ahyeon-ah

19
00:01:44,952 --> 00:01:46,119
I'm not going, uncle

20
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:48,718
You'll die if you do this

21
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:50,920
What if my mom no longer needs me?

22
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:53,448
Then, aren't you going to die anyway?

23
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,149
Before my mom abandoned me

24
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,781
I'm the one who leaves my mom first

25
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,183
Uncle, stop it too

26
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:03,575
Mom

27
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,407
Not my mom

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,142
Let's go back

29
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,798
Don't go

30
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,536
When you go in there

31
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:18,638
You'll regret it

32
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:21,822
I you

33
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:23,577
I might kill you

34
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:25,578
Then do it now

35
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:37,924
brother!

36
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,011
Why don't you say anything?

37
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,834
Seoksu!

38
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,600
Why is he like this, why is he like this!

39
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,001
Seok-su, look at your sister.

40
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,469
Seok-su, look at your sister.

41
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,667
Oh, what should I do, sis?

42
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:53,190
Seoksuya

43
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,448
I'm okay

44
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:56,744
Don't say it, don't say it!

45
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:59,968
Seok-su, don't say anything. You won't die, okay? Please.

46
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:01,326
still...

47
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,617
good

48
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,045
In the end, we're all together

49
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,958
Seoksu, Seoksu

50
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,193
Wake up, bro! Alright.

51
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,985
Brother! My real name

52
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,365
Seoksuya

53
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,600
Hey, you little shits!

54
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,336
Ah, Seoksu

55
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,105
stonemason...

56
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,867
Wake up, Seok-su! Wake up, hyung!

57
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,148
Wake up!

58
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,601
Seoksuya

59
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,766
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, brother

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,222
Seok-su, I'm sorry about your sister.

61
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,933
brother

62
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:06,980
Sister!

63
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,484
Oh, why are you doing this to us, why

64
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,455
oh my god

65
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:20,827
Sister!

66
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,075
Oppa!

67
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,387
mister!

68
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,289
Hey guys

69
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,260
Ahyeon-ah

70
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,876
mister!

71
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:16,209
Please save me, I don't want to die.

72
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,880
Please save me, sir

73
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,382
I don't want to die

74
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:29,890
This is news I just heard.

75
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,892
The police secured CCTV footage

76
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,461
The murder case of the pastor and his wife at the Buchon-dong church

77
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,398
There is news that some of the identities of the prime suspects have been secured.

78
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:42,135
There are three people in total, including Mr. Yoon, the son of a pastor couple.

79
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:48,508
Ah, ah, sir

80
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,343
It's weird, hyung, hyung...

81
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,111
My brother is weird, mister

82
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,125
Seoksu, Seok, Seok...

83
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,418
Breathe, I can't breathe, sir.

84
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,041
What should I do? I can't breathe.

85
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,090
What should I do?

86
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,260
My brother isn't breathing, what should I do?

87
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,496
let's go

88
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,332
Hurry up, Somi, take care of the kids. Hurry up, Joo-an, come to your senses! Hurry up.

89
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,564
you

90
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,457
Did you miss it or let it go?

91
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,400
I really liked her

92
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,825
It was somewhat usable among them, but you can't do that!

93
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,536
Did I bring you here to be their uncle?

94
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,711
Ha, Jeonghyun, yes

95
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:06,922
Next time Ahyeon

96
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,022
I have to kill him

97
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,259
Cleaning up useless things

98
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,574
That's what you have to do, right?

99
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,497
Do you understand?

100
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,957
Hey, brother, wake up.

101
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,238
Huh, huh?

102
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,674
Brother, why, why are you lying down like this, brother?

103
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,075
Hey, brother, wake up

104
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,280
We decided to live happily together, why?

105
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,882
Why, why is my brother dying, why!

106
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,684
Brother, don't die

107
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,819
oh my god

108
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,888
mister

109
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,591
Dude, this isn't right. Wake up, bro, huh?

110
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,959
Sister

111
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,500
Sister, sister, this isn't right!

112
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:50,864
oh my god

113
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,867
What should I do, Oppa, Oppa! We decided to live happily together.

114
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,673
We decided to live happily together

115
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,411
Why, why did you promise and not keep it, why

116
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,247
Brother, you can't die, you can't die

117
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,807
No, bro, don't die, bro

118
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:12,052
Please, I beg you, wake up.

119
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,688
Please open your eyes

120
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,789
Oppa! Brother!

121
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,628
Oppa, wake up

122
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,563
What should I do, bro?

123
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,698
brother!

124
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,787
sorry

125
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,637
I'm too late

126
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,725
It's my fault

127
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,512
I couldn't keep it

128
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,835
Ordinary

129
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,806
He said he would let me live freely

130
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,333
however...

131
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,599
But now there is no stone

132
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,022
What should I do, sir?

133
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,559
What should I do?

134
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,579
Breaking news

135
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:42,397
Shin Kye-re Party lawmaker Kwon Kang-man was found dead.

136
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:47,201
A total of five bodies, including that of Rep. Kwon Kang-man, were found at the scene.

137
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:51,985
The suspects are children involved in the murder of Pastor Yoon Se-hoon and his wife...

138
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:57,942
Actually

139
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:01,020
I heard something a bit embarrassing

140
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,096
which...

141
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:06,492
There seems to be some talk going around in the National Assembly.

142
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:10,397
Rep. Kwon Kang-man

143
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,836
I was a member of the adoption membership

144
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:20,224
I see that the confidentiality is not strictly maintained.

145
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:22,760
I'm a little scared too

146
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,587
I hate it when people talk about their private lives.

147
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,256
Am I being sensitive?

148
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,427
Pastor Yoon and his wife became like that.

149
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,815
Even Rep. Kwon Kang-man became like that.

150
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:39,933
Madam

151
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:43,536
If you think about it carefully

152
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,995
Wouldn't that be a good thing?

153
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:00,234
Anyone who knows that you and I met

154
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:02,946
There is no one in this world anymore

155
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,092
Hey, sister

156
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:09,072
I am

157
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:13,623
I know very well that closing the past opens the future.

158
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,337
What are you talking about...?

159
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:23,148
In a time when there were no laws and technology was lacking, errors were inevitable.

160
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:25,744
So, to be honest, there were some noisy things

161
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,395
But now we have laws and perfect technology.

162
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:31,350
No more errors

163
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,710
All you have to do is filter out past mistakes and get rid of them.

164
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:38,458
Cleanly without any trace

165
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,429
You will have to take responsibility for those words.

166
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,634
You know?

167
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,436
I won't leave any trace.

168
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,338
No trace

169
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:11,219
When will it be perfect?

170
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,093
Soon

171
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,430
It'll be done soon

172
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,094
Let's stop now

173
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,210
I won't let you do anything dangerous anymore.

174
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,209
I can't lose anyone anymore

175
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:32,845
I can't go

176
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:35,024
what?

177
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,595
She's the woman who tried to kill us.

178
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,565
And he even killed Seok-su.

179
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,659
What's next?

180
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:44,432
More children will be sacrificed

181
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,203
I can't tolerate this anymore

182
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,573
Ahyeon-ah

183
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,273
I promised the kids

184
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,669
I will let you go wherever you want and live freely.

185
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:00,779
I couldn't protect Seok-su though

186
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,670
I really want the remaining children to live like that.

187
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,614
I can never end it like this

188
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,828
You're alive

189
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,565
Hey guys, how have you been?

190
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,270
A new child is born

191
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,772
One child is missing

192
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,957
Shall we see? Yes

193
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,418
uh...

194
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,998
I had a really hard time finding this

195
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,766
It must be hard for you

196
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,751
who are you?

197
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,164
refund?

198
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:42,509
This is your last chance

199
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,970
So I can apply by this weekend?

200
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,544
How do you plan to compensate?

201
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,516
Oh, I just want to get paid

202
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,151
Is that possible?

203
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:54,452
sure

204
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:58,191
Since they said this was the last chance, everyone was requesting a refund?

205
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,619
Now I'm sick of children, I don't even want to look at them.

206
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:07,187
Please be advised that refunds will not be possible after this period.

207
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:09,600
Don't miss this valuable opportunity.

208
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,028
But I still have feelings for him

209
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:13,861
How to raise a child...

210
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,903
Madam

211
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,546
In the first place, people who think like that are human

212
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,682
I don't buy children with money.

213
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:25,786
nevertheless

214
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,878
I grew attached to it while raising it

215
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,702
Because of that, I can't abandon my child.

216
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,069
Well, I don't know

217
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:39,098
There's no way such stupid and inferior people could be my customers.

218
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:45,037
I'll clean it up neatly.

219
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,210
And you know what?

220
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:55,823
My sister's husband's genes are in my daughter.

221
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:58,918
Because he's a healthy child

222
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,688
We'll probably get good results within next week.

223
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:07,760
yes

224
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,982
Yes, sir

225
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,289
What is this? I got a letter.

226
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:06,686
My child

227
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:08,988
What do you mean by defective?

228
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,256
Yes, sir

229
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,992
You wanted to raise Dohyun to be a baseball player, right?

230
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,294
But?

231
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,796
It's really unfortunate

232
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,999
Dohyun's genetic information and physical development

233
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,548
As a result of comprehensive analysis of exercise performance ability, etc.

234
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:24,327
Why are you analyzing it there?

235
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,305
sir

236
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:26,983
This time because of a shoulder injury

237
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,287
I can confirm that you have received treatment. Is that correct?

238
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:31,711
no

239
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,030
It's just a minor sprain, not a serious injury.

240
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,383
If I go to Thailand for training this time...

241
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,488
Our Dohyun

242
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,692
Where on earth is the problem and how bad is it?

243
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,903
Is that you?

244
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,743
I can't see anything here

245
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,095
Give it to me

246
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,330
How's the situation there?

247
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:24,730
Same here

248
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:28,242
What is the refund request rate?

249
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:30,168
It's 96 percent

250
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,671
What about the remaining 4%?

251
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,040
No response yet

252
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,942
Push

253
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:40,137
Please share with me the list of those who have not paid their refunds and let's finish this quickly.

254
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:41,975
We need to move on to the next step, quickly

255
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:42,983
All right

256
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,019
Well, it hasn't even been a week since I started, so 96% isn't bad.

257
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,976
See, am I right?

258
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,339
You can't abandon the child because you're attached to it?

259
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:54,762
Funny sound

260
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,460
Jeong Hyeon-ah

261
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,035
When are you going to kill Ahyeon?

262
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:07,007
Can't you do it?

263
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:08,244
no

264
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:09,859
I don't have time

265
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:11,010
yes

266
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:36,603
Oh, what the fuck!

267
00:21:31,828 --> 00:21:33,118
That woman must die

268
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:34,027
shut up!

269
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,351
mister!

270
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,155
It's a member's cell phone.

271
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:05,164
Are you hurt anywhere?

272
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:06,357
are you okay

273
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:20,039
D-Day?

274
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,877
I think this is the refund date?

275
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,114
however

276
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,461
Are there cases where the organization issues the refund first?

277
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,688
No way

278
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:34,920
There has never been a case where the parents applied for a refund first, or the organization did so first.

279
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,856
It's all about money

280
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:39,092
But here

281
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,900
This is not a refund request

282
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,680
I am eligible for a refund

283
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:52,176
Lee Do-hyun

284
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,106
Seo Eun-jo?

285
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:56,977
These guys

286
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,626
It's the top tier for refunds.

287
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,986
But why are these two still on hold?

288
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:04,116
Even though they said they would give me a refund

289
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,075
I haven't decided yet

290
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:08,420
perhaps

291
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:10,975
There may be some parents who are a little different.

292
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:15,394
Like Somi's mother

293
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:43,023
People don't suspect text messages from delivery drivers.

294
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,392
So I planted malware in the link

295
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,764
The moment you press this

296
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:52,933
This person's phone is mine

297
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:56,670
Look look

298
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:59,638
Where are you now and where are you going?

299
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,242
Who are your family members and who did you exchange text messages with?

300
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,012
I can tell you everything that's going on right now.

301
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:10,882
Well, first of all, the good thing is

302
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,270
Eunjo's condition hasn't gotten any worse than last time.

303
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:17,189
Oh, thank you, teacher.

304
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,605
How about the treatment I mentioned last time...

305
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:21,910
that is...

306
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:25,599
It is a new drug that has only recently been developed.

307
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,667
Because it is not covered by insurance in Korea

308
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:30,189
I know it will be a huge burden

309
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:32,902
For now, this is the best method.

310
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:35,075
Moreover, in Eunjo's case

311
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,328
The disease is progressing faster than expected...

312
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,914
I don't have time

313
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,684
Is there really no other way?

314
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:45,652
hmm...

315
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:49,089
There are cases where organizations or individuals make donations.

316
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:53,593
And since it's allocated sequentially starting from low-income patients...

317
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,086
No, how

318
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,532
How can one injection cost over a billion, sir?

319
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:04,563
Father

320
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,773
Still, thinking of Eunjo

321
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,042
I suggest you think about it one more time...

322
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:22,447
Today, we invited a special mother and child.

323
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:26,234
Oh, baseball fans might be familiar with this.

324
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:30,351
You've already been featured in the media a lot for your high school-level skills, right?

325
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:32,509
This is student Lee Do-hyeon!

326
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,379
It's a shame, but I guess I'll have to call you a former player now.

327
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:44,068
Lee Do-hyeon gave up his dream of becoming a pitcher due to a serious injury.

328
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:46,646
He said he was looking for a new dream.

329
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,915
What happened in the meantime?

330
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:55,721
Dohyun!

331
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,125
What's wrong, what's wrong? Are you okay?

332
00:25:57,192 --> 00:25:58,892
Hey! Dohyun, Dohyun, are you okay?

333
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,627
I told you not to push yourself too hard, hey, stay still, stay still

334
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:05,731
Miss, I told you not to push yourself too hard, oh, really

335
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:10,970
I have nothing to say, Mother.

336
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,508
Thank you for your hard work, Coach.

337
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:19,211
Your mother has had a hard time too

338
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:46,899
Well, right now, in Dohyun's mind

339
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:49,929
More than the regret of giving up on my dream, I am more concerned about my mother.

340
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:52,712
I feel more sorry and regretful

341
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,849
Our Dohyun is that kind of child, overflowing with love.

342
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,584
yes that's right

343
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:58,400
yes

344
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,500
My mother is no different

345
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:01,703
Just our Dohyun

346
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,467
So that you can fully feel your mother's love

347
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:06,013
Please keep expressing yourself

348
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:08,193
Please support my new dream

349
00:27:08,703 --> 00:27:11,296
Mom, you love Dohyun so much, right?

350
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:11,897
yes

351
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,366
Could you tell me something?

352
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,835
I love you, my son.

353
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,070
Give it a try

354
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:23,075
Our son

355
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:26,345
Mom loves you

356
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:30,126
Mom, it was so awkward

357
00:27:30,193 --> 00:27:31,518
Me too, me too

358
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:32,819
right?

359
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:34,920
oh

360
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:36,954
Thank you both for your hard work

361
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,569
Thank you so much for having me today, teacher.

362
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:41,529
I feel like I'm coming here and getting properly healed.

363
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:43,429
Thank you so much, teacher.

364
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:47,428
Dohyun, do you want to go out for a bit? I have something to talk to Mom about.

365
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:48,902
Oh, yes

366
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,202
Go out and wait

367
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:59,445
Oh, Do-Hyeon's mother, are you having a hard time?

368
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,852
You must have had a hard time having children for a long time.

369
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:07,463
You raised him so wonderfully.

370
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,556
It's not like our blood is mixed

371
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:11,757
You did a great job, you're amazing

372
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:15,427
Oh, I know how hard you've worked.

373
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:17,885
You raised him so well

374
00:28:17,952 --> 00:28:19,346
It's all about genes

375
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:24,803
I did a few more tests

376
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,375
Dohyun didn't have good genes.

377
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:33,712
He wasn't a kid who grew up to be an athlete from the beginning.

378
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,248
Sir, what about that...

379
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:43,523
If I speak louder here

380
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,525
Everyone outside, including Dohyun, can hear it.

381
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:49,161
If that's not what you want, just listen

382
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:56,135
In fact, how much of a waste of time and money have you spent?

383
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,838
But now, should we support a new dream?

384
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:01,773
That's nonsense.

385
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:05,255
My mother invested a lot of money.

386
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:07,414
The kid couldn't do that.

387
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:09,348
Why should your mother suffer the loss?

388
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:13,385
Mother did her best

389
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,140
Now, please give me a refund.

390
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:48,199
uh

391
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,661
Is there only one left now?

392
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,166
Wait a minute

393
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:07,874
hello

394
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:10,110
hello

395
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:11,342
Please sit down

396
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,901
How is it here...

397
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,457
You're surprised

398
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,796
Oh, I came here because the hospital asked me to speak to Eunjo's mother.

399
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,777
So, today's teacher...

400
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:25,483
Yes, I am

401
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,792
Are you having a hard time?

402
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:29,861
How heartbreaking it is when your child is sick

403
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:34,144
Did you get the invitation, Mother?

404
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,338
How much heartache are you in?

405
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:40,272
I can't do it for a sick child, though

406
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:42,774
How much more effort will it take for Eunjo?

407
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,115
What are you talking about now?

408
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,582
But mom

409
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:52,568
Why don't you give the child a shot?

410
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,689
If you wanted to save your child from the beginning

411
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:58,361
You should have somehow made money and given me the injection.

412
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:00,417
You're not that poor.

413
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:07,599
That's it, a love worth a billion

414
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,604
Stop it now and give me a refund.

415
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:16,975
I will change you into a perfect child until you like it.

416
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:21,647
A new silver lining, if it doesn't work, another silver lining, if it doesn't work, another silver lining

417
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:25,118
Mom just did what she always did

418
00:31:25,185 --> 00:31:27,286
Just raise them well

419
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,554
I guess people are just objects to this person.

420
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:33,716
Something you can replace if you don't like it

421
00:31:56,354 --> 00:31:57,584
mom

422
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:58,753
huh?

423
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,403
Does Mom hate me?

424
00:32:01,217 --> 00:32:02,255
what?

425
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:04,019
just

426
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,292
Other families' kids are good at studying too

427
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,798
They do a lot of pretty things too

428
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:14,234
I can't do anything for my mom.

429
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:15,434
You, that...

430
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,159
what

431
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,188
I can't even do anything pretty

432
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,803
You always make your mom suffer

433
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,649
If you need to go to the bathroom, just tell me.

434
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:31,312
You drank a lot of water earlier.

435
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,192
Sorry

436
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:35,322
mom

437
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,495
Stop talking nonsense

438
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:42,594
Go to sleep now

439
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:06,634
Are you okay?

440
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,087
uh

441
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,588
That's right

442
00:33:16,002 --> 00:33:17,938
Did you get that text too?

443
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:20,932
That invitation

444
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:23,218
Why do you care about that?

445
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:25,605
No, just...

446
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,416
Just bring that up one more time

447
00:33:27,992 --> 00:33:30,163
I deleted that text as soon as I got it.

448
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,771
Delete you too, quickly

449
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:36,633
Okay, I got it

450
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:29,486
That's it, a love worth a billion

451
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:46,351
Are you Eunjo's mother?

452
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:48,062
yes

453
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,663
Uh, can I come in and talk for a minute?

454
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:02,360
Eunjo

455
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:04,095
Have you been thinking about getting a refund?

456
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,175
If I refund you, this is what will happen to Eunjo

457
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:11,979
You really didn't know?

458
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:14,772
I didn't know

459
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,844
To treat children so cruelly...

460
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:22,446
If I knew

461
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:24,988
How can I tell our Eunjo...

462
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,472
If it weren't for you, old man

463
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:30,352
I would already be dead

464
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:33,800
meet a good adult

465
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:35,667
As if I'm alive right now

466
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,770
Eunjo and the other kids too

467
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,871
So that I can continue living

468
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:43,596
help

469
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,831
Are you ready to meet the kids?

470
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:46,503
yes

471
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,586
Yeah, let's get rid of everything

472
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:16,839
Dohyun, cell phone

473
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:17,820
cell phone?

474
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:21,019
Today's camp rule: Leave your cell phone behind.

475
00:37:21,086 --> 00:37:22,524
Oh, here

476
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,044
Right

477
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,655
Listen carefully

478
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,823
You guys are more important than revenge

479
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:41,667
Don't get hurt, never

480
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:44,715
Don't worry, we can do it.

481
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,679
Ahyeon, please take care of me.

482
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:48,733
yes

483
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,802
Siwoo is safe and well too

484
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:52,908
yes

485
00:37:54,308 --> 00:37:55,773
let's go

486
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,477
Yes, let's go

487
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,344
Ah, Dr. Kim Se-hee, you are truly a wonderful person.

488
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,530
Please invite me to this event too

489
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:30,901
Oh, I see

490
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:33,250
This is going to be really fun, right?

491
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:34,976
uh

492
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:28,297
Dohyun?

493
00:39:29,558 --> 00:39:30,697
let's go

494
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,264
yes

495
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:39,702
Are all the kids here?

496
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,001
There's one left

497
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:49,022
mom

498
00:40:00,372 --> 00:40:02,369
Mom! Hey

499
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:03,590
Go together

500
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:12,443
It would have been better if you had come with dad.

501
00:40:13,146 --> 00:40:14,480
You don't like your dad?

502
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:18,550
I'm so glad I came with my mom

503
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,075
Oh my, our Sehee

504
00:40:21,142 --> 00:40:22,829
What are you going to make, Mom?

505
00:40:22,896 --> 00:40:24,422
Mom's favorite curry

506
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,091
Hmm, that sounds delicious

507
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:29,696
Then mom

508
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,258
I'll go get something from the car and come back.

509
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:33,665
Make it delicious

510
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,260
huh

511
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,167
I'll go and come back

512
00:40:52,652 --> 00:40:53,651
mom

513
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,422
mom

514
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:03,895
mom!

515
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,086
I've arrived, where is everyone?

516
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:09,861
How did you come?

517
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:18,856
everyone

518
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:21,439
Thank you for waiting so long.

519
00:43:26,897 --> 00:43:29,776
The game will now begin.

520
00:43:35,148 --> 00:43:38,716
The survival game begins now.

521
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,385
mom

522
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:46,251
Child, Mom

523
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:49,963
The rules are simple

524
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,300
All you have to do is survive and not die.

525
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:54,901
If you get shot, you die

526
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:55,869
dad

527
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:57,170
Listen up straight

528
00:43:58,489 --> 00:43:59,787
mom

529
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:01,263
Mom, you're surviving

530
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,174
It's this difficult

531
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:07,145
Oh, and there's one more rule.

532
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:11,783
No matter what happens, never call Mom or Dad.

533
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:15,536
Then you die right away

534
00:44:15,603 --> 00:44:18,467
Okay, let's start the game.

535
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,643
No, I'm not ready

536
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,095
city

537
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:23,299
work!

538
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,314
What are you doing now, are you crazy?

539
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:56,363
Congratulations, you got another scholarship?

540
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,998
Youngjae is different, isn't he?

541
00:44:58,065 --> 00:44:58,799
Are you a genius?

542
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,133
Then what do you do?

543
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,500
Where did the vulgar blood go?

544
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,034
What are you talking about?

545
00:45:03,664 --> 00:45:05,536
He's a good person who gets a scholarship

546
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,175
let's go

547
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:09,907
I heard you're getting a scholarship

548
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:12,243
We should celebrate again

549
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,577
let's go

550
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,849
Go, go quickly

551
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,049
Miss, come quickly and go quickly.

552
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,017
Hey, shit, step on it

553
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:23,432
What the heck, it stinks

554
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:25,525
Miss, it's dirty

555
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:27,527
Hey, stop it, stop it

556
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:29,360
But I still have to give a gift, right?

557
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,449
Let's finish this now

558
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:12,532
We're all in the same boat now.

559
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,267
Me too today

560
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:15,167
My child...

561
00:47:15,234 --> 00:47:16,897
I'm going to kill you

562
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:20,117
I need to find Kim Se-hee. I need to finish it before the refund starts.

563
00:47:20,184 --> 00:47:22,782
How dare you deceive me and my husband?

564
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:24,314
This is totally crazy

565
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:25,610
Woo Tae-sik!

566
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:27,898
mister!

567
00:47:27,965 --> 00:47:30,077
Uncle, stop it now

568
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:33,587
Sir, you can leave me alone now.

569
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:35,856
Catch Kim Ah-hyun!

570
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:37,691
They say that all you have to do is give love to the child

571
00:47:37,758 --> 00:47:39,567
But why didn't you do that to me?

572
00:47:39,634 --> 00:47:42,044
There are mothers like me in the world.

573
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:43,801
To die for a mother like me

574
00:47:43,868 --> 00:47:46,030
I have a daughter like you too
