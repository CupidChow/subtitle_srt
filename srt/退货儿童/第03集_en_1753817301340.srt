Do you want to live?

I found it

28
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,504
"My sister Xuan, did you hear that?"

29
00:01:42,504 --> 00:01:44,634
Get out of there now, quick!

30
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:46,064
I see

31
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:50,864
There's no time left. We have to leave.

32
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,364
Which hospital is my mother in?

33
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,704
Taisho Hospital

34
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,717
Not far from here

35
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,634
I visit her often and call her often

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,500
What I said is true

37
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:03,724
What about this card?

38
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:05,459
Who made this card?

39
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,528
What is the purpose of this card?

40
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,863
I...I don't know

41
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,234
I really don't know

42
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,733
I know but I can't tell

43
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:15,664
If I tell them, I'll die in their hands.

44
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:16,749
I'm going to die.

45
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,861
Hey you stinky girl

46
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,009

00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:33,263
Go fast

52
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:34,804
Damn

53
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:46,664
I was wrong

54
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,263
I know I'm wrong

55
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,904

Say it again

65
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:55,263
What did you say

66
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:58,634
"Found some trash..." Hey, follow me.

67
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:03,334

68
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:19,864

78
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,564
Are you okay?

79
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:10,934
Request ambulance support

80
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,664
Request ambulance support

81
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:14,564
Are you okay?

82
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:15,704
Let's go, wait.

83
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:17,104
Wait a moment…

84
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:42,434
Are there more survivors?

85
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:45,404
They seem to be hiding in the demolition area

86
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,104
I am confirming

87
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:49,234
In addition to Woo Tae-sik

88
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,704
Are there any other helpers?

89
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,404
You should have seen her face.

90
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:53,664
What

91
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,204
I mean I'm showing off.

92
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:59,464
She now...

93
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:02,734
Probably over 20 years old.

94
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,334
She's still alive

95
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:08,764
I'm sorry

96
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,804
Let her come to see me alive.

97
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:15,964
I want to see what she looks like.

98
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,064
Does it look like me?

99
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,634
I see

100
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,934
How many children did you say?

101
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,464
Plus Choi Si-woo

102
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:26,164
There are five in total

103
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:28,834
Kwon Sung-woo

104
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:31,604
He was the son of Councilman Kwon Kang-man, right?

105
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:32,934
Yes

106
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:48,264
(Returned Children EP3. Survivors)

107
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:08,634
Are we going to live here from now on?

108
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:12,834
Only temporary

109
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,634
Here again.

110
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,564
sorry

111
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,504
I can only bring you to this kind of place

112
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:50,764
Don't apologize

113
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,264
What do you have to apologize for?

114
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:54,004
It's more spacious here

115
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,634
And there is a second floor

116
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,334
There's a second floor here.

117
00:08:58,334 --> 00:08:59,534
Yes, sister

118
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:00,964
I like it here too

119
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:02,464
I also like

120
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:03,864
Yeah, everyone likes it.

121
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:04,864
Don't feel guilty

122
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:06,934
We just need to decorate it well.

123
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,704
good

124
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:11,304
Let's look around first.

125
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,834
Um

126
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,234
Be careful when moving

127
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,134
Pull it a little further this way

128
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:35,934
alright

129
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:38,404
This is my sister's and my room.

130
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:42,864
This is my room

131
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,834
We also have this room. This is my brother's and my room.

132
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,104
Come here, sister.

133
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,434
Really good

134
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,004
Really good

135
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,064
You come too

136
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,604
No, I like being alone.

137
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:34,804
Aren't you sleeping?

138
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:39,004
sister

139
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:43,234
What kind of people are your parents?

140
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,764
Maybe we are among the parents who abandoned us

141
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:57,364
There will be a good person

142
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:01,564
Just like Su Mei's mother

143
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,834
I've also had...

144
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:11,304
My mother

145
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,334
The woman wanted to be...

146
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:19,034
The most dazzling existence in the world

147
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:23,264
(Do everything with love)

148
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:30,434
Come in

149
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:36,204
Come play with me one day.

150
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:39,104
Clergy access to golf courses

151
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:40,334
Not a good impression

152
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:42,464
So I

153
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:44,804
They all took advantage of the closing days to play secretly

154
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:45,804
Oh my god

155
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:47,764
How about it

156
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,734
Did the talks go well?

157
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,534
She is indeed as honest as I heard.

158
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:53,804
It's also urgent

159
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:59,034
He is a perfect person

160
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:03,064
If only I weren't there...

161
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,664
I can't get pregnant

162
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,764
Please don't say that.

163
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,804
Didn't you come to see me?

164
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:28,634
I want to find a child worthy of him.

165
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:31,764
Perfect Child

166
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:38,964
It's so nice

167
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:41,264
It seems that what you want will come true soon.

168
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:43,104
Your contribution should not be underestimated

169
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:45,804
I think she respects and trusts you very much.

170
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:46,804
Ouch

171
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:50,134
After all, I make a living by my mouth.

172
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,664
The Lord would feel uncomfortable if he heard this.

173
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,604
Is that so?

174
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:57,264
But this is also the talent that God gave me.

175
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,904
I want to donate more to the church

176
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:06,634
I will make good use of the Lord's grace.

177
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,434
Bring it here

178
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:25,304
Ouch

179
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:29,364
This time the quantity is huge.

180
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:31,164
To create a perfect child

181
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:33,334
It'll cost a lot of money.

182
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:36,104
You can't always use consortium funds to subsidize

183
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:38,564
I believe you will manage it well.

184
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:42,734
Don't think of this as a complicated church.

185
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:46,634
Just think of it as a laundry.

186
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:52,804
But the woman didn't seem to have discussed it with her husband yet.

187
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,204
I'm not sure if I can successfully collect sperm.

188
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,504
You don't have to worry about this

189
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:01,164
He obeys his wife's every word.

190
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,234
That would be great

191
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:05,904
Then I have to meet Councillor Kwon Kang Man soon.

192
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:10,664
I was thinking about how to convince him.

193
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,704
Do you have any good ideas?

194
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,564
I do have an extra good card.

195
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:19,234
What good cards

196
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:23,104
They actually said that the embryo is a child

197
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:25,264
Don't you think people are ridiculous?

198
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,504
It's just a nail-like cell.

199
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:31,664
We Koreans are too sentimental.

200
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:34,234
That is to say

201
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,564
(The entire Bible)

202
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:44,704
I work

203
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:46,504
It created humans

204
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:51,304
Heavenly Father will be pleased too.

205
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,434
Because God loves the world

206
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,434
Of course

207
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:59,364
It's a miracle to give birth to a new life

208
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:01,134
In addition, we are currently experiencing a period of declining birthrates.

209
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,064
What could be a more groundbreaking and creative idea than this?

210
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:07,434
(Ms.)

211
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:13,434
Hello

212
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:16,264
Sisters, but

213
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,304
I thought about it carefully

214
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:20,834
If you want to have a baby

215
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,934
I seem a bit old.

216
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,864
So I want to ask...

217
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,264
Here it comes

218
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:38,404
I'm sorry to bother you so late, Shi Yu's mother.

219
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,334
Excuse me…

220
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,334
I show off

221
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,964
How come you come at this time?

222
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,534
Aren't you going to cram school at this time?

223
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,764
that…

224
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:54,734
I want to ask if you have heard any news about Shi Yu

225
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:57,734
Shi Yu?

226
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:05,064
We're still looking for him.

227
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:10,104
Thank you for worrying about him.

228
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:16,934
Shi Yu is really a good boy, right?

229
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,234
Sorry, auntie

230
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:24,604
I shouldn't have come here.

231
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:26,534
Then I'll leave first

232
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:30,704
If I hear any news about Shi Yu, I will contact you as soon as possible.

233
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:32,504
Thank you, I'm so cool

234
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:34,704
Be careful on the road

235
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,364
But I show off

236
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:45,564
Where did you buy your shoes?

237
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:48,304
What

238
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:51,004
Because I was looking for this style recently.

239
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:09,364
Detective Choi

240
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,464
How did you get here?

241
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,204
You'll die from overwork.

242
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,064
People don't die that easily

243
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,003
Many people died inexplicably.

244
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:21,164
Investigator

245
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:22,503
It's here

246
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:23,303
good

247
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:39,134
How's the investigation going?

248
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:40,104
It's a senior

249
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:41,834
Found the actual owner of the phone

250
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:44,234
It's a man in his forties named Yu Tae-sik

251
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,234
I sent you the photo.

252
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,164
good

253
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:48,764
I received

254
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:53,404
(Cao Zhihe)

255
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:56,434
Woo Tae-sik

256
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:05,904
How to use this

257
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:08,734
Where should I go with this?

258
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,204
(Eavesdropping signal frequency detected)

259
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,864
Han Zhexiu was found dead at home

260
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:20,734
Is he dead?

261
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:26,504
Please confirm the surveillance cameras near your home

262
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:29,304
We didn't kill him.

263
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:32,504
Looks like we need to get out of here quickly.

264
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,834
My sister Xuan

265
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:37,704
Are we going somewhere else?

266
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,704
What?

267
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:45,234
(wife)

268
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:49,204
(wife)

269
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:56,364
So beautiful

270
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,864
mom

271
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:00,704
mom

272
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:02,304
mom

273
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:04,264
husband

274
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:06,864
mom

275
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,404
Did you hear my voice?

276
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,604
husband

277
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:16,434
You don't have to come this week.

278
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:18,034
I'm fine

279
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,404
You really don't need to come this week.

280
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:23,804
Didn't you say the scholarship student would be here next week?

281
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,404
So you're busy?

282
00:19:26,104 --> 00:19:28,904
The doctor here is very nice to me.

283
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:30,504
Come back next week

284
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,734
Mom, what do you mean?

285
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:36,364
What do you mean by these?

286
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:38,064
Where are you

287
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:40,734
husband

288
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:44,634
Is Yuna okay?

289
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:50,664
You don't have to bring her with you when you come.

290
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:53,104
She's very busy preparing for the audition.

291
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:56,434
When she went to the audition

292
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:59,604
Mom should go with her.

293
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:04,604
Wait until I'm discharged from the hospital

294
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,264
I'll take her to the audition.

295
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,664
Pack her lunch

296
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:12,304
Tell her that she has worked hard and praise her.

297
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,064
My husband needs to tell her for me.

298
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:22,764
mom

299
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:47,534
My husband is like this

300
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:49,834
You don't know how much he loves me

301
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,164
If you keep bothering me

302
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:53,234
I'm going to complain to him.

303
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,064
customer

304
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:23,404
Do you think that if you do this your daughter will really...

305
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,434
Won't you come?

306
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,434
Everyone

307
00:21:57,664 --> 00:22:00,164
Let's go find Sumei's mother.

308
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:01,034
sister

309
00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:02,634
Are you crazy?

310
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:05,904
It's easy to guess why those guys would be lying in ambush there.

311
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:08,464
We don't know how to use that card.

312
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:11,334
Sumei's mother must know

313
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,104
Go find Sumei's mother

314
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,764
By the way, I asked her how to use the card

315
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:19,064
No matter what, you shouldn't take such a risk.

316
00:22:19,064 --> 00:22:20,334
elder brother

317
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:28,634
Thank you, sister.

318
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:36,204
Not Shiyu...you

319
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:39,604
Do you really want to go?

320
00:22:47,604 --> 00:22:49,104
Isn't it

321
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:51,604
Hair loss after childbirth

322
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,664
Skin deterioration

323
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:56,934
After all, we need to show up often

324
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:59,234
Have to care about these

325
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:01,534
certainly

326
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,404
Of course you have to take these into consideration.

327
00:23:06,404 --> 00:23:07,753
Finding a surrogate mother

328
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:11,457
Will you keep it a secret for me?

329
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:17,229
We'll risk everything to keep your secret.

330
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:27,664
Believing in God is not difficult

331
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:31,264
But I don't know why it's so hard to trust someone

332
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,704
What

333
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:35,204
After all, I'm in a high position.

334
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:38,004
Screening for the right candidates is a hassle

335
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,204
so…

336
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:47,564
What should I do?

337
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:49,804
Please give me something as a guarantee

338
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:55,164
Let me trust you 100%

339
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:57,234
Guarantee means...

340
00:23:57,234 --> 00:24:02,234
I heard your child is very outstanding.

341
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:09,064
I want the woman who bears my child to be perfect.

342
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:17,604
Like Kim Se-hee's sisters

343
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,304
14 years old

344
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:29,164
Mary was 14 when she conceived Jesus.

345
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:34,264
My daughter is exactly 14 years old.

346
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:39,734
Do you want to

347
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:53,764
I'm going to eat quickly.

348
00:24:53,764 --> 00:24:55,104
good

349
00:24:58,404 --> 00:25:00,164
What happened to Mom?

350
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:03,234
I show off

351
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,304
You are really precious to me

352
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:10,234
Like a gift

353
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:13,364
Me too

354
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:15,704
Mom is also very precious to me.

355
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:18,004
Yeah

356
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,834
Thank you, daughter

357
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:29,064
My mother wants to ask you a favor.

358
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:32,704
Will you agree?

359
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:05,804
Let me do it

360
00:26:07,404 --> 00:26:08,664
Come in

361
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,504
(Emergency Room)

362
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:23,864
hateful

363
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,034
hateful

364
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,034
Am I the only one who thinks something's wrong here?

365
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,904
It doesn't look like a hospital at all.

366
00:28:04,364 --> 00:28:05,664
Let's go

367
00:28:17,104 --> 00:28:18,364
Who are you?

368
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,434
What do you want to do?

369
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:32,264
Hit her, the key is there.

370
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,564
Seok-soo, let's go!

371
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,564
Catch them now

372
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:09,834
Seok-soo's side

373
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:13,704
Come here

374
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:17,104
Damn it, come here

375
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:30,764
(Lin Jingmei)

376
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,334
Lord's An

377
00:30:34,264 --> 00:30:35,334
Is this here?

378
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:41,634
Let's go

379
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:50,534
Mom... Yuna

380
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:52,134
My child

381
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,364
Yuna, you are not hurt, right?

382
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:57,704
How did you get here? How did you get in?

383
00:30:57,704 --> 00:31:00,504
Mom, I'm your daughter, right?

384
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:03,104
You didn't abandon me, did you?

385
00:31:03,764 --> 00:31:05,464
What nonsense are you talking about?

386
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:09,064
Yuna, my daughter

387
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:12,934
Mom, I doubted you before.

388
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:16,534
Not only did I not believe you, I also cursed you.

389
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,134
It's mom's fault

390
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:22,834
Mom is sorry, Yuna.

391
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:26,334
Mom, why did you hide the fact that you adopted me?

392
00:31:40,604 --> 00:31:44,404
When mom first saw you, she felt

393
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:47,164
You're no different from my own.

394
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:50,034
So no matter what others say, you are my child

395
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,304
Do you know

396
00:31:52,234 --> 00:31:55,504
Mom, did you buy me with money?

397
00:31:56,134 --> 00:31:57,504
Yuna

398
00:31:57,504 --> 00:31:59,404
Mom, you must tell me

399
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:03,804
Did you also go to a place where children were sold for money?

400
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:06,634
Mom, do you have this too?

401
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:10,864
Do you know this? No, I don't know what this is.

402
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:14,334
Mom, please tell me.

403
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:18,804
Telling you will put you in danger.

404
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:21,064
They are all very dangerous people.

405
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,434
Never get close to them

406
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:24,204
Don't investigate any further.

407
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:31,164
There's no time left. We have to leave quickly.

408
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:33,164
Mom, hurry up.

409
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:35,364
Hurry and leave with us first

410
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:53,604
mom

411
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:27,764
mom

412
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:40,004
Mom, you can't fall down, get up quickly

413
00:33:40,004 --> 00:33:42,204
Don't worry about me, you can't leave now

414
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:43,534
Go quickly

415
00:33:44,864 --> 00:33:46,834
Mom, I can’t…

416
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:49,304
Catch them

417
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,834
Wait a minute, what about these two?

418
00:34:00,134 --> 00:34:01,404
Damn

419
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:16,004
Why are you so stubborn?

420
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,304
Like a cockroach

421
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:24,934
Cockroaches die if they are caught

422
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:26,204
Like this

423
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,904
Are you okay? Let's go.

424
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,034
There

425
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:45,034
Go fast

426
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:50,034
Are you okay?

427
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:51,564
Fast Chase

428
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:55,264
Catch them now

429
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,204
Let's go, stop right there.

430
00:36:57,564 --> 00:36:58,934
Zheng Xuan, are you okay?

431
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:00,964
sorry

432
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:04,964
Do you need more manpower?

433
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:07,764
No

434
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:09,564
It's okay to ask if you need to.

435
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:11,934
I'm sorry I shouldn't have lost...

436
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:17,504
You know I cherish you the most, right?

437
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,934
So you can't get hurt

438
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:39,404
Stop

439
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:41,704
Hey, grab that guy!

440
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:44,964
Stop fighting

441
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:47,064
I said stop hitting you lunatic

442
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:02,064
Are you okay?

443
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:04,134
I'll take you to the hospital, you bastard.

444
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:05,734
Is that guy crazy?

445
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:08,064
Are you afraid that people don't know he's the son of a murderer?

446
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:09,234
Let's go

447
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:10,404
I'm not wrong.

448
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:14,134
When he was born, his father killed his mother and went to jail.

449
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:16,464
The look in his eyes is exactly like that of a murderer.

450
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:18,604
This isn't the first time he's done this. Let's go.

451
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:31,804
Are you Zheng Xuan?

452
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,264
It must be painful.

453
00:38:56,464 --> 00:39:00,164
I can help you heal every time you get hurt

454
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:04,234
Just like mom

455
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:08,534
Do you want me to be your mother?

456
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:13,404
So can you be the person your mother needs?

457
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:18,864
Do you want to call my mother to take a look?

458
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:25,164
I will make sure nothing goes wrong.

459
00:39:29,404 --> 00:39:31,734
You haven't called me mom lately.

460
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:38,434
Remember to call me mom next time

461
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:58,164
Your mother will be fine.

462
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:01,904
Wait until it's over

463
00:40:01,904 --> 00:40:03,834
We'll go get her back.

464
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,834
Can we really do this?

465
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:16,464
My mom said

466
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:23,104
Those people are more dangerous than we thought.

467
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:26,264
Hello

468
00:40:26,264 --> 00:40:28,164
Don't say such depressing words.

469
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:33,304
I'm tracking their movements.

470
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:34,964
Wait a minute

471
00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:44,504
Let me do it

472
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,704
Found it

473
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:27,564
My sister Xuan let me take a look

474
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,904
What is this place doing?

475
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,704
What is the status of signal detection?

476
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:36,134
(Detect eavesdropping signals)
(No signal)

477
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:36,904
Is there a signal?

478
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:39,064
No

479
00:41:44,164 --> 00:41:46,504
There's no way to identify this.

480
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,434
The section chief told us not to take over.

481
00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:49,334
What

482
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:51,234
He said the case was going to be closed anyway.

483
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:53,434
Just leave everything behind and walk away

484
00:41:56,204 --> 00:41:58,134
So how do we handle this?

485
00:41:58,134 --> 00:42:01,064
If you really want to check, go find a private forensic expert.

486
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:02,464
What kind of business...

487
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:07,664
A private business owner?

488
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:16,364
senior

489
00:42:16,364 --> 00:42:18,364
Can't you just drop this case?

490
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:20,464
I always feel that there is something wrong with this case.

491
00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:22,464
It's because something's wrong that we need to check.

492
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:24,134
Aren't you a policeman?

493
00:42:24,134 --> 00:42:26,104
That's not what I meant.

494
00:42:35,904 --> 00:42:37,904
Councilman Kwon Kang-man's son, Kwon Sung-woo, was found dead after being bullied at school.

495
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:43,364
(3 years ago)

496
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,234
Are you in the same class as Chengyu?

497
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:43,304
yes

498
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:44,704
Are you familiar with Chengyu?

499
00:42:44,704 --> 00:42:47,764
We're not that familiar, we're just classmates.

500
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:52,404
Have you ever seen Sungwoo being bullied?

501
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:54,234
There is no classmate among us...

502
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:55,704
Come out

503
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:58,564
How do you feel about losing your child?

504
00:42:58,564 --> 00:43:02,334
Please say something, Member of Parliament.

505
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:05,664
Please say something

506
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:09,864
Oh my god, my Sungwoo

507
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,864
Chengyu

508
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:20,704
My poor child

509
00:43:20,704 --> 00:43:22,504
What to do

510
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:24,802

The campus bullying task force directly under the President's Office was present to pay their respects.

518
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:43,764
Other parties, including the ruling party, also sent wreaths to express their condolences.

519
00:43:43,764 --> 00:43:47,704
It is said that the perpetrators did not even attend the funeral.

520
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:48,764
Yes, that's right.

He's like this every time

530
00:44:28,564 --> 00:44:31,364
Why didn't I see even an ant?

531
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:33,334
I'm so hungry

532
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:36,734
We've been here for seven hours, it's time to change shifts.

533
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:38,304
Give me

534
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:48,764
Haven't found anything yet?

535
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:51,234
Do you want to change shifts?

536
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,634
OK

537
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:54,964
I really want to rest

538
00:44:57,864 --> 00:44:59,504
Have you had a rest?

539
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,964
Thanks for your hard work

540
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:03,504
It's okay.

541
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:07,834

00:47:35,964 --> 00:47:38,564
The youngest person admitted to Stanford University

566
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:38,634
(Intelligence: 1++ Education: Stanford PhD)

567
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,334
The biological mother is a medical student at Seoul National University and a member of Mensa.

568
00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:43,964
He is definitely a science elite. Look at him crying.

569
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:46,204
Oh my, so cute

570
00:47:46,204 --> 00:47:48,134
Natural birth by surrogate mother

571
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:51,834
Naturally, the biological parents don't know about the child's existence.

572
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:53,464
He has genes in the top 1%

573
00:47:53,464 --> 00:47:55,964
The first item to be auctioned is the top item

574
00:47:55,964 --> 00:47:57,904
The starting bid is 250 million

575
00:47:57,904 --> 00:48:01,364
Free returns until your child turns 18

576
00:48:01,364 --> 00:48:04,304
Can you return it in any case?

577
00:48:04,304 --> 00:48:08,904
If it is not due to physical defects but simply a change of heart, no returns can be made.

578
00:48:08,904 --> 00:48:12,334
However, partial refunds may be made depending on the situation.

579
00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:18,204
Does this child have a genetic defect?

580
00:48:18,204 --> 00:48:22,064
Gene for ischemic heart disease discovered from paternal DNA

581
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:24,404
But it was safely removed during the cultivation process

582
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:26,464
No abnormalities in body functions

583
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:29,634
No need to worry too much

584
00:48:30,534 --> 00:48:33,564
The current highest bid is $495 million.

585
00:48:33,564 --> 00:48:36,104
The current highest bid is $498 million.

586
00:48:36,104 --> 00:48:38,104
Someone bid 510 million

587
00:48:38,104 --> 00:48:40,834
510 million...

588
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,964
Sold for 510 million

589
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:45,064
510 million?

590
00:48:45,864 --> 00:48:48,004
What does this mean?

591
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:50,534
No, so...

592
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:53,104
The parents who abandoned us...

593
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:55,634
Is this how you become a parent?

594
00:48:59,034 --> 00:49:00,204
It turns out my mother...

595
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:04,834
Is this the kind of person?

596
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,604
That's ridiculous.

597
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:17,334
This is much better than the last time I bought it.

598
00:49:21,004 --> 00:49:22,764
Next is the second bidding item

599
00:49:22,764 --> 00:49:24,764
About 48 hours after birth

600
00:49:24,764 --> 00:49:27,134
Blood type O, gender is female

601
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:29,904
Everyone still remembers the genius boy Sun Youjun, right?

602
00:49:29,904 --> 00:49:32,804
We finally got his genes.

603
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:35,104
Although the biological mother of the first bid is the same person

604
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:37,864
But the biological father's appearance is the highest level

605
00:49:37,864 --> 00:49:41,804
The appraisal price is higher than NT$500 million and the starting price is NT$470 million.

606
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:46,464
Start bidding now

607
00:49:49,634 --> 00:49:51,404
The highest bid was 590 million

608
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,334
595 million

613

720 million

615
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:01,364
800 million

616
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:03,104
890 million

617
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:04,604
900 million

618
00:50:03,464 --> 00:50:04,264
(Enter the amount to bid in 9)

619
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:06,504

993 million

621
00:50:08,134 --> 00:50:10,104
994 million

622
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:11,604
995 million

623
00:50:11,604 --> 00:50:14,934
995 million...

624
00:50:14,934 --> 00:50:17,164
Sold for NT$995 million

625
00:50:43,564 --> 00:50:46,704
Yes, I bought a nice kid.

626
00:50:46,704 --> 00:50:49,304
Now you can return that brat.

627
00:50:50,504 --> 00:50:52,364
Yeah, apply for a return.

628
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:54,104
That little devil is useless.

629
00:51:20,604 --> 00:51:22,104
What's wrong

630
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:34,304
(Postscript to "Returning Children")

631
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:37,734
Yunshu, congratulations on winning first place.

632
00:51:37,734 --> 00:51:39,504
You performed very well too.

633
00:51:39,504 --> 00:51:40,864
Thank you

634
00:51:43,064 --> 00:51:45,334
Hello, Mom

635
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:47,034
Congratulations, Yunshu's mother

636
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,564
Congratulations to Yunshu

637
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,464
Thank you, Auntie

638
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:52,134
Congratulations, bye.

639
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:54,164
Bye, congratulations, let's go first

640
00:51:54,164 --> 00:51:55,804
Good slow walk

641
00:51:55,804 --> 00:51:58,064
Yunshu, congratulations on winning first place.

642
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:03,834
(Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Competition)

643
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:09,464
I show off

644
00:52:11,204 --> 00:52:12,564
What

645
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:14,604
Do you think it's interesting?

646
00:52:14,604 --> 00:52:17,604
This is a game, a competition

647
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:21,964
You have to step on others to climb up and survive to the end

648
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:28,964
But today I congratulated Yunshu's mother

649
00:52:28,964 --> 00:52:30,964
Do you know what this means?

650
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:39,664
You made me inferior.

651
00:52:39,664 --> 00:52:44,064
You made me get stepped on by others

652
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,334
(Kim Ah Hyun)

653
00:52:48,764 --> 00:52:52,204
Do you know why adults give awards to the second and third place?

654
00:52:52,204 --> 00:52:53,934
Why

655
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:57,404
You have to praise the second and third place as well to make the first place look more impressive.

656
00:52:57,404 --> 00:53:00,804
Because he climbed up from the second and third place to become the first place

657
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:02,804
Why do we always start awarding prizes from the third place?

658
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,734
Because that way the first place will be more eye-catching.

659
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:09,264
Otherwise, it should be awarded to the most powerful person first.

660
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:13,064
But I'm still better than the third place.

661
00:53:14,704 --> 00:53:16,834
That's not important

662
00:53:16,834 --> 00:53:19,734
The point is you're not number one.

663
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:22,104
You lost to Yunseo again.

664
00:53:22,104 --> 00:53:24,364
I've never lost to Yunshu.

665
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,204
What

666
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,434
Because we are not competitors

667
00:53:34,634 --> 00:53:37,004
It seems you are fighting against me.

668
00:53:37,904 --> 00:53:38,934
What

669
00:53:38,934 --> 00:53:40,634
I just feel weird

670
00:53:41,364 --> 00:53:43,434
You and Yunshu have similar grades and abilities.

671
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:45,634
Not much difference

672
00:53:45,634 --> 00:53:49,804
But it's weird that you always come second and Yunseo comes first.

673
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:53,734
It's like you deliberately just want to get second place

674
00:53:54,704 --> 00:53:56,734
I didn't do that

675
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,664
That's because Yunshu is always better than me

676
00:53:58,664 --> 00:53:59,704
wrong

677
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:04,204
Even if it's just luck, at least you'll win once.

678
00:54:04,204 --> 00:54:07,404
But you always come in second

679
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,034
It's like he's trying to piss me off on purpose.

680
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:15,304
No, not that kind of mother.

681
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:19,464
You said you want to win over someone...

682
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:22,464
It's me, actually.

683
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:24,964
I show off

684
00:54:58,564 --> 00:55:01,704
(Return of children)

685
00:55:01,864 --> 00:55:04,734
Please quickly propose an amendment.

686
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,334
Let's amend a few articles of the Life Ethics Law

687
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:10,004
This was never legal in the first place.

688
00:55:10,004 --> 00:55:11,264
Are we too?

689
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:13,677
Now is not the time to run away, but to face it head on

690
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:15,612
Let's find her.

691
00:55:16,004 --> 00:55:18,916
Is Quan Chengyu really dead?

692
00:55:19,004 --> 00:55:20,304
Now you can responsibly and effectively

693
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:21,585
Do what needs to be done.

694
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:24,054
Okay, let's smoke more today.

695
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:27,004
One sample is missing

696
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:28,292
We need to speed up.

697
00:55:28,604 --> 00:55:30,334
Lock down the entire building

698
00:55:30,764 --> 00:55:31,964
Now

699
00:55:32,534 --> 00:55:33,664
Finally met

700
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,732
The whole of Korea will probably be in uproar.

701
00:55:36,064 --> 00:55:37,734
Take off the mask

702
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,004
My sister Xuan
