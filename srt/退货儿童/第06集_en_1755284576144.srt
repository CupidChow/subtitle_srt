My wife and I are very satisfied

182
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,737
So many people are asking for returns?

183
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,497
After all, people are always greedy

184
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:58,867
Even so

185
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:01,837
After all, it's the child I raised with my own hands.

186
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:03,097
Is it necessary to do this?

187
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,567
Who says that a child raised by one's own hands is one's own child?

188
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,467
To be loved

189
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,137
Just like your son

190
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,497
Having said that

191
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:17,467
I have solved the case as you requested.

192
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,597
But I'm a little worried that it might make things worse.

193
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:25,697
Plus, there's an uncontrollable detective in the department investigating cases everywhere.

194
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,337
If trouble occurs

195
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:32,197
I'll handle this quietly, don't worry.

196
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,537
Moreover, if it is turned into a public investigation

197
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:37,537
You also know that from the arrest to the case investigation

198
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:40,097
The media must be informed

199
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:42,697
I'm worried that this might lead to trouble.

200
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:44,797
Especially Councillor Kwon Kang-man

201
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:47,467
The whole country knows that his son is dead.

202
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,697
Just make sure they can't catch anyone.

203
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:52,697
What

204
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,137
Just kill and silence the witness.

205
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,067
If you die, you can't catch it.

206
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,797
Just bring them to me.

207
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:03,097
(Criminal Police)

208
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,567
It's the detective from before.

209
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,337
(Criminal Police)

210
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:07,337
what to do

211
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:09,067
Do you want my sister Xuan to answer?

212
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,667
No...I don't think so

213
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:34,037
He sent a text message

214
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,097
I'm Detective Choi Hyung-seok from the Buchon Police Station.

215
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,397
I know you are not the perpetrator.

216
00:10:43,237 --> 00:10:44,237
I want to help

217
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,537
what to do

218
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:56,637
My sister Xuan

219
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,837
I have something to tell you

220
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:09,797
My sister Xuan

221
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:11,637
If the detective

222
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,297
Really trustworthy

223
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:18,667
Do we need to do it ourselves?

224
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:20,737
Revenge

225
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:22,537
What does this mean?

226
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,697
As long as the world knows that we are victims

227
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:29,267
You don't have to suffer like this anymore.

228
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:35,667
I've never been happy before I met you and the others

229
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:38,767
Did I say that?

230
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:42,597
I'm worse than a dog in that house.

231
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,837
I'm Detective Choi Hyung-seok from the Buchon Police Station. I know you're not the perpetrators, and I want to help.

232
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,297
(In front of carriage 3-1 heading southbound at Shinta Station)

233
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:33,797
Have you arrived?

234
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:20,297
I, Kwon Kang Man, agree to abandon and destroy Kwon Sung Woo, whom I adopted eighteen years ago.

235
00:13:20,997 --> 00:13:23,197
Reason: Dissatisfied with product quality

236
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,397
Damn, do I even have to do this?

237
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:40,197
If you want to help us

238
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:42,467
Just do what a police officer should do.

239
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,167
What is the situation now?

240
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,937
Call the person in charge out. Call the person in charge out.

241
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:23,437
The person in charge came out to face

242
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:24,837
How long will I hide?

243
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:27,097
At least give me a solution.

244
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:31,637
What?

245
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:37,937
Representatives are unable to attend today due to personal reasons

246
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:39,297
Please understand

247
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,197
I said

248
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:44,637
Can I speak?

249
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:46,537
Yes, please say

250
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:49,337
The murder of the pastor and his wife

251
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,997
The police have converted it into a serial homicide case.

252
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:53,197
You know this, right?

253
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,637
Yes, I know

254
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:58,597
Han Zhexiu, principal of Daehan Elementary School

255
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,537
Pastor Yoon Se-hoon and his wife

256
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:04,697
Rumor has it that these three people are customers here

257
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,497
The suspects

258
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:09,567
Is it really a defective product that was not successfully destroyed?

259
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,567
If this is true

260
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,037
Doesn't it mean the children we destroyed

261
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,697
Maybe he's still alive?

262
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:17,997
I said

263
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:19,837
Say something too.

264
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:33,867
The destruction procedures are 100% executed

265
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,067
Destruction of all persons present

266
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,537
We've confirmed he's dead.

267
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,367
And buried

268
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,167
The probability of a returned defective product being found alive

269
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,097
Not even one percent

270
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:47,137
What if you still can't believe it?

271
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:49,497
If this is less than one percent

272
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:52,197
What if the child we abandoned is still alive?

273
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:54,667
Is there no solution?

274
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,337
What happened...

275
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:04,197
I returned the product because I killed someone in a rage.

276
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,437
Looks like I have to take responsibility.

277
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,337
Because of disobedience, return

278
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:11,767
Returned because of not growing taller

279
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,867
I returned it because I loved playing games too much

280
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:19,437
You guys just used this ridiculous reason to ask for a refund.

281
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:23,297
Are you so afraid of this less than one percent chance now?

282
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,137
You have to trust me.

283
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:32,197
Since you want to hide behind the mask and not take any responsibility

284
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:35,097
Then you should give it all to me and trust me.

285
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:38,567
What else can you do except believe?

286
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,437
Even so, if you still don't have confidence in me

287
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:43,237
I'll let you believe it

288
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,637
Although this won't happen

289
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,367
But if your child appears in front of you

290
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:55,067
1 billion...

291
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,767
No

292
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,397
I'll give each of you 10 billion.

293
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:03,937
10 billion?

294
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:05,367
Is this okay?

295
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,697
Coming

296
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:15,897
Member of Parliament...

297
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:17,997
Is Kwon Sung-woo really alive?

298
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:21,167
Member of Parliament, please say a word...

299
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,767
Is Councilman Kwon Sung-woo really alive?

300
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:27,497
Member of Parliament, please say a word...

301
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:30,767
Buchon-dong serial homicide case becomes public investigation

302
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,967
(Open investigation...4 suspects)

303
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,597
Jin Se-hee, this bitch

304
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:34,397
The police still have no clue about the suspect's whereabouts

305
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:35,767
You can't go in

306
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:38,497
Previously, the suspect Quan Chengyu made an extreme choice

307
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:41,297
What caused the citizens to grieve?

308
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:43,097
I've come to see you before

309
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:44,537
Do you still remember?

310
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,237
Go do your thing

311
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:49,997
Please take a seat

312
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,897
What do you want to see me about this time?

313
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:05,567
(Kwon Sung-woo Return Entrustment)

314
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:10,367
I, Kwon Kang Man, agree to abandon and destroy Kwon Sung Woo, whom I adopted eighteen years ago.

315
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,197
Reason: Dissatisfied with product quality

316
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:15,937
Damn, do I even have to do this?

317
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:25,567
People lately are so scary

318
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,067
Can use things like artificial intelligence

319
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:33,137
Such terrible fake news

320
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:36,067
You mean your son is really dead?

321
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,637
How many times do I have to say it?

322
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:41,537
Please stop asking.

323
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,467
Your son is still alive

324
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:54,867
If our Chengyu were still alive

325
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:58,737
Bring him to me

326
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,467
I miss my son too

327
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:06,537
If he is really still alive

328
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:09,897
Please let me see him first, please.

329
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:14,537
I'll take my leave today.

330
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,737
What do you think about the police claiming that Kwon Sung-woo is still alive?

331
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:28,837
Is it true that this is a show to win sympathy votes?

332
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:31,367
Could you please explain this self-directed farce?

333
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,297
You said you would hold a press conference and ask everyone to come here.

334
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,237
Why don't you say a word?

335
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:36,967
Members, please tell us the truth

336
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,897
Please tell everyone please say something

337
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:39,797
Member of Parliament

338
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:41,167
Please

339
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:54,197
Please…

340
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:57,137
Stop talking

341
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:16,797
Please stop bothering my son.

342
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,337
Because of my useless father

343
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:21,637
And the son who is on the road to despair

344
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,067
Please stop bothering him.

345
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:28,037
I'm counting on you.

346
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:31,867
Parents who have lost their children should not be hurt again

347
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:36,267
Sorry, Chengyu

348
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:40,767
Blame it on my useless father.

349
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:46,997
Son, I'm sorry.

350
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:53,897
If you're still alive

351
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:56,167
How nice it would be

352
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,167
If only you were alive

353
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:04,937
Cheng Yu Cheng Yu...

354
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:06,237
Cheng Yu

355
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,967
Damn

356
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:18,797
what to do

357
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:24,637
(Kim Se-hee)

358
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,437
That bitch didn't answer the phone.

359
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,537
The detective just now

360
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,867
Looks like he knows something inside

361
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:37,797
What to do then

362
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:45,267
Damn

363
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,067
Eradicate them all.

364
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,067
Get rid of all

365
00:21:57,497 --> 00:22:01,797
(Kwon Kang-man "Killed my son twice")

366
00:21:57,837 --> 00:22:04,237
Son, I'm sorry.

367
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:06,337
(Missed call from Councillor Kwon Hong Man)

368
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:08,437
This is not a politician, he can be an actor

369
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,797
Zheng Xuan's acting has improved

370
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:11,637
yes

371
00:22:11,637 --> 00:22:13,067
Do you know where the children are?

372
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:15,097
The police have designated a specific area.

373
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:16,597
You should receive a call today.

374
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:18,937
After receiving the contact, immediately tell him the news

375
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,997
He said he wanted to find his son and kill him.

376
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:22,437
We'll help

377
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,837
Now let's do what we have to do.

378
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:43,967
If sperm and eggs are not donated but sold

379
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:47,437
Will oversupply cause prices to plummet?

380
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:50,137
No need to worry about oversupply

381
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:53,567
We will use artificial intelligence as the basis

382
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:57,297
Automatically adjust the grade and price of sperm and eggs and regulate supply

383
00:22:57,297 --> 00:23:01,697
That's interesting. You're so thoughtful.

384
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:05,537
The issue of revising the Bioethics Law in South Korea

385
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:07,967
We just started discussing

386
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:13,267
Because I know the future I've always dreamed of is coming soon

387
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:16,597
Which future do you dream of?

388
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:21,767
Have the power to choose the genes you want

389
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,967
Create the desired child

390
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:25,437
In the near future

391
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:29,937
Humans no longer hate each other

392
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:32,037
Because everyone is perfect.

393
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,597
This is the future I dream of

394
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:45,967
Come with me

395
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:20,267
Is there any movement from Quan Kangman?

396
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:22,297
I heard that a group of Koreans were gathered

397
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:26,567
Really positive

398
00:24:27,037 --> 00:24:28,737
Someone has been sent to follow

399
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:32,667
Okay, go out.

400
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:48,837
(Mother Kim Ah Hyun)

401
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:06,537
Ready to implant the fertilized egg

402
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:06,497
(Embryo Transfer: implantation of fertilized egg)

403
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:11,997
uncle

404
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:17,067
If I really am pregnant

405
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:20,767
just in case

406
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,437
What if I really...

407
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:28,467
Really gave birth to a child

408
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,537
So

409
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,367
What will I become after this?

410
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,367
It's time to go

411
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,767
Will I be abandoned too?

412
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,997
Uncle, aren't you afraid?

413
00:25:50,397 --> 00:25:52,467
Aren't you afraid of being abandoned by your mother?

414
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:06,897
Didn't you drive me there?

415
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,367
I have things to do.

416
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,637
knew

417
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:12,597
Then I'm leaving

418
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:35,567
If you want to find someone

419
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,937
Just come to us

420
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:41,897
We are already looking for the child you specified.

421
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:44,337
If you just want to find someone

422
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,537
There's no need for me to come to a place like this in person.

423
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,537
So…

424
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,637
What do you want to do after you find it?

425
00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:08,937
Is there an arranged murder?

426
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:19,297
I'll be back soon

427
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:22,397
My sister Xuan, be careful on the road

428
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:26,067
Seok-soo, you have to take good care of everyone.

429
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:35,267
Come in, yeah

430
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,037
(Kwon Seong-woo is currently located in the Yeommi-dong Industrial Park)

431
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:55,397
Don't worry

432
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:57,537
Already found someone

433
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,197
The kind of person who lives in hiding

434
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,767
There aren't many places to go.

435
00:29:16,097 --> 00:29:19,297
If you kill someone, you'll be paid 100 million, right?

436
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:23,937
If you bury him, you'll get an extra 100 million.

437
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,097
wrong

438
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,837
To be dismembered or minced

439
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:31,167
If you completely deal with it, you will get an extra 200 million.

440
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,237
200 million? Is it true?

441
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:35,667
Did you hear 200 million?

442
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:15,467
Damn

443
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,697
What are you doing?

444
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:24,367
Can you help me?

445
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:27,737
You can do it, right?

446
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:29,967
Of course, Mom

447
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,897
Okay, thank you.

448
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:51,867
I am Kim Ah Hyun

449
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:53,937
Please help me

450
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:20,297
Want to contact us?

451
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:33,367
(Researcher Park Seong-geun)

452
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,097
I want to tell you

453
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:01,367
Thanks

454
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,197
My sister Xuan

455
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:08,597
You choose to contact me

456
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:10,497
Well done

457
00:32:14,137 --> 00:32:16,367
I didn't expect you to come.

458
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:24,997
Aren't you afraid of your mother?

459
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:31,667
I used to be afraid of her too.

460
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:36,237
But now it's the people who should be afraid

461
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:38,037
It's not us, it's her.

462
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:43,137
We only have one life left.

463
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:45,267
But what she has in her hands

464
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:47,397
But there are countless

465
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:03,397
It seems your base has been exposed.

466
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:05,567
Kwon Kang Man is heading to Yeommi-dong

467
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,937
(My Xuan Sister)

468
00:33:09,797 --> 00:33:11,067
Is my sister Xuan on her way back?

469
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:14,067
Seok-soo, get out of there quickly.

470
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:17,537
Still can't get in touch?

471
00:33:21,437 --> 00:33:23,297
What are you doing? Why don't you start?

472
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:25,197
My Miss Xuan hasn't come yet

473
00:33:25,197 --> 00:33:26,837
Didn't answer the phone either

474
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:31,267
My Miss Xuan was kidnapped

475
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:38,997
(Ms.)

476
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:43,297
Hello

477
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:45,167
sisters

478
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:46,997
The day of blessing has come.

479
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:51,467
Can I go over and congratulate in person?

480
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,997
I'm very grateful for this thought.

481
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:59,437
But it is better to keep a stable mood on the day of implantation

482
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,497
How is Miss Xuan?

483
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:04,067
Yes, she is very good

484
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:07,137
Don't worry, thank you for your concern

485
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:12,467
Kidnapping?

486
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:15,297
Who kidnapped her?

487
00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:17,936
We are tracking

488
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,666
Are you sure it's kidnapping?

489
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,037
What

490
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:22,767
If it's kidnapping, bring the person back.

491
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:25,637
If not, you know what to do.

492
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:27,537
Yes, I know.

493
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:55,037
(Kim Ah Hyun)

494
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:56,497
Hello, Detective Choi

495
00:34:56,497 --> 00:34:57,667
Now they...

496
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,167
I'm almost there

497
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:11,997
Detective Choi

498
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:15,037
Detective Choi

499
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:36,337
You two go downstairs.

500
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:44,497
Really

501
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:51,137
Lord's peace

502
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:53,367
Su Mei, please take care of Shi Yu.

503
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:54,837
Let's go, let's go

504
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,537
Chengyu is here

505
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:01,297
Your dad is looking for you.

506
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,667
Catch him

507
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:36,037
Can't…

508
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:37,337
Shi Yu

509
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:45,397
Damn

510
00:36:45,397 --> 00:36:46,867
You little bastard

511
00:36:56,667 --> 00:37:00,567
Seok-soo

512
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,897
Seoul City National Assembly Election Poll Results

513
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,197
Kim Tae-woo, the current candidate nominated by the People's Party

514
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,597
With a slight difference of one percentage point

515
00:37:14,597 --> 00:37:17,497
Kwon Kang-man, the leading candidate of the Saenuri Party

516
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:20,367
Although it's only a slight difference now...

517
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:23,867
Is it fair for me to lose to that guy?

518
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,567
Where was this poll conducted?

519
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,767
Let's connect with reporters on the scene...

520
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:31,337
Kwon Kang-man candidate

521
00:37:31,337 --> 00:37:33,967
This time, a special law on school bullying

522
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:37,097
That is to say, it has made great contributions to the amendment of the school bully law.

523
00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:39,737
The party had high expectations of him.

524
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:42,197
The result was unexpected.

525
00:37:42,197 --> 00:37:43,967
Why because of the opponent

526
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:46,097
You bastard are quite supported by the MZ generation

527
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,937
What about sympathy votes?

528
00:37:48,937 --> 00:37:51,497
Do you want me to wag my tail and beg for mercy?

529
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:55,667
However, on the contrary, candidate Kwon Kang Man...

530
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,697
Is it enough to have a sympathy vote?

531
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:02,337
Only one percentage point difference

532
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:04,837
Although representatives have mass influence

533
00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:07,267
But it's not cohesive enough

534
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:15,537
Oh my god, my Sungwoo

535
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,167
What to do

536
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,697
My son

537
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:26,067
Chengyu

538
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:30,337
My child... Sungwoo

539
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:31,837
My baby son

540
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:38,567
Oh, so Chengyu, you are here.

541
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:42,997
All the defective products are gathered together

542
00:38:44,837 --> 00:38:47,197
My Chengyu is still the same

543
00:38:47,197 --> 00:38:50,337
Who told you to survive?

544
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:55,297
Do you know what you made me do?

545
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:59,767
That woman caught me and I can't hide away.

546
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:05,537
How did you go from the past to now?

547
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:08,897
They're causing me trouble.

548
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:11,567
Were you born to hold me back?

549
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:13,937
A bastard who is worse than pigs and dogs

550
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,337
Show off your special skills

551
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,197
Call a few times and listen

552
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:23,697
Scream

553
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,497
Don't you call?

554
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:29,437
Kill those guys

555
00:39:30,597 --> 00:39:31,967
Wang...

556
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:33,767
Seok-soo hyung Seok-soo hyung

557
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:35,637
What are you doing? Stop yelling...

558
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:37,367
Don't shout

559
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,437
Damn it, stop yelling.

560
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:41,097
Why are you doing this? Don't shout.

561
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:48,797
Wang...

562
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:50,037
Seok-soo

563
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:54,567
Please

564
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:58,167
Please, dad, don't do this again.

565
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,137
I beg you, Dad.

566
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:02,637
So you can speak human language?

567
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:04,837
I will die

568
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,637
I will do as my father wishes

569
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:10,797
Go to hell, so...

570
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:13,867
So please don't hurt them.

571
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,397
They are leaving Korea today.

572
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:20,297
Yes, the passport is ready.

573
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:21,537
So please let them go.

574
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:24,037
Dad, please, really?

575
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:25,897
Would you like to

576
00:40:25,897 --> 00:40:27,667
Do you really want to die?

577
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:31,097
Then of course I'm grateful

578
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:32,297
good

579
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,297
Seoksu, don't be like this

580
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:38,797
Don't do this, Seoksu hyung. Don't do this.

581
00:40:38,797 --> 00:40:41,037
Seoksu, what do you want to do? Seoksu, don't do this.

582
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:43,237
Seoksu, don't be like this

583
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:45,137
Seoksu hyung...let me go...

584
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:46,467
I told you to let me go

585
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:48,397
Let me go

586
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:50,967
Put the damn thing down, I told you to put it down

587
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,767
Put down the knife, I beg you.

588
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,837
Please put down the knife

589
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:57,467
Release them immediately

590
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:59,567
Stay away from them or I will kill him.

591
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:01,667
Untie the rope

592
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,897
Unlock it quickly!

593
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:05,367
Untie the rope quickly

594
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:08,437
Unlock it quickly

595
00:41:08,997 --> 00:41:10,767
Get out quickly

596
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:13,937
Get out now

597
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:16,567
Why are you still standing there? Get out now.

598
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:20,667
Hey Sungwoo...

599
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:23,067
Chengyu's father is in pain

600
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:24,667
Stop it now...

601
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:29,167
You've been keeping me from being happy.

602
00:41:30,997 --> 00:41:34,297
I didn't want to kill you, I just wanted to be happy

603
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:37,267
You asked for this.

604
00:41:45,097 --> 00:41:47,067
Seok-soo hyung Seok-soo hyung

605
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:49,467
Brother Seok-soo

606
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,467
What should I do, Seok-soo?

607
00:41:51,997 --> 00:41:53,897
Brother Seok-soo

608
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:55,337
Don't leave us

609
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:57,737
How did you know I was here?

610
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:05,137
What's wrong with you...Brother

611
00:42:05,997 --> 00:42:08,197
Get up, what's wrong with you, Seoksu?

612
00:42:08,197 --> 00:42:10,167
Wake up!

613
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:12,597
What's wrong with you, Seoksu?

614
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:14,637
Wake up, Seoksu.

615
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:18,097
Brother, why don't you speak?

616
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:22,297
Seok-soo…

617
00:42:22,297 --> 00:42:25,137
How could this happen? How could he become like this?

618
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:26,567
Seok-soo, look at me.

619
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,537
Seok-soo, look at me.

620
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:31,737
My sister Hyun Suk Soo

621
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:33,237
I'm fine

622
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:35,397
Don't talk...

623
00:42:35,397 --> 00:42:37,837
Shuozhu, don't talk, you won't die.

624
00:42:37,837 --> 00:42:40,067
Please stop talking about it anyway...

625
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:42,737
That's fine too.

626
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,797
At least we're all together in the end

627
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:50,167
Seok-soo... no

628
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,667
Cheer up, Seoksu hyung!

629
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:55,697
My real name is...

630
00:42:55,697 --> 00:42:57,437
Suk-soo

631
00:42:58,297 --> 00:42:59,997
Those bastards

632
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:03,567
I'm sorry, Suk-soo, you've worked so hard.

633
00:43:07,137 --> 00:43:08,867
Seok-soo…

634
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:10,037
Get up quickly, Seoksu.

635
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:12,297
What's wrong? Get up quickly.

636
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:14,397
Get up

637
00:43:14,397 --> 00:43:16,867
Please get up, Seoksu.

638
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:21,337
Seoksu hyung...

639
00:43:22,497 --> 00:43:24,437
Please, Seoksu.

640
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:27,067
Those bastards

641
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:28,697
Suk-soo

642
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:32,167
I'm sorry, Seok-soo hyung and Seok-soo sir.

643
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:34,137
sorry

644
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:37,437
I'm sorry, Sister Shuozhu

645
00:43:51,537 --> 00:43:54,197
Why do you do this to us?

646
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,667
Seok-soo

647
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:07,497
Seoksu, get up quickly!

648
00:44:44,937 --> 00:44:48,197
elder sister…

649
00:44:48,197 --> 00:44:50,037
Seok-soo

650
00:45:34,437 --> 00:45:37,337
(Return of children)

651
00:45:37,297 --> 00:45:39,967
Didn't you say that you would let us live a free life?

652
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,467
Seok-soo

653
00:45:42,097 --> 00:45:43,937
Did you let them go by mistake or on purpose?

654
00:45:43,937 --> 00:45:46,167
She is not our mother.

655
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:47,637
Uncle, please stop.

656
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,137
Do you know your husband's genes?

657
00:45:50,137 --> 00:45:52,597
Inside my daughter.

658
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:55,497
He is just a person who is reluctant to part with 1 billion

659
00:45:55,497 --> 00:45:57,037
Just return it.

660
00:45:57,037 --> 00:45:58,797
What is this D-Day?

661
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,537
Is there only one left now?

662
00:46:00,537 --> 00:46:03,637
To keep other children alive

663
00:46:03,637 --> 00:46:05,097
Please help me
