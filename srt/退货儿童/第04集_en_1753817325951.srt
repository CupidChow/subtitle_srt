This person is Uncle Tae-sik

89

Uncle Tae-sik takes over the job that this person has contracted.

90
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:39,808
Responsible for secretly handling abandoned children

91
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:41,638

92

And I think...

94
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,338
It's probably this person

95
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:53,908

96
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:58,408
We also provide transaction and adoption services to wealthy customers

97
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:02,338

106
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:31,408
This is totally illegal

107
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:35,478
This was never legal in the first place.

108
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:38,908

There must be something

127
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,278
But how do we find her?

128
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:51,338
Then let’s first…

129
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,078

Because I have to study on Sunday

135

Do you know what's the scariest thing?

136
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:32,608
She only studies one day and plays the rest, but she's a top student preparing for medical school.

Please wait a moment

189
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,808
How do you handle things?

190
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:57,378
Why did the detective come to see me?

191
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:01,138
The die is cast and the water cannot be undone

192
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,208
Of course you have to wipe it clean with a rag

193
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,978
What does this mean?

194
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,038
Is he still alive?

195
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,808
That's right.

196
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:12,638
Kwon Sung-woo is still alive

197
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:13,778
What did you say

198
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,908
How could you handle things like this?

199
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:18,108
Member of Parliament

200
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:25,938
Didn't you say you would deal with it quietly?

201
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:28,338
Hiding it from everyone cleanly and neatly

202
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:32,708
If word gets out that your son is alive

203
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,738
The whole of Korea will probably be in uproar.

204
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:37,908
What on earth are you...

205
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:41,178
Do you feel wronged? Then go ahead and sue me.

206
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:48,578
What do you want to do now?

207
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,638
Do you want money?

208
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,008
Member of Parliament

209
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:57,738
I already have too much money to make any more.

210
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,408
I already think making money is too boring

211
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:04,178
I just...

212
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:07,738
I want to change this abnormal world

213
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:10,738
Just get back on track

214
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,138
What did you say

215
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:15,408
Looks good

216
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:19,608
Looks very good

217
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:23,208
When I saw this, I thought

218
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:27,378
Is this really the case?

219
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:30,038
After creating humans

220
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:32,738
Are you really satisfied?

221
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:38,678
No, I don't think so.

222
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,308
I must be dissatisfied after creating it.

223
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,208
That's why so many trials were sent down.

224
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,178
Bad brain

225
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:48,678
Stupid and ugly

226
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:52,778
Created a bunch of useless inferior humans

227
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:55,187
Then irresponsibly

228
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,757
Say "Looks good"

229
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,808
Don't you think it's too much?

230
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,808
I am a very responsible person

231
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:05,931
Amen

232
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:10,903
Once you start, you'll be responsible until the end

233
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:14,407
Please quickly propose an amendment.

234
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:17,510
Let's amend a few articles of the Life Ethics Law

235
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:19,378
You guy...

236
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:20,746
Kwon Sung-woo

237
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,578
(Kim Yun-soo)

238
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:26,385
Do you want him to continue living?

239
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:27,953
What

240
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:31,624
Member of Parliament

241
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,393
You will die

242
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:37,208
I will be responsible and sure

243
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,538
Get rid of Quan Chengyu

244
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:41,638
Now you...

245
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:43,108
Responsibly and accurately

246
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:45,078
Do what needs to be done.

247
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:41,638
Are you okay?

248
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:43,078
Yeah, it's okay.

249
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:45,038
See if there is any other space.

250
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:46,378
I see

251
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,038
What is this doing?

252
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:34,108
uncle

253
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:36,138
I show off

254
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:38,678
Change your clothes and take a rest first

255
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,778
A staff will come to take you

256
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:43,008
What tests will I have today?

257
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:45,338
I have no idea

258
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:47,838
Uncle, have you eaten?

259
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,738
You didn't eat?

260
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:53,578
Go eat quickly

261
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:06,408
Not all restored yet

262
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:10,608
But are you sure this person is a human trafficker?

263
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:11,638
What

264
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:13,108
Would you like to take a look at this?

265
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:16,208
Uncle, we're going to eat soon.

266
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,308
When will you be back?

267
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:19,538
I'll be home late, don't wait for me

268
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:22,078
Uncle, this is the first time you haven't come back for so long.

269
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,208
A bit worrying

270
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,078
I'm sorry

271
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:25,138
I will definitely go back tomorrow

272
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:27,008
Don't worry, I'm fine.

273
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:30,678
This is basically a conversation between family members.

274
00:24:37,638 --> 00:24:40,038
Anesthesia is ready, please prepare

275
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,208
good

276
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,478
Okay, let's smoke more today.

277
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:47,638
Now stop smoking this girl's

278
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:50,278
Overdose of drugs and poor condition

279
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,738
Broken body

280
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:54,178
I see

281
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:56,078
So far so good

282
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:02,078
There's one person missing here.

283
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:03,778
Go find it quickly

284
00:25:07,978 --> 00:25:10,678
Is anyone in there?

285
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:13,508
doctor

286
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,738
Doctor, are you okay?

287
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,708
That one sample is missing.

288
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,108
hateful

289
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,438
Lord's An

290
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:55,538
Found the design

291
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:58,038
Go downstairs and turn right.

292
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:00,108
Then you will see the main engine room

293
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,508
This should be the most important

294
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:36,878
Lord's An

295
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:39,208
Can you see what it is?

296
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,938
A little further over there

297
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:46,078
Not the second one

298
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:48,278
Did you find it?

299
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,638
This one?

300
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:51,978
Yes, that's the one

301
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,838
hateful

302
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:32,638
Are you okay?

303
00:27:34,938 --> 00:27:36,178
OK

304
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,008
etc.

305
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,578
Director, you might want to come over as soon as possible.

306
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:52,138
Did you find anything?

307
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:55,178
(Buyer's List)

308
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:56,578
Found the buyer's list

309
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,678
There seem to be thousands of people

310
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,038
So many?

311
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:02,608
No information about the seller?

312
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:03,838
Wait a moment

313
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:06,808
(DNA Edited Child Buyer No.17)

314
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:08,138
(Park Cheol-yong and Seo Eun-joo)

315
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:10,538
DNA database...

316
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:11,678
What is this?

317
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:13,778
DNA database? What is that?

318
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:17,338
What is this...

319
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:19,438
To put it simply

320
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:22,378
It is to separate the good and bad DNA

321
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:26,378
Then customize the child you want here

322
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,338
Too exaggerated

323
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:41,908
What's going on?

324
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:44,038
Because there was a signal response, I looked for it

325
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,608
Lock down the entire building

326
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:02,338
Now

327
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,938
Black Alert detected a breach

328
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:20,278
We need to speed up.

329
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:22,578
I found that it was invaded and searched carefully for me.

330
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:07,478
Black Alert: Intrusion detected

331
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:15,938
sisters

332
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:17,838
How are you doing?

333
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:18,938
Of course

334
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:21,308
I'm sorry to have you make this trip in person.

335
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:23,978
I'll just entertain you.

336
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:25,178
Understood

337
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,938
My husband is not very convenient to move around outside.

338
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:31,908
Please understand.

339
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:33,678
You are so kind.

340
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:36,838
If it weren't for this opportunity, how could I come here?

341
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:40,238
Thank you for thinking this way

342
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:48,478
Thank you, sister

343
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:52,408
She was willing to sacrifice her daughter

344
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:56,908
We really became a family.

345
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,508
Like sisters

346
00:31:12,878 --> 00:31:14,108
husband

347
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:20,478
Finally met

348
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:22,478
I've always wanted to see you

349
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,978
Nice to meet you, I'm Jin Se-hee

350
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:35,608
I'll just get to the point.

351
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:37,408
Support rate part

352
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:41,008
As you can see, I have my own defenses.

353
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:45,978
But everyone who comes to me with a proposal

354
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,808
They only talk about support rates

355
00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:51,278
This makes me feel very boring

356
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,678
Usually stupid people

357
00:31:55,678 --> 00:31:59,378
Feeling bored when hearing something you have to hear

358
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:06,578
You are indeed as bold as the rumors say, Doctor.

359
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:11,278
The youngest president of the Republic of Korea

360
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:13,308
The highest average approval rating ever

361
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:16,108
Someone like you who has no regrets

362
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:18,238
Why would I care about those

363
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:20,438
What about the little people who talk about their approval ratings?

364
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:25,308
I understand you want to do a real political

365
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:29,478
Regarding the issue of declining birthrate

366
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:34,938
In fact, in a country where even the president and his wife are DINKs

367
00:32:34,938 --> 00:32:37,178
Why am I the only one asked to have a baby?

368
00:32:37,178 --> 00:32:39,938
It's not a question of support.

369
00:32:41,178 --> 00:32:44,738
I believe you want to see me because you already know this.

370
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,708
Do you want to think and walk together with the people?

371
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,378
I'm right, right?

372
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:55,008
and

373
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:57,738
The most important thing is that you really love your wife

374
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:11,378
I didn't see the wrong person.

375
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:16,308
After I was diagnosed with azoospermia

376
00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:19,278
actually…

377
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:21,208
I even thought about divorce.

378
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:24,508
But if you divorce during your term

379
00:33:26,908 --> 00:33:29,038
I'm worried about ruining his future.

380
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,338
I also wondered if I should get a divorce before the inauguration.

381
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:38,238
I will make both of your dreams come true.

382
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:42,838
The Lord will surely grant grace

383
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:44,138
Amen

384
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:56,438
If this matter can be successfully concluded

385
00:33:56,438 --> 00:33:59,538
I also want to repay you a little kindness

386
00:34:00,478 --> 00:34:03,308
I heard that you encountered many difficulties in your research.

387
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:08,308
There are too many useless regulations in China, right?

388
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:20,908
Lord's An

389
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:23,178
Lord,

390
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:24,508
Just keep going straight

391
00:34:27,837 --> 00:34:30,238
Please explain the inspection process.

392
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:31,408
good

393
00:35:00,338 --> 00:35:01,538
Excuse me

394
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:06,238
Sister, where can I get checked?

395
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:11,608
Then I'll wait here

396
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,308
What's going on, my sister Xuan

397
00:35:35,638 --> 00:35:36,778
My sister Xuan

398
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:38,538
What happened? Why is this happening?

399
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:44,208
Does Miss Xuan need anything?

400
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,108
Can I come in?

401
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:55,508
Can

402
00:35:57,938 --> 00:35:59,938
Who was that sister just now?

403
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:01,338
Are you new here?

404
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:02,578
Who are you talking about?

405
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:31,008
Wow, it's Snow White.

406
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:36,238
Do you know the true story of Snow White?

407
00:36:40,238 --> 00:36:42,838
What's wrong? Is this the first time I see my mother smoking?

408
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:46,338
right

409
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:51,308
Do you want to try it?

410
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:54,208
Mother…

411
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:55,908
I show off

412
00:36:57,938 --> 00:37:00,708
"Magic mirror, magic mirror"

413
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,978
Snow White's stepmother said this

414
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:07,008
Actually, that woman...

415
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:19,408
It's so frustrating.

416
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,278
She turned it off

417
00:37:22,278 --> 00:37:23,408
What

418
00:37:23,878 --> 00:37:25,338
Let's go quickly

419
00:37:25,338 --> 00:37:26,938
Seok-soo

420
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:28,538
We have to go

421
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:37,338
Lord's An

422
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:47,138
Catch her over there.

423
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:49,108
Detecting intruders

424
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:54,608
Seoksu, we have to go.

425
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:57,838
I need to go help.

426
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,108
What can I do when I go there?

427
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:01,678
My sister Xuan

428
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:11,408
Damn it

429
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,908
My sister Xuan

430
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,878
My sister Xuan...

431
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:21,078
My sister Xuan

432
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:22,938
Shi Yu

433
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:24,478
What are you talking about

434
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:27,838
It's my sister Xuan

435
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:32,208
The person who was in front of my sister Xuan

436
00:38:35,278 --> 00:38:37,238
It's my sister Xuan

437
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:44,878
(Controlled Area)

438
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:47,738
Over there

439
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:49,138
Catch her quickly

440
00:38:54,408 --> 00:38:55,738
hateful

441
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:30,578
Hey, go report to your superiors.

442
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:31,838
Go get the chainsaw.

443
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:33,338
It's fast action

444
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:32,778
(Bai Enshu abandoned)

445
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,308
(Zhao Yanyou abandoned)

446
00:40:53,638 --> 00:40:55,578
Does Miss Xuan need anything?

447
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,608
(deprecated)

448
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:24,378
(Abandoned by Yin Zhishuo)

449
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:28,838
I, Yin Shixun, agree to abandon and destroy

450
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:32,138
(Pastor Yoon Se-hun's son: Yoon Ji-seok)

451
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:31,308
Yin Zhishuo, who was adopted seventeen years ago

452
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:33,708
Reason: Dissatisfied with product quality

453
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:37,008
You say it too.

454
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,478
I agree

455
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:39,878
Amen

456
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,938
All staff please gather in the lobby

457
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:17,908
All staff please gather in the lobby immediately

458
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:19,338
What happened?

459
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:21,408
It's nothing, don't worry

460
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:22,738
Go change your clothes first.

461
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:24,038
good

462
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:40,778
Hello

463
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:42,978
My sister Xuan is me

464
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,038
I am Choi Si-woo

465
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:48,678
Shi Yu

466
00:43:48,678 --> 00:43:50,838
What happened to you?

467
00:43:51,908 --> 00:43:53,738
My sister Xuan

468
00:43:53,738 --> 00:43:55,838
Can you help me please

469
00:43:59,038 --> 00:44:01,238
I'll tell you when we meet.

470
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:05,008
But you have to come alone and not be seen.

471
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:06,638
Where are you now?

472
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:09,808
good

473
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:23,508
You can't go out

474
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:25,778
no

475
00:44:25,778 --> 00:44:27,338
Do not touch me

476
00:46:06,378 --> 00:46:08,178
Get out of here!

477
00:46:13,508 --> 00:46:15,438
All staff please gather in the lobby

478
00:46:15,438 --> 00:46:18,478
All staff please gather in the lobby immediately

479
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:20,708
All staff please gather in the lobby

480
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,408
All staff please gather in the lobby immediately

481
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:29,478
Line up

482
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:38,678
Hey, what are you doing?

483
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:40,408
Go over there quickly

484
00:46:58,178 --> 00:47:01,078
Listen up, everyone, take off your masks.

485
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:04,278
Take off the mask for me

486
00:47:33,108 --> 00:47:34,508
Take off the mask

487
00:47:42,408 --> 00:47:43,638
Don't move

488
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:47,338
Don't move

489
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:51,208
Get out of the way

490
00:49:32,978 --> 00:49:34,138
Put the gun down

491
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,578
stop

492
00:51:05,778 --> 00:51:07,508
Don't make that expression.

493
00:51:16,478 --> 00:51:18,208
You know, bang.

494
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:49,938
no

495
00:52:17,238 --> 00:52:18,778
Mother

496
00:52:18,778 --> 00:52:20,108
You lose

497
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,338
Mother

498
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,538
You're of no use at all

499
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:29,708
Mother

500
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:32,708
Goodbye, I Hyun

501
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,278
Mother

502
00:52:36,638 --> 00:52:37,838
Mother

503
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:40,378
Mother

504
00:53:24,778 --> 00:53:26,003
I show off

505
00:53:26,478 --> 00:53:29,408
"Magic mirror, magic mirror"

506
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,709
Snow White's stepmother said this

507
00:53:32,078 --> 00:53:33,611
Actually, that woman...

508
00:53:34,008 --> 00:53:35,312
Not a stepmother

509
00:53:35,508 --> 00:53:37,347
Her biological mother

510
00:53:38,308 --> 00:53:41,678
The person who ordered the hunter to take out Snow White's heart

511
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:43,978
Not a stepmother

512
00:53:43,978 --> 00:53:46,678
Is the biological mother

513
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:06,178
I show off

514
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:10,408
my daughter

515
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:12,678
how is your day

516
00:54:17,978 --> 00:54:19,857
How could you come here?

517
00:54:20,308 --> 00:54:22,292
He should have died back then.

518
00:54:58,608 --> 00:55:01,178
(Thanks to actors Lee Min-woo and Sung-hoon for their special guest appearance)

519
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:04,308
(Return of children)

520
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,408
If you worry for too long and cause me to suffer any harm

521
00:55:06,408 --> 00:55:08,008
Think about it more

522
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:09,778
I'll go anyway, alone.

523
00:55:09,878 --> 00:55:11,816
I thought about it and found them useful.

524
00:55:11,938 --> 00:55:15,052
There should be an adult to protect those children.

525
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:17,508
Is that really the only way?

526
00:55:17,508 --> 00:55:18,678
You're not alone now, are you?

527
00:55:18,678 --> 00:55:20,808
So let's go together

528
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:22,708
Did you kill Eun-gyeol?

529
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:24,578
That stinky boy Yin Zhishuo

530
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:25,522
He used to be my son.

531
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:26,808
Kill him quickly

532
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:30,277
Just carefully select excellent genes and combine them together.

533
00:55:30,279 --> 00:55:33,538
Then there will be no such waste. It is simple and convenient.

534
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,307
So I'm going to do this

535
00:55:36,538 --> 00:55:38,676
Nice to meet you my Maria

536
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:42,446
I want to be a daughter who can help my mother

537
00:55:42,678 --> 00:55:45,483
Your son Zhishuo is here.
