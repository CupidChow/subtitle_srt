00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,900
(Yeon Jung-ah)

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,530
(Yuan Zhener)

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,830
(Cui Yongchen)

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,930
(Kim Jin-young)

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,030
(Return of children)

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
(This drama is a fictional work adapted from the original novel of the same name and has nothing to do with reality)

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
(Filming with child actors and animals complies with established regulations, and some stimulating scenes are required by the plot.)

8
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,770
Mother

9
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,700
Um

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,870
Why is my name called Xuan?

11
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,030
This is the name I gave you.

12
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,730
That…

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,530
What does my name mean?

14
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,000
"I" refers to myself and "xuan" means to shine

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,700
"I shine"

16
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,270
wrong

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,200
You are "the child who makes me shine"

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,170
How could you come here?

19
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,070
He should have died back then.

20
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,400
How are you still alive?

21
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,900
Should I die?

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
Why do you want to live?

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,470
How could mom do this?

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,200
How can people do such a thing?

25
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,570
"Mom"?

26
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,270
What is "Mom"

27
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,900
Useless stinky girl

28
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,830
(Returned Children EP5. Useless Children)

29
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,500
Oppose the Bioethics Law Amendment

30
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,370
A petition for the "Purchase of Children Act"

31
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,400
More than 500,000 people supported

32
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,870
Q: What are the pros and cons of the "Child Purchase Law"?

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,230
The current political landscape is centered around the opposition party.

34
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,070
Protests are in full swing

35
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,930
What exactly does this "Purchase of Children Law" mean?

36
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,870
The current controversial "child purchase law"

37
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,670
(Lawyer Jung Joo-yeon)

38
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,070
It is a project in the name of promoting scientific progress.

39
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,600
Subtly change the wording

40
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Finally legalizing the trade of eggs and sperm

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,170
and the evil law of technically manipulating the sex or genes of the fetus

42
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,600
Nor can it be regarded as just an evil law.

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,630
There are also studies that

44
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,700
(Lawyer Park Kyu-hyun)

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,800
If the "Purchase of Children Law" is passed

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
This will be a breakthrough in solving the current impact of South Korea's declining birthrate.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Which study are you referring to?

48
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,570
Now even the president of South Korea is a DINK

49
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,700
The total fertility rate is less than 0.6

50
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,470
A country on the verge of extinction

51
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,770
In this crisis, the "purchase of children law"...

52
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,900
That’s right…

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,170
I was wondering when they would mention me.

54
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,670
Can you drink alcohol

55
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,400
I hope you don't drink alcohol before sperm collection

56
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,430
It's okay to drink a little

57
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,730
No way

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,030
But when should I start using a belly support belt?

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,500
If you want to look pregnant

60
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,400
Maybe I need to gain weight?

61
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,870
Are you still drinking when you're about to become a mother?

62
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,900
It's not me who's pregnant anyway.

63
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,829
Speaking of which…

64
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,200
The surrogate mother

65
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,700
She really...

66
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,370
Is she Jin Se-hee's biological daughter?

67
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,730
Yeah, it's confirmed.

68
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,030
I heard she is smart and talented.

69
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,600
She's as beautiful as her mother.

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,270
Even if you are blinded by ambition

71
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,470
Why would you want to use your own daughter?

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,730
That girl is so young

73
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,670
husband

74
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,330
Let me just relay what she said to you.

75
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,800
"Miss"

76
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,930
"Do you know how old Mary was when she gave birth to Jesus?"

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,730
"It is said that he is 14 years old."

78
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,970
"Isn't this God's wonderful will?"

79
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,630
Loving Heavenly Father

80
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,900
Please have mercy on us

81
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
good

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,470
I see

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,800
But my husband

84
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,930
Should I at least meet her once?

85
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,930
I mean that girl

86
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,370
Be patient, there's no danger.

87
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,370
Absolutely not

88
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm sorry, sister.

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,270
Just be patient, you'll be fine.

90
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,130
Can you please remove the tape?

91
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,670
Yeah, you're right. Sorry.

92
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,930
What are you doing? Who are you?

93
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,700
Shi Yu

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,200
What's going on?

95
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,300
Sister, I will explain.

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,430
Sister, this is because...

97
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,730
Please help us.

98
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Our sister is locked up inside.

99
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
What

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,700
Your mother wanted to kill our sister.

101
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,070
impossible

102
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,600
There must be some misunderstanding, my mother...

103
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,070
Not that kind of person

104
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,670
She can't do that.

105
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,700
Sister, my sister Xuan is in danger

106
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,770
Please help us

107
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,130
We plan to exchange you for my sister Xuan

108
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,530
"My sister Xuan"

109
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,330
Who is that sister?

110
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,400
(Ms.)

111
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,730
I want to see me show off

112
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,030
Did you know

113
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,400
This time, I show off a lot of uses

114
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,230
Mother

115
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,530
Don't come over here

116
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,130
I told you not to come here.

117
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,500
What are you doing?

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,930
Let me go first

119
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,600
Mother

120
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,400
I told you not to come here.

121
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,530
Mother

122
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,600
I want to see me show off

123
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,630
Let her go

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
elder sister

125
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,500
Sister, are you okay?

126
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,000
Are you okay?

127
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,630
what to do

128
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,630
sister

129
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,800
Act quickly

130
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,170
Let's go

131
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,130
Are you okay?

132
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,630
Are you injured?

133
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,300
Mother

134
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,270
Okay, I'm showing off.

135
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,530
my daughter

136
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,800
It's okay

137
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,800
I show off...

138
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,500
Take her back

139
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,570
yes

140
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,530
Sister, are you okay?

141
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,170
Sister, wake up!

142
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,230
Sister, are you okay?

143
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,169
Brother, drive faster.

144
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,730
Drive faster, my sister Xuan

145
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,670
Did you just hear that?

146
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,600
She calls me "Mom"

147
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,770
What is "Mom"?

148
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,530
It's so annoying.

149
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,400
I'll find the waste as soon as possible.

150
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,830
Get rid of them

151
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,800
Don't worry about them.

152
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,300
I thought about it and found them useful.

153
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't you think they're looking for their parents?

154
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,000
Looks like he's scared

155
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,500
Fortunately, no one was injured

156
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,000
What if I get hurt?

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have to take her to see that woman tomorrow.

158
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,670
When she gets pregnant, she's not allowed to go out.

159
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,670
I see

160
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,130
It is also impossible for a 14-year-old to go out with a pregnant belly

161
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,670
If you need any help in the future, please contact me

162
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,970
Carry her in, sister, is there any way for me to carry you?

163
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,870
Come up

164
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,970
The bleeding still won't stop

165
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,730
Give it to me

166
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,670
But that woman just now

167
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,300
Doesn't it look like my sister Xuan's mother?

168
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,330
No way

169
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,200
It's my sister Xuan

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,000
The person who was in front of my sister Xuan

171
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,100
Please love your children more

172
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,870
Look at them with loving eyes

173
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,130
A pampered child

174
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,000
Sister, you are watching this again

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,730
I will give you twice as much love in return

176
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,130
Daughter, I love you

177
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,170
Love mom too

178
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,670
So

179
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,530
The woman I used to see on TV

180
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,100
Why on earth would she...

181
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,700
elder sister

182
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,800
elder sister

183
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,070
Sister, let's go to the hospital.

184
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,930
What should I do if I can't go to the hospital?

185
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,400
At least we have to save people.

186
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,070
Let's go quickly

187
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,200
Dr. Park

188
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,300
Please ask Dr. Park to come

189
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,800
The doctor my uncle hired before

190
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,830
Yes, please ask Dr. Park to come.

191
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,070
There's no point in contacting her.

192
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,430
Why

193
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,400
If he didn't have money, he wouldn't come.

194
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,500
Ask first, at least we should save people.

195
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,100
After all, she is a doctor and should have some conscience.

196
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,070
No matter what, I'll definitely find a way

197
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,730
Even if I'm alone, I'll go

198
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,300
Please

199
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,030
Think about it more

200
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,970
I'll go anyway, alone.

202
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,200

204
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,730
You know these kids, right?

205
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,370
I don't quite understand what you're talking about

206
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,270
Woo Tae-sik

207
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm looking for Woo Tae-sik

208
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,170
This

209
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,730
I don't know that person

210
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,830
I know that Woo Tae-sik is the guardian of those children.

211
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,630
There should be an adult to protect those children.

212
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,730
Is there any way to contact those children?

213
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,730

eight

216
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,070
What are you doing? You can obviously keep holding it in.

seven

221
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,970
I told you not to come out.

222
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,600
Useless girl

223
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
My sister Xuan's body is so hot

224
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,130
Can't delay any longer

225
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,670
Let's ask Dr. Park to come.

226
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,730
God bless us to go to church

227
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,800
We have to come up with the money.

228
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,430
Lord's peace

229
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,830
Is that really the only way?

230
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,530
coward

231
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,530
What

232
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,200
I said you were a coward.

233
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,400
Are you done talking?

234
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,230
I haven't finished yet.

235
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,730
If anything happens to me because of your indecision

236
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,630
Can you take responsibility?

237
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,600
So beautiful

238
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,370
What I fear most now is that something will happen to my sister Xuan

239
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,170
But you...

240
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,230
Please

241
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,600
If you don't know anything, just shut up.

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,970
Don't talk about other people's wounds casually

243
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,070
You have no idea how much pain I'm in.

244
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,900
How could I not know

245
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,130
You beg and cry every night

246
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,370
You don't know

247
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,830
We all know

248
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,300
What

249
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,600
"Lord, I was wrong"

250
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,300
Jesus please save me it's all my fault

"dad"

252
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,130
You sleep like this every day, how could we not know?

253
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,200
you…

254
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,430
Do you still have to hide because you are afraid?

255
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,500
Are you going to keep running away?

256
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
Is it okay if I pretend I didn't see it?

257
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,200
Now it's time to overcome it.

258
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,430
You have to face it properly.

259
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,670
And you...

260
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,000
You're not alone now, are you?

261
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,900
Even though you were alone

262
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,400
But now we still have

263
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,230
So let's go together

264
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,300
You're up.

265
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,170
Sit down

266
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,270
Eat slowly, daughter.

267
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,200
good

268
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,570
Were you scared yesterday?

269
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,300
From today on, I will arrange bodyguards for you.

270
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,570
Don't worry too much

271
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,730
Sometimes things don't go well for me at work.

272
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,770
Those people seemed to have some misunderstanding about me yesterday

273
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,530
good

274
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,630
Eat it

275
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,730
After eating, I slowly prepared to go out

276
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm going to take you somewhere

277
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,900
Where to go

278
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,970
You'll know when you go there

279
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,630
By the way, I decided to help you drop out of school

280
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,500
Start preparing to study abroad

281
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,300
I will go abroad almost next year

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,200
She seems to know tea etiquette even though she is so young

381
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,300
Not to mention anything else

382
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,470
But I insist on teaching good manners

383
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,870
You are so...

384
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,700
Baby raised daughter

385
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,830
After all, this is God's will.

386
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,670
Amen

387
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,870
That's right

388
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,030
I want to ask the most important question

389
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,730
Physical condition

390
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,670
It's allowed, right?

391
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,070
What I mean is…

392
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,500
My first period came around this time last year.

393
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,230
So you don't have to worry

394
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,770
good

395
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,430
Right

396
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,930
sisters

397
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,600
Can you let me and Xuan talk alone?

398
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,700
I show off

399
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,600
If you don't want

400
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,830
I can stop now.

401
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,100
No

402
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,270
I volunteered

403
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,670
Really

404
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,670
Is it true?

405
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,930
You don't know how scared I am that you were forced

406
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,900
So I feel really guilty

407
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,070
Aren't you afraid?

408
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,700
Aren't you afraid?

409
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,730
Because that's what Mom wanted.

410
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,200
Of course... what mom wants

411
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,170
That's what I hope for

412
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,170
I…

413
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,270
I want to be a daughter who can help my mother

414
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,130
I really hope...

415
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,970
I can have one soon.

416
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,030
A daughter like you

417
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,600
It will be available soon

418
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,100
Thank you

419
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,330
Thanks

420
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,930
should…

421
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,130
The dangerous period has passed

422
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,500
But she lost a lot of blood and is still very weak.

423
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,530
Why didn't I see your uncle?

424
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,870
And there is one more member

425
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,900
My sister Xuan will be fine, right?

426
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,370
Still need to observe

427
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,230
Are you guys not injured?

428
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,900
And you

429
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,000
You can leave when the treatment is finished.

430
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,070
Please don't mention our affairs outside.

431
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,170
I was thinking of doing that.

432
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,730
Who are you guys?

433
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,400
(ICSI: Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection)
ISCI is successfully completed and you can start training

434
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,700
Congratulations on behalf of

435
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,000
It's nothing. I don't have much expectation.

436
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,030
The president's genes are no more special.

437
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,370
I just want to make myself feel at ease

438
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,070
I feel like if I keep doing this, a perfect child will appear one day.

439
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,400
Thank you for your hard work

440
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,970
Earlier at 3 p.m.

441
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,070
Bioethics Amendment Act, commonly known as the Child Purchase Act

442
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,130
Approved by the House Judiciary Committee

443
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,000
I heard that in the final vote

444
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,230
Congress passes child purchase law, fearing massive protests

445
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,070
The ruling party will also force it through, right?

446
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,500
Yes

447
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,100
(Reporter Lee Yoon-hee)

448
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,470
The opposition also said it would use all means of lengthy debate to prevent

449
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,600
(Life is not an experimental subject, withdraw the bioethics law amendment)

450
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,530
(Science and technology that violates moral ethics)

451
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,800
It is expected that there will be fierce clashes between the ruling and opposition parties at today's meeting

452
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,430
Congress passes child purchase law, fearing massive protests

453
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,930
What happens if the final vote is passed?

454
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,230
Will babies really be sold and bought by then?

455
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,000
Yes

456
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,700
This is exactly what religious groups, civic groups, and opposition parties are worried about.

457
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,430
(Life is not an experimental subject, withdraw the amendment to the Bioethics Act)

458
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,670
The majority opinion is that although this amendment is in the name of developing biotechnology research

459
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,430
But in fact, these are just one-sided words

460
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,630
This is where what is done

461
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,900
You'll know when you see it

462
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,700
Come in

463
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,370
Did they really do this?

464
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,400
yes

465
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,030
They are not children at all, they are a bunch of scoundrels

466
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,900
Congratulations on passing the Judiciary Committee vote.

467
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,270
You are here

468
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,430
It's you, not me, who should be congratulated.

469
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,570
Don't worry, the final vote will pass.

470
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,230
There's a lot of opposition because there's no precedent.

471
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,070
Still talking about morality and ethics

472
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,600
But the law of nature is that the weak will be eliminated and the strong will survive.

473
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,370
We all follow the laws of nature. I don't understand what we are opposing.

474
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,530
Amen

475
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,970
What a mess

476
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,170
Fortunately, all important things are moved to the new lab.

477
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,600
I invited the MP here today to show you these

478
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,700
This is an artificially fertilized embryo.

479
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,900
There's only one that works.

480
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,930
Did you see it? It's different at first glance.

481
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,800
What about the other embryos?

482
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,030
waste

483
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,170
Christianity says that every embryo has a soul

484
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,330
It is life given by God

485
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,330
So some people are against artificial insemination

486
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,170
Holding signs to protest and making a mess of the demonstration

487
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,830
The world will change and people's hearts will change with it.

488
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,900
But if people's hearts change, the world will change accordingly

489
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,870
Then it's too late

490
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,000
That's right

491
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,670
Just think of it as helping to create a new world.

492
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,300
Why do you look like this?

493
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,400
I originally thought I was just a businessman obsessed with money.

494
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,000
Do you think she's a crazy woman now?

495
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:44,170
This embryo was later found to have a heart disease gene

496
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,500
So it was returned

497
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,530
This is because my parents are getting divorced.

498
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,670
This is more serious

499
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,130
ADHD gene detected

500
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,270
So I said it.

501
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:26,199
Wouldn't it be better to select good gene editing from the beginning?

502
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,500
Then there would be no such waste. How simple and neat!

503
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,469
That's why I want to do this business

504
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,100
See, I'm a crazy woman.

505
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,900
The world was changed by crazy women

506
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,900
They say you need to be brave enough to enter Congress.

507
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,700
This seems outdated.

508
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,470
How can you accomplish great things when you are so weak?

509
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,130
What do you want to discuss with me privately?

510
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,730
Actually, I spent a lot of time

511
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,070
We were able to win over the President and his wife to become believers in our church.

512
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,370
Such time and energy

513
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,400
Plus, I put in a lot of effort in all aspects

514
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,300
Completed such a difficult task

515
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,570
I thought you had enough funds.

516
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,430
Amen... Of course

517
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,970
I have donated a lot of salvation offerings on your behalf...

518
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,330
Once the bill is passed

519
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,070
The work of officially promoting the commercialization of the "Purchase of Children" law will be very busy.

520
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,800
The exchange you mentioned earlier

521
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,870
If you give me the management rights...

522
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,200
Exchange?

523
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,530
right

524
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,130
This is the sperm and egg exchange you mentioned.

525
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,500
If a service center can be established in the future

526
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,270
Providing one-stop service from adoption to abandonment

527
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,670
Pastor, this is a great idea.

528
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,500
Really very good

529
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,900
Of course the management rights will be handed over to you.

530
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Amen thank the Lord

531
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,830
My sister Xuan, are you okay?

532
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,600
The children...

533
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,870
I'll help you

534
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,730
What's going on?

535
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,430
Who treated this? Doctor Park was here.

536
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,930
What

537
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,600
Where does your money come from?

538
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,230
My husband and I are good at stealing safes.

539
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,270
It's really too dangerous. Why would you...

540
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,670
I'm glad you woke up, sister.

541
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,500
My sister, look at this

542
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Show me here

543
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,730
I'm Detective Choi Hyung-seok from the Buchon Police Station.

544
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,630
Please call me back

545
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,830
He had been trying to contact you while you were unconscious.

546
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,300
How did you run out?

547
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,470
My sister Xuan

548
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,300
I thought I'd see that person again

549
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,370
You can face him with your head held high.

550
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,800
Take revenge on him

551
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,200
But when we actually met, it was completely different

552
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,970
I feel very scared

553
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,670
Afraid of his eyes

554
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,530
I feel happier when we live in hiding

555
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,100
Eat delicious food with uncle

556
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,800
Play games together

557
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,930
Those days were happier.

558
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,400
I think so too

559
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,030
I'm scared too

560
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,530
But the Lord

561
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,400
Thinking about how we'll have to live in hiding forever

562
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,770
I think that's more terrifying.

563
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,570
Why are we running away?

564
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,030
We are not the ones who are wrong

565
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:45,070
Now is the time to face the challenge head on

566
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,800
Not just me

567
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,600
And you

568
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,900
No one should be allowed to live in hiding

569
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,970
Just like other ordinary people

570
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,430
Let's start over

571
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,600
Let's start a new life

572
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,130
Hello

573
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,130
Are you okay?

574
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,870
(Yin Zhishuo)

575
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,970
Let's go

576
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,870
Can you see the picture?

577
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,100
Visible

578
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,170
This guy…

579
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,900
Wasn't there a fire last time?

580
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,270
(Donation Box)

581
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,270
I heard about a famous fortune-telling parlor.

582
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,730
This one seems to be very famous

583
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,030
Should we perform an exorcism?

584
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,970
Nonsense about exorcism rituals

585
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,330
I am a pastor after all.

586
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,900
Everyone is doing it

587
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,630
Liu Renjun persuaded 5 million yuan

588
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,400
It's really worthy of being Liu Quanshi

589
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,970
It seems that the recent performance is good.

590
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,600
Deacon Yan Shunzi: 1 million yuan

591
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,300
(Thanks for your donation)

592
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,100
Isn't her business doing well recently? Why did she only donate 1 million?

593
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
That is to say

594
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,770
Jin Chunpei's followers 50,000 yuan?

595
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,700
Oh my god

596
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,100
etc…

597
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,800
Landlords are so stingy

598
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,070
Are you kidding me? Is he crazy?

599
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,930
Are you kidding me? I'm so annoyed.

600
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,000
Yoon Ji-seok?

601
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,770
Yin... No way

602
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,970
(You killed Eun-gyeol)

603
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,470
Did you kill Eun-gyeol?

604
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,470
This madman

605
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,670
Yin Zhishuo, this bastard

606
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,570
That stinky boy Yin Zhishuo

607
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,130
(Wanghua Bodhisattva Temple can help you cast curses, exorcise evil spirits and eliminate disasters)

608
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,270
Go back to me

609
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,230
What

610
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,130
Why

611
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,800
Why do people who worship the gods come here?

612
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,330
There is no distinction between big and small in God.

613
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,670
Worship whatever god you need depending on the situation.

614
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,000
Can you see where he is?

615
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,230
That guy?

616
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,670
That guy

617
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,300
(Fragrance oil box)

618
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,730
You guys

619
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,730
He is your son, right?

620
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,670
right

621
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,100
He is my son

622
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,200
wrong

623
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,730
He used to be my son.

624
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,470
Kill him quickly

625
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,370
Really

626
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,330
A guy without blood or tears

627
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,230
What do you mean, you want me to draw a curse on him?

628
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,930
Or hold a ritual to exorcise evil spirits?

629
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,770
Everything is fine, do it now

630
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,530
you…

631
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,970
Want to see results

632
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,200
Just put the amulet under the cross of your church

633
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,530
We must suppress the great god

634
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,430
The spell will be effective

635
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,600
good

636
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,970
thank you

637
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,700
Amen

638
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,130
Thanks

639
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,070
You've worked hard

640
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,400
Those two idiots drew a talisman and took it away happily.

641
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,670
But what religion do they believe in?

642
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,730
Of course, I believe in money.

643
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,930
Let's go

644
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,200
A Loving Heavenly Father

645
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,700
On this day of remembrance

646
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,330
We miss Eun-gyeol and pray for her soul.

647
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:55,800
Rest forever in the arms of our Heavenly Father

648
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,770
All of the above are prayed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

649
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,870
Amen

650
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,230
Amen…

651
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,300
Eun-gyeol is my missing son

652
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,370
Zhishuo's best friend

653
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,070
We gather here every time on Enjie's death anniversary

654
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,130
Let's pray together and hope that Zhishuo will come back to visit

655
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,200
Every year without interruption

656
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,830
Will Eun-kye know?

657
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,800
Will you know where my Zhishuo is?

658
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,200
Zhishuo

659
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,630
He will definitely find his wife.

660
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,430
Zhishuo must be safe

661
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:41,570
Thank you for your advice

662
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,700
Found it

663
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,430
Found Yoon Ji-seok

664
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,930
Let you guys go

665
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,130
Didn't you ask me to find your son Yin Zhishuo?

666
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,000
Let's go out and talk. Be brave.

667
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
How dare you touch the body of a god?

668
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,070
I'm sorry, God

669
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,230
I'm sorry, God

670
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,430
This rude boy is a sinner.

671
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,670
etc.

672
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:15,270
The talisman is hidden under the cross in the chapel.

673
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,300
A spell? Priest?

674
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,270
It's not right to advise

675
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,530
This is a misunderstanding

676
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:20,730
No, I'm a pastor. What is this?

677
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,770
How can there be a talisman? What is this? There is something here.

678
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,230
What's this

679
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,870
It's a spell

680
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,600
Oh my god

681
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,430
Zhishuo

682
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,000
I said I found your son Yin Zhishuo

683
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,170
Zhishuo

684
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,630
Zhishuo

685
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,270
Why do you put this symbol here?

686
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,370
That's not the case.

687
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,570
Your son Zhishuo...

688
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,230
Here

689
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,430
It's really him, Ji-seok

690
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,600
What? He's alive.

691
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,870
He's still alive

692
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:58,030
This bastard...

693
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,830
Hallelujah

694
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,830
Dear believers

695
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,570
Heavenly Father performed miracles

696
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,870
This is a miracle from Heavenly Father

697
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,170
Hallelujah

698
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,270
It is your sincere prayer

699
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,070
Received a response from Heavenly Father

700
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,230
Hallelujah

701
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:19,230
Heavenly Father brought back dear Ji-seok

702
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,670
Hallelujah

703
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,800
Thank You, Heavenly Father

704
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,630
You performed miracles

705
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,130
Thank You, Heavenly Father

706
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,500
Zhishuo

707
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,700
My Zhishuo

708
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,570
My Ji-seok is back

709
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:37,930
Disgusting guy, how dare you come here?

710
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,670
priest…

711
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,430
Oh my god, Pastor

712
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,170
Oh my god, Pastor

713
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,330
Disgusting guy

714
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:05,100
Stop fighting...

715
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,270
You are the one who is really disgusting

716
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,200
You money-crazy bastard.

717
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,500
Yes, I am crazy about money.

718
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,230
What can you do to me?

719
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,130
What about you? Aren't you also crazy about men?

720
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,200
You lunatic, don't you look at yourself?

721
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,970
You're worse than an animal.

722
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:38,430
You crazy person

723
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,130
If you want to hold your head high before the Lord

724
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,430
Just ask for forgiveness and repent.

725
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,700
This is your only way to survive

726
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,070
You disgusting guy

727
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,300
Enjie

728
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,500
Do you like my Zhishuo?

729
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:54,500
My son Zhishuo will become a pastor in the future

730
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:59,100
Take over this church

731
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,900
A pastor who once fell in love with a man

732
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,500
yes

733
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,570
Maybe by that time

734
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,530
The world has accepted this.

735
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:32,730
But Heavenly Father will never accept this.

736
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,500
Enjie

737
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:46,070
You hope my Zhishuo is happy, right?

738
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,270
Do you really love him?

739
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,370
right

740
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,300
Then disappear

741
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:08,830
Isn't this the love that Jesus taught?

742
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,830
Just like when Jesus was crucified for sinners

743
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:15,230
The same blood that redeems sinners

744
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,870
To Zhishuo

745
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,830
I really hope my love for you is just friendship

746
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,400
(Zhou Enjie)

747
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,030
I hope you see my choice.

748
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,030
Don't be too sad

749
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,470
All the choices I made

750
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,830
I hope you can be happy

751
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,970
I thought you saw me

752
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,370
A hint of guilt will appear on his face

753
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,230
So the first thing you said when you saw me

754
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,130
It turned out to be a "disgusting guy"

755
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,630
How could you do this?

756
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,130
Disgusting guy

757
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,830
You're not worthy of being a human being.

758
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,670
Are you saying that I killed Eun-gyeol?

759
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:31,270
No, you killed him, you lunatic.

760
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:34,970
If you hadn't entangled him, he wouldn't have died.

761
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:36,930
You know what, you lunatic?

762
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,400
Shut the fuck up

763
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,630
Hey, what are you doing?

764
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,670
Don't put that down yet.

765
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,370
What do you want to do, crazy Lord An?

766
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,800
That's enough for now.

767
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,830
So far

768
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,170
Let me go

769
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,270
I told you to let go

770
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,230
What do you want to do? Let me go.

771
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,300
Don't put that down yet.

772
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,770
Everyone who asks receives

773
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,870
Those who seek will find

774
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,200
A sinful and fallen soul

775
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,030
Will be punished

776
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,400
Lord's An

777
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,330
Go to hell, Ji-seok, don't do this.

778
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,870
Don't be like this... Ji-seok...

779
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,470
I give you money. I give you all my money.

780
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,770
All the money is yours...

781
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,370
If you want to do something, don't you need money?

782
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,600
You know, money is everything to me.

783
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:33,370
The safe is right there...

784
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:36,700
To open the safe, you need my fingers

785
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,830
I'll help you open it

786
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,800
I'll help you open the jerk boy

787
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,400
Please spare my life, Zhishuo...

788
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,400
Please

789
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,870
Please spare my life

790
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,970
Forgive me...

791
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:13,430
(Please use it on children)

792
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,730
How are you

793
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,900
Damn, it came really fast.

794
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,930
I was completely robbed.

795
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,730
How can you come now?

796
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,330
(represents)

797
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:54,000
How is this

798
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,730
Pastor, are you available to talk?

799
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,970
represent

800
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:05,330
The operating rights you mentioned earlier

801
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:07,670
I've thought about it.

802
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,170
I feel like I can't give you

803
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,700
What

804
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,500
Otherwise, how am I supposed to survive?

805
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,570
You can't just live on dreams, of course you have to make money.

806
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,900
You crazy bitch...

807
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:26,230
It's so noisy

808
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,400
Try saying this to yourself first.

809
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,770
Putting aside the identity of mother

810
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:35,600
I need love, too.

811
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,070
Then try to say it once.

812
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,230
I love you

813
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,130
I love you…

814
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,800
I love myself

815
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,930
I love you…

816
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,900
(Thanks to actors Ryu Seung-moo and Hwang Seok-jeong and Sung-hoon for their special guest appearances)

817
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,870
(Return of children)

818
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,770
From this moment on, it turns into a serial murder case

819
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,030
(Wanted serial homicide suspect)

820
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:29,800
Just kill and silence the witness.

821
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,530
If you die, you can't catch it.

822
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,230
The day of blessing has come.

823
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:34,900
I'll let you believe it

824
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,670
Why is Cheng Yu up there?

825
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,500
He said he wanted to find his son and kill him.

826
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,530
We'll help

827
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,600
Do you want me to wag my tail and beg for mercy?

828
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,200
If you continue to be so rude to me, I will resurrect Quan Chengyu

829
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,370
But now it's the people who should be afraid

830
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,030
It's not us, it's her.

831
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,570
I heard that a group of Koreans were gathered

832
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:52,630
Is there an arranged murder?
