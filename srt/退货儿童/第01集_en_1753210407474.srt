I'm not that interested

15
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,700
If I were you, I would be so curious that I would go crazy

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,900
Do you want me to tell you?

No need, what?

20
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,530
Are you scared?

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,930
I'd be scared.

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,030
It doesn't matter what

23
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,500

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,070
At least drink some soy milk. How can you skip breakfast?

Didn't you say you were going to eat fried chicken? What are you doing?

72
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,300
You don't have money to buy fried chicken.

73
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,430
Really...she only does this to me

74
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,000

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,770
Go Somewhere Else

This is the first time I've heard this.

83

Who said I was afraid?

84
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,500
Isn't it better to just ask uncle to buy it for us?

85
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,600
Hey uncle, I have no money.

86
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,730
Otherwise you just keep eating instant noodles

87
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,430
How can you be so rude?

88
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,470
Hey, let's go.

The loser is responsible for cleaning, washing clothes and dishes

94
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,570
bring it on

105
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,600

Hey, what are you doing?

110
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,030
Feel sorry

111
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,470
The casino is huge.

112
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,100
I can't see

113
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,230
How is that person?

114
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,500
Is that the vault?

115
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,130
So what are you going to do?

116
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,700
Hello Lord

117
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,570
Sister, I have planned everything.

118
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,970
How dare you talk to me like this?

119
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,330
How can you be my brother?

120
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,570
How dare you be so disrespectful

121
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,200
Anyway, as long as it succeeds, it means my plan is great.

122
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,230
I'm leaving

123
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,100
Hey wait for me...

124
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,070
Hello

125
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,430
What the hell is this?

126
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,970
Kill them

127
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,600

I'm hungry, come here quickly

138
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,100
You are responsible for cleaning. You can't regret it.

143
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,330
I was planning to open a fried chicken shop.

144
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,430
As a result, at most I could only eat two chickens.

145
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,930
But do you really want to leave your money here?

146
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,230
Someone will come and get it.

147

It smells so good

155

Do you want to go in and eat?

156
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,100
Are you crazy? What if your uncle finds out?

157
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,070
Why not just hide in the corner and eat?

158
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,070
No, I'm so hungry, let's go home quickly

159

It'll take a long time.

168
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,500
Hold the gun

There's only one thing that doesn't work

184
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,400
If you want to die, you can go out.

185
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,570
If I wish for one of you to die

186
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,670
Just go out.

How long will we do this?

189
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,400
If you want to continue like this, you might as well die.

191
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,330
What's wrong

192
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,200
Isn't it?

193
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,430
Did I say anything wrong?

194
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,630
We can't go out and be locked up in this place every day.

195
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,000
No one will come to us

196
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,630
There's not even a name.

197
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,930
Enough

198
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,330
Is this considered living?

199
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,700
Why

200
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,600
Why do we live like this?

201
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,200
If you want to continue like this, you might as well die.

202
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,630
Because I don't want to die

203
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,170
I don't want to die

204
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,400
Please save my uncle

205
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,430
I don't want to die

206
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,670
Help

207
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,430
Please help me

208
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,530
I don't want to die, please save me

209
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,600
Because we...

210
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,270
Choose to live

211
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,800
I can't go on like this.

212
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,030
They can't hold on any longer.

213
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,530
Ya Hyun

214
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,430
I got a boat

215
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,770
Although it is just a small fishing boat

216
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,900
It won't be smooth along the way.

217
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,970
But I still hope you can convince everyone

218
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,930
What about you, uncle?

219
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,730
uncle…

220
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,070
I have something to do

221
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,670
When everything is over...

222
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,970
I'll catch up with you when this is all over.

223
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,370
Don't worry, uncle will come to you right away.

224
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,670
Can't we go together?

225
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,430
Can't we forget everything and start over?

226
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,300
It's not your fault that the kids are like this.

227
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,700
This is not something you can solve alone.

228
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,330
Someone will contact you shortly.

229
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,730
Can you do it?

230
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,030
sorry

231
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,170
It seems like I've given you too much burden.

232
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,630
I'll tell the other kids.

233
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,270
You have to go

234
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,670
I'll bring enough bullets.

235
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,670
Today I have to hold on till the end

236
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,930
Okay, brat.

237
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,570
Got it. See you later.

238
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,170
Why do you sweep the floor every day when no one comes here?

239
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,300
Looking for something to do?

240
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,470
Oh, that's right.

241
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,400
There's really nothing going on recently.

242
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,500
It's too quiet. I'm running out of money.

243
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,300
There is no return order. Really?

244
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,500
Brother, why don't you take this opportunity to do something else?

245
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,300
There are many things you can do besides return the product.

246
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,470
How to say

247
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,270
Selling and the like

248
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,800
That should be more profitable.

249
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,430
I also told Director Zheng that I hope to have more work

250
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,600
But it doesn't work, it just gives me some trivial things

251
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,430
Is there no way to contact the higher-ups without going through Director Zheng?

252
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,130
How is it possible?

253
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,670
Why

254
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,730
Do you know who's up there?

255
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,730
Who is it? Have you seen him?

256
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,100
God

257
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,530
There's God up there.

258
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,630
This person does not exist in the world

259
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,230
Invisible but present

260
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,870
"sorry"

261
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,000
Doctor, thank you every time.

262
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,700
What's there to thank for? I like doing these things.

263
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,300
You know how much I love children.

264
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,570
Children, the dean is here.

265
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,230
Come quickly...

266
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,670
Then let's pray first

267
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,070
good…

268
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,100
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit

269
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,570
Amen

270
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,430
Heavenly Father

271
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,800
Thank you Heavenly Father for giving us abundant food

272
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,570
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

273
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,870
Amen

274
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,200
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit

275
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,770
Amen

276
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,600
Please take your time.

277
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,730
The Doctor is like my mother.

278
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,600
Really

279
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,730
So you wanna call me mom?

280
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,230
Mother

281
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,130
Save me

282
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,830
There are people here

283
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,630
Save me

284
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,600
There are people here

285
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,600
Who are you

286
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,970
Won't you let me go?

287
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,200

gentlemen

289
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,900
I just pretended nothing happened.

290
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,330
real

291
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,970
How can Mr. Reporter pretend that nothing happened?

292
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,930
You all...

293
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,700
It's so clear.

294
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,630
No

295
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,800
I don't know anything

296
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,070
I really don't know anything

297
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,870
gentlemen

298
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,030
I have a 7-year-old son

299
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,900
My wife is also pregnant

300
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,270
Please spare me.

301
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,530
Just right

(Note: Approximately NT$75 million)

306

Your wife will be very happy.

307
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,270
No…

308
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,630
After all, with the monthly salary of journalists

309
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,070
I can't make that much money.

310
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,170
No…

311
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,300
I don't need so much money

312
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,800
Sir, please spare me.

313
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,030
I don't need so much money

314
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,570
Please spare me...

315
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,900
Cleaned up

317
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,560
Please love your children more

318
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,500
Please love your children more

319
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,300
Look at them with loving eyes

320
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,830
The spoiled child

321
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,400
I will give you twice as much love in return

322
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,830
Sister, you are watching this again

323
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,130
Daughter, I love you

324
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,130
Why do you watch this kind of thing? It's so disgusting

325
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,330
Very interesting

326
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,400
Do you want to talk about it together?

327
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,800
Daughter, I love you

328
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,070
Love mom too

329
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,470
Daughter, I love you

330
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,330
Love dad too

331
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,530
very good

332
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,830
Hello everyone

333
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,470
The so-called theory of evolution is that inferior genes are eliminated

334
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:59,670
Only good genes survive

335
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,130
Does anyone want to tell me if this theory is correct?

336
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,870
Please say

337
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,370
I don't think we can take the genes that survive

338
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,070
Considered to be good genes

339
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,870
Because individuals who have difficulty surviving in certain environments

340
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,970
May survive climate change

341
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,470
Dinosaurs once dominated the world

342
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,300
They also became extinct during the Ice Age.

343
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,370
therefore

344
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:33,370
I don't think survival is evidence of genetic superiority

345
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,200
So genetics don't matter?

346
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,470
Of course it’s important

347
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,530
But there is no need because I am now very capable

348
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,830
Feeling complacent when you are better than others

349
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,470
There is no need to be inferior to others

350
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,370
I feel bad about myself.

351
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,700
I think the most important thing is to discover your own strengths

352
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,000
And strive to maximize it

353
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,430
Very good advice

354
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,270
Any other opinions?

355
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,100
Shi Yu, what do you think?

356
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,630
Can you share your thoughts?

357
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,900
I think...

358
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,370
yes

359
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,470
I agree with her opinion

360
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,630
Teacher, this should be impossible.

361
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,130
Yes, although it's a bit regrettable

362
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,270
But Shi Yu's qualifications are not good enough to join the Mensa Math Class.

363
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,100
What I mean is…

364
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,500
Something may have gone wrong with the test

365
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,370
Let's retest

366
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,200
Teacher, you also know this, right?

367
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Shi Yu's father graduated from Stanford Medical School

368
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,670
If Shi Yu also wants to enter the same department

369
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,870
You have to go to Mensa Math Class

370
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,230
All the students in the same cram school were admitted

371
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,700
Let's retest

372
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,470
Auntie's retest results will be similar.

373
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,900
Really…

374
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,870
It's so unreasonable.

375
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,600
He is clearly a very intelligent child.

376
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,030
mom

377
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,430
mom

378
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,330
I finished class early today.

379
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,130
Can I skip tutoring and go out to play?

380
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,500
What did you say

381
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,600
Please

382
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,600
You really are...

383
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,430
mom

384
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,000
You laughed again

385
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,370
Go ahead and have fun

386
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,130
Mom is the best

387
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,170
Hello

388
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,330
Is this Dr. Kim Se-hee?

389
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,600
Yes, who is it?

390
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,230
The lady wants to see you

391
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,930
You're contacting me now. I've been waiting for a long time.

392
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,470
Doctor, there are a few things to note before meeting a lady.

393
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,130
Excuse me

394
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,870
I'm driving with a kid.

395
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,900
I'll call back soon.

396
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,030
What

397
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm sorry to disturb you while you were reading.

398
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,530
No, it's okay with me.

399
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,600
Really good

400
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,630
By the way, how is Shiyu's child?

401
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,170
Looks quite interesting

402
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Shi Yu is very popular among his classmates and is also very interesting.

403
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,230
My most familiar brother

404
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,000
He said he and his mother were going to the children's park today.

405
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,670
So that's it

406
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,100
Shi Yu must be very happy

407
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,800
Brother, what are you doing?

408
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,500
You're here so soon. I'm just doing some work nearby.

409
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,000
What's this

410
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,830
I will download the ones that need to be destroyed urgently first.

411
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,930
Damn, it's really heavy.

412
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,500
Yeah, I'm going to play today.

413
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,970
You can handle it yourself.

414
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,700
Of course it's not once or twice.

415
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,000
And this client wants to return the goods. Take a look.

416
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,370
Can I return it?

417
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,000
The child is under 19 years old

418
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,530
Customers can

419
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,570
Can you help confirm a few items?

420
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,770
OK, please tell me

421
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,900
You are Ms. Park Min-joo herself

422
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,700
Your husband is Mr. Choi Hyun-kyu...

423
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,900
That's right. Both are correct.

424
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,730
Can you handle it quickly?

425
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,470
This is totally defective.

426
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,130
Is it right for a child to be so stupid?

427
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,030
Please refund quickly

428
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,000
It would be better if you could compensate me for my loss.

429
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,730
customer…

430
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,430
This customer is very angry.

431
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,770
These people are so disgusting.

432
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,970
Even if it's bad enough to raise a dog, you wouldn't abandon it like this.

433
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,030
Let's move together

434
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,370
one two three

435
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,270
Hello

436
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,900
Yes, please handle it cleanly.

437
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,230
Don't leave any trouble behind

438
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,870
OK

439
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,030
Shi Yu's mother went to buy Coke

440
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,330
When you finish playing, come down here and wait.

441
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,430
Um

442
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,500
See you later

443
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,470
What did you say

444
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,170
Why is the level test so bad?

445
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,600
I don't know

446
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,270
He's totally defective.

447
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,370
My husband, I'm really angry.

448
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,400
No matter how angry

449
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,870
How can you make your own decision?

450
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,030
This is a big deal. Why are you always so willful?

451
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,900
Dean Cui

452
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,130
Have you made the right decision?

453
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,630
Stop talking

454
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,330
Who told you to adopt a child?

455
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,300
It's your mother who keeps saying she wants to have a grandchild.

456
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,070
Obviously my son is infertile

457
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,430
In the end, I will be blamed.

458
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,400
What's your tone? It's so superficial.

459
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,130
What if I make a big fuss by returning the goods now?

460
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,600
They said just pretend to be missing

461
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,300
Next, I will help with the destruction.

462
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,670
I can only believe it.

463
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,630
To be honest, you don't like that kid smiling all the time.

464
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,570
Isn't it?

465
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,870
It's a good thing he really doesn't have a mind for studying.

466
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,330
That's it

467
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,270
But at least you did your best to raise him.

468
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,500
It's too bloodless and tearless.

469
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,000
What blood and tears?

470
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,770
I have no blood relationship with him.

471
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,470
But it's such a waste

472
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,130
I spent a lot of money on him.

473
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,170
Mother

474
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,970
Mother

475
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,800
Mother…

476
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,300
How should I explain this to my mother?

477
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,500
Hey, I'm planning to adopt another child.

478
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,130
They said they would refund the money and I could use it to adopt another child.

479
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,130
Honey, I have to go.

480
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,700
By the way, you have to cry a little too.

481
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,200
That way it will feel real

482
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,200
Hang up

483
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Hello…

484
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,200
Why do I have to go too?

485
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,000
So annoying

486
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,400
I can really act.

487
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Mother

488
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,570
Mom, where are you?

489
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,270
Are you Shi Yu?

490
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,730
Your mother was injured at the door and was sent to the hospital.

491
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,670
What

492
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,100
She wants me to take you there.

493
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,530
Let's go

494
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,030
Miss, I'm sorry.

495
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,200
Sir, what's wrong?

496
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,730
what to do

497
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,600
My child is missing

498
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,230
Please calm down and help me find it.

499
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,300
Mom, calm down first.

500
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,670
Where did you see the child last?

501
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,300
He was playing there just now

502
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,730
We agreed to meet here

503
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,870
But Shi Yu is missing...

504
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,100
What is the child's name and how old is he?

505
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,800
11-year-old Choi Si-woo

506
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,970
Is it a boy? He is 11 years old.

507
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,200
Is Choi Si-woo a boy? Yes, he is.

508
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,400
My Shiyu...

509
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,600
Mother…

510
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,670
Shiyu must be very hungry, please calm down first

511
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,070
We have called the police...

512
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,800
He said he wanted to buy a Coke, so I went to buy it. I'll find it soon. Please calm down and wait.

513
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,030
Shi Yu... Mom...

514
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,270
Shi Yu, where are you? Mom, please wait a moment.

515
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,700
I'm looking for my child

516
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,630
What should I do with my wife and husband?

517
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,170
What is going on?

518
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,800
Shi Yu... Have you found Shi Yu?

519
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,870
Can't find it? Haven't found it yet?

520
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,370
Already looking for it, no news yet

521
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,600
What should I do? Really, what should I do, husband?

522
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,830
What should I do? Shi Yu must be hungry. Where did he lose the child?

523
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,630
Wife

524
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,700
I would die without Shiyu.

525
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,170
What should we do with Shiyu? Shiyu...

526
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,600
Please help me find it

527
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,870
Shi Yu Choi Shi Yu

528
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,130
Wake up

529
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,670
Are you awake?

530
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,500
Uncle, who are you?

531
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,630
Where is this

532
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,700
Shi Yu, wait a moment.

533
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,230
(Dongzhege)

534
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,730
Wait a moment

535
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,630
Hey Dongzhe

536
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,930
Hello where are you

537
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,400
I'm almost there

538
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,900
Damn it, I'm so unlucky today.

539
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm going there now

540
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,230
What

541
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,600
I'll be there in half an hour.

542
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,430
No

543
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,430
You go back and rest early and I'll clean up.

544
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,400
It's okay. I have nothing to do when I get home.

545
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,800
Let's have a drink together after the event

546
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,800
OK, I know.

547
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,400
Uncle, where is this place?

548
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,570
Who are you

549
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,870
Where's my mom?

550
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,030
Choi Si-woo, listen up!

551
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,870
You are kidnapped now.

552
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,970
Ask us to kidnap you

553
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,630
That's your mother Park Min-joo

554
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,200
And my father Choi Hyun-kyu

555
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,870
Hello

556
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,700
The location has been confirmed

557
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,130
Please tell your child and leave the scene.

558
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,370
Go back to the staff for help after one hour

559
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,700
What to say

560
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,500
Are you going to act out that your child is missing?

561
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,330
Yes, report missing children.

562
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,700
I will lead the child to the blind spot of the surveillance camera

563
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,500
Then to the parking lot

564
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,470
I'll be there in thirty minutes.

565
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,200
When will the refund be issued?

566
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,430
Your parents also asked to kill you

567
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,830
Please let me go, please let me go

568
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,470
I did something wrong.

569
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,130
No, Shi Yu

570
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,400
Uncle will save you.

571
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,130
If you want to live

572
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,400
You have to do whatever your uncle says next.

573
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,700
Can you do it?

574
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,230
Choi Hyun-kyu and Park Min-joo

575
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,200
They don't even consider you as their own child.

576
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,330
No, my mother is not that kind of person.

577
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,900
Uncle, I want to get off.

578
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,030
No, Shiyu

579
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,700
Can't get off now

580
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,830
You have to believe what your uncle says.

581
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,130
Please

582
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Come on, take this.

583
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,770
Go to this place

584
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,730
There are kids just like you waiting for you there.

585
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,670
Don't attract attention on the way there

586
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,830
Do you know

587
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,100
You should find it hard to believe

588
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,230
But those people will buy children at will

589
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,930
If you don't like it, just throw it away

590
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,630
They're the bad guys.

591
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,230
If they knew you were here they would...

592
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,630
What if I try harder?

593
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,470
I just need to be a better kid.

594
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,370
Uncle, it's my fault.

595
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,700
Please let me call my mom.

596
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,900
Let me tell her I was wrong.

597
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,970
I will try my best

598
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,600
(Bathhouse)

599
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,670
There will be a new child coming.

600
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,670
Sorry for bothering you, Yahyun

601
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,770
good

602
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,400
Please be careful, uncle.

603
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,570
Shi Yu

604
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,830
Because the child is not good enough

605
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,770
People who abandon their children

606
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,770
Not worthy of being a parent at all

607
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,970
My husband, but

608
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,900
This is what I have decided

609
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,070
Dean, you don't dare to make any big decisions?

610
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,730
He looked at me stupidly when I called mom

611
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,500
You know that expression?

612
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,330
I know, a smiling face

613
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,900
That moment

614
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,030
I really feel like I can't stand it any longer.

615
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,430
I made up my mind immediately

616
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,900
I even hate the sound of his walking

617
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,870
Anyway, you're really amazing

618
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,770
Hey, I can't stand it either.

619
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,470
Sticking with him all day...

620
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,270
Really, wait a minute.

621
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,870
Hello

622
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,730
You have to cry. Your child is missing now.

623
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,730
Hello

624
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,170
Hello

625
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,600
Who are you

626
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,800
Mother

627
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,100
you…

628
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,200
Could it be Shi Yu?

629
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,700
What nonsense is this?

630
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,100
Mother

631
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,000
Mom, I'm sorry.

632
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,700
Why did you scare me?

633
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,130
what to do

634
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,600
He called.

635
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,970
It's his voice

636
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
He doesn't seem to be dead yet.

637
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,770
Are you talking about death?

638
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,430
How could he still be alive?

639
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,900
It's really him.

640
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,700
Hello

641
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,170
We requested a refund.

642
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,300
How can I let him live?

643
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,670
Hello

644
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,100
Mother

645
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,370
Mother…

646
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,830
Mother

647
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,400
Go to hell…

648
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,300
It's time to go

649
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,930
Choi Si-woo is still alive

650
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,630
Hello, Mr. Zheng

651
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,930
Where is Choi Si Woo?

652
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,570
What

653
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,930
If we can't find that kid

654
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,070
You're dead.

655
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,400
What are you talking about…

656
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,900
Hello

657
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,000
Tae Shik, we are done.

658
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,270
No way

659
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,070
What the hell, he's only 5 years old.

660
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,670
Is that him? Is he in the wrong place?

661
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,900
Such a small one

662
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,170
Come in

663
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,300
Taesik

664
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,230
Woo Tae-sik

665
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,600
You came really early

666
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,630
Still here, right? Let me see what's going on.

667
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,170
What's wrong? It's okay.

668
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,470
They said the child was missing.

669
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,100
Damn, I thought I was dead.

670
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,130
All he does is put on a bad face all day long. Damn it.

671
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,600
hateful

672
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,770
Director Zheng

673
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,600
The child is here

674
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,570
Director Zheng, why are you doing this?

675
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,130
What are you doing?

676
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,830
You bastard...

677
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,970
Open

678
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,730
Why do you want to do this?

679
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,430
Take out the goods

680
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,670
Have you seen the look in those children's eyes?

681
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,500
The children who died here

682
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,370
In their eyes I saw hell

683
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,400
Aren't you going to blow out the candles?

684
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,970
Little Brother

685
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,470
In this place

686
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,530
The day you join is your birthday

687
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,370
Congratulations on your new life

688
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,900
You are so smart that you came here on your own

689
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,300
This is for you

690
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,970
What's your name, little brother?

691
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,130
Hey, why do you ask my name?

692
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,800
Pick a name you want.

693
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,170
We didn't want to use the names those guys came up with, so we changed them to new ones.

694
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:37,400
But don't you think it's funny that it sounds like a subway station?

695
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,430
Ahyeon Station Seoksu Station Juan Station

696
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,500
(Note: Pronounced the same as "Ya Hyun Seok Soo Joo An")
Ahyeon Station Seoksu Station Juan Station

697
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:40,530
(Note: Pronounced the same as "Ya Hyun Seok Soo Joo An")

698
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,100
Very funny, right?

699
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,200
She has the same name as her idol

700
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,230
Did she ask So-mi to pretend she was Jeon So-mi?

701
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,800
(Note: "Su Mei" is pronounced the same as "Zhao Mi")
Did she ask So-mi to pretend she was Jeon So-mi?

702
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,830
So self-righteous
(Note: "Su Mei" is pronounced the same as "Zhao Mi")

703
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,030
So self-righteous

704
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,470
Isn't it funny?

705
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,630
Doesn't seem funny

706
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,330
Uncle, please contact us

707
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,330
I'm so hungry

708
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,100
But when will uncle come back?

709
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,970
He said he would buy fried chicken for us today.

710
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:10,130
Yes

711
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:13,100
Where is your uncle, little brother? Why are you here by yourself?

712
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,100
Bluebird 1 is searching for public telephone booths nearby

713
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,370
What happened to that car?

714
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:34,200
I'm searching near public telephone booths

715
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,300
Looking for an 11-year-old boy

716
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,200
Wearing a denim shirt and beige cotton pants

717
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,700
I'm looking for an 11 year old boy

718
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,300
He didn't use code words, this is clearly a police channel

719
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,500
What's going on?

720
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,900
Did you meet anyone on the way here, little brother?

721
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Did anyone see you?

722
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,900
Is it possible?

723
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,900
Did you call the police?

724
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,300
I called my mom.

725
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,330
uncle

726
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,670
I asked you to come closer

727
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:51,730
Shoot now

728
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:15,700
Front

729
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,500
uncle

730
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,730
uncle

731
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,300
(Postscript to "Returned Children")

732
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,760
(Kim Ah-hyun)

733
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,630
Is your name Kim Ah-hyun?

734
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,830
Is this our home?

735
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,830
This place...

736
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,070
It can't even be called a home

737
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,800
It's home.

738
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,330
Let's go in

739
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,870
Um

740
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,130
You guys eat more

741
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,130
How come it disappeared? Did someone take it? You ate it, right?

742
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,670
I didn't eat it, you must have eaten it

743
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,100
I didn't eat it for you.

744
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,870
I don't see the chicken leg. Give it to me quickly.

745
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,400
Then you eat this...

746
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,600
Hey, stop arguing.

747
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,030
It would be nice if I could eat it more often, right?

748
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,470
Yes, I am tired of eating instant noodles all day long.

749
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,100
Fried chicken tastes good only when eaten occasionally

750
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,830
Uncle, let's take a photo together.

751
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,370
Can I take the photo?

752
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,170
What to take photos of while eating

753
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,300
Just take a photo. I haven't taken a photo in a long time.

754
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,900
Really

755
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:56,500
I don't shoot

756
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,030
I'll take the photo. I don't want to...

757
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,400
Take a quick shot

758
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,230
one two three

759
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,330
one two three

760
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,100
(Thanks to actor Kim Soo-ro for his special guest appearance)

761
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,160
(Return children)

762
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,830
Ma'am, nice to see you.

763
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,900
I want to find a child worthy of him.

764
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,600
There will be a way

765
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,700
Mom is in a great mood today

766
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,700
Because the moment I've been dreaming of is coming

767
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,800
My best classmate

768
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,400
I haven't been to school for several days.

769
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,700
He should be fine.

770
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,100
We are just commodities

771
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,300
After spending money to buy it

772
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,330
If you are not satisfied, ask for a return

773
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,970
Where is the membership card?

774
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,400
Those children shouldn't exist in this world.

775
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,000
So where did they go?

776
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,100
A place that does not exist in this world

777
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,130
Go fast

778
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,700
You are all defective.

779
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,830
Why do you want to kill us all?

780
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,130
Uncle couldn't find it in the end.

781
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,630
I must find that monster.
