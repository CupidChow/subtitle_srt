♫ please don’t leave me aside
and pulverize my heart ♫

16
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,650
The reason I came back
to Nong Saeng this time...

17
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,850
is not just to visit your grandmother.

18
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,050
Actually your grandmother is old.

19
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,010
She has all kinds diseases.

20
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,290
But her heart is still strong.

21
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,410
Look, she always jumps up and down like that

22
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,250
But it's probably time for to take care of it.

23
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,050
You mean Grandma?

24
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,610
Take care of Grandma...

25
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,730
take care of...

26
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,330
the Saengsin business.

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,770
You're going to leave
your work at Bangkok?

28
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,690
Actually, I've been
working for 5 to 6 years now.

29
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,130
I think I'm already very good at it.

30
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,450
Finding something new
to do is quite interesting.

31
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,330
Actually I've been talking about
it with Grandma for some time now.

32
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,450
When things get serious...

33
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,650
Your grandmother...

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,250
she's very stubborn.

35
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,050
Like you.

36
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,570
How can you say that?
Are we in the same side?

37
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,570
How could you say that to me?
No, I'm not talking to you anymore.

38
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,130
My head hurts.

39
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,050
Go, go. Go to sleep.

40
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,050
You should quick head to bed.

41
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,650
I'm having a headache talking to you,
I don't want to you anymore.

42
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,490
My head hurts too.

43
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,130
Why did you kick me?!

44
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,210
Ai'Ruk?!

45
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,210
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,010
I can get up on my own.

47
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,050
Who asked you to
scared me with the mask?

48
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,650
I thought you were a ghost.

49
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,050
Look, it's raining.

50
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,810
Thunder is about to strike you.

51
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,370
And you still haven't woken up?

52
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,530
I was sleeping comfortably.

53
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,250
Who let you come up here?

54
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,730
You mother, of course.

55
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,290
She asked me to bring
you down for breakfast.

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,250
Also...

57
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,130
I LINE text you last night...

58
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,730
you read it but
why didn't you reply?

59
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,490
Because I was busy.

60
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,790
Busy?

61
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,650
Is busy and sulking...

62
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,010
are the same words?

63
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,370
Who's sulking with you?

64
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,250
You and I and nothing to each other.

65
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,730
Why would I be sulking?

66
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,090
You're right.

67
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,770
If you're all right then good.

68
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,210
I thought the thunder
already struck you to death.

69
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,290
I'm leaving.

70
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,090
Ruk, wait.

71
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,170
Shit.

72
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,250
What's all the ruckus, son...

73
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,850
What are you doing so loudly?!

74
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,850
- What happened?
- Nothing, Mom.

75
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,530
The kids were playing.

76
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,770
What are you playing?

77
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,730
Grandma, Grandma!

78
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,930
Mom...

79
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,330
Hey, hey. You're grown up!

80
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,810
Get up!

81
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,850
What are you playing
on the floor like that?

82
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,970
Mom, it's nothing.
The kids were just playing.

83
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,170
Oh my butt.

84
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,290
Oh, my butt.

85
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,050
P'Tunwa.

86
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,490
What is it?

87
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,890
We're sorry.

88
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,130
Sorry?

89
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,890
Sorry about what?

90
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,170
For wanting to prank you
by dropping the flour on you.

91
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,450
It's a small matter, it's nothing.

92
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,240
I have work to do,
we'll talk tomorrow.

93
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,850
I almost forgot.

94
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,730
I want you to delete
the clip that you took.

95
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,050
I'm worried that someone might
see it and it can cause trouble.

96
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,170
Yes.

97
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,840
I'm leaving. See you soon.

98
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,870
Sawasdee krub.

99
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,370
It's that simple?

100
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,790
Exactly.

101
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,570
Kaengsom, I've been to ask you this.

102
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,290
How did you know P'Tunwa?

103
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,330
He's in the same
year as my older brother.

104
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,370
So I stole his number from him.

105
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,210
Ever since I've known you...

106
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,810
you're the smartest
in this kind of thing.

107
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,930
Are you complementing me?

108
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,050
Yes, I am.

109
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,330
Thank you so much.

110
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,490
Yes.

111
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,250
Irritating me?

112
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,570
I was just thanking him.

113
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,770
Thing is...

114
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,450
my mom has something to tell you.

115
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,450
Our band worķ is finished.

116
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,890
And our savings...

117
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,250
are almost depleted.

118
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,650
Today's work...งานวันนี้ก็

119
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,930
Today's work has been cancelled.

120
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,050
That means we'll have no money.

121
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,090
Then I'll quit.

122
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,450
I'll resign too.

123
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,850
I haven't been paying my room
rent for several months now.

124
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,650
It's better for me to do online selling.

125
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,330
Goodbye.

126
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,330
I'm quitting too, Grandma.

127
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,210
Me too.

128
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,610
I'm so sorry.

129
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,010
Those who are still here...

130
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,850
and thinks that...

131
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,650
you have love to work on this together...

132
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,090
makes me feel re-leaved

133
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,170
Those guys...

134
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,130
are such like raising a wasted cooked rice.
[ " raising a wasted cooked rice" = " good for nothing" ]

135
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,610
When our band was famous...

136
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,290
they all came rushing for the job.

137
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,290
But now when our
band doesn't have any job...

138
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,610
They all leave.

139
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,210
Don't blame them, that's normal.

140
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,010
We have to agree to that.

141
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,650
If people are bored of old song...

142
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,200
should we create a new song?

143
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,690
You said it like it's easy.

144
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,650
The composer had just
walked away a moment ago.

145
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,530
Then should we
sing other people's song?

146
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,610
There will be copyright issues.

147
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,610
Copyright fee is very expensive.

148
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,170
And we have no money to pay for it.

149
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,760
Kaewtah...

150
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,650
take a look at the cue book.

151
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,060
Do we still have jobs left?

152
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,810
For this month?

153
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,410
This month,
next month. Check them all.

154
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,770
This month...

155
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,050
there's none, Mom.

156
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,810
Next month and...

157
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,690
the following month, also none.

158
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,770
We have no more job.

159
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,250
No more job?

160
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,530
No more.

161
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,820
That's all right.

162
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,170
Today we'll have a delicious meal...

163
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,050
to comfort us all, OK?

164
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,690
I can't stay.

165
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,810
I have to prepare dinner back at home.

166
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,690
You said no one's home.

167
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,570
I have a dinner
planned with a friend.

168
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,570
I have to go now.

169
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,090
One day, he might changed to
be my boyfriend. I'll go now.

170
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,690
I have to go now.

171
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,830
IG, son...

172
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,240
Yes.

173
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,690
Please invite Ruk here for dinner

174
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,730
Sure thing, Mom.

175
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,370
Go, dear.

176
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,170
I'll will cook to the best of my abilities.

177
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,490
Alright, Grandma.

178
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,940
Grateen.

179
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,860
What are you doing sitting here
absent-minded? Miss your girl?

180
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,180
What girl, Grandma?

181
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,980
You're imagining thing.

182
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,580
Don't lie to me.

183
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,240
Lying to elders is a sin.

184
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,230
You know everything about me.

185
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,140
If not, how can I
be your grandmother?

186
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,230
I'm just afraid that...

187
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,020
I'm the reason the band fell.

188
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,900
Don't think to that extend, Grateen.

189
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,220
If I dance better...

190
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,100
sing better...

191
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,660
or can compose song
and play musical instrument...

192
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,460
I can help the band
more than this, Grandma.

193
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,230
You're the vocalist.

194
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,460
It's because of your voice...

195
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,460
that made the band famous.

196
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,500
That made us able to make
a living and earned a fortune.

197
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,740
Don't get too emotional on this.

198
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,220
That's how life is.

199
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,420
Same as the band.

200
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,580
There's ups and downs.

201
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,700
It's a normal thing, Grateen.

202
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,460
Don't stressed about it.

203
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,460
Has your wound gotten better?

204
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,260
Yeah, it's got better now.

205
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,660
Fortunately, it's only flesh wounds.

206
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,580
My mom's fear hasn't gone yet
since Ai'Kaengsom called her.

207
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,220
Lately, she's been calling
me every morning and night.

208
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,220
To check if I'm still alive.

209
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,540
Your friend, Petch...

210
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,540
did he ever mention me?

211
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,340
No.

212
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,900
Why?

213
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,220
He seems weird.

214
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,060
Weird how?

215
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,710
Well...

216
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,740
Or did he told you...

217
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,820
about him being gay?

218
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,860
Yes.

219
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,360
Ever since we met for the first time.

220
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,340
Don't take him too seriously.

221
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,500
That's how he is.

222
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,900
He likes to open up
and doesn't like hiding things.

223
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,660
Except if you're someone he's into.

224
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,900
If that's the case...

225
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,620
he'll avoid you for sure.

226
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,300
The person he likes?

227
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,300
- Ai'Petch?
- Ruk.

228
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,700
Khun...

229
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,820
Petch.

230
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,580
Kui....

231
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,580
Where's he rushing too?

232
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,860
My dad is not home.

233
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
Then why is the electric on?

234
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,220
Who cooked this so many dishes?

235
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
It's me.

236
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,160
Since Uncle Yingyod
and Nukrop are not home.

237
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,040
so I came and cooked all this.

238
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,160
Come, let's eat together.

239
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,860
Are you not cold wearing like that?

240
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,080
No.

241
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,880
Why? Are you cold?

242
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,100
It's late...

243
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,800
so I kinda feel cold.

244
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,160
If you're cold...

245
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,980
I'm ready to give you a hug(sop).

246
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,960
But if you want to date(kop) me...

247
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm ready to be your darling too.

248
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,560
What are you guys doing?

249
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,450
IG?!

250
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,960
What are you guys doing?

251
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,200
Hello. What is it, Mom?

252
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,360
E'Bplatoo's dead?!

253
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,320
Ruk...

254
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,880
Bplatoo's dead!

255
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,360
Who?!
You mean who?

256
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,520
Who?!

257
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,040
P' P'...

258
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,400
Who?!

259
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,000
My cat's dead.

260
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Cat?!

261
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,840
Enjoy the meal, Ruk.

262
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,960
Move!

263
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,600
My cat! My cat's dead!

264
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,800
I thought it was a person.

265
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,720
Ruk.

266
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,360
What were you doing just now?

267
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,040
Well...

268
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,880
Noinae's cat is dead.

269
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,200
That's not it.

270
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,560
I mean, what were you doing earlier?

271
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,040
It's not like what you think, IG.

272
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
Why are you being so panic?

273
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,360
I was stupid to misunderstand
thinking you're up to something there.

274
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,240
So, why are you looking for me?

275
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,760
My grandma...

276
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
wants me to invite you for dinner.

277
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,360
But from what I can see...

278
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,440
you already have
someone taking care of you.

279
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,360
Don't be sad.

280
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Sad for what?

281
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,200
Me and you...

282
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,920
are nothing to each other.

283
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,120
Whatever you want to do...

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,440
go ahead.

285
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,280
- Sawasdee krub, Mom.
- Sawasdee, son.

286
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,360
Whatever you wanna do, go ahead!

287
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,600
What's wrong, son?

288
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
You were fine when you went out.

289
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,800
What's the matter?

290
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,760
If it's that bad...

291
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,000
this...

292
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
I will burn it for you.

293
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,070
Mom, wait.

294
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,680
It's alright, I'll keep it myself.

295
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,920
I was messing with you.

296
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,640
There's a call, just a moment.

297
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,760
Mom.

298
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,560
Hello.

299
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,040
Yes, this is Saengsin's car parade.

300
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,520
Yes.

301
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,960
A 100 days merit?

302
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
That's a huge job.

303
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
Of course.

304
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
Do we have a new car parade?

305
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,360
Absolutely, no problem.

306
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,640
No problem at all.

307
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
A new car parade?

308
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,760
Piece of cake, I'll take care of it.

309
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,160
I'll take care of it.

310
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,600
I'll take care of it.

311
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,520
We'll definitely not disappoint.

312
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,560
See you.

313
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,080
A huge job, Mom?

314
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,080
Yes it is.

315
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,480
A 100 days merit. Huge indeed.

316
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,130
But...

317
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,520
What is it?

318
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,760
They want a brand new car parade.

319
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,080
New car parade?

320
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,720
How can we get a new car parade?

321
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,080
We're doomed.

322
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,560
Calm down, Mom.

323
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,560
I know now.

324
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,040
What is it, Mom?

325
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,930
All done!

326
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,610
Where's Grateen?

327
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,850
Grateen!

328
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,450
It looks good, right?

329
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,890
Why don't you turn around
and let me have a look.

330
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,860
I think it's alright. It's alright.

331
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,450
It's alright.

332
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,930
If it's alright then we can't use it.

333
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,770
Really?

334
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,860
It'll do.

335
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,990
It'll do, right?

336
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,780
Noinae, who trained them a moment ago?

337
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,130
Grandma?!

338
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,890
Grandma?

339
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,570
Grandma?!

340
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,320
I know it's Grandma.

341
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,400
No!

342
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,410
Grandma's here!

343
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,690
What are they doing here?

344
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,450
What costume is that?

345
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,540
So revealing and flashy.
Who made that?

346
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,730
Ummm...

347
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,490
Do you deem my
band as having no dignity

348
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,170
Why are you doing this?!

349
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,730
Come here, Grateen.

350
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,950
What costume is this?

351
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,440
It has embroider like a flying vulture.

352
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,870
This is a crazy costume!

353
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,250
Who made this?!

354
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,730
Grandma, Grandma!

355
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,360
Who made this?!

356
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,890
It's almost nudity.

357
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,330
Grandma...

358
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,010
calm down.

359
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,090
IG.

360
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,570
Are you the same as them? IG?

361
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,530
You...

362
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,170
Come here, Grateen.

363
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,570
This is a crazy costume!

364
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,130
Who made this?!

365
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,130
Grandma, Grandma.

366
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,290
I knew you'd be sitting here.

367
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,330
Earlier...

368
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,410
I looked terrible..

369
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,730
It can't be that bad.

370
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,090
You're not good at lying.

371
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,680
Nothing will get better
by blaming yourself.

372
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,090
You did your best.

373
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,130
How can it's not my fault?

374
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,850
I'm the lead singer.

375
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,170
It's not exactly your fault.

376
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,770
The kids want a change
of style, weren't they?

377
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,890
Staying like this makes me feel better.

378
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,410
Then stay, like this for awhile.

379
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,770
Teacher Rop is kissing a guy!

380
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,950
That's P'Grateen!

381
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,810
Guys are kissing each other!

382
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,610
Teacher Nukrop is kissing a guy!

383
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,130
Yes, yes!

384
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,160
Teacher Nukrop is kissing a guy!

385
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,610
What is this?

386
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,810
It's a phone.

387
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,410
I knew it.

388
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,210
You liked...

389
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,170
and comment on it.

390
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,050
You still have feelings for Fangkao, right?

391
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,330
That's my problem.

392
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,130
How can it be your problem?!

393
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,330
You and I are pretending
to be boyfriends!

394
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,640
If you're doing this,
how can you move on from her?

395
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,850
Do you think it's easy
to get over someone?!

396
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,490
When I love someone...

397
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,170
it's difficult to forget about them.

398
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,730
Even though she's with someone else...

399
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,910
I still love her.

400
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,770
No matter how cruel she is to me...

401
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,490
I still can get over her.

402
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,720
How can someone like you understand?

403
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,410
How can I not understand?!

404
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,130
If you like her...

405
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,130
then tell it to her straight.

406
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,690
Why are you doing
this fake and real thing?

407
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,410
Fine.

408
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,890
If you want me to tell her...

409
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,530
I'll do it.

410
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,130
What's with all the noises?

411
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,660
P'.

412
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,530
Where's IG?

413
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,300
Did you had an argument with him?

414
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,760
It's nothing.

415
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,560
Just a little misunderstanding.

416
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,320
A misunderstanding also
happened in this house earlier.

417
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,720
Did you know that IG gọt
slapped by his grandmother?

418
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,920
It was a hard slap too.

419
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,200
Just because of an misunderstanding.

420
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,520
Next time, whatever you're
thinking or want to do..

421
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,000
think carefully about it.

422
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,880
Don't go around and have
a misunderstanding about others.

423
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,120
Don't let it become a big issue and gets worsen.

424
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,720
Understand?

425
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,120
I'm gonna go check on Grandma.

426
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,760
She probably cooled off by now.

427
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,080
I have to go now.

428
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,680
So cute.

429
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,760
Am I being mad for no reason?

430
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,200
Wake up!

431
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,720
WAKE UP!!!

432
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,680
What's the ruckus early in the morning?

433
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,240
I want to get a drink!

434
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,600
Come, come. Quick!

435
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,240
What is wrong with you?

436
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,200
I'm bored like an idiot. I need a drink.

437
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
Wanna join me?

438
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,720
You're inviting us for a drink.

439
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,700
Are you heartbroken
or had a fight with Ai'Ruk?

440
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,320
He's been saying stupid things.

441
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,240
Why am I mad about it?

442
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,480
Don't tell me that you two quarreled about
you liking and comment on Fangkao's photo?

443
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,280
Yes, he was acting stupid.

444
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,600
I only like and comment and he thinks
that I have feelings for Fangkao.

445
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,520
Then he caught me doing it and he...

446
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,480
Air

447
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,240
Oh God, it's over now.

448
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

449
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,910
You two are behaving like
you're in a real relationship.

450
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,160
What are you talking about?

451
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Are you crazy?!

452
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,520
No, we've been suspicious
about it for some time now.

453
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,600
If you don't believe me...

454
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,960
you'll know.

455
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,680
Court is in session!

456
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,200
Honorable judge.

457
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
The incident...

458
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,760
started during the defendant's party.

459
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,760
The fate of the defendant got intertwine with the victim's...

460
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,400
started with a kiss.

461
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,960
The reason was that the defendant was worried that his friends...

462
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,620
would bully the victim.

463
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,280
But the defendant...

464
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,800
is conflicting in his
heart and can't say anything.

465
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,720
So the defendant chose to
pretend to be the victim's boyfriend.

466
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,120
While the defendant could
have gone to find a beautiful girl.

467
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,600
to be his girlfriend!

468
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,280
Objection!

469
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,080
Be quiet!

470
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,380
Continue.

471
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,900
The next testimony...

472
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,740
As a lawyer, after the semester ends...

473
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,300
I went to meet the
defendant at the temple fair.

474
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,840
The defendant...

475
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,160
doesn't want that girl named Noine...

476
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,910
to approach the victim.

477
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,800
The defendant begins
to avoid being seeing.

478
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,080
Even though the defendant
could have just go home.

479
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,560
The final testimony is...

480
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,120
The defendant would use
this expression every time...

481
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,440
the victim is near a guy named Tunwa.

482
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,060
Or it's not true?!

483
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,600
So reasonable.

484
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,100
You're awesome, P'Mes.

485
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,860
You really are an amazing informer.

486
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,070
I admire you.

487
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,440
Or you can call it being nosy, right?

488
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,840
Very good, Katty.

489
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,040
Ai'Kui.

490
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,280
Are you playing this with them?

491
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,700
It's fun.

492
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,080
Enough, enough. Stop playing, you guys.

493
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
Stop watching too much TV shows.

494
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,680
Don't change the subject.

495
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,600
You can stop acting now.

496
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,950
- IG.
- Yes.

497
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,510
Grandma.

498
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,190
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,590
I didn't mean to disrespect...

500
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,590
or insult your band.

501
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,310
I just want to help.

502
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,710
Do you still remember this song...

503
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,190
that I used to sing to you?

504
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,350
♪ Sleep, son. Close your eyes,
Mom will soothe your ♪

505
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,230
♪ I'm going to the filed to

00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,990
Do you remember?

510
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,910
I don't remember.

511
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,800
No.

512
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,210
That's alright. It's been a long time.

513
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,690
Yes.

514
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,670
But, back then...

515
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,430
you were very little.

516
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,590
I also turned on the Mo Lam for you to listen.
[ "Mo Lam" is northern-style song ]

517
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,730
Then, when I went to see you at Bangkok..

518
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,430
you will sing Mo Lam for me.

519
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,350
Is that so, Grandma?

520
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,730
Yes.

521
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,190
But...

522
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,270
I don't know how has it been..

523
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,630
since you sing Mo Lam.

524
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,720
Krub.

525
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,270
I think as time changes...

526
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,670
things will change.

527
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,870
But the one thing that I want...

528
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,870
is to have the Saengsin Band...

529
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,790
to be known by people and...

530
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,790
may the band's identity...

531
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,390
be the one that people used to...

532
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,310
listen and hear..

533
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:41,470
because I believe Saengsin
has many great things about it.

534
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,740
Grandma...

535
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,230
I may not understand
Mo Lam as good as you do.

536
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,590
But I can tell you that...

537
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,590
me and Mom are trying our best.

538
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,450
Don't be mad at me and Mom.

539
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,950
I was just murmuring like
an old people usually do.

540
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,630
Anyway, I also want you
to know that Saengsin...

541
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,630
still has many great things about it.

542
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,150
Do you think as I do?

543
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,510
I do.

544
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,390
I understand everything you said.

545
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,950
How are you here?

546
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,110
You think this is your house?

547
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,510
Actually when you speak Isaan...

548
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,150
is kinda cute.

549
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,750
Try speak some.

550
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,030
I can't.

551
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,870
Your accent is thicker than mine.

552
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,030
Go Ruk.

553
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,990
Get out of my house.

554
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,670
No.

555
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,030
- Go.
- No.

556
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,070
If you're serious then carry me.

557
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,670
Are you challenging you?

558
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,950
I'm kidding.

559
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,150
I'm kidding, IG!

560
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,550
I'm kidding.

561
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,590
Aren't you gonna ask me...

562
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,470
why I'm looking for you?

563
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,310
Why are you here?

564
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,070
I came to apologize.

565
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,290
For yelling at you about Fangkao.

566
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,630
Honestly, if I knew that it's this hard
for you to forget about Fangkao...

567
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,830
I would've help you from the start.

568
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,550
You still think I miss Fangkao?

569
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,820
Is it not the case?

570
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,800
Listen to me.

571
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,300
Right now...

572
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,440
I don't want to pretend to
be your boyfriend anymore.

573
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,230
I rather be your real boyfriend.

574
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,630
Shy?

575
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,390
What shy?

576
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,630
You're shy.

577
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,630
What are you talking about?

578
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,750
Take your shirt off.

579
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,230
What for, IG?!

580
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,590
Take your shirt off.

581
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,670
No, IG.

582
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,240
Take your shirt.

583
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,720
Your grandmother is outside.

584
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,830
She wouldn't know, this is my room.

585
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,990
I should go home, IG.

586
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,430
No way.

587
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,150
Ruk!

588
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,050
Don't forget to think about it.

589
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,980
Teacher Nukrop is kissing a guy!

590
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,430
Hey, it's P'Grateen!

591
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,330
Hey, it's P'Grateen!

592
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,350
Guys are kissing each other!

593
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,070
Teacher Nukrop is kissing a guy!

594
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,560
Nukrop.

595
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,430
Nukrop.

596
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,020
Nukrop.

597
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,080
Nukrop!

598
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,630
What's wrong?

599
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,070
Nothing.

600
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,630
Can I print my documents?

601
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,630
Go ahead.

602
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,070
What's the matter?

603
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,510
I'm in deep shit.

604
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,950
Hoy so?

605
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,790
Some students saw me...

606
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,270
and Grateen were kissing.

607
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,250
So?

608
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,750
Are you surprised?

609
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,570
How?

610
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,630
If people know that I'm gay..

611
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,670
So?

612
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,430
things won't be as it used to.

613
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,350
Even if the students didn't see you
they would see it from another couple.

614
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,790
The world is a different place now.

615
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,120
Stop barricading yourself.

616
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,470
Do whatever that makes you happy.

617
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,240
And if I'm happy...

618
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,830
but others suffer...

619
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,950
wouldn't that makes me selfish?

620
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,510
I don't think this is
about the students anymore.

621
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,550
It's about your father, right?

622
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,590
No father...

623
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,550
wants to see their children unhappy.

624
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,870
Have you told to him straight?

625
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,340
No way.

626
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,390
Do you think a guy like my father would listen?

627
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,940
You know how he is.

628
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,590
If that's the case...

629
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,390
you have to choose.

630
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,710
Between your happiness or...

631
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,710
your father's happiness.

632
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,300
Which one would
make you want to live more?

633
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,110
Yeah.

634
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,590
You're right.

635
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,030
Thank you so much.

636
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:47,990
No problem.

637
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,790
You want to print documents?

638
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,230
Do as you please.

639
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,770
I'm gonna go take a shower.

640
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,950
ОК.

641
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:28,870
Noinae.

642
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,710
Tomorrow...

643
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,620
Noinae!

644
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,900
Noinae!

645
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:43,910
What's wrong?

646
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,950
I'm gonna go home now.

647
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,550
Noine, what's wrong?

648
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,910
Oh, P.'.

649
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,390
What's wrong?

650
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,590
You look unusually dull.

651
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,350
Yeah.

652
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,310
Strange.
