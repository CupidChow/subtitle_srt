00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,570

♫ Tell me and I'll find some or you ♫

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,690

8

♫ please don’t leave me aside
and pulverize my heart ♫

16
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,300
Did you wear a mask to make fun of me?

17
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,210
No.

18
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,810
But it was hilarious when you wore it.

19
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,410
But I can't help it.

20
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,850
A cool guy like me...

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,050
even when I'm wearing a catfish mask...

22
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,790
I still look cool.

23
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,170
Very cool indeed.

24
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,050
Are you shy?

25
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,570
The hell I am!

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,450
So are you...

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,530
agree to pretend to be my boyfriend?

28
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,730
Yes.

29
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,490
Why do you have emphasize
on this so many times?

30
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,170
So how long will I have to pretend?

31
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,290
Well..

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,850
until I die, maybe.

33
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,370
Do I have to wait until my next life?

34
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,290
You're exaggerating.

35
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,050
I'll stop liking her eventually.

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,490
But it will need time.

37
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,880
Really?

38
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,610
Yes...

39
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,770
Try and speak.

40
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,930
You're as bad yourself.

41
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,410
I think we should
go and brush our teeth.

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,690
Where?

43
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,770
The bathroom, of course.

44
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,130
Absolutely.

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,330
Let's go.

46
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,830
They saw us here so they
went away for privacy, right?

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,730
Yeah, what's up with them?

48
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,250
P', they're pretending to be boyfriend,
it's right for them to be talking together.

49
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,970
Yeah, you're right.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,810
You are all busybody.

51
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,490
Yes, we are.

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,970
Did you just realize that?

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,830
Ai'Kaengsom!

54
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,410
P', I'm sorry.

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,880
Watch your mouth.

56
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,930
Is there anything you want?

57
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,610
Nothing!

58
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,050
What's wrong with you guys?

59
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,170
You're so annoying!

60
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,050
P'Ruk, can we take a selfie?

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,080
Thing is, my friend at the tutorial
class wants a picture of you.

62
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,290
Friend or lover?

63
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,360
Friend!

64
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,730
Friend!

65
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,320
If there's a stain, then go wipe it off.
[ T/N Chaiya's acent made it sound like he said "bpeuan/stain" instead of "peuan/friend" ]

66
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,310
Ai'Ruk!

67
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,050
I'm kidding.

68
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,250
My friend is a fan of P'IG.

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,640
He knows that you
and P'IG are boyfriends.

70
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,760
So he wants a picture of you.

71
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,890
They knew that much?

72
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,850
It's not that surprising.

73
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,490
The news is everywhere.

74
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,050
Even my football friends to my friends at Mars know about it.

75
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,010
Mars?!

76
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,250
Yes.

77
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,130
Are you crazy?

78
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,250
Let me talk to my dad for a sec.

79
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,830
Hello, Dad.

80
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,840
Ruk, I know everything about it.

81
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,770
About what?

82
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,600
How can you still
pretend like you don't know?

83
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,490
How long are you
gonna keep this from me?

84
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,730
Dad.

85
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,370
I have no choice.

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,610
Is there anything you want to tell me?

87
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,410
Do you have any
idea how disgrace I feel?

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,130
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,810
You're the son of the village chief..

90
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,850
and you took a
friend's shoes to wear?

91
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,250
If i didn't talk with the coach,
I probably won't know about this.

92
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,810
My friend no
longer wears that shoes.

93
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,290
So he gave it to me.

94
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,890
If there's someone
came to me about this...

95
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,750
what am I gonna do?

96
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,450
When is your election?

97
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,050
Come home during semester break.

98
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,410
The election will be just
in time with your semester break.

99
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,050
Yes, Dad.

100
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,690
Be careful of
what you're doing.

101
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,730
Don't disgrace me.

102
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,450
Yes, yes. Don't worry.

103
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,730
P'Ruk, so can
we take a selfie?

104
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,330
P'Ruk, so can we take a selfie?

105
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,890
Come, come. Come here.

106
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,610
Shit.

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,130
Can you print
some documents for me?

108
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,490
S...Sure...
Sure thing, Dad.

109
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,850
Why do you look so shocked?

110
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,410
The computer is having a problem.

111
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,330
I don't know what's wrong,
but the computer keeps turning on and off.

112
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,370
I'll print them at school tomorrow.

113
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,090
Then, what about my flyers?

114
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,170
Your flyers...

115
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,850
The printer is broken.

116
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,610
Suddenly the ink won't come out.

117
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,170
I'll print them at school tomorrow.

118
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,690
Can we make it in time?

119
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,290
Absolutely, trust me.

120
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,810
Let me take a look.

121
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,890
This, Dad.

122
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,090
The computer
keeps turning on and off.

123
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,370
Did the cable went loose?

124
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,130
Where's the plug?

125
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,890
Is it freezes?

126
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,890
It's here, but...

127
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,730
Why now?

128
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,730
You'll do it at the school tomorrow?

129
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,180
- Yes
- Both of them

130
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,170
Yes.

131
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,120
It had to be broken right now.

132
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,330
Alright, Sawasdee krub. I'm IG-an.

133
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,130
Today, I'll show you the content of
my travel bag for the Maldives trip.

134
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,080
I've already got everything
planned for the semester break.

135
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,370
I'll be going alone.

136
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,570
But, there are 5 items
that I can't leave behind.

137
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,090
For my trip to Maldives this time...

138
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,770
I'll have...

139
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,250
an underwater GoPro camera.

140
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,650
Do you see it?

141
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,050
Thank you.

142
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,090
Now that I can take pictures
underwater, I also need one up the sky.

143
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,770
Here it is.

144
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,490
The drone.

145
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,210
Do you see it?

146
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,250
You see it, right?

147
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,770
Thank you.

148
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,170
It's cute, right?

149
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,650
I also have this.

150
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,330
This third equipment...

151
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,050
I absolutely can't leave it behind.

152
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,130
A camera tripod.

153
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,090
It had to be the tripod.

154
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,690
Do you want it like this?

155
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,450
Also, I have...

156
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,570
This.

157
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,050
See?

158
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,170
This is one can't be left it behind.

159
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,410
I'll use it for diving.

160
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,690
Can't leave this one out.

161
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,770
These are all the equipments...

162
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
that can't be left behind for a trip to Maldives.

163
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,810
And this is the fifth
equipment that I can't do without.

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,810
IG, let's have dinner.

165
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,650
Mom, I'm doing a live right now.

166
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,730
A live?

167
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,130
Oh my god!

168
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,690
Hello.

169
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,140
Fans, I'm IG's mother.

170
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,030
I'm gonna sell some facial cream.

171
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,820
I have to go now, bye. See you.

172
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,730
IG...

173
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,090
there were so many viewers.

174
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,790
You can't even let me to
be in the same frame as you?

175
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,650
Oh, so...

176
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,050
who are you going with?

177
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,810
I don't know,
I haven't invited anyone yet.

178
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,570
Why didn't you invite Kui?

179
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,050
That guy is such boy scout. Too
stingy and only travel in Thailand

180
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,170
Why aren't you going for a
trip around Thailand sometimes?

181
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,210
Thailand or anywhere else is fine.

182
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,050
They're all the same.

183
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,610
It's hot here too.

184
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,050
That's a bold statement.

185
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,770
Then Maldives not hot?

186
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,410
- Let's get some dinner.
- Yes, Mom.

187
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,370
IG, dear.

188
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,610
Can I borrow your
loudspeaker charger?

189
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,050
It's on the table.

190
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,650
ОК, ОК.

191
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,290
IG...

192
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,050
is having a new lover?

193
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,330
They went dating on the
bridge is having a new lover?

194
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,830
Having a new lover?

195
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,170
This is his personal matter.

196
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,050
Not mine.

197
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,730
It's my son's private matter.

198
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,800
It's not mine, understand?

199
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,490
But this is about his new lover.

200
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,890
But, it's his personal matter.

201
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,130
My son's.

202
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,170
It's my son's...

203
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,210
personal matter.

204
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,250
It's not my personal matter.

205
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,930
Sawasdee krub, I'm IG-an.

206
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,050
If there's anyone has any idea of any beautiful
place in Maldives, you can share it with me.

207
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,040
I'll post some photos while I'm there.

208
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,090
What now?

209
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,210
Hello, Fangkao.

210
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,330
P'IG, Kim already has someone else.

211
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,450
What did you say, I can't hear you.

212
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,730
I should've believe you but I didn't.

213
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,450
Calm down.

214
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,810
Do you want me to go to you?

215
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,650
Као.

216
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,090
Did someone do something to you?

217
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,330
Why did he do this to me?

218
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,770
Who? Tell me.

219
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,810
Kim.

220
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,090
Listen to me.

221
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,530
Ai'Kim is a selfish guy.
Everyone knows that.

222
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,170
Stop crying.

223
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,090
Funny.

224
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,490
I was the one who left you.

225
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,890
But you're here still comforting me.

226
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,170
Because I still...

227
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,050
You still love me, right?

228
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,790
Well, I...

229
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,450
You don't really like
this Ruk guy, aren't you?

230
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,530
Look into my eyes.

231
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,570
I can't, Fangkao.

232
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,890
It's too cruel.

233
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,530
You don't love me anymore.

234
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,810
Why are you doing this?

235
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,650
I just want to come back to you.

236
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,970
You know that I really can't
cut you off from my life.

237
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,050
If you want to come back to me...

238
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,810
can you choose?

239
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,410
Will you choose Ai'Kim or me?

240
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,050
Please don't do this again.

241
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,900
I'm sorry, P.

242
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,300
That's all right, I understand.

243
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,540
P'Mes.

244
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,700
I think this is a good thing.

245
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,100
We get to see prove of
who really love our club.

246
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,540
But this not the time
to prove your love, isn't it?!

247
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,580
If everyone's quit, then there won't be
enough member to join the parade.

248
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,580
What's the point
of the sponsor then?

249
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,380
Calm down, P'.

250
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,420
Why are there
so many people quitting?

251
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,420
Because there are rumors
that our club will be disbanded.

252
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,820
So they all went out
to sign up with other clubs.

253
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
You'll see, if I have the money...

254
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,940
I will restore the reputation of our club.

255
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,860
How about this, P'?

256
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,540
If there's anyone else came
here to quit just cast them out!

257
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,820
Sawasdee krub, P'.

258
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,180
Hey, you!

259
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,780
You're here to quit, right?

260
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,340
Just go where you want to go!

261
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,220
I'm here to sign
up but better not then.

262
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,220
Nong, Nong!

263
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,220
Ai'Tong! He was here to sign up!

264
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,940
What's wrong with you?

265
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,700
I'm sorry, P.

266
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,660
It's too late.

267
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,860
Damn.

268
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,220
Hey!

269
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,180
Is IG here?

270
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,980
Are you blind, Ai'Kim?

271
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,340
This the Cheer Club.

272
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,980
IG is at the football club.

273
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
That's rude, Ai'Mes.

274
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,460
Sit down and be quiet.

275
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,340
Am I in your way?!

276
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,220
I heard your girlfriend called
her ex to see him, didn't she?

277
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,220
Such a dog!

278
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,060
Ai'Mes!

279
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,700
Excuse me, P'.

280
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,700
I'm here to sign up...

281
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,340
They're about to be shut down.

282
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,140
But P', I...

283
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,780
Go back to your class.

284
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,820
Cheer Club, you say?

285
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,660
Noob.

286
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,740
Just shut it down!

287
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,060
Ai'Ruk, where does all
of your strength comes from?

288
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,940
I'm fit.

289
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,700
And you're sitting there chilling.

290
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,960
I'm playing with the water.

291
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,460
IG, come here!

292
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,620
Ai'Kim, what do you want?!

293
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,210
Calm down, Ai'Kim!

294
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,980
What is wrong with you?!

295
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,700
Don't butt in my business.

296
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,780
What business?

297
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,740
You're already dating Ai'Ruk.

298
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,740
Why are you bothering Fangkao?

299
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,480
Answer me!

300
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,660
I didn't!

301
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
She came to me herself.

302
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,020
Your girl called me!

303
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,980
How can you blame me for that?!

304
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,540
Then what about when
you met her behind my back?

305
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,780
What was that all about?

306
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,260
Answer me!

307
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Ai'Kim!

308
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,500
This fucker!

309
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,860
The fact that you were with
someone else is no problem for you!

310
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,220
Busybody.

311
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,780
Why do you intruding?!

312
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,980
Why do you intruding?!

313
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,460
No!

314
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,300
Kim, calm down!

315
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,260
Calm down!

316
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,620
Ai'Kui, get him outta here!

317
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,100
Ai'Kim, hurry.

318
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,940
Remember, Fangkao is mine!

319
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,900
Remember that!

320
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,220
Get out of here, Kim.

321
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,260
Alright, everyone.

322
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,100
We will have a selection
of the team's captain.

323
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,540
The one who'll lead the
team in this year's match.

324
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,660
The losing team...

325
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,420
will be punished.

326
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,580
But this year...

327
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,380
it will be a bit special.

328
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,180
The winning team...

329
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,580
will be rewarded.

330
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,900
Alri ht.

331
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,580
Who wants to sign
up as the team's captain?

332
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,900
I do.

333
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,540
Anyone else?

334
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,620
Coach.

335
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,990
I heard that...

336
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,100
IG wants to be in the team.

337
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,990
But he probably can't now.

338
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,180
He probably more
suited to be the reserve player.

339
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,580
IG, what say you?

340
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,260
Better not, Coach.

341
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm not ready.

342
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,860
Besides,
I don't want to be someone...

343
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,140
who are pretentious.

344
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,420
I want in, Coach.

345
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,860
Get in position, go!

346
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,980
Come.

347
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,940
Pass it properly!

348
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,260
Didn't you see your friend?!

349
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,340
Damn!

350
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
How did you kick?!

351
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,340
If you see a friend, pass it!

352
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,040
Go!

353
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,020
Hurry!

354
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,020
Let me do it!

355
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,420
Kim, fighting!

356
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,220
Keep fighting!

357
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,500
Foul, foul, foul!

358
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,500
What foul?

359
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
IG.

360
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,220
Are you all right?

361
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,020
Look at me...

362
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,420
not anyone else.

363
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,420
Get your head in the game.

364
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,700
According to the
rules of the game...

365
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,940
The losing team...

366
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,940
will be punished.

367
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,020
As for the winning team...

368
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,940
they will be rewarded.

369
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,980
That's our tradition.

370
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,420
What tradition?

371
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,860
Push-ups until the coach says stop.

372
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,780
Shit.

373
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,620
Isn't that too extreme?

374
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
Yeah.

375
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,380
The coach never calls to stop.

376
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Until someone
got muscles inflammation.

377
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,340
It's lucky that
the parents doesn't know.

378
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,780
The winning team, get up.

379
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,820
Go to rest.

380
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,540
The losing team...

381
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,220
get up!

382
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,220
Faster, faster.

383
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,180
Faster!

384
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
Hurry, hurry.

385
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,420
Get down to position!

386
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,220
Ready, count!

387
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,100
Kui.

388
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,740
Now that we've won...

389
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,340
what will be the reward?

390
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,220
I think this time, it will
definitely be a big reward.

391
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,500
4, 5, 6.

392
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Damn.

393
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,860
I've never been so proud being the school's football player until today.

394
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,220
My reward is very valuable.

395
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,700
One stick of ice cream.

396
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,460
My thoughts exactly.

397
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,500
I better get something to eat,
it'll fill me up more.

398
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,980
So that day,
what did you do with Fangkao...

399
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,220
that Ai'Kim was
mad at you to that extend?

400
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,820
I didn't do anything?

401
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,780
She came to me and said
she's comfortable with me.

402
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,060
But she can't
move on from Ai'Kim.

403
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,220
So I...

404
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,740
So you...

405
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,700
kissed her?

406
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,860
Are you crazy?

407
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,940
So I told to think carefully
who she wants to choose.

408
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,100
But in the end...

409
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,140
it is as you see.

410
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,990
Why do ask?

411
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,820
Jealous?

412
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,580
The hell I am!

413
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,220
There she is, that bitch.

414
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,500
There, Fangkao.

415
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,740
It's really her.

416
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,780
Kiss me again.

417
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Quick.

418
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,420
You seemed fine when
you were playing football.

419
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,300
Why do you have
put your focus on her?

420
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,940
Hurry, kiss me again quick.

421
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
What is it with you with kisses?

422
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,380
Whatever, just do something.

423
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,540
If you don't kiss me,
I'll pull and kiss you.

424
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,060
No, IG!

425
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,220
No!

426
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
IG!

427
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,580
A kiss...

428
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,220
doesn't always means
an expression of love.

429
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,100
Is she looking at me?

430
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,500
She is.

431
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,260
But you can stop looking at her.

432
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,220
Just look at me is enough.

433
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,100
It's all messy.

434
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,650
Come everyone.

435
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,210
Let's congratulate the
captain of our football team!

436
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,370
Damn.

437
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,050
If it wasn't for me, you won't be.

438
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,570
That's bold.

439
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,850
I'm gonna go to the toilet.

440
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,450
Damn...

441
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,970
Are you too shy
to the point of urinate?

442
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,090
P'Tunwa sent a
photo of the horse farm.

443
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,450
- Look.
- Where, P'?

444
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,370
- Can I see?- Here.

445
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,370
Here.

446
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,930
P', why does it look...

447
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,690
P', why does it look... "hen leng"?

448
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,490
Hen leng?

449
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,170
Barren(haeng laeng).

450
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,330
Your accent is quite thick.

451
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,130
- Where, can I see?
- Here, look.

452
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,410
Yeah.

453
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,530
I think all of us...

454
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,450
will definitely get dark
after coming back from this.

455
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,290
Yeah, I think so too.

456
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:47,930
Shit.

457
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,370
P'..

458
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,970
I don't think I can go anymore.

459
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,490
It's so happened that parents asked
me to go visit my grandma at Australia.

460
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,010
It's because the photo
is not what you expected...

461
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,770
you end up not being free.

462
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,490
I really have to go.

463
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,090
Where is this place anyway?

464
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,150
I don't know.

465
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,250
It's at Nong Saen District or
was it Nong Saeng, I don't know.

466
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,870
Nong Saeng?

467
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,450
Why do you have to shout?

468
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,970
It's looks fun.

469
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,250
Are you going?

470
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,450
I can't.

471
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,890
I have to to Maldives.

472
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,610
Maldives? Can I come?

473
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,210
You're free now?

474
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,690
He got burned.

475
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,250
What were you talking about?

476
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,650
We were discussing on where
should we go during semester break.

477
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,130
Are you gonna go home?

478
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,170
Yes.

479
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,450
I miss my dad and friends.

480
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,090
Does your
neighborhood have cute girls?

481
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,970
Of course.

482
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,770
My neighborhood is
full of cute girl dancer.

483
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,370
Could you please
introduce one to me?

484
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,610
I'll come too. Can I come?

485
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,730
Can we come too?

486
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,810
Can we come?
Can we come? Can we come?

487
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,290
Yes, of course!

488
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,290
Come on!

489
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,450
Cheers!

490
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,710
Bottoms up.

491
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,090
It's become my burden again.

492
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,210
P', P.

493
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,530
P'..

494
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,190
P', wake up.

495
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,650
You have slept
for several hours now.

496
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,730
P'Tong, P'Tong.

497
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,610
Wake up.

498
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,210
P', wake up.

499
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,050
Did you hit me?

500
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,370
No, there was some
shadowy figure did it.

501
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,450
Wake up, wake up.

502
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,150
Payback time.

503
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,090
Did you hit me?

504
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,490
Did you hit me?

505
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,210
No.

506
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,650
P', what should we do with P'Ruk?

507
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,390
I'm starting to feel sleepy.

508
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,370
Let me take care of Ai'Ruk.

509
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,870
You take these four back home.

510
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,370
OK, sure thing.

511
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,970
P'Kui, let's go home.

512
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,010
P'Tong, let's go home.

513
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,570
Hurry, P'.

514
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,210
It's been too long now, wake up.

515
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,010
P', wake up.

516
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,050
Let's go, P'. Let's go home.

517
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,010
Let's go home. P'Mes, P'Katty.

518
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,130
Come, go home.

519
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,850
Go home, go home.

520
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,730
Go home.

521
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,690
Come on, P'. Go home.

522
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,570
Get home safely, guys.

523
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,370
OK, P'. See you later.

524
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,170
Hey, P'.

525
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,650
That way.

526
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,810
P', that way.

527
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,370
P', P.

528
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,850
P', let's go.

529
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,850
Why is a small
guy like you so heavy?

530
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,850
What's wrong with me?

531
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,490
I'm drunk, I'm drunk, I'm drunk!

532
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,810
No, I'm not

533
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,930
I'm not drunk, damn.

534
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,570
Sawasdee, IG.

535
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,810
Sawasdee, Ruk.

536
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,130
Shit!

537
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,730
How did you come in here?

538
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,450
Why are you naked?

539
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,610
I'm taking a bath,
of course I'm naked.

540
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,970
You on the other hand get
naked in someone else' house.

541
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,450
Shit.

542
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,130
Did your "thing" bump into me?

543
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,850
It was yours that bump into me.

544
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,650
Go, go.

545
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,370
Your legs are cold!

546
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,970
What's all ruckus, son?

547
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,010
Oh my!

548
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,970
Mom!

549
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,170
Sawasdee krub.

550
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,650
Sawasdee ja.

551
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
Dude..

552
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,160
did you see mine?

553
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,400
I didn't.

554
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,200
Did you see mine?

555
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,160
I, I didn't either.

556
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,520
But I saw it.

557
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,040
No one came to
help me get the plate.

558
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,600
'Sitting there like a young
master just waiting to eat.

559
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,040
Eat, hurry.

560
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,200
Eat up.

561
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,120
It's a bit dull around here, I think...

562
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,800
I'm gonna turn on some music.

563
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,480
Mom.

564
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,640
Having breakfast like this is fine, Mom.

565
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,960
Is that so?

566
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,560
Ruk.

567
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,440
Are you in the football club?

568
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Yes.

569
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,520
Are you new?
I never seen you before?

570
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,600
Yes.

571
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,480
I got here with a scholarship.

572
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,440
I studied at the
Isaan region before.

573
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,520
You were studying at Isaan region?

574
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,720
Mom.

575
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,590
I'm an Isaan too, we're neighbors then.

576
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,680
- We're from the same place
.- Mom, Mom.

577
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,220
- Mom.
- We're from the same place.

578
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,080
Son, son, son.

579
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,840
Are you all right?
Have some water.

580
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,220
You were eating too fast,
that's why you got choked.

581
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,520
Oh dear.

582
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,680
Are you all right?

583
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,440
I told you, eat slowly.

584
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,560
So where exactly do you live?

585
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,880
Mom, Mom.

586
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,520
Ai'Ruk needs to go to class,
or he'll be late for attendance.

587
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Me?

588
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,840
Yes, you'll get into
trouble if you late for class.

589
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,960
Go.

590
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,160
Yes.

591
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,480
Go, go, go

592
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,960
Sawasdee, son.

593
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
I'll be back soon.

594
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,560
You go on first.

595
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,400
I'm gonna get my bag,
I'll be right with you.

596
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,200
IG, son.

597
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,200
You can't go Maldives.

598
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,380
Why not?

599
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,520
It's Grandma, she is very sick.

600
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,680
We have to go
to Nong Saeng District.

601
