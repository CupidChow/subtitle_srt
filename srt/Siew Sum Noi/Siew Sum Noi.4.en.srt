16
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,850
P'Ruk, if you're going home...

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,530
can I ask you to take a
photo of P'Grateen for me?

18
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,820
Also, tell him how much I'm fond of him.

19
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,770
Alright, I tell him.

20
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,830
I still have one more thing
to ask you to give to him.

21
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,330
Yes.

22
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,690
This.

23
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,530
Can you give this card to him?

24
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,900
Also, there's still one more thing.
I want you to give to him for me.

25
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,330
What's that?

26
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,090
Close your eyes first.

27
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,910
Close your eyes first.

28
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,530
What's wrong with you?!

29
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,720
Give him that for me.

30
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,610
How should I do this?

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,890
Fuck it.

32
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,050
What's going to happen will happen.

33
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,130
Hello, Mom.

34
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,370
Why aren't you here yet?

35
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,850
I miss my flight

36
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,330
So, how will you get here?

37
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,490
I'm on a bus now.

38
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,250
- I'll be arriving in the morning.
- I'm putting my bag.

39
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,130
Call me when you arrive.

40
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,650
Yes.

41
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,330
Why didn't you fly here?

42
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,810
I've checked the flight ticket
but there's none left.

43
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,370
Did something happened?

44
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,730
It's a long story.

45
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,210
Ja. Take care of yourself.

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,570
We'll talk about it later.

47
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,650
IG?!

48
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,050
Shit!

49
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,690
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,090
You said you're going to Maldives.

51
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,090
Will a bus get you to Maldives?

52
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,050
I've changed my plan.

53
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,290
I want to go for a trip at Isaan region.

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,210
So where are you going?

55
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,130
I'm going home.

56
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,570
So, how did you end up going
for a trip to the Isaan region alone?

57
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,250
I want to have a
change of atmosphere.

58
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,050
I don't want to go
to the beach anymore.

59
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,730
So when you said
about going for surfing...

60
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,770
sun bath and get some tan...

61
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,370
what happened to that?

62
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,090
Why?

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,490
I can get get sun bath anywhere.

64
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,650
I didn't say anything about it.

65
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,170
I'm just curious.

66
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,050
Hello, Mom.

67
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,290
Why did you hung up so fast?

68
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,050
The connection here is bad.

69
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,610
Grandma wants to talk to you.

70
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,830
Mom, don't rush her.

71
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,090
Talk to IG.

72
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,080
Mom.

73
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,770
Hello.

74
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,210
Hello, is that you IG?

75
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,050
Is that you, IG?

76
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,690
Yes, Grandma.

77
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,770
Why are you arrive so late?

78
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,880
I miss you to death, IG.

79
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,170
I miss you too.

80
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,890
You're an Isaan people...

81
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,410
so you should speaķ like one.

82
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,080
Are you not proud
of being my grandson?

83
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,870
I'm speaking Isaan with you.

84
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,490
I am proud.

85
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,690
I love you.

86
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes, if you really love me.

87
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,210
can you do it quick?

88
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,050
I don't know if I could make it until tomorrow.

89
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,330
Please hurry.

90
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,890
Come and see me.

91
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,490
Live until I get there.

92
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,850
I'll be arriving tomorrow.

93
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,570
You're not here yet.

94
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,970
Can you sing me a song?

95
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,890
Grandma, there are a
lot of people in the bus.

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,690
Sing it, please. sing it.

97
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,490
I really want to hear it.

98
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,850
Sing it, sing it.

99
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,890

What are you laughing at?

104
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,130
Nothing.

105
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,130
I was reading something funny.

106
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,330
Were you eavesdropping me?

107
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,410

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,530

133
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,090
I didn't.

134
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,820
My ears happened to heard them.

135
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,560
So, how can you speak in Isaan language?

136
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,790
I learn them.

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,690
Learn?

138
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,170
That's right.

139
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,250
My school used to teach dialects.

140
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,450
I score 4 points in my exam.

141
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,830
Bullshit.

142
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,610
Then that means your
grandmother learns them too?

143
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,650
Yes.

144
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,610
It's like a family package.

145
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,050
You're such a pretender.

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,210
Your accent earlier clearly
shows you're Isaan people.

147
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,410
Or...

148
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,490
you're from Khon Kaen?

149
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,530
No.

150
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,010
Yaso?

151
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,130
No!

152
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,250
No!

153
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,610
- Bangkok?
- No!

154
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,210
See?

155
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,450
At least now you admitted...

156
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,490
that you're not Bangkok people.

157
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,490
IG...

158
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,330
What's to be embarrassed
about being an Isaan people?

159
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,090
Just different in laguange.

160
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,610
Eat, sleep...

161
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,050
they all live just
like people in Bangkok.

162
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,570
What are you talking about?
Nonsense.

163
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,570
I'm not.

164
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,610
Really?

165
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,050
But I've recorded it.

166
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,490
Fuck you, Ai'Ruk!

167
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,210
I'm kidding.

168
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,370

326
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,840
Yes, Mom.

327
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,180
Shall we go now?

328
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,450
Sure.

329
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,800
They seem eager to go, for sure.

330
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Be careful.

331
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,320
Don't ride too fast.

332
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,760
Or you'll get into an accident,
we don't want that.

333
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,520
Yes.

334
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,080
Hurry.

335
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,040
Go, go.

336
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,120
Go now.

337
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,240
- Hurry up the sooner you'll be back
- I'll go now, Grandma.

338
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,140
Have fun.

339
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,320
Mom, let's eat.

340
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,700
- Eat, I cooked them myself
- Where's the tadpole steam curry?

341
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,000
Sawasdee krub, Uncle.

342
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,960
Sawasdee kha.

343
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,040
Uncle Ying, Ruk's back, isn't he?

344
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,320
He's upstairs.

345
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,160
There, he's coming down now.

346
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,840
Ruk!

347
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,880
Take it easy there.

348
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,040
You're a girl.

349
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,120
You have to behave yourself.

350
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,720
I've been kissing his
cheek since we were kids.

351
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,840
What's to be scared of?

352
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,840
That was when you were kids.

353
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,240
But you've grown so big now.

354
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,160
A little.

355
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,960
No, I didn't mean it that way.

356
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,060
I mean you're a young lady now.

357
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,200
If others see it...

358
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,510
they might gossip about it.

359
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
When that happened,
no one will come courting you.

360
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,240
I don't want anyone
else to court me either.

361
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,800
Except for Ruk.

362
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,880
So, where are you planning to go?

363
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm gonna go see Petch.

364
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,960
Petch again?

365
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,920
When you're here,
you always go and see him.

366
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,700
If you didn't move out, you probably
have him as your husband by now.

367
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,480
Ruk here...

368
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,960
is a man of man.

369
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,720
It's impossible for
him to ended up gay.

370
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,920
Am I right, Ruk?

371
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,960
True, true.

372
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,360
I'll be going now.

373
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,400
I'm coming with you.

374
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,680
Kids nowadays...

375
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,520
are so sensual...

376
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,240
and daring.

377
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,390
Beautiful.

378
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,110
P'Grateen.

379
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,710
Where are we now, P'?

380
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,950
The pond by the village.

381
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,230
A pond?

382
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,110
Very nice.

383
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,350
What does it called?

384
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,510
This pond by the village? .

385
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,230
The Haunted Pond.

386
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,470
The Haunted Pond?

387
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,030
That's good then.

388
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,710
Let's have a closer look.

389
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,160
There's a legend in this pond.

390
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,830
Legend?

391
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,710
Then good. let's go.

392
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,270
Let's go, quick.

393
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,830
This is good.

394
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,110
This is nice.

395
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,710
This very nice.

396
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,710
The water is very clean, everyone.

397
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,870
Look.

398
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,990
This is very natural.

399
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,930
The water is so blue.
Look, it's clean.

400
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,710
The pond here is very nice.

401
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,510
P'Grateen.

402
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,590
So, about what you said
earlier about this place...

403
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,390
did someone really died here?

404
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,300
I was joking.

405
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,440
Whether it's true or not,
I have no idea.

406
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,870
It's late, let's head back.

407
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,710
Sure, P'.

408
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,710
You don't have to call me
“P'”. We're the same age.

409
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,510
I heard that you stop study for 2 years.

410
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,990
Yes.

411
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,070
If that's the case, there's
no need for me to be courteous.

412
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,670
I'm almost 20.

413
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,470
Why everyone here
knows a lot about me?

414
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,190
That's no surprise.Toa

415
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,670
You're Grandma Yoi's grandson.

416
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,150
The owner of Saengsin.

417
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,250
You're the hope of Loei Village.

418
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,710
Me?

419
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,390
Without you...

420
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,440
who will inherit it?

421
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,760
Don't stress about it.

422
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,340
People will always keep talking that way.

423
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,020
Your grandmother
might have way out again.

424
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,870
I hope so too.

425
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,230
What are you doing here, Grateen!

426
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,110
What are you doing here,
just the two of you?

427
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,420
I didn't do anything.

428
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,990
Yes.

429
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,550
I am.

430
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,430
You weren't arousing him?

431
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,270
No.

432
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:55,900
You're not overconfident?

433
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,640
I am overconfident.

434
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,520
Then I'll go.

435
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,320
- Go where?
- Go

436
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,710
That's enough, you guys.

437
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,190
What are you playing at?

438
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,030
This is Nukrop.

439
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,310
He is Ai'Ruk's older brother.

440
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,870
And this is IG,
Grandma Yoi's grandson.

441
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,110
Ruk's friend.

442
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,310
Sawasdee, P'.

443
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,950
Yeah, Sawasdee.

444
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,430
You can go home now.

445
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,590
I have some errand to do with Nukrop.

446
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,470
Sure.

447
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,630
How can I go home?

448
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,750
You can take my bike.

449
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,830
ОК, ОК.

450
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,110
Then, I'll be leaving.

451
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,110
See you at home.

452
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,350
Sawasdee, P'.

453
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,150
Jealous?

454
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,470
No.

455
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,830
If you're jealous, just say so.

456
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,190
I said I'm not.

457
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,950
I'm not jealous.

458
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,310
If you're not, then why
are you moving away?

459
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,710
I told you, I'm not jealous.

460
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,270
So why were you
holding his necķ like that?

461
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,510
Can't friends hold necks?

462
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,830
Someone might sees us.

463
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,110
Who's going to see?

464
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,430
It's been a long time since
we're together just the two of us.

465
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,150
You're saying like
we're in a different country..

466
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,430
It takes a long
time for me to be with...

467
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,790
my Daddy Lover

468
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,830
I'm jealous, you know?

469
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,530
There they are.

470
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,710
Kids, over here. Come.

471
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,470
So cute.

472
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,430
This is Sis Suang,
the owner of this farm.

473
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,790
And these who will do
the promotion are N'Tong...

474
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,710
- N'Kaengsom...
- Yes.

475
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,950
- N'Katty
- Sawasdee krub.

476
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,710
and N'Mes.

477
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,110
So cute.

478
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,870
You're all so handsome.

479
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,790
Just like a male protagonist.

480
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,070
I'm so happy that
you're willing to help.

481
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,710
Look at them, they are
all cute and adorable.

482
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,830
I'm feeling so lovable.

483
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,990
I think they are pretty tired traveling
from Bangkok, don't you think?

484
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,230
I think we should
let them go in and rest.

485
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,750
Good.

486
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,790
As for the work,
I think we'll talk about it later.

487
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,790
Let's go

488
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,470
Mes, take your friends
and put your things in order.

489
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,230
As for which room
you want, that's up to you.

490
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:56,910
Thank you.

491
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,110
Please come in.
You sleep on the lower floor.

492
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,490
Then it'll be easier
for me to go in and out...

493
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,450
I mean, go in and
out to look after you.

494
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,030
Please come in.

495
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,190
So cute.

496
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,590
I'll sleep on the sofa.

497
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,950
I'll have the bed then.

498
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,710
Do you like to eat creams?
[ It's a joke of saying the boys have fair skin ]

499
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,950
Come on in.

500
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,270
So strong and cute.

501
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,510
So cute.

502
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,950
As I explained...

503
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:28,310
the kids need money for their Cheer
activities during the Samakee event.

504
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,390
How much you want to give them...

505
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,430
you can tell me directly.

506
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,390
That won't be a problem.

507
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,190
I'll take care of it.

508
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,470
How nice of you to do it:

509
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,430
I like it.

510
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,230
Very good, Sis.

511
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,550
I think we should go inside.

512
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,550
Good, good.

513
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,990
Come, what shall we do?

514
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,830
Find something cold to drink.

515
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,500
- But they're all cute, really wins my heart.
- Yes, Sis.

516
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,030
Awesome.

517
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,110
Shit!

518
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,790
What are you doing to my mother?!

519
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,990
Ai'Kui?!

520
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,550
I was just massaging your mother.

521
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,150
Yes, massage.

522
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,310
How did you know I'm here?

523
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,870
It's because you lied.

524
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,790
How can you think that
Maldives has a haunted pond?

525
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,670
It's because I knew you were
lying that I called your mother.

526
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,310
Is there anyone else knows?

527
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,790
How am I supposed to know?

528
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,670
If they did, so what?

529
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,710
It's because you
lied too much, right?

530
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,230
Alright, alright.

531
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,710
You come from afar,
you must miss each other.

532
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,350
By the way, have you
had something cold yet?

533
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,370
Not yet,
I'm starting to feel hungry.

534
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,870
Very good.

535
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,990
We ran out of food.

536
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,390
That's good,
then he won't have to eat.

537
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,990
What do you mean?

538
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,510
I'll have IG take you to
find something cold to eat.

539
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,710
There's a lot of food at
the temple fair near the alley.

540
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,310
Plenty of food.

541
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,470
Your massage are very good.

542
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,830
My back hurts, massage my back.

543
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,990
- Sure thing.
- Massage my back.

544
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,710
Hey, Mom.

545
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,430
What now, son?
You're interrupting my happy time.

546
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,430
What is it, son?

547
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,790
It'll fix my back.

548
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,070
No need, no need.

549
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,510
Just take me to find
something eat, I'm hungry.

550
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,550
Go, go, go

551
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,710
Sawasdee krub, Khun Mom.

552
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,790
It's all messed up, oh dear.

553
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,430
Let's go.

554
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,390
Kui.

555
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,710
Take a photo of me.

556
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,070
I really like this decorated lights.

557
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,990
Take out your phone
and take a picture of me.

558
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,660
Come, come, come.

559
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,310
Here it goes.

560
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,950
Let me see.
How's the picture?

561
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,320
Look.

562
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,230
One more time.

563
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,220
Come.

564
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,030
Isn't that Ai'Ruk?

565
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,550
Is that him?

566
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,550
Ai'Ruk!

567
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,270
Ai'Kui?

568
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,390
How are you here?

569
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,590
I'm here with IG.

570
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,390
Is your house nearby?

571
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,830
Yeah, it's within the vicinity.

572
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,430
Kui, this is Petch.

573
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,470
- Sawasdee krub.
- Sawasdee krub.

574
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,550
Sawasdee krub.

575
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,070
And..

576
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,270
I'm Noinae.

577
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,790
Sawasdee krub.

578
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,230
Sawasdee!

579
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,940
Ruk, I want to eat some dessert.

580
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,190
Take me to buy some.

581
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,510
Let's go.

582
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,550
Come, let's all go.

583
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,150
Wait, wait.

584
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,060
Ruk, give me your hand.

585
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,460
Thumb is used when...

586
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,260
you're angry at someone.

587
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,630
Index finger is used
when ordering someone.

588
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,550
The middle finger is
used to get into trouble.

589
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,890
As for the ring finger,
it is used to confess your love.

590
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,470
And pinky
finger is for reconciling.

591
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,910
As for all the five fingers...

592
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,020
I'm too shy to tell.

593
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,830
These five fingers
are used to hold hands...

594
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,390
Ruk?!

595
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,070
Where are you?!

596
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,550
Ruk, take me with you!

597
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,210
Over here, come quick.

598
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,460
Drink this.

599
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,190
Give chance to others too.

600
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,470
That's enough, over here quick.

601
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,710
Come and drink.

602
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,360
Oh, that's not it.

603
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,230
Are they cute?

604
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,750
Cute like me?

605
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,520
Am I cute?

606
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,190
Shit!

607
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,150
Ruk, I'm hungry.

608
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,030
Let's eat.

609
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,310
Why are you hungry now?

610
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,550
Let's feed these
goats some milk first.

611
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,110
Fine, I'm outta here.

612
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,790
Ruk.

613
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,550
I think they're already full.

614
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,510
Now..

615
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,150
I'm hungry.

616
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,270
Wanna go eat?

617
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,870
Wait, feed them first.

618
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,710
Let's go eat.

619
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,710
Look, it's hungry.

620
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,670
I'm really hungry.
Look, I'm all thin now.

621
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,630
Come, let's eat.

622
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,110
Let's get something to eat.

623
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,510
Where are they?

624
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,990
Exactly, I have no
idea where they are.

625
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,550
You play football with Ai'Ruk here?

626
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,840
What football team
do you support?

627
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,550
I'm just his neighbor.

628
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,310
I don't know how to play football.

629
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,790
I don't watch football either.

630
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,550
I don't like it.

631
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,230
How can Ai'Ruk doesn't notice...

632
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,790
that P'Noinae is into him?

633
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,520
How can you tell?

634
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,270
Look at her, all geeky
and glue to him like that.

635
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,230
It's obvious that she likes him.

636
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,390
It's probably nothing.

637
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,870
Because Ruk and P'Noinae knew
each other for a long time now.

638
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,750
You're saying that,
means you don't believe me.

639
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,670
Look.

640
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,670
That girl over there has been
staring at me for some time.

641
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,630
Excuse me,
can I scan your LINE?

642
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,150
Absolutely.

643
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,070
N'Fon, is it?

644
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,390
That's right.

645
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,510
I'll be seeing you later.

646
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,230
I'll contact you tonight.

647
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,870
Kha.

648
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,310
I got her number.

649
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,350
Freaking cool.

650
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,030
See? It's so easy.

651
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,550
That girl over there...

652
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,230
she's been looking
at you for some time now.

653
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,270
That one?

654
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,030
Try to do what I did.

655
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,630
Trust me.

656
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,110
- No.
- Try it.

657
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,700
- I don't want to.
- Hurry.

658
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,550
- Come and try it.
- No.

659
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,350
- Hurry, try it.
- No.

660
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,990
- Come on.
- I said no.

661
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,310
Just try it, trust me.

662
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,150
Go, quick. Trust me.

663
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,870
I said no!

664
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,830
Because I don't like girls!

665
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,350
I'm sorry.

666
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,110
Then, we should
get something to eat.

667
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,550
Let me have some.

668
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,550
I haven't eat it yet.

669
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,150
That's nice.

670
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,590
You're right

671
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,190
Damn, P'...

672
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,030
What are you doing, P'?

673
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,550
Just sitting.

674
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,230
Ai'Kaengsom!

675
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,830
Where's your Maldives?

676
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,910
What's wrong with your hair?

677
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,510
What was that about?

678
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,350
Your Maldives seems weird.

679
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,430
I'm not going to Maldives anymore,
I'm going to the beach now.

680
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,670
Come, let's head to the beach.

681
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,190
Let's go.

682
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,000
Don't be too attached with me, P'Noinae

683
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,070
Let me hug you a little before sees us later.

684
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,020
Someone might sees us.

685
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,950
Who's gonna see us at this moment?

686
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,790
Watch the way you fucking walk!

687
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,330
Watch the way you fucking walk!

688
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,910
You want some from me?!

689
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,790
Ruk!

690
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,440
Shut up!

691
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,750
You're Yingyod's son.

692
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,470
What's your problem?

693
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,150
What the fuck, bastard?!

694
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,550
- What?!
- Come on?!

695
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,910
What!

696
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,190
Calm down.

697
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,670
- What do you want?!
- Why?!

698
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,190
Do you want some?!

699
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,190
What's your problem?!

700
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,910
What are you doing?!

701
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,830
What are you doing to my friend?!

702
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,590
I didn't do anything!

703
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,990
I let you go this time.

704
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,550
Next time, you'll be sorry!

705
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,270
Let's get outta here.

706
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,390
No need for next time!

707
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,150
Ai'Tong!

708
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,590
Bastard.

709
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,550
That's enough!

710
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,310
Enough!

711
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,790
You're finished.

712
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,550
- Ai'Tong!
- Ai'Tong, that's enough!

713
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,830
Ai'Tong!

714
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,630
He has a weapon!

715
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,150
You bastard!

716
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,710
Kui!

717
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,750
Kui!

718
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,630
Kui!

719
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,990
Ai'Kui!

720
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,030
Fuck!

721
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,380
Ai'Kui!

722
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,990
Kui!

723
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,990
Are you alright?

724
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,190
Shit!

725
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,960
♫ Go to eat alone and traveling with no companion ♫

726
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,710
♫ Someone who has a girl and
not single will never understand ♫

727
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,710
♫ I have a smart phone but
can't use to express love ♫

728
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:36,870
♫ It's just expensive and
I'm really bored and lonely ♫

729
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,910
♫ I'm counting days out loud,
don't want to turn on my Facebook ♫

730
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:45,990
♫ Everywhere in it are couple photos,
it makes me more lonely ♫

731
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:50,030
♫ Someone loveless are seen
by the sky with no word ♫

732
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:56,070
♫ Who thinks as I do saying that
evening to morning are quiet ♫

733
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,550
♫ Please appear before me ♫

734
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:04,110
♫ If you are the right couple for me ♫
