and pulverize my heart ♫

16
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,810
Let's hurry up.

17
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,560
How are you?

18
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,400
P'....

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,080
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,570
It's all right

21
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,770
It's not your fault.

22
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,530
I've very
serious about it all the time.

23
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,330
Why does it
have to be this way?

24
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,890
What did Dad say?

25
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,610
Dad didn't say anything.

26
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,330
Don't think too much.

27
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,010
Dad will come visit tomorrow.

28
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,370
Seriously...

29
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,130
I think it's a coincidence.

30
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,970
We don't even know who hit him.

31
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,770
I think it was an accident.

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,970
I don't think so.

33
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,850
What are you guys talking about?

34
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,490
IG, do you know this guy?

35
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,690
Ai'Kui and I...

36
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,530
went to investigate...

37
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,050
and Ai'Choi,
a scallion chicken rice seller...

38
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,650
is the perpetrator.

39
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,850
Dad.

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,790
The police caught the
guy who hit-and-run Ruk.

41
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,840
The rider confessed
that he was hired by...

42
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,490
Tunwa.

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,890
Tunwa?

44
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,870
Tunwa probably on the run now.

45
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,370
That damn Tunwa.

46
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,000
How could you this to my son?!

47
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,450
Sawasdee krub, Uncle.

48
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,530
Why are you here?

49
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,890
Please let me visit him.

50
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,410
Give IG a chance, Dad.

51
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,090
At least, IG?
is better than Tunwa.

52
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,770
Please, Uncle.

53
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,790
Yeah, go ahead.

54
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,670
Thank you.

55
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,650
In that case...

56
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,170
please excuse me
to go to the police station.

57
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,290
Are you OK?

58
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,410
I can't play soccer anymore.

59
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,250
Listen to me.

60
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,010
No matter how you feel...

61
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,050
you may feel sad...

62
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,050
you may feel angry.

63
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,810
Maybe you feel
the world is unfair to you.

64
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,410
I want you to know...

65
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,370
I will be by your side forever.

66
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,690
Don't be afraid.

67
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,410
I am here.

68
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,610
I will not leave you.

69
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,050
I will be here.

70
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,970
Ruk.

71
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,960
Sawasdee krub, Uncle.

72
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,280
IG...

73
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,800
have a sit and talk to me.

74
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,720
IG.

75
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,480
If I directly from Ruk,
he probably won't tell me.

76
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,040
I'm gonna ask you straight.

77
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,880
What is your relationship with Ruk?

78
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,320
We..

79
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,120
We are dating

80
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,960
At first..

81
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,920
I thought...

82
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,360
if I hear a response like this...

83
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,560
I would be very mad.

84
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
But no.

85
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,960
When I hear this kind of response...

86
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,120
I feel so much relieved.

87
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,120
Relieved?

88
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,060
Yes.

89
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,560
You and Ruk...

90
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,000
love each other...

91
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,000
it makes me feel happy.

92
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,200
Most importantly...

93
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,000
it makes Ruk, my son...

94
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,400
smile.

95
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm old now.

96
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,920
and I still have many things to learn.

97
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,040
Look at Tunwa, for example.

98
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,000
I trusted and known him for 10 years.

99
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
and he can still do this thing to me.

100
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,320
This is what called know from
the outside but not on the inside.

101
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,600
I have to stop judging people from outside.

102
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,320
IG.

103
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,280
For all these while...

104
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm so sorry...

105
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,680
for not trying to understand you two.

106
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,320
There are no,
certainty in this world.

107
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,800
Especially love.

108
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,640
Thank you so much to you..

109
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,680
for my beloved son.

110
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,280
Don't mention it.

111
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,400
I promise...

112
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
I will forever take care of Ruk.

113
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
You can trust me on this.

114
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,200
Thank you.

115
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,380
When I'm free, I will go and apologize
to your grandmother and your mother.

116
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,080
Kao, thank you
for meeting me today.

117
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,800
At first, I didn't want to come. However, after
hearing your voice, it doesn't sound OK.

118
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
I'm sorry about
what happened that day.

119
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Sorry for shouting at you like that.

120
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,840
I didn't mean it.

121
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,640
I also...

122
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,840
want to apologize to you, Kim.

123
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,920
With everything that happened...

124
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,440
it's obvious.

125
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,720
you and Kao...

126
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,280
looks very suitable.

127
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,200
More than I was
when I was dating Fangkao.

128
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,600
Honestly...

129
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,200
I should be the
one apologizing to you.

130
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,640
I took away your girlfriend...

131
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
and...

132
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
troubling you.

133
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,540
To be honest, whatever
I do didn't feel right.

134
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,120
You really did wrong.

135
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,600
You took away my girlfriend.

136
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,480
But...

137
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,520
honestly...

138
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Fangkao and I doesn't
love each other anymore.

139
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,920
It's good that it end this way.

140
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,040
Stop worrying about it.

141
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
If I find out that
you have someone else...

142
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,400
you'll be sorry.

143
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,280
Rest assured.

144
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,840
I only love Fangkao here.

145
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,640
I love her for so long too.

146
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,800
Wait.

147
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,320
Since when did you change
from her boyfriend to her father?

148
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,320
Yeah, she is my ex-girlfriend.

149
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,520
My girlfriend.

150
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,640
Dad had to hurry
because of his elections matter.

151
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,720
And I have to back to teach at school.

152
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,360
Can you stay on your own?

153
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,390
Yes.

154
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,000
Don't think too much. It's in the past.

155
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Take care of yourself.

156
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,520
OK?

157
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,760
Sawasdee krub, Mr. Tunwa.

158
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
You've been disappearing.

159
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,720
Where are you going?
It's time to pay your monthly debt.

160
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,070
I'm not gonna let you go.

161
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,090
I got it!

162
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,640
Stand still.

163
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Let's go.

164
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,880
Cheers!

165
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,680
IG, we never thought that...

166
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,640
you could make the reputation of our
Chatreemit school to be once again famous.

167
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,120
Because I have a good teacher.

168
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
If you put your mind
into it, you can do it.

169
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,840
A man from a famous school...

170
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,000
was beaten up by his creditor
and was rushed to the hospital.

171
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,600
The police accused him of fraud.

172
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,720
This is news about P'Tunwa.

173
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,320
In the end, someone
committed got his punishment.

174
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,000
But that's how it should be...

175
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,160
for a guy like him.

176
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,120
Next time, we have to be
more "stick" to our work.

177
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,020
Focus! (seutid)

178
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,360
You're such a...

179
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,720
P'IG.

180
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,520
This semester break,
we're going to Nong Saeng again.

181
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,100
We're going to do merits.

182
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,680
Really?

183
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Let's go then.

184
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,960
We'll let IG sing...

185
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,920
and you guys
will dance the votive.

186
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
I probably won't go
back this semester break.

187
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,040
Why?

188
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,770
I have to record
a song with Thaithep.

189
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,760
You're not
going to sing at Saengsin?

190
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,600
I've signed the contract and may
have to stay here for a long time.

191
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,280
I may not return
to the village at all.

192
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,320
Relax, it's not like we can't
dance with IG not coming.

193
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,800
Ai'Ruk can handle the venue.

194
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,720
You guys just have to get
ready with the appropriate attire.

195
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,500
I'll do the recording and
"chare" it with you guys.

196
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,240
It's "share"!

197
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Yes, yes. Share it is.

198
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,360
This semester break, I'll...

199
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,920
Hello, what's up?

200
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Hello, Ruk.

201
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,600
It's so happen that the province
club increase their selection number.

202
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,680
And they want you to go for
the selection after your legs recover.

203
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,040
Really?!

204
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,560
Will you return to
the village for semester break?ป

205
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,560
Well, um...

206
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,880
Sure, sure.

207
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,920
See you later.

208
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,200
Who called? Looks like a good news.

209
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,800
My brother called and told me...

210
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,060
that the Country Province Football Association
asked me to participate in their selection.

211
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,500
- Damn
- Is that true?

212
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,560
Yes!

213
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,280
Let's cheers.

214
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,520
Let's cheers.

215
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,920
Then that means, you will come
and help us with the merits thing.

216
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
Yeah.

217
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,840
I think this semester
break will be special.

218
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,320
I think so too.

219
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,800
Have you made your decision...

220
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,800
about moving out of Saengsin?

221
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
If you got selected by the association...

222
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,600
that means you...

223
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,680
will have to stay at Saengsin forever.

224
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,480
Probably.

225
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,280
I live in Bangkok.

226
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,520
You live in Nong Saeng.

227
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,040
It's such a sky
apart relationship here.

228
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,120
You talk like it's
life and death apart.

229
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,280
We just leave for a
while to pursue our dreams

230
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
For us to meet again.

231
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,800
You promised me, didn't you?

232
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,400
That we won't
leave each other again.

233
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,990
P'Ruk.

234
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,590
Do you really have to go

235
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,430
I can't breathe.

236
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,150
Don't you pity me?

237
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,150
I have to go.

238
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,510
Look.

239
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,890
Looks so pathetic.

240
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,110
You mean me?

241
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,430
I mean me!

242
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,470
Let me go.

243
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,150
I really have to go.

244
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,670
Take good care of yourself...

245
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,390
and focus on your studies.

246
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,450
Understand, troublemaker?

247
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,670
Good.

248
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,830
LINE text me if you miss me.

249
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm gonna go now.

250
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,550
Stop crying.

251
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,920
It's not like I'm gonna die.

252
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,470
Thank you.

253
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,390
Sawasdee kha, my name is
Khet from Thaithep recording company.

254
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,350
Yes.

255
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,030
Do you any agent yet?

256
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,790
Not yet.

257
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,190
Are you interested in making
music with our company?

258
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,230
Yes, I am.

259
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,150
I'm very interested.

260
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:16,310
♪ Are you really single
and not just being lonely? ♪

261
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,470
♪ Not just because you had a fight with her ♪

262
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,470
♪ So you came to tell about your loneliness ♪

263
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,110
♪ Are you really single or pretending....♪

264
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,790
You sing it wrong.

265
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,020
How can it not be right?

266
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,150
It's wrong for real.

267
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,150
I told you, you always argue.

268
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,350
You think that you're teacher,
you do everything right?

269
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,470
Yes.

270
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,910
Yes.

271
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,470
Everything.

272
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,150
But not because I'm a teacher.

273
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,190
What then?

274
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,070
Because I'm your boyfriend.

275
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,750
Because I'm your boyfriend.

276
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,580
You suddenly became deaf?

277
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,670
You treat the fact of
being frank as if it's a big deal.

278
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,590
Don't be so loud.

279
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,950
You'll wake up the forest
guardian and the mountain guardian.

280
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,590
So annoying,
it's stinks of sweetness here.

281
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,060
Grateen, Grandma wants
you to come. The host is here.

282
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,830
Let's go.

283
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,290
I'll go now.

284
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,910
It's quite good to have love.

285
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,310
P'.

286
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,550
Ruk.

287
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,310
When did you arrive?

288
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,710
Just now.

289
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,790
Really?

290
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,950
See you later, I'm leaving.

291
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,670
Wait.

292
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,270
Are you...

293
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,190
still mad at me about that day?

294
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,270
If you know...

295
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,310
that I was the one who sent the photo
of you and IG kissing to Uncle Yingyod...

296
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,310
will you still
want to talk to me?

297
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,030
I'm sorry.

298
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,190
I was hoping for it
too much on my own.

299
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,710
Didn't think
what I was holding.

300
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,390
It's alright.

301
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,990
It's in the past now.

302
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,430
Just let it be in the past.

303
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,790
We can start anew.

304
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,070
Really?

305
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,150
Yes.

306
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,430
Thank you.

307
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,660
P', what are you doing?

308
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,710
I was talking to Ruk.

309
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,910
What talking?

310
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,430
I clearly saw you hug him.

311
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,970
You are a woman.

312
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,070
Holding a guy 3 to 5 times
like this, is that appropriate?

313
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,310
What's his problem?

314
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,350
Or are you two in
some kind of relationship?

315
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,390
Ai'Tong, are you crazy?

316
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,430
Me and P'Noinae
is not in a relationship.

317
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,350
Yes, true.

318
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,620
Just a hug,
that's normal. Nothing...

319
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,120
Stop talking!

320
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,550
If you really are not in relationship...

321
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,790
then...

322
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,270
can I have your number, P'Noinae?

323
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,390
Something suspicious?

324
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,560
Not here.

325
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,920
If no then...

326
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,150
can you give me your number?

327
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,270
What's his problem?

328
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,590
Give it to him.

329
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,150
Please.

330
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,160
Can you give N'Tong your number?

331
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,430
If you don't give it,
you're suspicious.

332
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,350
I'm happy for you.

333
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,470
Good luck, Brother in love.

334
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,150
Since there's no one here now...

335
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,670
how will you go home?

336
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,190
No nee to be a busybody.

337
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,310
Let's go for a stroll.

338
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,140
I thought you weren't coming back.

339
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,740
At first, I didn't think about coming.

340
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,580
But I don't know why...

341
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,780
I can't get rid of
my longing to this place.

342
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,700
I probably can't control my feelings...

343
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,140
like you once told me.

344
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,300
IG.

345
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Thank you so much...

346
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,900
for not leaving me.

347
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,980
Thank you too.

348
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,140
What is this?

349
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,340
What are you doing?

350
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,180
Wait.

351
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,980
What are you gonna
do wearing that life vest?

352
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,260
For playing golf perharps.

353
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,060
Move, we're gonna
jump into the water.

354
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,140
Shit.

355
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,300
Katty.

356
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,580
What is it, P'?

357
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,260
You're not going into the water?

358
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,940
No, I'm afraid of fried fish.

359
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,700
Fish bite!

360
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,860
The fish at your house is good for frying.

361
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,860
It's the same thing.

362
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,180
Yeah, yeah.

363
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,930
What are you guys doing?

364
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,180
We're watching our friends swimming.

365
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,620
Come up! Come up!

366
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,420
- Come up, come up!
- Come up quick!

367
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,560
- Tong, come up quick!
-Hurry!

368
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,700
P', what's there in the water?

369
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,220
There are leeches!

370
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,820
Shit!

371
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,140
Come up!

372
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,980
Why didn't you tell
them there are leech in there!

373
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,140
I forgot!

374
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,060
Come up!
