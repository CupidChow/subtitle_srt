16
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,050
How are you feeling?

17
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,850
Mr. Superhero.

18
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,050
You're lucky, Kui.

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,010
Good that you're not
wounded more severe than this.

20
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,050
This little injury won't kill me.

21
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,330
Such a big talker.

22
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,730
Khun Kui...

23
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,830
Khun Kui...

24
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,300
are you're all right?

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,490
My friend here is crying river.

26
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,730
It's not like Ai'Kui is dead or anything.

27
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,770
Th... Thank you so much.

28
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,770
It was my fault.

29
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,530
I wasn't taking care of myself.

30
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,010
It's not really your fault.

31
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,010
Are you nuts?

32
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,610
He's crying

33
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,530
Move.

34
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,170
Don't get in my way.

35
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,050
Anyway, I have to thank you.

36
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,090
If there's anything you need my help with...

37
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,850
you can let me know.

38
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,530
Are you OK?

39
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,610
If you're really feeling guilty, then...

40
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,970
can you give me a massage?

41
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,530
Of course.

42
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,330
Thank you so much, Khun Kui.

43
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,170
If there's anything you need my help with...

44
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,810
you can let me know.

45
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,290
Hello Nae.

46
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,290
Do you want me to pick you up?

47
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,250
Yes, come and pick me up.

48
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,970
Sure, sure.

49
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,610
No need.

50
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,490
I'll give you a ride home.

51
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,930
Alright.

52
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,610
Your father's calling.

53
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,170
Hello, Dad.

54
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,250
Where are you?

55
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,050
At Grandma Yoi's house.

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,730
I've asked P'Tunwa to pick you up.

57
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,090
Hurry back.

58
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,730
Dad, Dad!

59
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,230
Dad!

60
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,210
Ruk, then I'l...

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,890
I'll go home by myself.

62
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,690
Take care of Kui.

63
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,330
I'm going home now, Petch.

64
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,210
Ai'Kui, I'm leaving.

65
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,490
See you.

66
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,050
Are you hurt?

67
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,650
No, just tickle.

68
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,290
Keep massaging.

69
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,050
Kui...

70
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,050
-What?
- Get out.

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,570
Get... Get out!

72
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,610
Is there something wrong?

73
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,050
Nothing.

74
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,250
Too much dust.

75
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,090
Should I get some water?

76
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,170
That won't be necessary.

77
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,890
Keep massaging.

78
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,010
Are you sure you don't
want a glass of water?

79
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,290
That's alright.

80
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,050
How do you know I'm here?

81
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,740
Your father told me.

82
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,690
S0....

83
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,690
Have you been back from Bangkok long?

84
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,570
Some time already.

85
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,890
I brought your friends here for photoshoot.

86
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,890
The God Guys Gang.

87
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,050
Such a small world.

88
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,090
Never thought of seeing them here.

89
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,890
By the way...

90
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,770
I heard that you...

91
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,050
pretend to date IG, is that true?

92
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,420
So why did you come home together?

93
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,860
He's Grandma Yoi's grandson.

94
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,330
The owner of Saengsin car parade.

95
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,250
What a coincidence.

96
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,370
If IG's fanclub know that he's Isaan...

97
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,760
they'll be all confused
like rooster lose its eye.

98
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,410
IG...

99
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,870
doesn't want anyone to know that he's

100
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,250
He's obsessed with his image.

101
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,960
You sure knows a lot about IG.

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,540
P'....

103
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,490
me and him are not real boyfriends.

104
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,610
Can you promise me...

105
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,210
that you won't tell this to my father?

106
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,210
You don't have to worry.

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,600
I won't tell anyone about this.

108
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,980
Thank you so much.

109
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,810
If I don't have you,
I might not be able to survive.

110
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,890
Come, I think we should go home now...

111
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,770
or your father will be worried.

112
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,820
Sure, P'. Let's go.

113
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,050
Here.

114
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,970
Thanks.

115
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,850
Lately, you haven't
mention much about Fangkao.

116
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,650
Or your method of pretending t
o be Ruk's boyfriend works?

117
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,050
I guess so.

118
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,890
Mes.

119
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,690
I think I'm gonna stop being a youtuber.

120
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,170
What do you think?

121
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,050
You're just all talk.

122
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,570
If you don't do it,
what else are you going to do?

123
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,050
I just don't feel like doing
anything for the time being.

124
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,370
I don't even want to
talk about going to school.

125
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,250
But I don't know what to do.

126
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,530
You're feeling too
overwork or you're bored of it?

127
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,850
It's actually a good thing
because you've tried many things.

128
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,330
But I don't see you stick to any of them.

129
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,040
Are you really going to
keep changing things like this?

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,130
It's not the right thing for me.

131
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,410
Not right...

132
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,370
or you can't hold on to it?

133
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,250
You always refuses to persist like this.

134
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,290
How can you really
be interested in something?

135
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,370
Hello, Mom.

136
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,290
Aunty.

137
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,210
Where is that Bangkok football player?

138
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,690
Who do you mean?

139
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,500
That guy...

140
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,770
Move!

141
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,850
All the gangs are here.

142
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,930
Not you.

143
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,450
Then who?!

144
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,490
That Yingyod's son!

145
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,690
If you're looking for Yingyod's son...

146
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,450
then go look for him at Yingyod's house!

147
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,410
Why are you here?!

148
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,970
I don't care.

149
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,010
Your son is that guy's friend!

150
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,530
Whatever you do, you have
to be responsible for it together.

151
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,890
What do you want?!

152
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,130
What?!

153
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,090
Hold on!

154
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,050
What are you gonna do to my son?!

155
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,290
Why are you interfering?

156
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,490
He's my son!

157
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,490
Hey, wait, wait!

158
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,250
Finally, here you are!

159
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,930
What are you gonna do?

160
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,290
Why?!

161
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,330
I think you should calm down.

162
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,630
Otherwise, things will get worsen.

163
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,690
Who are you...

164
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,170
dare you preach us?

165
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,730
Your friend caused
my friend to get arrested!

166
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,090
Are you sure...

167
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,370
that my brothers started this?

168
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,710
If you ask people
who're present at the scene...

169
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,050
maybe...

170
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,490
the person who should be in jail...

171
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,530
might not be just your friend.

172
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,330
I think we should end this here.

173
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,290
Do you know...

174
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,050
trespassing into
someone else' house like this...

175
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,410
it violated article 364 of the Criminal Law.

176
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,650
You can get imprison for 1 year...

177
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,730
or a fine of 20,000 baht.

178
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,370
Or both imprisonment and fine.

179
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,010
Do you wanna try?

180
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,450
Come on, do you wanna try?

181
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,650
Do you want that?

182
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,170
What?

183
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,570
If you don't leave, I'll shoot!

184
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,530
She has a gun.

185
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,930
I'll let you go for now.

186
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,210
Next time, you'll be sorry.

187
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,890
Remember!

188
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,930
You're awesome.

189
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,410
What's up, Mr. Lawyer?

190
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,530
The future lawyer is here.

191
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,170
Mom.

192
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,090
- Mom.
- What is it?

193
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,090
Stand here, Mom.

194
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,650
Ai'Ruk, how are you here?

195
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,530
Ai'Kui told me about this.

196
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,930
I called him.

197
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,090
I got you a watermelon.

198
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,690
Thank you for visiting me.

199
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,090
What makes you think
of giving me a watermelon?

200
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,370
It's sweet.

201
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,080
You should try it.

202
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,370
Is it as sweet as the
one who gave it to me?

203
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,770
Have a sit.

204
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,570
Is there anything?

205
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,730
Are you usually
a less talkative person?

206
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,130
Well, no.

207
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,410
But, I don't know what to talk about.

208
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,890
What's wrong, Kui?

209
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,370
My arm and my wound hurts.

210
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,930
It's sore all over.

211
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,050
I'm thirsty too.

212
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,130
Can you feed me?

213
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,210
Sure, sure.

214
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,330
What are you doing?
It's all messy now.

215
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,090
Sorry.

216
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,130
Wipe it for me.

217
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,730
It's messy.

218
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,370
Be gentle.

219
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,570
Sorry.

220
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,810
Wipe here.

221
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,330
Of course.

222
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,890
Here.

223
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,010
Are you alright?

224
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,450
Why are your heart beating so fast?

225
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,330
Do you have a heart disease?

226
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,490
No.

227
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,090
I'm gonna go home now.

228
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,290
Dude.

229
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,890
Do you want to go see
the boys photoshoot today?

230
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,930
Who is this?

231
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,090
IG.

232
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,570
Is Ruk there?

233
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,690
He's not here.

234
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,970
He went to the
market and forgot his phone.

235
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,210
Is there anything you want?

236
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,530
Never mind.

237
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,490
Please tell him to
call me when he get back.

238
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,210
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Dad

240
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,850
Did anyone called me?

241
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,250
No.

242
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,610
That's good pictures.

243
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,250
Very beautiful.

244
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,770
This one looks handsome.

245
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,930
- So handsome.
- True.

246
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,330
Mes, Katty.

247
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,570
How's it going?

248
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,930
P'IG.

249
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,650
You guys dressed up handsomely.

250
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,010
Of course, it's a cowboy costume, right?

251
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,130
- Shit.
- A cowboy.

252
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,890
Those pictures are nice.

253
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,040
Sawasdee krub.

254
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,250
Sawasdee ja.

255
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,650
N'IG!

256
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,710
You're so handsome in person!

257
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,090
So cute.

258
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,330
Thank you.

259
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,450
I'm gonna take some photos at the back.

260
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,650
Yeah, OK.

261
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,970
Say goodbye to my viewers.

262
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,410
Bye, see you.

263
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,930
So cute.

264
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,290
I think we should do more.

265
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,490
Let's go.

266
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,330
Tunwa, the price that we discussed...

267
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,400
does it include IG's promotion fee?

268
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,010
N'IG only came here with his friends.

269
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,010
The price that I
charged you in the beginning...

270
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,970
doesn't include N'IG.

271
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,370
If we include N'IG, I think...

272
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,490
the price might be higher.

273
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,250
That's unfortunate.

274
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,090
But he seems to be very
passionate about photo shooting.

275
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,370
Yes.

276
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,170
Do you want tell him that
he's not allow to take videos here?

277
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,710
No, no.

278
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,890
No, no.

279
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,370
He can do it.

280
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,130
Because N'IG is a
very hot person right now.

281
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,210
He has a lot of followers.

282
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,570
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

283
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,010
In that case, can you
talk to him for me about his fee?

284
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,930
See how much he wants.

285
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,650
Absolutely.

286
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,130
In that case,
you wait here for a moment.

287
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,690
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

288
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,370
Very good.

289
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,730
Sawasdee to all IG-an.

290
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,730
This is IG, your usual great guy.

291
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,690
Today, I'm taking you guys to a horse farm.

292
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,570
No need to tell you that
because I'm standing in front of a horse.

293
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,330
Where did you get your hair done?

294
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,330
Which barbershop, can you tell me?

295
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,130
Your hair style...

296
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,490
IG.

297
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,490
It's...

298
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,930
What are your relationship with Ruk?

299
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,610
What?

300
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,730
I ask, what is your realtionship with Ruk?

301
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,530
Why?

302
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,210
Whatever I am to him...

303
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,210
has nothing to do with you.

304
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,770
Don't tell me you guys are dating.

305
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,610
But Ruk himself told me...

306
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,530
that you're not dating for real.

307
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,410
Do you even have rights to question me?

308
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,690
Even if there's
something between me and Ruk...

309
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,930
it has nothing to do with you.

310
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,290
The person he doesn't love...

311
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,690
has no right to be jealous.

312
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,770
I almost forgot.

313
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,490
The clip that you've taken...

314
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,490
Sis wants to ask you to help her promote.

315
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,130
How much your price is, just tell me.

316
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,570
But...

317
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,530
don't think about charging the price too high.

318
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,610
It's free, I'm rich.

319
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,210
OK, deal.

320
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,250
Since you're already here,
when you done recording...

321
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,290
help me to give the horse a bath.

322
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,520
Sis, I've talked with N'IG.

323
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,800
IG offers his price at 100,000.

324
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,080
100,000?!

325
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,120
That's it?

326
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
If you don't mind...

327
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
about those money for the kids...

328
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,200
you can give it to me.

329
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Because we're already close.

330
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,920
Of course.

331
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,800
The money is no issue.

332
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,760
I'll transfer it.

333
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,840
Alright, Sis.

334
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,360
Thank you so much
for taking care of the kids.

335
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,880
Yes.

336
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,120
I'll give you a signal...

337
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,720
and you'll execute it, Tong.

338
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
Consider it done, P'.

339
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,520
He won't scold us, right?

340
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,720
The hell he will.

341
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,880
His very gentlemen, unlike you, Ai'Rang...

342
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,240
you're petty.

343
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,150
If we fail...

344
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
it will be over.

345
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,320
Are you ready, Kaengsom?

346
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm ready since I was born.

347
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,680
Call P'Tunwa.

348
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,360
It will be done.

349
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,440
Kaengsom.

350
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,160
Sawasdee krub, P'Tunwa.

351
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,440
What is it? I'm busy.

352
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,200
Umm, here he is, everyone.

353
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,320
Our great hero who
sponsor our cheer event this time.

354
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,920
- Without him...
- Is that a live broadcast?

355
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,840
Yes, P'

356
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,880
No, no. Don't do it.

357
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,160
Wait, don't rush.

358
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,120
- No, no need for this.
- P', it will only take a while.

359
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,080
Why do you want to go back?

360
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,310
Let's ride a horse, have you ever ride one?

361
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,920
I have to leave now.

362
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,000
Just for a moment.

363
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,920
Drop it, drop it!

364
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,440
P'Tunwa!

365
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,320
Shit!

366
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,440
Shit.

367
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,800
Ai'Kaengsom, what the hell?

368
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,880
What the fuck are you playing?!

369
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
I said don't record it!

370
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,680
Put your phone away!

371
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,700
Shit, what now?

372
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,080
He is so scary.

373
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Shit.

374
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Shit, what the hell?

375
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,280
Oh shit.

376
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
What now?

377
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
You said he won't get mad.

378
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,110
I think I'm gonna wet my pants.

379
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,600
That yourdon't call angry?

380
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,520
It's all your fault, Ai'Tong. Damn.

381
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,080
I missed.

382
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
Look at my hair here!

383
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,920
Yes, I've bought it. It's the
beautiful mango you want to eat.

384
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
I bought it, I'm on my way home now.

385
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,360
See you soon, Dad, OK.

386
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,520
Petch.

387
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,280
Do you have anything to eat today?

388
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,320
I bought this.

389
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,880
Looks appetizing.

390
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,440
Thank you.

391
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,280
What are you guys doing here?

392
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,080
Nothing.

393
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,090
I was just on my way home.

394
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,960
Where's Ai'Ruk?

395
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,120
He's at home.

396
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,400
He's inviting P'Tunwa
for dinner at his house.

397
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,160
I'm planning to join.

398
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I'll come too.

399
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,320
Sure thing.

400
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,680
Wait, you can't go.

401
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,040
Why?

402
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,360
Who's gonna feed me the mango?

403
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,600
Stop!

404
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,160
You guys settle
about your mangoes here.

405
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,280
You'll be coming with me.

406
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,160
- So, so...
- Hurry, I'm hungry.

407
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,720
He...

408
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,640
Grateen, what are you playing?

409
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,920
Someone might see us.

410
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,480
People might see us hugging...

411
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,080
but they don't know what it means.

412
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,400
Keep it down.

413
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,280
When will I get to call you
my boyfriend out loud?

414
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,760
We have to always hide whenever we go.

415
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
It's not the moment yet.

416
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,400

You two!

478
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,030
Noinae!

479
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,710
How are you here?

480
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,270
My house is here.

481
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,750
Why are you two here?

482
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,310
I saw it earlier.

483
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,790
You two...

484
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,270
were kissing each other.

485
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,870
Kissing like that, aren't you
afraid you might get a thunder strike?

486
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,470
Please don't tell this to anyone.

487
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,230
If my father knows,
we'll be dead for sure.

488
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,190
But...

489
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,510
No buts, Noinae.

490
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,510
Don't you pity us?

491
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,150
But...

492
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,630
Please, don't tell anyone!

493
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,070
Don't tell anyone.

494
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,070
I've already known
about this for a long time!

495
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,390
You guys weren't slick enough,
should go to school again.

496
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,270
Always got caught.

497
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,270
Ever since that story about the haunted pond.

498
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,070
Do you think I'm afraid of ghost?

499
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,670
You're going on a date at that place, right?

500
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,670
I'm sorry that I'm not afraid of ghost.

501
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,590
So I saw the secret truth
of you two since last year.

502
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,990
Does anyone else knows aside from you?

503
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,710
Ruk.

504
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,270
Ruk know...

505
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,550
but he doesn't want
you to know that he knows.

506
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,070
Come now, don't be stressful.

507
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,720
What a relived.

508
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,150
I won't tell anyone.

509
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,710
I've been keeping this secret for a year now.

510
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,430
But, next time...

511
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,550
be more careful.

512
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,070
If so happen that someone
who's not me saw you...

513
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,810
it'll be a disaster.

514
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,990
Nukrop.

515
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,710
Don't kiss Grateen too often.

516
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,190
He might get pregnant.

517
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,070
Don't be ridiculous.

518
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,510
Nukrop, switch places with Ruk,
I can't see clearly.

519
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,870
How's that be any different?

520
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,630
I don't know.

521
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,870
Nukrop, you...

522
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,510
come and sit next to me.

523
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,870
Sit next to me.

524
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,390
I can't see very clear.

525
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,110
You sit over there.

526
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,870
My eyes are not very good.

527
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,550
Then let's dig in.

528
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,070
Yes, go ahead.

529
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,470
Ruk, get the chicken.

530
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,710
Yes.

531
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,470
Give it to Tunwa.

532
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,240
Very good.

533
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,350
Tunwa, next time bring
your father along to see us.

534
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,550
Lately, it's not very
convenient for him because...

535
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,550
there's been too much work at the factory.

536
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,350
He's a big time boss. No free times.

537
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,350
Especially now, that he live in a
different district, it's hard to contact.

538
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,550
Whenever he's free, bring him along.

539
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,860
Do you remember,
Ruk when he was a kid...

540
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,630
crying to watch football everyday.

541
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,590
Remember?

542
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,430
In his 8th grade, he cried
wanting to watch football at your house

543
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,070
That was during his 9th grade, Uncle.

544
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,790
Grade 9?

545
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,070
Grade 8 or 9, he was so small back then.

546
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,260
Dad.

547
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,790
You're a funny guy, Uncle.

548
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,670
How's your study now? Hard?

549
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,470
I will graduate in another 2 years, but...

550
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,990
I want to graduate in 3 and a half years time.

551
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,470
There's work and there's study.
It's been rough.

552
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,910
Awesome.

553
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,590
Graduate in 3 and a half years time.
Work and study at the same time.

554
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,590
You're great.

555
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,950
Ruk, remember to take
him as an example. Understand?

556
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,350
He's great.

557
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,270
It's good to work while studying.

558
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,790
I almost don't have enough time.

559
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,350
Right now, I'm doing a Youtube business.

560
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,470
What Youtube?

561
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,870
Youtube channel.

562
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,710
Youtube...

563
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,950
it's just you taking video then spread it out.

564
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,310
That's so simple!

565
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,830
You wanna talk about something
like that? That's just too simple.

566
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,350
All you need for
Youtube is just taking video.

567
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,830
Yeah, that's true, IG.

568
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,070
So, when did you study?

569
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,310
Unless you already stop studying.

570
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,510
I didn't study before.

571
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,270
I stop school for 2 years,
but now I came back to school.

572
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,630
I'm in grade 12 now.

573
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,310
I'm allocating my times as best I can.

574
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,670
Grade 12, grade 12...

575
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,870
Nukrop, you don't have to
stress about your study anymore.

576
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,270
You can just graduate in another 5 years.

577
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,550
Because...

578
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,850
that guy will graduate much slower than you.

579
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,030
- Dad.
- Dad.

580
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,390
You should be like this guys,
he'll graduate in 3 and half years time.

581
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,190
He's great.
See, be like Tunwa.

582
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,550
December(Tunwa), January,
February and April!

583
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,190
He's very good.

584
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,070
Eat.

585
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,630
Of course he is.

586
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,840
Of course he is.

587
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,910
Studying and working and graduate
in 3 and half years. Awesome!

588
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,030
Eat, eat.

589
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,550
That's how you do it.

590
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,960
Come, let's eat.

591
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,510
Eat up.

592
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,550
I'm sorry.

593
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,830
I have to go home now.

594
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,070
My grandma and mom will be worried.

595
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,230
Yeah, yeah. Hurry, hurry.

596
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,310
Go to your grandmother.

597
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,750
So your mother and
grandmother will feel ease. Go, go.

598
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,430
Thank you for today.

599
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,190
Hurry to her, your grandmother
might be coughing sick.

600
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,510
Ruk!

601
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,310
Have some manners. We have guest, sit.

602
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,870
Hey, close the door!

603
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:58,870
Dad!

604
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,790
The door was opened,
when people leave, they have to close it.

605
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,070
That's normal.

606
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,070
Eat, eat.

607
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,790
Very delicious.

608
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,700
The papaya salad is good.

609
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,150
Yes.

610
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,910
I heard that you bring students from
Ruk's school here for photoshoot.

611
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,590
Yes, well...

612
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,430
I was looking for a sponsor
for them for their cheer event.

613
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,910
You look for sponsor,
that means you got some commission.

614
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,390
How much? Can you tell me?

615
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,590
I did it for them for free.

616
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,310
Do it for free?! That's awesome.

617
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,910
As for the money...

618
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,950
I let the boys handle all of it themselves.

619
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,750
You're even generous, to boot!

620
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,990
I don't want to get involve in that matter.

621
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,380
This is a good example.

622
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,150
Can I have a consult?

623
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,190
If I want to build a temple...

624
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,350
can you help me find some funding?

625
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,750
Where do you want to build this temple?

626
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,390
At Manchester.

627
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,670
You're funny.

628
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,510
Awesome.

629
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,750
I'm gonna build a temple.

630
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,590
Take him as an example.

631
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,630
Ruk, take him as an example.
He's good in his work.

632
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,430
Very good.

633
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,870
Fuck you, Tunwa.

634
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,550
Will Ai'Mes knows?

635
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,710
Where's my phone?

636
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,070
Hello, Mes.

637
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,190
Hello.

638
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,110
Can I ask you something?

639
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,830
Where did you get
P'Tunwa's contact number?

640
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,790
We asked from Ai'Kaengsom.

641
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,550
I don't know where he got it.

642
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,710
I'm just curious.

643
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,070
Why?

644
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,910
Ai'Kaengsom already asleep.

645
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,310
I'll ask him for you tomorrow.

646
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,310
Um, OK.

647
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,070
If I'm OK, why would I go home?

648
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,510
Mom, if we don't implement
changes, we'll die for sure.

649
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,630
As you can see clearly from the account...

650
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,390
there's only expenses
and our income insufficient.

651
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,830
Why need changes?
The antique is doing good enough.

652
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,150
Grateen's song is very famous and it sells.

653
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,790
But there's only Grateen's song here!

654
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,910
Are we going to make a
living with this song all the time?

655
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,070
Yes.

656
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,390
Why are you interfering with my business?

657
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,860
It's my band!

658
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,150
If it's going to die, it'll die with me.

659
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,470
That's what you always said.

660
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,270
Mom, Grandma.

661
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,110
If there's any problem,
just let it die with me.

662
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,270
You're not listening, Mom.

663
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,070
Enough, Kaewtah. Don't interfere,
I'm having a headache.

664
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,270
I want to-go-to bed.

665
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,430
Mom

666
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,830
You're not talking to me,
so how is this going to settle?

667
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,470
It's finished, I'm-outta here.

668
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,670
I'm gonna head to bed.

669
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,730
IG, go to.bed.

670
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,230
You never listen as always.

671
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,350
Kaewtah

672
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,470
You talk too much that I got a headache.

673
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,990
Mom.

674
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,350
I'm looking for a reason, talk to me.

675
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,430
I better go to bed.

676
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,110
What's going on?

677
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,870
♫ Just you coming here makes my heart melt ♫

678
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:32,030
♫ It melts, melts that I want to swallow you whole ♫

679
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,910
♫ You didn't come with anyone else, right? ♫

680
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,550

683
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,350
♫ I don't have what others do ♫

684
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,830

694
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,230
♫ There is famine, not enough money to spend ♫

695
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,630
♫ Are you looking at me
from the outside or the inside? ♫
