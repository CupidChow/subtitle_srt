16
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,130
How dare you create a problem with P'IG?

17
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,450
You scum!

18
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,850
Ai'Kaengsom!

19
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,730
What the hell are you doing?!

20
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,110
I'm sorry, P'.

21
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,170
You're too into things again.

22
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,000
So, what's your
relationship with P'Tunwa?

23
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,410
No matter how many
times you asked me...

24
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,450
the answer will remains the same.

25
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,170
He and I are just brothers.

26
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,330
If you wondering about the kiss....

27
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,050
I can only tell that I
wasn't intended to do it.

28
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,530
Are you going to prove...

29
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,210
that you and him
have no relationship?

30
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,250
Absolutely.

31
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,690
What do you want me to prove.

32
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,050
I'll do them all.

33
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,890
Do you know...

34
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,130
that P'Tunwa is in a gambling debt.

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,330
I only known about it a few days ago.

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,210
My brother called and told me...

37
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,890
that he has a gambling debt.

38
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,370
He tricked all of his family's money.

39
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,850
And now he came to
trick people at Bangkok.

40
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,130
Don't tell me that you guys...

41
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,370
Yes!

42
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,290
He took all of our money.

43
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,650
Shit.

44
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,650
Do you want me
to help with anything?

45
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,050
Give me your phone.

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,610
Go, Ai'Tong.

47
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,170
Give me your phone.

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,890
Here you go.

49
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,090
Let me see.

50
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,610
Right now...

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,490
I have AI'Tunwa's address.

52
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,250
What you have to do is...

53
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,450
trick him...

54
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,840
to meet us.

55
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,410
Then, we...

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,810
will take care of the rest.

57
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,810
Ai'Tong, give it back to him.

58
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,170
Call him.

59
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,290
I won't.

60
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,410
Why?!

61
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,330
You said you wanted to help us?!

62
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,330
It's because you two
are in a relationship, right?!

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,410
I have my own way.

64
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,170
What are you doubting me about?

65
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,010
Give me P'Tunwa's address!

66
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,840
Ai'Kaengsom, is it really here?

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,850
Yes, P'

68
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,290
Shit!

69
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,810
What?

70
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,770
What are you wearing?

71
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,290
We're here to breaking and
entering, so we must in disguise.

72
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,790
Ai'Kui, Ai'Mes.

73
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,450
You guys too?

74
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,690
Of course.

75
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,250
No one will recognize us.

76
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,670
Yes.

77
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,530
Shit, fuck you guys!

78
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,890
What's wrong, P'?

79
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,050
We came here together.

80
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,650
Your nose is so big.

81
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,490
IG, you wait here with your friends.

82
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,410
Yeah.

83
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,050
No need to go upstairs.

84
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,770
I can't let this person go.

85
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,610
You people dressed crazily.

86
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,410
Take care of yourself.

87
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,930
Shit!

88
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,090
You startled me

89
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,730
This is an act of theft.

90
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,250
Your nose is very big.

91
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,360
How do you know I live here?

92
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,740
Can I come in?

93
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,680
I've been living in a
small room as of late.

94
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,920
I don't have much money.

95
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,850
So...

96
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,620
is there something that
you came looking for me?

97
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,380
I knew everything about you...

98
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,090
and father.

99
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,820
You used to tell me...

100
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,050
that your father
is in a gambling debt...

101
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,980
to a point of you not having any money.

102
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,140
In actuality,
it's not your father.

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,840
But it's you.

104
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,780
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,870
Did you heard this
from someone else?

106
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,180
Your father...

107
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,650
told everything to my father.

108
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,250
P', trust me.
No one will recognize us.

109
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,730
It's like in the movies.

110
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,170
True.

111
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,410
That's right.

112
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,810
Yes, sir.

113
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,130
Am I right, P'Tong?

114
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,450
I know.

115
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,090
Sawasdee krub, P'Kui, P'Mes.

116
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,810
You got the wrong guy.

117
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,410
I'm not Mes.

118
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,690
And I'm not Kui.

119
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,770
Look closer.

120
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,570
How can we not recognize,
you're the God Guys Gang, right?

121
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,570
You guys can recognize us?!

122
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,130
Of course. What's going on here?

123
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,330
Let's go.

124
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,050
They're smiling.

125
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,530
I'll smack that smirk out of you.

126
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,770
Enough!

127
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,170
Idiots!

128
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,250
You said people
aren't gonna recognize us.

129
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,530
Ai'Ruk is up there too long.

130
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,730
I'm gonna go inside.

131
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,820
IG.

132
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,050
But Ai'Ruk told us to wait down here.

133
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,810
Who said I was gonna wait?

134
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,970
IG!

135
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,860
How could you do this?!

136
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
That's your family.

137
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,400
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,700
I don't understand.

139
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,800
How can you not know?

140
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,060
You took all the money for
gambling until there's nothing left...

141
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,600
to the point
of deceiving my friends.

142
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,840
I didn't!

143
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,020
Sis Suang is
the who deceived them.

144
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,960
เออ กฝากไปบอกแก็งทวยเทพเพื่อนถึงด้วยนะ

145
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,160
You told your
God Guys gang too?

146
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,960
If you want to
accuse someone like me...

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,360
go find some evidence first.

148
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,780
You want prove?!

149
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,200
Here's your prove!

150
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,040
What is your problem?!

151
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,960
You tricked my friends!

152
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,920
But now...

153
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
we're about take everything back.

154
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,280
I think you should pay them back.

155
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,860
I didn't take anyone's money.

156
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,520
Why do I have to pay back?

157
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,640
How can you still lie to us?!

158
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,000
After taking away other
people's money and still...

159
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,320
Let's just beat him up!

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,080
I think we should search his room.

161
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,280
Go!

162
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,080
Get out of my room!

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,880
Shit!

164
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,520
Shit!

165
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
You people leave now.

166
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,120
If not, I'll shoot.

167
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
Someone like you...

168
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,120
dare to do so?!

169
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,300
Why wouldn't I be?

170
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,060
If can't do it...

171
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
someone like you...

172
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,080
don't hope for it!

173
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,580
Why do you have to
make things so difficult?

174
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,620
Do you think my life was easy?

175
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,400
Yes!

176
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,800
I deceived all of you.

177
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,020
As for Sis Suang....

178
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,840
she came into my
life and pay for my room.เ

179
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,780
And that watch I bought for you...

180
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,080
you never thought about wearing it.

181
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,980
You...

182
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,520
never sees
any goodness in me.

183
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,280
Never sees...

184
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,760
that love I have for you.

185
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,400
But for a guy like him...

186
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,480
Let me ask you this.

187
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,560
What makes him better than me?

188
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,340
If I knew...

189
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,640
that a guy like you...

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
would never understands...

191
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,500
I would have never get to know you!

192
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,300
Ruk!

193
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,560
IG, that's enough!

194
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,360
P'Mes!

195
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,680
IG, that's enough.

196
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,640
IG!

197
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,200
That's enough.

198
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,840
Let's go back for now.

199
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,560
He got what he deserve for now.

200
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,960
Let's get outta here.

201
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,180
I really don't know...

202
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,800
what makes you ended up like this.

203
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,640
Fuck!!!

204
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
Why can't we do it?!

205
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,040
Mes.

206
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,960
Why are you like this?

207
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
I took the evidence to the police.

208
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,160
So?

209
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,680
But...

210
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,440
there is no fucking use of it at all.

211
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,960
And the football
match will start in two weeks

212
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,440
I've made up
my mind to be like this.

213
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Mes.

214
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,920
It's gonna be alright.

215
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,760
You...

216
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
can do anything.

217
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,760
Look at me.

218
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,720
You can do anything.

219
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,400
Come.

220
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,400
You're an amazing person.

221
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,280
You're the best.

222
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,960
Thank you so much.

223
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,200
You're so cute.

224
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,540
- Are you feeling hot?
- Yes.

225
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
So cute.

226
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,040
What should we do tomorrow?

227
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,640
How about...

228
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,080
we go watch movies?

229
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,440
- Sure
- What movies?

230
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,800
You choose.

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
Ai'Kim!

232
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,400
What do you want?

233
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,240
You know that Fangkao
is dating IG, right?

234
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,800
Yes, so what?

235
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,120
So...

236
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,200
and you go here and
there with his girlfriend?

237
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,680
What's it got to do with you?

238
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,160
You broke up with IG, didn't you?

239
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,560
But what you're doing is not right.

240
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,640
Since when did you become a judge?

241
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,160
As if you're that good yourself.

242
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,220
Isn't this a photo of
P'Kim and P'Fangkao together?

243
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,800
I wrongly sent it to you.

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,660
Where did you get this photo?

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,880
My friend sent it to me.

246
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,860
I think we should
not tell this to anyone.

247
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,120
It's better that
we keep this a secret.

248
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,040
Of course.
I will not tell anyone.

249
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,640
Very good.

250
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,760
Hello, E'Ferm.

251
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,760
Have you seen the
photo in the LINE group?

252
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,680
Yes, a photo of P'Kim and P'Fangkao.

253
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
I still haven't
send it to anyone else.

254
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
We have to keep this a secret.

255
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,320
Yes, OK.

256
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,680
Fangkao?

257
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,920
P'IG.

258
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,960
why would I be going back to Kim?

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,540
That was an old photo.

260
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,600
Are you free?

261
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm free.

262
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,080
I'm gonna go see Mes first.

263
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
See you tomorrow.

264
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,280
P'IG, wait!

265
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,960
He's not jealous?

266
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,320
Or he doesn't know?

267
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,960
He doesn't know, for sure.

268
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,080
What should I do?

269
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,800
I think.

270
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,720
I want to buy him a book.

271
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,400
I never seen IG read a book before.

272
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,240
You're right

273
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,120
Then...

274
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,960
I'll buy him a soccer ball.

275
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,560
He can buy that himself.

276
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,280
He uses a very famous brands.

277
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,800
Shit.

278
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,400
Shit.

279
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,960
But I don't have any money.

280
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,280
Then anything that looks simple...

281
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,600
that the the two of you know, something like that.

282
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,200
I think I got it.

283
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,680
Thank you so much, Ai'Kui.

284
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,960
Yeah, yeah. Good luck.

285
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,180
Am I dreaming

286
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,260
You're not.

287
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,680
How are you here?

288
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm definitely not dreaming.

289
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,640
Can you be with me today?

290
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,160
I'm here already.

291
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,730
Go back to sleep.

292
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,330
This is the same as you
admitted to the School of Communication.

293
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,330
No yet, calm down.

294
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,050
Anyway, I have to wait for them to
announce the art test results first.

295
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,610
Probably in another 2 weeks.

296
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,770
That's good.

297
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,950
You already enter new
school before graduating.

298
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,010
See?

299
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,600
You've become a Bangkok student too.

300
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,730
Unless...

301
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,330
you're following someone here.

302
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,330
Are you crazy?

303
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,570
The reason I can do it...

304
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,490
is because I'm good.

305
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,170
What about you?

306
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,450
How are things with
you and Mr. IG after this?

307
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,090
But I think...

308
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,770
there will be good news soon.

309
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,810
Why?

310
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,450
Because your father already
accepted Grateen in your family.

311
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,610
I was in car on my
way home the other day.

312
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,610
I saw them having dinners together.

313
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,730
Yeah.

314
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,770
My older brother already told me.

315
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,090
But, dude...

316
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,730
a guy like IG is
fucking difficult to please.

317
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,450
Come now, dude.

318
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,530
I think Mr. IG likes you anyway.

319
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,550
Give him some times.

320
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,330
Besides Uncle Yingyod
already open up about this.

321
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,140
Go for it.

322
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,330
What are you guys talking about?

323
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,250
Please excuse me.

324
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,010
What the hell?

325
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,330
Actually, you...

326
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,250
are not here to see me,
right, Ai'Petch?

327
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,850
Well, no...

328
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,370
Let's go, Petch.

329
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,370
I have to go now.

330
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,930
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

331
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,770
I want you to see this yourself.

332
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,570
See what?

333
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,730
You'll know.

334
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,690
Stop being dramatic, will you?

335
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,930
Stop intruding in my business!

336
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,690
I'm sick of your games.

337
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,570
I hope that
everything will end today.

338
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,170
So there's nothing
bothering you anymore.

339
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,570
Please.

340
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,330
The reason I
came to see you today...

341
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,010
because I have
to tell you something.

342
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,730
What is it?

343
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,330
My dad already accepted
P'Grateen to date P'Nukrop.

344
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,770
So what?

345
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,650
I think not long after this...

346
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,170
it will be our opportunity.

347
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,450
Do you think us...

348
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,010
can come back to
the way we were before?

349
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,850
Young man,
what are you doing here?

350
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,010
was helping him pull
out his nose hair, right?

351
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,050
Yes.

352
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,290
Young people has
a very long nose hair.

353
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,610
Everyone in the
movie theater already went out.

354
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,610
Where's Ai'Kim and Fangkao?

355
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,610
There they are.

356
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,050
Kao!

357
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,090
PIG!?

358
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,650
Why do you have to
repeat this 3 to 4 times?

359
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,970
You're such
shameless guy, aren't you?

360
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,890
She already has a boyfriend...

361
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,050
and you still going out with her?

362
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,810
You don't have to blame P'Kim on this.

363
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,210
It's my fault, I went to
see him on my own accord.

364
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,650
I just feel that you
don't love me anymore.

365
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,990
What are you talking about?

366
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,890
Stop fooling yourself, P'IG.

367
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,850
I know that you love
him now, am I right?

368
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,570
Yes.

369
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,810
I am in love with him.

370
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,050
But I'm aware...

371
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,890
that I'm dating you now.

372
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,930
I hoped....

373
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,090
that we might get
back to how we used to.

374
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,570
It's annoying at this point, P'IG.

375
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,450
I don't love you anymore.

376
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,410
You know...

377
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,750
I hate you the most.

378
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,010
You never been honest with me!

379
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,290
You never said it when
you're unsatisfied with something!

380
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,930
Never said anything when you don't like something!

381
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,330
So shameless that you dare
to take other people's lover.

382
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,490
Why didn't you brave enough
to break up with me first?!

383
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,960
IG!

384
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,650
You!

385
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,450
- Stay out of this!
- Ai'Kim!

386
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,850
P'Kim!

387
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,490
Let's get outta here.
Let's stay away from them.

388
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,010
Yeah.

389
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,050
Ai'Ruk!

390
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,290
Let's go, Fangkao.

391
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,280
Slowly.

392
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,220
Are your hands
human's or buffalo's?

393
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,260
Do you want
to keep hurting yourself?

394
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,340
You're small...

395
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
and still wanting
to protect others.

396
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,820
And now I have
to heal your wounds.

397
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,780
I'm sorry.

398
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,500
I'm sorry too.

399
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,900
Sorry for not having the courage to
protect our feelings for each other.

400
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,260
But this time, I promise...

401
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,660
I will do my best.

402
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,980
The wound stills hurt.

403
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,860
Should I give
you a new medicine?

404
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,020
It's not getting any better.

405
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,700
Then I'll give you another.

406
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,500
Is your mother home?

407
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,380
No, she's not.

408
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,180
Let me...

409
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,180
do it for you.

410
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,420
Do what?

411
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,700
You'll know.

412
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,820
IG.

413
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,860
IG, did you open the window?

414
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,140
I didn't.

415
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,180
Then who did?

416
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,580
- Mom!
- Auntie!

417
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,260
So....

418
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,260
who's the bottom....

419
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,820
and who's the top?

420
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,500
Sawasdee krub.

421
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,020
Mom, go.

422
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,900
Someone's here in a pair.

423
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,300
Why are you being nosy?

424
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,780
The coach wants us to
practice early in the morning.

425
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,820
Yeah, the match will be
in a few days from now.

426
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,100
Time flies, right?

427
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,900
Mes.

428
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,940
Why are you so early today?

429
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,260
My dad is going to work.

430
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,220
So he sent me.

431
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,260
Hello?

432
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,740
Sawasdee kha, N'IG.

433
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,180
I want to get in touch with
one of the God Guys Gang.

434
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,940
ОК.

435
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,580
P'Khet, just a moment.

436
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,900
One of the
member happens to be here.

437
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,660
Me?

438
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,420
Yes, she's from Thai Tape.

439
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,940
She wants to talk to you.

440
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,700
I'm gonna buy some drinks.

441
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,500
Hello, P'.

442
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,620
I'm Mes.

443
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,580
Sawasdee kha. I'm Khet,
calling from Thai Tape.

444
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,780
We from Thai Tape saw the
video clip of your performance.

445
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,900
So we want to support your
Cheer club with 100,000 baht.

446
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
Of course.

447
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,900
What is your contact number?

448
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,100
I'll ask IG to send
you the contact numbers.

449
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,980
What's your problem?

450
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,980
Why is your expression looks weird.

451
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,220
A Thai Music Company...

452
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,860
saw ours and IG's
performance at Siam Square.

453
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,140
So they want to support the
Chatreemit Cheer club...

454
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,740
with 100,000 baht!

455
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,820
100,000?!

456
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,020
Yes.

457
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,240
Then why do you look stressful?

458
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,780
Yeah, so tell us the details.

459
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,540
It's their company policy...

460
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,140
to encourage and fund young
people who are interested in music.

461
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,900
Shit, for real?

462
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,820
Yes.

463
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,820
Ruk!

464
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,460
Ruk,Ruk.

465
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,900
- Are you OK?
- Are you hurt?

466
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,020
My legs!

467
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,980
Ruk!

468
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,580
Hurry and call the ambulance!

469
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Do you have a phone?

470
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Ai'Ruk.

471
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,100
Ruk.

472
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,900
How are you feeling?

473
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,780
Ai'Ruk.

474
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,580
The doctor said you're all right.

475
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,540
You can go home
after only awhile here.

476
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,420
But for sure...

477
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,100
you'll not be able to
participate in the football match.

478
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,340
I know you've
been serious about it.

479
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,100
But it's alright.

480
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,220
Got a scholarship to be an athlete...

481
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,020
but can't participate
in the match in the end.

482
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,060
What are you talking about?

483
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Ruk..

484
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,620
P'Nukrop will come here shortly.

485
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,420
Do you remember
I told you about Ai'Ruk?

486
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,230
It was not an accident.

487
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,270
I have prove. Here.

488
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,060
Where's the prove?
What is this?

489
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,820
The guy who
hit-and-run Ai'Ruk. His bike.

490
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,860
What is this?
It's just two black spots.

491
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,900
Can't you print in color?

492
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,820
You want to see it clearly?
Then look at this photo.

493
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,380
This bastard
that runs over Ai'Ruk!

494
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,060
Let me tell you this.

495
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,920
At first, we were here.

496
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,340
Then Ruk went
here to buy some stuff.

497
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,340
He then waited for him here.

498
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,500
He got hit by the motorcycle here.

499
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,100
Look at the brown drink he bought.

500
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,660
That wasn't his blood.

501
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,900
Here.

502
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,580
It's not clear.

503
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,180
Look at this.

504
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,740
It's clear now.

505
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,140
It's Ai'Tong's father.

506
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,540
- Ai'Tong's father, Sawasdee krub.
- Dad, Sawasdee krub.

507
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,740
No!

508
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,260
This bastard is the one
who hit-and-run Ai'Ruk.

509
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,580
But you really
didn't have a color printed?

510
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,540
It's what we have.

511
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,820
I think I can catch
him with this evidence.

512
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Laugh, what
are you waiting for?

513
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,500
♫ Just you coming here makes my heart melt ♫

514
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,540
♫ It melts, melts that I want to swallow you whole ♫

515
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,500
♫ You didn't come with anyone else, right? ♫

516
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,060
♫ What do you like? ♫

517
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,380
♫ Tell me and I'll find some or you ♫

518
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,100
♫ I’m not rich like others ♫

519
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,860
♫ I don't have what others do ♫

520
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,500
♫ I just wanna say that a guy
like me only have true love ♫

521
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,340
♫ I will never abandon you ♫

522
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,500
♫ Nor make you sit in sadness ♫

523
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,060
♫ Even though I’m not handsome,
my heart is sincere ♫

524
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,620
♫ I will give all my heart to you ♫

525
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,740
♫ In my life right now, I only have you ♫

526
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,620
♫ please don’t leave me aside
and pulverize my heart ♫

527
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,020
♫ I met you when I didn't have anything left ♫

528
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,900
♫ Will you accept me on the
day I don't have anything left? ♫

529
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,540
♫ The economy is bad,
my house is in troublesome ♫

530
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,740
♫ There is famine, not enough money to spend ♫

531
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,140
♫ Are you looking at me
from the outside or the inside? ♫
