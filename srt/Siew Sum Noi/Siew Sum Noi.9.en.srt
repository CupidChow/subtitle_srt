17
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,970
Can't we be together?!

18
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,770
Ai'Nukrop!

19
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,690
What the hell are you doing?!

20
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,330
It's not like what you see, Dad.

21
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,490
Dad, Dad, no!

22
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,050
No, Dad.

23
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,010
Move!

24
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,300
♫ I want you to say that I
might still have a chance ♫

25
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,650
Dad.

26
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,730
♫ When I wake up in the
morning I would still have you ♫

27
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,650
Grateen!

28
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,790
Grandma.

29
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,050
What's wrong?

30
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,530
Grateen, what did you do?

31
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,050
Look, there's blood!

32
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,290
What happened?

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,250
Kaewdtah!

34
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,170
Kaewdtah, come and
take a look at this boy!

35
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,810
Where are you? Come quick!

36
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,250
Yes, Mom. What is it?

37
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,570
Look at Grateen.

38
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,670
What is this?
What's with all the bleeding?!

39
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,970
Sit, Mom. Sit, son.

40
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,490
Sit, sit, son.

41
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,050
What did you do?

42
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,050
What happened?

43
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,770
Who did this to you?

44
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,210
Tell me, dear. Who did this?

45
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,540
Oh, blood.

46
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,170
Uncle Yingyod...

47
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,090
He saw me having a
relationship with Nukrop.

48
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,010
So he got mad.

49
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,010
Ai'Yingyod!

50
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,250
How can you do this to my grandson?!

51
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,530
Mom, calm down.

52
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,170
Don't, Grandma.

53
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,530
Don't go.

54
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,850
It's my fault.

55
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,490
I'm not supposed to
go visit Nukrop like that.

56
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,890
That damn Yingyod.

57
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,450
What's all the big deal?

58
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,610
It's just two men loving each other.

59
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,830
Are you some kind of god?

60
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,330
I'm so mad right now.

61
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,090
Mom, Mom.

62
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,850
Calm down or
your pressure will go up.

63
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,050
Please, Mom.

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,290
It's not like every,
family will understand this like ours do.

65
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,250
We all have
different upbringing.

66
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,730
But...

67
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,730
he went so far
to use violence like this...

68
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,650
and hit his head this severe.

69
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,290
I'm gonna go and clear things up.

70
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,050
No need to go, Mom.

71
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,850
You don't have to go.

72
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,050
Really, son?

73
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,210
So what are you
gonna do next with Nukrop?

74
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,050
Tell me.

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,050
will probably have
to break up with him.

76
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,690
I'm having a headache
too now, my grandson.

77
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,730
Ruk!

78
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,570
Ruk!

79
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,410
Ruk!

80
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,650
What the hell?

81
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,090
Ruk!

82
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,210
Ruk!

83
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,330
Ruk!

84
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,840
Ruk!

85
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,370
Ruk!

86
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,130
He's not home.

87
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,610
Sawasdee, Auntie.

88
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,830
They all went to the hospital.

89
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,490
Who's sick?

90
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,650
Grandpa Yingyod of course.

91
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,050
He got high blood pressure

92
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,850
Blood pressure?!

93
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,980
They went to take
him to the hospital there.

94
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,210
OK, thank you.

95
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,210
Sure, no problem.

96
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,830
Sure, no problem.

97
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,010
Krub.

98
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,250
Why did he hang up?

99
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,730
Pick up.

100
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,370
Perhaps he's busy?

101
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,090
I'll send a message then.

102
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,610
How's your father?

103
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,490
He's gotten better now.

104
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,610
He can be discharged this evening.

105
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,290
Khun IG's messages?

106
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,090
Why didn't you reply?

107
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,810
I'm not ready to
talk to him at this moment.

108
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,130
What are you gonna do next?

109
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,850
Break up with him, I guess.

110
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,890
But if I were you...

111
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,610
I'd explain everything to him first.

112
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,250
Why should I tell him?

113
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,690
The result will be the same.

114
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,650
I'm a coward...

115
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,650
and not brave enough
to follow my own heart.

116
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,450
If I can control my feelings...

117
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,490
I won't be like this.

118
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,090
But it wasn't your fault.

119
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,370
Your father will
understand you eventually.

120
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,050
He just need time.

121
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,330
How long will I have to wait?

122
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,530
It's not easy...

123
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,410
for me to meet
someone who being so to me.

124
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,810
Why does it have to be this way?

125
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,290
This way, Uncle Yingyod.

126
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,890
Mom fell asleep for a moment.

127
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,370
Mom, Mom.

128
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,890
Uncle Yingyod is here.

129
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,330
Come, come

130
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,690
What is it that you called me here?

131
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,890
Well, I was worried.

132
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,490
I want to ask if your
condition is getting better or not.

133
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,570
It's not that much better yet.

134
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,290
Just about that!

135
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,490
Mom, Mom. Calm down.

136
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,540
Stay away from my business.

137
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,810
Just the matter of two
kids loving each other...

138
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,890
why do you have to use violence
until got him wunded like that?!

139
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,250
The reason I was so harsh...

140
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,970
because Ai'Grateen...

141
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,770
because Ai'Grateen...

142
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,090
went...

143
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,690
went to do that thing with
my son, I can't accept that!

144
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,890
Dad.

145
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,130
That thing you mention...

146
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,650
it was just that.

147
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,050
Two kids loving each other.

148
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,050
Are you not happy that
your son is a good person?

149
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,050
Can't you just forgive
him for this kind of thing?

150
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,850
I'm sorry for
being too harsh on him.

151
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,730
But I won't let the two
of them love each other.

152
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,560
I can't accept it

153
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,890
Yingyod.

154
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,130
We can only take care of our kids.

155
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,570
As for their hearts,
we can't determine that for them.

156
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,850
The more we force them...

157
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,730
the further away they'll run from us.

158
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,250
Trust me.

159

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,820
♫ The bed we once sleep on and
the pillow you once used ♫

168
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,740
♫ I still keep it even though
you're no longer here ♫

169
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,720
♫ How are you over there?
I have no idea ♫

170
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,160
♫ Damn, I can't stop
thinking about you ♫

171
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,880
♫ How are you over there?
I have no idea ♫

172
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:45,500
♫ Damn, I can't stop
thinking about you ♫

173
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,500
♫ I want you to say that I
might still have a chance ♫

174
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,770
♫ When I wake up in the
morning I would still have you ♫

175
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,820
Open it when you get there.

176
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,860
Thank you.

177
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,380
This two too?

178
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,470
Where is Ai'Kaengsom?

179
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
He's sleeping at the back of the van.

180
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,020
Are you really not coming with us?

181
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,180
It's all right.

182
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,500
Are you really not coming with us?

183
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,940
I've promised Ruk
to go back together.

184
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,940
Ai'Ruk already went back.

185
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,220
What's the matter with him?

186
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,040
He promised to go with me.

187
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,300
How about this?

188
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,300
Let's go back with us.

189
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,180
Let's go back with us.

190
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,660
Grandma.

191
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,060
Do you really have to go?

192
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,980
Yes.

193
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
Can you not go?

194
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,180
Stay out of this.

195
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,820
You're raising your
voice just to scold me?

196
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,900
I'll come visit you
again as soon as I can.

197
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,540
Hurry back, OK?

198
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,020
Krub.

199
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,700
They love each other so much.

200
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,140
Hurry and visit me again.

201
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,020
Oh, your grandson.

202
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,900
Come and hug me.

203
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,380
Have a safe journey.

204
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,220
I don't want you to go,
but you must.

205
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,660
Take care of yourself.

206
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,620
Petch, take care of
my mom and grandmom.

207
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,540
Go.

208
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,020
- Sawasdee krub
- Sawasdee ja.

209
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,100
I'll go now, Grandma.

210
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,140
See you.

211
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,340
Let me walk my grandson to the van.

212
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,300
Let's go, let's go.

213
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,660
I'm off now, Grandma.

214
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,020
He's speaking Isaan too.

215
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,540
Bye everyone. Have a safe journey

216
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,820
Have a safe journey .

217
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,460
Come again next time.

218
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,860
Sawasdee krub, Mom.

219
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,980
I'm stuck with my Isaan dialect now.

220
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,860
Sawasdee krub.

221
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,180
Bye.

222
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,300
Here.

223
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,860
I've got you Grateen's signature.

224
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,060
Thank you.

225
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,460
Long time no see,
I miss you so much.

226
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,380
Can I hug you?

227
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,950
Can I hug you?

228
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,940
I was just kidding.

229
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,860
So, how was your semester break?
Was it fun?

230
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,940
It was OK.

231
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,140
The thing with you and
P'IG is so trending right now.

232
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,340
Why is face looks so miserable
like you're holding in your shit?

233
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,590
Had a quarrel with P'IG?

234
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,580
Actually, we've broken up.

235
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,880
Broke up?!

236
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,820
Yes, why do you have to be so loud?

237
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,980
And you,
don't tell anyone about this.

238
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,020
OK, I won't tell anyone.

239
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,500
OK, I'm gonna go now.

240
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,100
Don't you tell.

241
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,740
Hello, dude.

242
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,500
Don't tell anyone.

243
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,940
Ruk.

244
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,620
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

245
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,980
I want to ask you to go watch
my singing performance.

246
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,460
Wanna go?

247
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,380
No.

248
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,300
What's the matter?

249
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,920
Nothing.

250
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,260
Nothing, my ass.

251
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,420
Your voice is high.

252
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,580
You were avoiding
me since Nong Saeng.

253
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,780
You didn't answer my calls or
reply my LINE messages.

254
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,740
My dad was admitted to a hospital.

255
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,380
I didn't have time.

256
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,780
How's your father doing?

257
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,020
High blood pressure.

258
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,700
That's how old people is.

259
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,980
But he's better now.

260
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,060
Because of your father...

261
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,900
you didn't have time for me.

262
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,900
That's it?

263
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,180
Why didn't you tell me?

264
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,300
I'm not clingy to my boyfriend.

265
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,300
If I want to be clingy...

266
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,260
it would only be...

267
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,180
if you want me to.

268
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,260
That's all you want to ask of me, right?

269
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,220
I'm having stomachache,
I want to get some sleep.

270
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,820
Wanna crash at my place?

271
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,540
No one's at home.

272
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,020
Let's go.

273
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,180
No.

274
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
I have a morning practice tomorrow.

275
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,420
Ruk!

276
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,140
Ruk!

277
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
Wait!

278
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,820
Ruk!

279
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,620
Hello.

280
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,360
What is it, Mes?

281
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,860
P', are we really gonna be OK?

282
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,300
Avi'IG is a professional.

283
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm not worry about P'IG.

284
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,060
Will that song of his work?

285
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,140
Shit.

286
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,660
I don't know.

287
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,140
But what I'm sure of is...

288
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,980
where is my plug?!

289
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,020
What the?!

290
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,460
I have a problem too.

291
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,580
;What now? ;

292
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,580
I can't remember the chords.

293
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,100
Will we able to do this?!

294
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,580
Nevermind.

295
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,220
Shall we try first?

296
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,620
Let's try.

297
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,100
Come on.

298
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Hello?

299
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,900
Hello?

300
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,580
Test, hello.

301
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,860
Tes...

302
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,940
It's not loud, P'.

303
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,140
Idiot, you don't plug it in yet!

304
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,100
I'm gonna kill you!

305
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,180
Hello, hello.

306
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,410
Sawasdee....

307
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,090
Fuck!

308
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,570
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

309
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,090
Let's do it again.

310
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,810
Sawasdee to all.

311
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,770
We're from Chatreemit School.

312
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,890
Today, we're gonna perform
a live Mo Lam performance.

313
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,810
For tonight, whoever requested
the song first, we'll play it first.

314
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,490
Whoever requested it
later will be played later.

315
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,250
But whoever pays,
will be given priority.

316
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:31,170
Alright, for the opening
song will be sing by P'IG Sangsin!

317
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,970

So good!

346
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,610
We did not succeed.

347
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,450
Is it our music style
doesn't really suits for IG.

348
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,370
You can tell by looking at IG's face...

349
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,730
He's upset about
something else, probably.

350
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,050
Why?

351
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,090
Immediately after
we finished packing up...

352
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,130
that woman P'Fangkao
instantly went to him.

353
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,550
Rumor has it that
she broke up with P'Kim.

354
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,090
Does that mean she's moved
on and came back to him again?

355
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,930
I think so.

356
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,490
Ai'Mes.

357
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,090
How much is the
money you've calculated?

358
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,930
24,000.

359
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,370
The hell it is!

360
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,290
Only 24.19 baht.

361
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,090
It's not even enough
for musical instruments.

362
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,090
That bastard P'Tunwa, if you don't
pay us in these one or two days...

363
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,130
I pray that you...

364
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,450
Tunwa's calling.

365
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,810
Hello, P'Tunwa.

366
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,750
Mes, I have news
about the payment.

367
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,650
Anyway, meet me at
the usual place tomorrow.

368
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,410
Sure, P'.

369
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,650
I'll set the appointment later.

370
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,370
I'll set the appointment later.

371
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,970
ОК.

372
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,770
What the heck?

373
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,850
It's OK now.

374
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,370
Hello, Ruk.

375
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,370
Hello, P'.

376
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,850
I'm here,
I've been waiting long already.

377
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,690
Come, come.

378
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,930
OK, P.

379
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,090
Krub.

380
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,170
Sawasdee krub, Mr. Tunwa.

381
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,450
What are you doing?!

382
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,570
Ruk!

383
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,690
Come, no need to chase him.

384
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,810
Are you alright?

385
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,370
I think we should report this.

386
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,930
No need.

387
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,130
Small-time thief like this...

388
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,930
the police won't catch them.

389
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,450
OK!

390
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,930
When did you
come back to Bangkok?

391
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,650
I've been here
for a few days now.

392
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,210
Actually I wanted
to come back here earlier.

393
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,970
But my father wanted
me to stay ḥome longer.

394
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,290
You...

395
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,970
are not living with your father, right?

396
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,140
How did you know that?

397
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,570
Someone told me...

398
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,370
that you're living alone.

399
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,650
Are you...

400
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,890
in any kind of trouble?

401
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,490
Ruk, can you not tell this to anyone?

402
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,530
My father is in a gamble debt.

403
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,170
It's all over Ban Phang.

404
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,370
I need to search for
money, to pay for him.

405
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,130
So I have to study,...

406
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,210
and work at the same time.

407
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,410
For real?

408
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,090
This is a big issue.

409
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,720
Do you want my dad to help you?

410
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,410
No matter what, my dad
will surely help your family.

411
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,170
It's all right.

412
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,810
I'll live.

413
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,450
I just need one particular
person to be by my side.

414
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,050
That is enough.

415
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,890
Is there anything
troubling you that you called me?

416
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,920
Forget it.

417
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,380
Your problem is more serious.

418
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,370
Thanks.

419
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,730
Are you hurt?

420
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,970
I'm fine. This is nothing, I'm fine.

421
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,770
Come, we should go.
That guy might come back again.

422
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,810
Are you thirsty?

423
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,370
What?

424
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,890
Are you thirsty?

425
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,610
Wait here, I'll buy one for you.

426
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,600
Ruk.

427
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,460
You're not stressed about
your father's illness, aren't you?

428
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm your boyfriend.

429
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,120
If there's anything
we should talk about it.

430
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,960
I think we should break up.

431
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,240
Let's break up.

432
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,160
I'm not ready to
have anyone at the moment.

433
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,880
Why?

434
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,840
Did I do something wrong?

435
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,920
What happened?

436
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,680
Please tell me.

437
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,320
I can't love you.

438
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,360
Can't you understand?

439
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,720
Two kids loving each other.

440
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,220
Are you not happy that
your son is a good person?

441
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,920
Can't you just forgive
him for this kind of thing?

442
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,320
I won't let the two
of them love each other.

443
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,880
I can't accept it.

444
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,960
I'm a man.

445
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,120
I like woman.

446
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,600
Besides...

447
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,080
When I saw you with Fangkao...

448
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,000
you guys look well-matched.

449
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,940
This is my reason.

450
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,880
Do you have a new lover?

451
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,340
Is it P'Tunwa?

452
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,120
Or Noinae?

453
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,920
Let me tell you so you'd know.

454
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,840
Me and Fangkao...

455
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,360
are not in any relationship.

456
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,970
You should
stop this kind of thinking.

457
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,320
Please tell me...

458
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,360
what's wrong with you now?

459
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,600
Say something.

460
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,800
Say something!

461
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,480
Ruk!

462
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,000
What's wrong? Tell me.

463
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,560
Here's the thing...

464
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,160
you've done nothing wrong.

465
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,840
But I really can't love you.

466
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,080
I'm sorry.

467
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,680
This time...

468
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,240
I don't want to pretend to
be your boyfriend anymore.

469
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,360
I rather be your real boyfriend.

470
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,880
you've done nothing wrong.

471
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,610
But I really can't love you.

472
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,160
Deceived?!

473
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,840
Yes, that's right.

474
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,240
Sis Suang closed the horse farm.

475
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
I don't know how much of
the money she got away with.

476
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,460
I heard that because her
horses got infected by a disease.

477
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,470
Will we get infected
from the horses too?

478
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,050
Do you even have any importance?

479
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,240
How can it spread on a nonexistence
person?I'll smack you for that.

480
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,720
I'll smack him for you.

481
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Yeah, that's true.

482
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Then what should we do now?

483
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,280
We haven't done any search for it.

484
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,800
You guys don't have to worry.

485
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,960
Right now, I have my
police friend to investigate this.

486
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,120
Anyway, you'll get your money,
every single baht of it.

487
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880
I hope so.

488
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,000
Plus...

489
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,660
I have to apologize that
things turn out this way.

490
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,040
I have to apologize that
things turn out this way.

491
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,840
It's all right.

492
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,160
It's not your fault, I understand.

493
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,280
I know...

494
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,360
that you guys need the money.

495
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,240
This is really the
best I can help you with.

496
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,120
There are a total of 20,000 in here.

497
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,480
Actually, I wanted to give you more.

498
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,720
But I still have save some
for my study next semester.

499
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
You don't have to do this.

500
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,240
You already help us finding a sponsor,
now you even have to pay us.

501
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,560
Accept it, I'm fine with it.

502
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,000
It's alright, P'.

503
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,320
Accept it.

504
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,380
No.

505
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,840
Accept it, trust me.

506
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
That's fine.

507
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,560
Let me decide that.

508
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,440
Ai'Kaengsom!

509
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,400
Give it back!

510
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,360
Thank you.

511
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,480
ОК.

512
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,400
Anyway, if there's any update...

513
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,760
I'll let you know immediately.

514
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,120
ОК.

515
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,760
Then, we're gonna
excuse ourselves now.

516
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,120
- See you.
- Thank you.

517
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,400
Hello, Sis Suang.

It's Tunwa.

520
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,880
So, can you please transfer the
remaining 180,000 baht to me?

521
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,840
I'll give it to the kids myself.

522
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,400
