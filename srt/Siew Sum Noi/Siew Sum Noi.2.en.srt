00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,050
♫ Just you coming here makes my heart melt ♫

3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,090
♫ It melts, melts that I want to swallow you whole ♫

4
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,050
♫ You didn't come with anyone else, right? ♫

5
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,570
♫ What do you like? ♫

6
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,970
♫ Tell me and I'll find some or you ♫

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,690
♫ I’m not rich like others ♫

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,450
♫ I don't have what others do ♫

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,050
♫ I just wanna say that a guy

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,180
♫ please don’t leave me aside
and pulverize my heart ♫

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,130
Bring this for me.

17
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,090
Hurry.

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,050
Where are you going?

19
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,570
We're going to see a fortune teller.

20
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,880
He's gonna give us a feng shui for changing mattress.

21
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,090
Are you sure?

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,010
What's with feng shui bullshit?

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,050
Just tell him the truth that this is about P'IG.

24
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,450
This is about IG, right?

25
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,770
If my friends know...

26
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,290
that I leave in the same room as you...

27
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,650
they'll bully me about it.

28
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,890
Wait.

29
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,930
You guys don't have to go anywhere.

30
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,610
I know what I should do.

31
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,090
It's true, trust me.

32
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,040
No, no, no. That was just a
pretend by the male protagonist.

33
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,640
He pretends to be cool in
front of the female protagonist.

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,090
For real.

35
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,730
You never watch a Y-drama.

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,570
I was squealing in my pillow.

37
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,370
I like it so much, I can't be jealous at all.

38
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,200
They'll get together, trust me.

39
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,940
I was squealing my pillow hard.

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,690
I like it so much. I'll watch
that Y-drama again tomorrow.

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,050
It already ended with yesterday's episode.

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,210
Just a moment, we'll talk later.

43
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,410
IG, dear.

44
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,290
IG, come and sit here.

45
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,570
Come here.

46
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,130
Come and sit here for awhile.

47
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,290
Come here, son. Have a sit.

48
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,490
Is there something wrong?

49
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,650
Well..

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,370
it's nothing, Mom.

51
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,290
What is it? Tell me if there's something wrong.

52
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,250
How do you know?

53
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,250
This your mother.

54
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,570
Tell me, what's wrong?

55
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,050
Supposedly I don't
want to study anymore...

56
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,410
what would you say?

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,490
Why?

58
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,570
Have you ever wrongly accused
of something that you didn't do?

59
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,050
Quite often.

60
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,050
So how did you handle it?

61
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,330
Actually..

62
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,530
it's not that big of a deal.

63
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,170
If we don't care about it...

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,090
we won't be stressed about it.

65
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,570
But if don't want to be stress...

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,730
then we should just ignore it.

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,450
By the way, what's this got to do with
you not wanting to study anymore?

68
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,210
I had some conflict
with the people at school.

69
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,930
It's the same problem, Mom.

70
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,490
The school and I'm not good
at both studies and sports.

71
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,370
Others still like to misjudge me.

72
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,890
They were just
scolding me for no reason.

73
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,170
So I just confess to them.

74
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,690
This is a confession too, right?

75
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,370
If you don't care about it,
why would you be stressed about it?

76
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,130
You're so unconfident, my dear son.

77
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,520
But the director already
knew that you didn't do it.

78
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,490
You knew about that?

79
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,050
Yes.

80
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,890
They called and told
me about it this afternoon.

81
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,050
But if you don't want to study...

82
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,690
then I wouldn't mind.

83
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,830
However, think carefully about it...

84
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,050
as to why you came
back to school this time.

85
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,050
Don't let other people perceptions
on you affect your life too much, son.

86
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,970
Nowadays, it's already been very hard as it is.

87
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,530
My son..

88
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,650
My son..

89
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,210
Thank you, Mom.

90
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,170
Ja.

91
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,690
Go take a shower and eat lunch.

92
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,410
Yes.

93
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,410
Go.

94
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,710
This is the guy who inform the
teacher about P'IG lighting the firecracker.

95
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,810
I'm sorry, P'. Don't tell
the teacher that I hit you.

96
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,370
Where are you going?

97
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,810
What is your problem?

98
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,530
Where are you going?

99
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,050
IG!

100
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,130
What?

101
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,370
Move.

102
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,410
IG! IG!

103
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,890
- IG! IG!
- What?

104
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,210
Move!

105
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,570
IG!

106
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,450
What are you guys doing?

107
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,530
Nothing, P'.

108
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,050
Let's get outta here.

109
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,290
Ruk.

110
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,970
Here.

111
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,450
Thanks.

112
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,130
But honestly, you don't have to.

113
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,330
I have 2 of these back at home.

114
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,210
Just take it.

115
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,970
How great it is to be in
the God Guys gang, isn't it?

116
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,250
They can do whatever they want.

117
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,530
They can get whatever they want.

118
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,210
It all seems so easy.

119
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,370
Are you being sarcastic about life?

120
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,650
Or are you talking about IG?

121
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,770
Ignore whatever they
say in the social media.

122
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,250
They just say whatever they want.

123
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,370
IG has come back to study here.

124
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,650
Really?

125
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,050
But he quit the football team.

126
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,250
Was it because of me?

127
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,890
Not entirely. Because of you, Ai'Kim...

128
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,010
He himself is not fond of football.

129
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,650
And he's not even good at it.

130
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,330
Worst case it might get the
football team less supporter.

131
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,890
You and IG are very close, right?

132
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,370
I only became close
to him since this year.

133
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,370
He's two years older than me.

134
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,170
I remember that he was isolated by his
friends because of his poor education.

135
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,610
So, why did he came back to school?

136
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,890
As I recall, he said that...

137
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,650
Einstein came into his dream and
told him to pursue Phaya Nak at school.

138
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,050
Whatever that means.

139
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,370
I don't even bother to ask him.

140
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,690
Ai'IG may not be
as lucky as the two of us.

141
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,650
When we came here,
we knew what we like and dislike.

142
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,810
Attention to Mr. Pogmes, Mr. Katty,
Mr. Pakkorn and Mr. Tawan.

143
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,250
Please come to the meeting room now.

144
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,330
Retribution really did come fast.

145
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,540
Cut all of our budget?!

146
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,580
Yes, especially you, Mes.

147
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,540
You're fully aware...

148
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,900
that you're a senior but
didn't look after your juniors.

149
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,980
If something happens,
are you gonna take responsibility?

150
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,900
But if you cut our budget like this...

151
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,980
the juniors who come and
train hard will feel terrible.

152
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,780
Think about it, Mr. Director...

153
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,820
We train 4 hours a day,
3 times a week.

154
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
That adds up to
a total of 624 hours.

155
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
That's a lot of work.

156
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,660
Mes, that's enough!

157
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,820
Stop talking

158
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,980
You're lucky enough
that we don't expel you.

159
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,220
If you still want to run the Cheer Club then
go look for the money on your own.

160
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,420
But, Mr. Director...

161
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,180
Enough! I've made my decision.

162
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,780
P', drinks.

163
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,020
P'Mes.

164
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,140
Or did we not
do it good enough?!

165
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
Ai'Tong!

166
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,980
You're the cause of this!

167
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,100
How shameless!

168
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,620
Covering ears, how can you hear me?

169
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,460
You're covering your ears not mine!

170
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,740
You're right

171
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,780
Seriously...

172
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,180
When your mother gave birth to you...

173
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,580
did she forgot to give birth to
your brain and left it in her tummy?

174
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,780
Oh God.

175
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,020
Why do you said my mom
left my brain in her tummy?!

176
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,380
It's your fault.

177
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,340
P', calm down.
This is getting too out of hands.

178
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,100
P'Mes, help.

179
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,260
-Why involve my mom?
- P'Katty, P'Tong, calm down.

180
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,540
I've got an idea!

181
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,970
Those people before us said they
looked for sponsor from their seniors.

182
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,930
Who?

183
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,460
I can think of one person.

184
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,940
P'Tunwa.

185
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,140
Who's that?

186
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,780
How come you guys
don't know who P'Tunwa is?

187
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,780
Ai'Kaengsom, how did you know him?

188
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,980
P'...

189
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,780
how can I not know?

190
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,020
P'Tunwa? I know him,
his family is extremely rich.

191
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,060
They said that he
has a zoo behind his house.

192
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,980
He's the former captain of
chearleading and football team, right?

193
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,580
He is super amazing.

194
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,540
It would be great if I could have
just a tiny bit of his greatness.

195
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,220
I remember,
aside from his cool-looking face...

196
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,020
his figure is also amazing, P'!

197
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,260
P'Tunwa is...

198
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,600
Call his number.

199
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,060
I don't have it.

200
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,020
I can't even
find his Facebook account.

201
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,860
What is his last name?

202
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,900
- What is his last name?
-P'...

203
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,820
Kaengsom, shut up!

204
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,220
Just sit there,
don't even breathe.

205
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,300
Just be quiet.

206
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,940
Can you not interfere?

207
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,060
Should we find him on Twitter?

208
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,660
What did you type? Let me see.

209
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,620
This.

210
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,860
You typed in "December"
and you expect to find him?

211
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,110
Why did you type in "December"?

212
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,900
Well, because December means Tunwa.

213
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
Why don't you type in Thai?!

214
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,380
Damn it, that's enough!

215
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,820
You guys seriously
give me a headache!

216
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,420
What the hell?

217
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,100
P'Tunwa, how are you?

218
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,780
Sawasdee krub.

219
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,780
Sawasdee.

220
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,100
Are you from the God Guys gang?

221
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,300
Yes.

222
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,220
All of you are good-looking.

223
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,820
Of course.

224
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,540
Let's get to business.

225
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,380
I have to clarify first that...

226
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,060
I no longer have any money
to invest for your activities.

227
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,100
What?

228
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,980
But...

229
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,780
Those before us said we can
ask for donation from the seniors.

230
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,020
Who told you that?

231
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,660
Thing is...

232
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,900
I'm just the middleman who
help you find a sponsor.

233
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,220
Then this time...

234
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,000
Can you help us for one more time.

235
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,780
- Please, P.
- We beg you.

236
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,700
Let me search for it first.

237
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,740
Here it is, found it.

238
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,660
I need something that needs
an exchange at equal value.

239
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,700
You can it's a
"exchanging pig and dogs".

240
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,580
You'll do something for me...

241
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,340
and in return I'll help you find the
money, will you be OK with that?

242
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,260
Where are you getting at, P'?

243
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,180
If it's 18+, I don't want it.

244
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,900
No.

245
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,060
Are you crazy?

246
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,060
I have a relative who
works on a horse race.

247
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,780
He(she) wants someone to
do a promotion for him(her).

248
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,540
You can probably get around...

249
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,300
a hundred to
2 hundred thousands.

250
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,190
Hundred thousands?

251
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,860
Shit!

252
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,290
- How?
- For real, P"?

253
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,580
Yes.

254
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,180
The Samakkee event
will be held next semester, right?

255
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,900
Yes.

256
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,540
Then...

257
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,100
We'll do a photoshoot
during the semester break...

258
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,140
because we don't
have much time left, OK?

259
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,380
OK, P'.

260
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,660
We'll go.

261
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,580
ОК.

262
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,380
Thank you so much.

263
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,300
That's the plan then.

264
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,620
Yes.

265
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,970
Come, let's cheers.

266
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,580
1

267
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,660
Mes.

268
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,900
I'm gonna host a party this Friday.
It's been awhile since I host one.

269
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,420
Yeah, good idea.

270
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,820
It's been stressful lately.

271
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,860
Right? Don't you agree?

272
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,220
Shit.

273
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,620
Did I owe him in my previous life?

274
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,780
Please come back to the team.

275
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,300
Stop following me around.

276
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,580
Please agree to come back to the team.

277
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,980
Fine.

278
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,620
I'll agree to come back to the team.

279
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,100
But..

280
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,620
But what?

281
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,020
This Friday, I will host
a fancy party at my house.

282
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,660
You...

283
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,460
need to dress in a cute
animal-themed outfit to attend it.

284
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,740
Because it's
fancy-themed event.

285
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,780
Your family...

286
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,460
probably doesn't
have this kind of stuff.

287
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,490
If you're wearing
something outdated...

288
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,620
like too ordinary outfit...

289
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,100
and someone took a picture of you...

290
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,820
I can't help you with that.

291
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,580
Absolutely.

292
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,780
Animal-them

293
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,220
Then see you this Friday.

294
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,980
Just be ready to join the team.

295
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,140
See you.

296
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,620
How will he come as?

297
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,740
Will he come though?

298
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,770
Where's IG?

299
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,410
There, he's sitting over there: ·

300
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,290
This belongs to my friend.

301
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,370
Can't you take it easy a bit?

302
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,930
Hey, IG.

303
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,890
I thought you won't show.

304
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,210
I came late but I came for sure.

305
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,580
This is Yuna. My friend since high school.

306
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,210
- Sawasdee kha.
- Sawasdee krub.

307
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,490
Ai'Kaengsom.

308
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,770
Why do you still drink milk?

309
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,210
P', I'm still a kid anymore.

310
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,090
Go and be a kid somewhere else.

311
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,470
Get up.

312
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,610
Go.

313
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,930
ОК, ОК.

314
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,770
Sawasdee krub, I'm Kaengsom.

315
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,850
- Let's go.
- Sawasdee kha.

316
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,250
Hold on.

317
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,970
Go there.
Go and see Ai'Tong.

318
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,570
What the heck?

319
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,610
P'Tong.

320
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,210
Wait, come here.

321
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,930
You have to
stay and aceompany me.

322
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,410
Sit here.

323
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,050
Sawasdee kha.

324
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,290
Sawasdee krub.

325
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,300
I'll leave her to you.
It's time for you to move on.

326
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,450
Then I'm gonna take M to eat.

327
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,770
Sorry, buddy. I'm tripping for love.

328
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,210
Hey, over here.

329
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,650
Alright, everyone.

330
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,050
Give a big hand... (in Isaan)

331
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,490
No, no.

332
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,570
Give a big hand to...

333
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,690
Ai'Ruk.

334
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,490
Our new football team player!

335
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,010
Why didn't you clapped?

336
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,410
Clap.

337
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,650
You...

338
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,290
People here doesn't recognize you.

339
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,770
- Take the mask off.
- Hands off.

340
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,330
I'm not taking it off.

341
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,330
That wasn't in our agreement.

342
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,370
All right, All right

343
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,370
It's fine.

344
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,650
My friend is a bit shy. Don't mind him.

345
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,540
Let's continue to have fun.

346
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,210
Turn on the music.

347
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,770
You'll get upset even with just that?

348
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,770
IG.

349
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,130
Your dear friend is here.

350
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,290
Why are you here?

351
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,730
To your party, of course.

352
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,290
It looks fun.

353
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,970
I'm not sure if he's
really your friend or not.

354
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,530
Fangkao.

355
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,210
Are you here for me?

356
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,410
No, I'm not here for you.

357
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,130
Why are you here then?

358
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,010
I'm here for Kim, is he here?

359
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,170
Why?

360
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,770
Afraid that he might went
out with someone else...

361
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,050
just like you did?

362
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,610
Can you be more respectful
with what you want to say?

363
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,290
No respect...

364
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,090
No respect... just hate.

365
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,070
You're not gonna tell me, aren't you?
Then, I'll look for him myself.

366
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,170
Why are you sitting here by yourself?

367
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,970
I don't have any friend.

368
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,450
So, why are you wearing a mask?

369
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,970
There's a bit of a misunderstanding.

370
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,850
But it's kinda cute.

371
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,370
Kim!

372
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,650
Kim!

373
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,890
Kim!

374
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,330
Као.

375
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,130
What's wrong?

376
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,530
It's nothing.

377
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,770
Where is Kim?!

378
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,770
I saw Kim is with some random girl.

379
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,730
I don't believe you!

380
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,850
He already left a long time ago.

381
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,850
- Kim!
- Fangkao, Fangkao.

382
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,530
Here you are.

383
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,650
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

384
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,310
There's Kim.

385
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,690
It's because you're behaving like
this that we can't be together.

386
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,810
Move on from me!

387
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,690
Idiot.

388
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,130
Fine!

389
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,490
I don't love you anymore!

390
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,810
Besides...

391
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,050
I already have a new lover.

392
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,890
Fuck!!!

393
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,210
Oh my god.

394
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,290
Their lips touched, did you see that?

395
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,570
This is my boyfriend.

396
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,690
Boyfriend, my ass!

397
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,170
- Fuck.
- Got punched.

398
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,250
He's head gotta be broken.
I think it's broken.

399
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,010
Do you think it's broken?

400
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,330
Oh my god.

401
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,730
- It's definitely broken.
- Is he all right?

402
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,770
He got angry easily.

403
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,550
Kui.

404
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,610
I apologize on behave of my
friend for what happened last night.

405
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,890
You're apologize for which one?

406
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,330
Yeah, there's a lot, really.

407
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,490
That's all right.

408
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,930
It's in the past.

409
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,010
During football training...

410
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,370
IG and I have to train separately.

411
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,610
Why?

412
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,810
Well..

413
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,370
he and I had an agreement.

414
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,450
No.

415
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,690
Why does he has to
come for football training?

416
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,410
He told me himself.

417
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,530
If I attend his party...

418
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,530
he'll agree to come
back to the football team.

419
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,410
But he submitted a form to
quit the team this morning.

420
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,850
Shit!

421
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,410
Is it really him?

422
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,810
What's the matter?

423
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,850
IG...

424
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,290
Ruk!

425
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,370
Your photo has reached
tens of thousands share.

426
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,130
What the fuck were you
thinking by kissing him? Look.

427
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,770
[ There is no more tender
kiss than this. Take it 10/10. ]

428
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,330
IG.

429
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,770
Hey!

430
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,850
At first, I thought I was pulling Kui's friend.

431
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,250
But I pulled the wrong person.

432
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,450
That's all.

433
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,570
What are you gonna do next?

434
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,890
I already have a plan.

435
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,410
IG.

436
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,330
I need to talk to you.

437
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,730
Come here.

438
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,810
Let's talk about this to make it clear.

439
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,690
What are you gonna do now?

440
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,330
Are you gonna come back
to the football team now?

441
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,050
Not yet.

442
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,570
You jerk.

443
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,930
I came all the way to this school...

444
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,290
not for you to destroy my life.

445
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,530
2:What-are you doing?

446
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,930
Ruk, this is my last request.

447
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,410
Can you pretend to be my
boyfriend in front of Fangkao?

448
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,490
If you agree...

449
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,170
I'll join the team.

450
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,850
Do you watch too many series?

451
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,530
Yes, I got that from a series.

452
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,690
So in your head...

453
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,770
between you and me...

454
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,050
who'll be the "bottom"
and who'll be the "top"?

455
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,770
I'll be the "top".

456
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,450
You...

457
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,330
will be the bottom

458
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,650
Bottom, my ass.
Are you nuts?!

459
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,490
Whatever.

460
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,250
I beg you.

461
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,890
If you pretend to be my boyfriend...

462
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,610
I'll agreed to join the team, for real.

463
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,530
And no one...

464
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,370
will dare to bully you again.

465
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,770
I don't trust you.

466
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,530
This time, I'm serious.

467
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,490
How can I trust a guy like you?

468
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,050
Last time...

469
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,810
you tricked me.

470
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,930
Ruk.

471
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,090
I have nothing to lose.

472
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,770
I really shouldn't have known you.

473
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,580
It's like you used to say...

474
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,130
no, means no.

475
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,970
But there's
someone who can help you.

476
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,970
Who?

477
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,540
1323.

478
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,850
Whose number is that?

479
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,730
Hotline for mental health hospital.
Don't forget to call.

480
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,290
Fuck you, Ai'Ruk!

481
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,330
Fine.

482
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,250
I'll agree to come back to the team.

483
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,410
You need to dress in a cute
animal-themed outfit to attend it.

484
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,170
Is that so?

485
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,490
It's that guy, right?

486
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,890
Hey, for real?

487
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,890
But he submitted a form to
quit the team this morning.

488
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,810
I beg you.

489
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,450
If you pretend
to be my boyfriend...

490
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,330
I'll agree to join the team, for real.

491
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,850
I'm Kim's girlfriend.

492
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,170
What?!

493
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,090
You broke up with me...

494
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,170
because I'm a football player...

495
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,590
and I'm in 12th grade.

496
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,450
You said...

497
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,870
you and I didn't have
time to be together.

498
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,810
I don't mean any bad intention.

499
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,090
I think you should
focus on your studies.

500
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,130
Then you can graduate
normally like other people.

501
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,130
Why are you here?

502
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,010
I'm here for Kim, is he here?

503
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,250
Why?

504
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,330
Afraid that he might
went out with someone else...

505
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,050
just like you did?

506
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,850
Can you be more respectful
with what you want to say?

507
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,290
No respect...

508
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,130
No respect... just hate.

509
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,690
Fangkao.

510
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,130
Here you are.

511
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,730
I've been looking everywhere for you.

512
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,210
There's Kim.

513
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,210
It's because you're behaving
like this that we can't be together.

514
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,850
What are you trying to do?

515
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,650
I asked, what are you trying to do?

516
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,890
Ai'Ruk?

517
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,870
Ruk.

518
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,170
Kiss me.

519
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,370
The fuck are you talking about? No.

520
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,650
Kiss me a bit.

521
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,930
Hurry.

522
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,450
I said I won't.

523
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,650
The whole school knew
that you and I are boyfriends.

524
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,250
Help me act along with it.

525
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,330
What do you mean act along?

526
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,580
I won't kiss you.

527
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,730
Kiss me, quick.

528
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,290
Hurry.

529
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,610
No!

530
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,810
If you help me...

531
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,650
I'll come back to the
team tomorrow, for sure.

532
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,330
Are you really that crazy?

533
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,580
Just because of one girl...

534
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,450
and you gonna commit suicide?

535
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,530
Who said I was
gonna commit suicide?

536
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,730
I was just walking
and enjoy the view.

537
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,330
Really?

538
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,890
What are you thinking?

539
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,450
Whatever.

540
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,810
I helped you.

541
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,130
Don't forget to come back
for football training tomorrow.

542
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,410
Ruk.

543
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,090
Thanks.

544
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,810
Yeah.

545
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,050

546
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,490
Hello, Dad.

547
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,570
What's the matter?

548
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,530
Why do you sound tired?

549
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,530
I've been very busy with studies lately.

550
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,220
Do you have a new friend yet?

551
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,530
A lot of them.

552
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,290
What are your friend's name?

553
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,810
His name is Khiao(green).

554
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,620
Why is Bangkok people
having someone named "green"?

555
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,250
Dad, don't worry.

556
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,570
All right, all right.

557
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,850
Take care of yourself.

558
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,210
Go to sleep, it's late.

559
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,090
Yes, Dad.

560
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,290
What is it?

561
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,410
That's absurd, I don't believe it.

562
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,530
Guys, have you seen the news?

563
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,090

["Koo-jin" = imaginary couple ]

564
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,650
Isn't that AiRuk?

565
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,210
What's going on with him?

570
