Noine.

18
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,730
Noine!

19
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,330
Noine!

20
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,890
What's, Wrong?

21
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,360
I'm gonna go home now.

22
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,210
Listen to me.

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,370
Right now...

24
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,010
I don't want to pretend
to be your boyfriend anymore.

25
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,170
I rather be your real boyfriend.

26
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,810
I should go home, IG.

27
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,530
Ruk!

28
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,490
Don't forget to think about it.

29
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,170
Why are you sitting here
all gloomy by yourself?

30
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,890
I went to IG's house.

31
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,080
I just got home.

32
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,610
What is that?

33
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,330
I happened to went to the city,
so I bought many food.

34
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,590
Do you go for
soccer practice nowadays?

35
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,530
I practice everyday.

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,210
Good, keep working hard.

37
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,130
Krub.

38
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,410
Which position are you playing?

39
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,530
All of them.

40
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,370
Good, why not play as a striker?

41
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,050
Why?

42
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,850
I was a striker back in my days.

43
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,730
It's a shame, if I was born
the same year as Phiyaphong.

44
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,050
Phiyaphong Would,have not exist.

45
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,130
Yes, for real.

46
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,870
His free kick is very accurate.

47
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,210
- Really?
- Yes.

48
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,620
Noine?!

49
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,650
What's the matter?

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,880
P'?

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,340
You look unusually dull.

52
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,490
Hey, what's wrong?

53
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,570
Strange.

54
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,440
That's unusual.

55
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,450
She seems unusual today.

56
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,850
Yeah.

57
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,770
IG.

58
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,770
Yes, Grandma.

59
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,650
Try to listen to the song in the tape.

60
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,730
Might be some very good songs. there.

61
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,850
Yes, Grandma.

62
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,370
Take a look, take a look.

63
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,250
Shit.

64
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,130
Look at the water.

65
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,010
Oh my God.

66
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,570
- So beautiful.
- Look

67
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,610
So beautiful, right?

68
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,880
This is the haunted pond.

69
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,650
So, is there a ghost here?

70
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,490
Do you think the ghost
is gonna show up for you?

71
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,810
Yeah.

72
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,970
This water seems
to be a little dangerous.

73
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,770
Will there be a crocodile?

74
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,290
Are you crazy, Ai'Kaengsom?

75
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,050
With the water this calm,
if there is one...

76
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,890
it'd jump out and snatch long ago.

77
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,870
Yeah, that's true.

78
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,530
But I do know that
it definitely have fish in it.

79
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,470
Why?

80
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,530
Look, there are farting over there.

81
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,450
There are a lot of them.

82
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,570
The hell with your "fart", Ai'Rang!

83
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,850
It's jumping!

84
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,570
It's the same.

85
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,850
Have we left IG for so long that
he composed his own song?

86
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,650
Look.

87
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,690
P'Mes.

88
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,450
When we will get the money?

89
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,770
We've been waiting for too long now.

90
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,050
True.

91
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,610
Not even a single baht. I want
to go back to Bangkok now.

92
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,050
How about this?

93
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,050
Let's go break into
P'Tunwa's house, shall we?

94
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,250
He might put them in his house.

95
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,450
Are you crazy?

96
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,450
If you break in, you'll get arrested.

97
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,570
So what should we do?

98
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,050
I'll call and check for a sec.

99
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,890
But I think..

100
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,330
he won't answer as usual.

101
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,810
Let's just try.

102
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,570
Let me pass.

103
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,650
It got in.

104
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,970
Did he pick up? Go ahead.

105
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,530
Hello.

106
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,050
Hello, P'Tunwa.

107
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,250
We will be going back to Bangkok soon.

108
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,050
We want to know
when we'll get the money.

109
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,370
I've asked Sis Suang.

110
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,250
She said...

111
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,170
she'll give them as soon as possible.

112
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,450
Anyway, I'll transfer to you as soon as I can.

113
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,770
Alright, P'.

114
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,490
Thank you, P'Tunwa.

115
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,410
How was it?

116
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,850
We will get the money soon.

117
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,890
We can go home!

118
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,410
Where should we head to next?

119
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,930
Let's go for outing, what are we waiting
for? We finally have a chance to do so.

120
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,050
Yes, yes, yes.

121
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,040
Bang...

122
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,720
Khae...

123
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,560
At Bang Khae...

124
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
At Bang Khae...

125
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,280
helping mom sell rice...

126
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,440
you...

127
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
"You" first.

128
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,560
Help mom...

129
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,800
At Bang Khae...

130
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,680
At Bang Khae, just you...

131
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,400
At Bang Khae...

132
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,880
you're helping mom sell rice...

133
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,280
with chicken.

134
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,400
At Bang Phai...

135
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,600
you're selling...

136
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,600
Where is that dog that's been howling?

137
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,080
You coming here without
even a word of greeting.

138
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,240
I was focus on listening
what were you singing.

139
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,560
You wrote it yourself?

140
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,760
Yes.

141
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,200
I wrote it myself.

142
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,360
Let me see.

143
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,200
I remember now.

144
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
You used to sing.

145
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,800
Now, you have to write it yourself?

146
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,800
Ūm.

147
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,400
I wrote it myself.

148
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,120
I just want to help my mom.

149
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
The composer just resigned.

150
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,440
So I wanted to help
compose one on my own.

151
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,120
Whether it'll be good or not...

152
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,400
I have no idea.

153
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,280
Sing it to me.

154
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,000
No way.

155
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,720
If I sing, my voice will sound like a duck.

156
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,440
Sound like a duck or a goose,
I'll be the judge of that.

157
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,800
Just sing it.

158
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
Come on.

159
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
Fine.

What song is that?

169
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,000
Listening to it makes

00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,710
So what's the relationship
between you and Ruk?

333
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,440
What is it exactly?

334
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,310
I saw the photo of you and Ruk kissing

335
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,830
Let Ruk have his future.

336
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,190
He deserves to be loved...

337
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,190
by someone
who deserve to love him.

338
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,110
Don't worry.

339
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,270
There's nothing
between me and Ruk.

340
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,190
What you saw...

341
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,430
was just a play.

342
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,990
Who is it?

343
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,070
Petch?!

344
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
It's me.

345
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,110
What are you thinking
dressing up like this?

346
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,270
I just feel that it looks
good in a weird way.

347
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,990
But you look pretty.

348
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,630
I'm gonna go now.

349
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,070
You like me, don't you?

350
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,030
The reason you've been avoiding me...

351
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,990
is because you like me, right?

352
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,510
Can you kiss me?

353
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,830
I just want to be sure...

354
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,870
if I like you or not.

355
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,070
What are you saying?

356
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,470
You like girls, right?

357
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,230
That's true.

358
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,110
But I want to be certain.

359
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,310
Do you feel it?

360
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,470
Shit.

361
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,070
I feel good.

362
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,550
What about you?

363
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,130
Do you feel the same way as I do?

364
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,790
One more?

365
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,510
I'm blushing now.

366
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,220
I'm not playing Grateen.

367
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,660
Why so grumpy?

368
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,860
Do you miss-me?

369
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,460
There must be something
that you wanted to meet me.

370
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,860
Why do you look so pale?

371
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,460
Are you sick?

372
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,300
I'm fine.

373
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,420
I have something to tell you.

374
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,780
Talking like that, don't tell me...

375
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,390
- Let's break up.
- you're gonna propose.

376
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,420
What?

377
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,180
Let's break up.

378
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,580
If you want to break
up because of others...

379
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,060
I won't.

380
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,060
Grateen.

381
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Grateen!

382
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,100
Grateen, Grateen.

383
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,260
Grateen.

384
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,980
Grateen.

385
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,700
Grateen.

386
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,580
Grateen.

387
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,300
Grateen.

388
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,980
Grandma!

389
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,540
Please check on Grateen.

390
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
How are you holding up?

391
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,580
I'm fine.

392
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,500
Sit here first.

393
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,080
Grateen, what's wrong?

394
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,860
Grateen fainted, Grandma.

395
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,580
So...

396
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,580
We have a car parade
work in the evening, Grateen.

397
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,480
I'm fine, don't worry.

398
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,220
What now, Mom?

399
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,180
What should we do?

400
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,420
How about this, Kaewdtah.

401
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,140
Go make something hot for him to eat.

402
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,290
So he'll feel better.

403
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,780
I'm gonna check on the work outside.

404
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,380
ОК.

405
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,680
Take care of him, Nukrop.

406
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,060
Oh dear, Grateen.

407
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,260
Are you alright?

408
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,060
I'm fit.

409
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,460
I hope it's as true as your words.

410
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,580
Nukrop.

411
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,340
I ask you for real.

412
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,980
Do you still love me?

413
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,300
I do

414
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,300
But...

415
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,100
Because I'm handsome, right?

416
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,500
Perfect, right?

417
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,180
If you leave me, you gonna
have queue to get to me.

418
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,100
You're nuts.

419
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,500
Yeah.

420
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,300
Today, I'll leave school early to watch.

421
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,300
You're adorable.

422
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,900
Breakfast is here.

423
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,580
for my handsome
and well-mannered singer.

424
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,940
Here, here, here.

425
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,940
Breakfast time is almost over.

426
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,390
Eat a ot, OK?

427
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,260
Eat this then take some medicine.

428
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,340
After thaget some sleep then wak

429
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,540
Later..

when you wake up, it would just
in time for our evening job.

431
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,740
No need for sleep,
Aunty Kaewdtah.

432
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm fine, I'm very fit.

433
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,860
Eat a lot.

434
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,570
That's it.

435
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,540
Rest a lot.

436
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,100
Your voice is still cracked.

437
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,660
Eat,a, lot.

438
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,140
Yes.

439
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,420
Eat up.

440
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,140
I made it hot for you.

441
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,500
So you'll get better
and feel relieved.

442
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,380
Take a big bite.

443
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,580
Eat up.

444
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,410
Eat a lot and rest a lot.

445
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,740
Yes, that's it.

446
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,320
Finish the shrimp
porridge I made for you.

I'll clean the bowl for you.

448
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,110
What porridge?

449
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,140
Shrimp porridge.

Yes, it's our first time of seeing
a car parade performance.

456

Yeah.

458

Normally, it's not this late.

Hot.

461
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,100
Let me check on IG first.

Shit!

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,780
Shit!

471
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,980
Hey, he sounds
like a buffalo giving birth!

472
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
He can't sing!

473
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,980
can't sing, let someone else sing!

474
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,300
No, no, no!

475
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,660
Step down!

476
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,140
Change!

What now?

481
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,260
What should we do now?

482
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,340
Can't you sing, dear?

483
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,420
Sore throat?

484
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,140
Try to sing again.

485
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,660
Try to sing, again.

486
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,100
This is what you call...

487
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,140
"the enjoyment that
you'll never get elsewhere."

488
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,740
You're too much.

489
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,940
If that's the case,
then I don't want it.

490
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,580
What should we do now.
Look at that.

491
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,700
What the heck?

492
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,020
IG, what happened?

493
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,020
Grateen is unable to sing.

494
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,180
My mom still let him to go up and sing.

495
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,340
I don't think I can do it.

496
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,180
Look at me.

497
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,620
You can do it.

498
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,220
Trust me.

499
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,580
IG...

500
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,320
I love you.

501
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,900
I think...

502
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,940
