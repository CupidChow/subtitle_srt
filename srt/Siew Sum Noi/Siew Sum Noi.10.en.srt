16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,200
Hello P'.

17
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,020
Where?

18
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,570
I'll go to you

19
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,810
Ruk!

20
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,690
What is it?

21
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,610
What is this?

22
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,970
Are you going to sleep?

23
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,970
It's 4 AM.

24
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,730
Why are you here so late?

25
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,890
Is there something wrong?

26
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,570
Your face...

27
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,090
looks not OK.

28
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,330
Nothing's wrong.

29
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,050
I'm just afraid that one
day you will forget about me.

30
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,970
But in truth...

31
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,130
I'm more afraid that
everyone will forget about me.

32
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,610
Who will for get about you?

33
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,650
Man of mm friends...

34
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,530
appreciate you.

35
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,610
What if I'm not the person that you know?

36
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,830
Do you still want to talk to me?

37
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,730
Why are you acting like this?

38
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,410
If I'm not competent...

39
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,170
not a nice person...

40
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,570
or rich like other people says...

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,690
Will you still want to be with me?

42
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,250
Just about that...

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,460
if it spread out...

44
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,010
I'll call my dad...

45
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,050
I like you.

46
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,410
What did you say?

47
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,050
I like you for a long time now.

48
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,090
I like you since
the first time we met.

49
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,690
At first...

50
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,690
I thought
you're not into guys.

51
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,250
Until...

52
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,890
You were dating IG.

53
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,200
I don't like all men.

54
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,530
IG is a special case.

55
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,290
IG is a special case.

56
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,770
If my dad knows....

57
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,370
that I'm dating a huy...

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,090
he must have hated me so much.

59
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,170
What if it's not IG?

60
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,170
You father loves me so much.

61
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,050
I think...

62
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,250
we can date.

63
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,570
But I don't like you that way.

64
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,570
I only think of you as an older...

65
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,170
Ruk!

66
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,770
Don't interfere!

67
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,890
Ruk...

68
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,970
why did you do this to me?!

69
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,880
Remember this!

70
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,680
- IG
- Ruk.

71
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,250

If I'm not good enough,
be straight with me.

108
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,770
Don't date two people at once!

109
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,970
What the fuck are you doing?

110
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,370
P', haven't you seen
IG's uploaded status?

111
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,730
Why are you so over-the-top
when just reading his status?

112
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,770
It must have a little feeling into it.

113
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,850
IG called and told me...

114
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,290
he accidently saw
Ai'Ruk kissing P'Tunwa.

115
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,050
Kissed P'Tunwa?

116
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,570
Oh, man. How could he do that?

117
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,890
Also, P'Tunwa is really like a ghost.

118
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,570
If he wants to come out, he come out.

119
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,610
When he disappeared,
it's fucking hard to find him.

120
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,810
So, how's P'IG holding up now?

121
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,190
IG...

122
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,890
is still in the acceptance stage.

123
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,290
How?

124
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,650
When our bodies...

125
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,690
face heartbreaking situation...

126
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,690
it will produce a
type of stress hormones.

127
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,600
You, you...

128
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,290
Why do you have an orgasm?

129
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,730
As far as our brains...

130
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,370
it will stop producing happy hormones.

131
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,570
Including dopamine...

132
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,690
and endorphin.

133
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,610
So that grief comes in five stages.

134
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,650
One, accepting the truth.

135
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,490
Second, anger.

136
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,170
Third, coaxing the other party.

137
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,370
Fourth, depression.

138
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,090
So Ai'Ruk and IG...

139
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,170
has been in a conflict for a while.

140
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,050
Ever since they
came back from Nong Saeng.

141
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,450
So I think, he should
be in the fifth stage.

142
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,970
That is to brace
himself and acceptance.

143
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,450
Then back to normal.

144
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,110
Wait, wait!

145
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,890
Hold on.

146
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,090
Do you-want some mint?

147
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,610
Just a minute.

148
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,810
What the fuck is wrong with you?

149
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,530
I'm your senior, you motherfucker!

150
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,730
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,050
I have a plan.

152
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,690
What plan?

153
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,170
I think we need to do a presentation...

154
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,970
of us doing research at Nong Saeng.

155
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,690
The teacher should see how difficult it is...

156
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,960
for us to get the money,

157
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,050
P', you're very wise.

158
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,610
You really deserves to
be the star of our school.

159
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,530
I think this event...

160
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,610
we will surely succeed.

161
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,930
Why are you unhappy?

162
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,130
Sawasdee krub,
o our beloved principal.

163
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,330
Sawasdee krub,
to our beloved principal.

164
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,970
I am the cheerleader
representative of Chatreemit.

165
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,050
We went to Nong Saeng Village

166
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,090
A small village in the northern region.

167
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,090
While there, we had the support of
one particular kind-hearted elder.

168
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,530
We, with all our heart
and strength, did our best.

169
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,250
So we're able to make...

170
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,690
20,249 baht.

171
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,890
So we would like to ask you, Mr. Principal
to help us fill our budget to 100,000 baht.

172
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,450
To support us making our
cheerleading activities this year...

173
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,040
the best we can.

174
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,930
ОК.

175
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,690
Turn on the light.

176
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,490
No way.

177
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,730
I've already made my decision.

178
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,250
And it is final.

179
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,730
I don't agree
with this project anyway.

180
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,210
Jaturamitr Samakkee event...

181
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,570
it comes and goes.

182
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,010
Especially for you, Mes.

183
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,650
You're in 12th grade now.

184
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,610
Use your time to study.

185
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,170
Prepare for your exam.

186
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,090
You should make good
use of your current time.

187
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,730
We have money!

188
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,450
We will have enough, I mean.

189
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,250
It's time for me
to show my killer skills!

190
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,450
You won't expect this for sure,
I'd tell you that.

191
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,930
You won't be able to guess it.

192
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,090
What is wrong with you?

193
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,810
IG!

194
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,850
Can't you see that?!

195
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,770
Pass the ball, IG!

196
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,530
What the hell!

197
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,970
What the hell are you doing?!

198
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,170
Shit!

199
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,210
Gui, why didn't you guard the goal?!

200
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,810
IG, why didn't you pass it to Ruk?!

201
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,450
IG! Pass over!

202
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,690
IG!

203
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,250
How can you not see it?!

204
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,170
Move, let me do it.

205
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,690
Why did you snatch the ball from me?!

206
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,410
What are you playing, IG?!

207
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,170
What are you playing at?

208
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,090
Shit, what the fuck are you doing?!

209
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,130
Don't tell IG that we
were insulting him just now.

210
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,290
OK, OK, sit down.

211
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,090
IG did good.

212
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,210
- It's good.
- It's alright.

213
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,850
How are you? Tired?

214
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,250
A little.

215
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,450
Tired?

216
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,810
Let me buy you
some sweet drinks for you.

217
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,290
Sweet drinks.

218
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,090
I want to drink too.

219
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,690
- It reeks of love in here.
- Fangkao.

220
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,850
No need.

221
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,050
No big deal, I'll buy it.
It'll only take a sec.

222
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,690
Wait a moment, OK.

223
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,050
She's buying him a drink.

224
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,250
Reeks of love in here.

225
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,610
I'm thirsty.

226
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,130
Why are you guys so busybody?

227
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,570
What the hell are you playing?!

228
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,090
- Ai'Ruk, calm down.
- What the fuck?

229
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,730
I told you to pass it to me,
why didn't you?!

230
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,940
I didn't hear you!

231
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,570
How can you not hear it, IG?!

232
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,450
Hey, take it easy!

233
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,450
Don't bring your personal
issue into the game, IG!

234
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,330
That's my business!

235
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,800
Really? Your business?

236
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,570
Yes!

237
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,050
IG!

238
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,650
Calm down.

239
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,210
Let me go!

240
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,450
Ai'Ruk.

241
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,650
What's wrong with you?

242
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,050
Look at your friend there.

243
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,450
Calm down, calm down.

244
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,980
You're home, big boy?

245
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,210
Mom, Sawasdee kha.

246
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,610
When did you arrived?

247
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,370
Just a moment ago.

248
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,240
By the way, Fangkao...

249
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,970
Me and Fangkao are dating again.

250
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,450
You're together again?

251
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,970
That's good.

252
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,740
Ruk was kissing another guy?!

253
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,930
Is that true?!

254
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,930
It's true, Mom.

255
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,210
So...

256
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,810
So what next?

257
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,690
I broke up with him.

258
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,260
You really did?

259
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,690
If I didn't...

260
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,130
how can I bring
Fangkao home with me?

261
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,570
Did you really broke up?

262
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,050
Mom...

263
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,230
Are you deceiving yourself?

264
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,890
You brat.

265
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,410
I raised you, how can I not know...

266
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,650
when my son is really happy...

267
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,370
and when you're lying to yourself?

268
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,970
For us to meet the right person...

269
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,090
it's difficult.

270
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,450
And when we did...

271
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,850
we need to treat them properly.

272
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,930
Fooling other people... you can.

273
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,720
But lying to your own heart...

274
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,970
Think about it.

275
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,450
I'm worried.

276
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,810
Krub.

277
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,380
Very beautiful.

278
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,140
Everything is beautiful.

279
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,060
Beautiful.

280
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,380
Everything from the food and
the person are all beautiful.

281
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,180
Look, my dressing is very beautiful.

282
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,060
Beautiful dress that's
suitable for the Isaan lady.

283
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,940
The food also looks good.

284
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,100
Mom.

285
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,580
What are you wearing?

286
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,580
Today is the Cultural Day.

287
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,740
Cultural?

288
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,820
Yes.

289
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,350
It's our family's cultural day.

290
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,060
Who created this?

291
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,980
Grandma, of course.

292
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Come now, here.

293
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,980
Let's tie this.

294
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,860
It's the Northearn region culture day,
so we need to appear as one a little.

295
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,620
Handsome.

296
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,780
Very handsome.

297
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,020
The mother's beautiful, the
son will definitely handsome.

298
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,020
We have to fit in with the culture.

299
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,540
Have a sit, what do you think?

300
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,940
The food looks so delicious.

301
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,100
I've prepared some traditional.

302
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,620
Wait, we'll eat together.
Wait until I unwrap these.

303
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,980
ОК.

304
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,620
Fangkao has been
calling so many times.

305
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,940
Really?

306
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,980
She didn't call your phone?

307
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,220
Let me check.

308
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,820
She did.

309
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,540
I didn't checked my phone.

310
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,260
Let me take care of it.

311
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,540
- Let me do it.- Wait.

312
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,140
Come, let's eat.

313
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,540
There's a phone call.

314
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,300
Sawasdee kha, my name is Khet
from Thai Tape recording company.

315
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,580
Yes.

316
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,020
I saw a clip of you and your
friends' music performance.

317
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,540
No need to smile like that.

318
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,180
People might accuse
me of having no decency.

319
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
Won't want to let
you walk home naked.

320
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,080
Thank you.

321
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,120
Wash, yourself.

322
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,860
Come son.

323
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,420
What's on you mind?

324
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,060
I want to thank you...

325
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,700
to be nice with Grateen.

326
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,540
I'm not that of a heartless person.

327
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,140
Just be nice with my son...

328
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
then I'll love them all.

329
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,700
As for what happened earlier...

330
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,980
why did the kid
threw eggs at Grateen?

331
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,260
He saw me...

332
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,540
Just be honest with me.

333
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,500
He saw me and Grateen...

334
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,240
He saw me and Grateen... kissing.

335
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,460
But I understand.

336
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,920
People doesn't understand
this kind of thing easily.

337
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,300
True.

338
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,060
I will try to make
the student's parents...

339
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,600
accept me.

340
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Most importantly...

341
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,940
I will make you accept Grateen too.

342
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,540
It's alright son.

343
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,300
Just do whatever you want.

344
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,360
I just want you to be...

345
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,720
a good person in the society, OK?

346
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,140
Don't create any trouble for anyone.

347
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,540
Love and take care of each other.

348
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,580
Thank you.

349
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,780
Who's coming?

350
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,040
Go see who's coming.

351
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,300
Yes Dad.

352
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,460
Thank you so much.

353
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,620
I don't know who
to depend on anymore.

354
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,040
When I get my salary this month...

355
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,500
I'll immediately pay you back.

356
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,360
It's alright.

357
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,620
We're friends.

358
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,140
We should help one another.

359
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,780
It's no bi deal at all.

360
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,020
So...

361
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,300
when Tunwa came
back did you get to see him?

362
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,780
He won't dare to face me.

363
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,400
Why?

364
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,380
It's because of the state I'm in.

365
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,960
Because of his debt...

366
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,360
that I have to constantly moving
from one lace to another.

367
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,900
To the point that I
don't know where to go.

368
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,580
ย He's been gambling ever
since he entered the university.

369
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,940
He spent all the money.

370
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,860
Even the car and the house...

371
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,220
he sold them all.

372
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,000
I forbid him but he never listen.

373
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,380
When his mother got ill,
we had no money for treatment.

374
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,460
When she died...

375
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,540
he came back to me.

376
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,100
So now...

377
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,700
where is he staying?

378
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,260
He's staying in Bangkok.

379
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,500
I heard that he's been cheating
on people's money to pay his debt.

380
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,840
I think...

381
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,160
you (P'Roong) should report this, so...

382
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,580
you won't have to be responsible for it.

383
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,180
You have a son too right?

384
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,160
Who has the stomach
to do that to their sons?

385
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,860
Ruk...

386
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,800
how are you now?

387
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,080
Cheat?

388
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,980
P'Tunwa?

389
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,200
Yes.

390
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,040
I was confused like a
chicken with damaged eyes.

391
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,840
I was pondering day and evening.

392
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,820
Right now...

393
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,280
I can't sleep all day.

394
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,920
At first, I wanted to this a secret.

395
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,920
But I remembered that our
friends came here with him right?

396
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,460
Yes.

397
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,840
The God Guys Gang.

398
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,780
That's the name?

399
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,840
Yeah, them.

400
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,580
If he also cheats on kids...

401
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,260
then he's an asshole.

402
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
So is he still bothering you now?

403
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,380
Worse than mosquitoes.

404
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,260
He kissed me.

405
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,700
Kissed?!

406
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,660
He did that too?

407
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,580
So what did you do about it now?

408
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,500
At that time I was shocked.

409
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,360
But what's more shocking is...

410
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,820
IG found out.

411
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,480
He probably hates me now.

412
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,620
He won't be angry at
you if he knows the truth.

413
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,280
When will I get the
chance to talk to him?

414
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,260
He avoids me when he sees me.

415
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,260
When I look for him he runs away.

416
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,500
I don't know what to do.

417
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,940
Grateen told me...

418
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,900
"Slow and stead
will dominate the world".

419
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,920
Seriously...

420
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,660
that applies to you.

421
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,820
This formula doesn't work on IG.

422
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,180
Dude...

423
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,160
I'm back to ether with Grateen now.

424
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,380
Really?

425
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,060
It's not just a normal back together.

426
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,920
Dad is talking nicely with Grateen now.

427
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,300
I think...

428
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,920
he can't accept it 100%.

429
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,000
He probably doesn't
want to see us suffer.

430
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,600
we're still young.

431
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,220
Follow your heart

432
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,720
I believe that one day...

433
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
Dad will understand us.

434
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,680
I'm gonna hang up now.

435
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,020
But before that can
I take a screenshot?

436
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,920
I miss my brother.

437
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,280
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,660
Make a proper face.

439
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,660
OK.

440
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,560
See you.

441
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,380
See you.

442
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,740
Sure, sure.

443
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,020
Thank you.

444
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,420
See you.

445
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,220
Sawasdee ja, kids.

446
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,060
Sis Suang?!

447
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,180
You kids are all look radiant.

448
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,380
How's your cheer training?

449
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,940
What was the event again?

450
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,660
Jaturamitr Samakkee.

451
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,240
That's right.

452
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,420
When you finish with it,
please show it to me.

453
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,380
How can we finish it?

454
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,220
Because the money...

455
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,300
is only enough for tutoring.

456
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,060
Tutoring?

457
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,320
Yeah, that's what I said.

458
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,900
Yeah, that's what I said.

459
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,060
What is this?

460
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,020
I gave you 200,000,
is that still not enough?

461
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,290
You're a middle school
students, don't overspend it.

462
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,820
200,000?

463
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,820
How dare you say that?

464
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,620
Cheater!

465
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,620
We only got 20,000

466
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,660
120,000!

467
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,820
What?!

468
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,400
I gave Tunwa 200,000!

469
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,400
Here, I have prove.

470
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,300
Here, I have prove.

471
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,180
Here, look at the transaction slip.

472
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,060
See?

473
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,820
Shit!

474
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,180
That means you've been
deceived by Tunwa.

475
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,360
He told me to transfer it
to him and he'll pass it to you.

476
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,640
So is there anything
we can do about this?

477
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,900
Can you help us?

478
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,420
In that case...

479
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,980
regarding Tunwa...

480
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,980
I'll use my contacts to
get him out and handle this.

481
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,380
As for you guys...

482
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,660
no need to interfere.

483
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,620
I'll handle him myself!

484
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,220
I'm sorry for misunderstands you.

485
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,460
- We're sorry too.
- We're really sorry.

486
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,740
Fuck.

487
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,820
P'...

488
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,580
since Sis promised us,
should-we-get back to our cheer activities?

489
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,940
Yeah, that's right.

490
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,340
I got goosebumps,
I think this time...

491
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,980
we will definitely succeed.

492
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,420
It'd be awesome.

493
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,620
Amen to that.

494
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,620
Sa-thu.

495
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,060
Wait, wait.

496
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,820
Don't get to happy about it yet.

497
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,420
If Sis Suang able to catch P'Tunwa...

498
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,820
does that means...

499
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,580
we can get the money?

500
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,860
Think about it.

501
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,060
If Sis Suang able to catch P'Tunwa...

502
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,060
she'd be wanting him to pay her back.

503
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,300
So...

504
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,580
I think it would be too late.

505
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,660
We'd definitely won't be able
to catch up with the football event.

506
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,580
I think the best way is,
we'll go ask him ourselves.

507
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,060
Oh, P'...

508
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,900
Let me tell you,
to get in contact with P'Tunwa...

509
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,260
is extremely difficult.

510
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,860
Lately...

511
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
we called, he didn't answer.

512
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,260
We LINE text him...

513
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,140
he didn't reply.

514
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,060
He's a fucking ghost.

515
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,340
Exactly.

516
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,180
I know where to find P'Tunwa.

517
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,800
Kaengsom.

518
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,860
What are you looking at?

519
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,740
I'm looking at our future.

520
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,980
This will help us
get back the 200,000.

521
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,180
Ai'Tong.

522
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,620
Let's go.

523
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,020
I can't take it anymore.

524
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,780
He's out of it.

525
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,940
P', wait for me!

526
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,540
What you guys up to?

527
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,700
You're acting like kids.

528
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,340
We're looking for your
brother's classmates book.

529
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,140
It's here.

530
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,260
Here.

531
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,780
What are you doing?

532
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,060
Be quiet.

533
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,260
P'Kaengliang?

534
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,540
'What are you doing in
Mom's room, Ai'Kaengsom?

535
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,660
We want to find P'Tunwa's address.

536
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,300
He's in the same class as you.

537
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,140
What for?

538
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,060
We're having some
problem with P'Tunwa.

539
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,520
You got tricked by him, didn't you?

540
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,660
How do you know?

541
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,180
Any senior knows about this.

542
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,420
But most senior from
his class all praised him.

543
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,700
That's your senior.

544
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,140
Ai'Tunwa...

545
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,580
after graduating, he broke
contact with all of his friends.

546
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,260
If when we can contact
him is when he is in trouble.

547
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,220
But he's good person.

548
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,900
Well-behaved.

549
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,740
He won't tricked us.

550
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,660
He will target you people.

551
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,460
By the way...

552
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,500
how did you get to know him?

553
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,620
You again?

554
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,620
The book that you're holding...

555
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,340
is the class that were ages ago.

556
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,060
You guys can go home now.

557
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,700
I'll help you find it.

558
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,740
I'll let Kaengsom pass it to you.

559
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,370
Alright, P'.

560
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,860
Thank you, P.

561
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,380
I knew that he's an asshole.

562
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,500
P'...

563
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,500
It's P'Tunwa's address.

564
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,100
Shall we go and burst in?

565
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,340
Take it easy.

566
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,100
If he's carrying a gun...

567
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,220
someone might die on this.

568
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,100
Careless.

569
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,860
I'm just hot-blooded youth, P'.

570
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,860
P'...

571
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,700
are you doing another party?

572
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,860
What party?

573
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,940
There.

574
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,140
See?

575
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,500
Shit.

576
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,260
I know now...

577
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,300
how to find Ai'Tunwa.

578
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,260
There.

579
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,260
♫ Just by walking here it's
enough knowing that you look ♫

580
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,420
♫ You look, loo and look at
me until my eyes stares like hers ♫

581
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,140
♫ I'm not here with anyone ♫

582
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,740
♫ I came alone and only want to have fun ♫

583
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,180
♫ Just walk in here to forget
about the person who left me ♫

584
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,860
♫ I’m not rich like others ♫

585
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,580
♫ I don't have what others do ♫

586
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,140
♫ I just wanna say that a guy
like me only have true love ♫

587
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,100
♫ I will never abandon you ♫

588
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,480
♫ Nor make you sit in sadness ♫

589
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,780
♫ Even though I’m not handsome,
my heart is sincere ♫

590
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,340
♫ I will give all my heart to you ♫

591
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,580
♫ In my life right now, I only have you ♫

592
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,360
♫ please don’t leave me aside
and pulverize my heart ♫

593
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,740
♫ I met you when I didn't have anything left ♫

594
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,840
♫ Will you accept me on the
day I don't have anything left? ♫
