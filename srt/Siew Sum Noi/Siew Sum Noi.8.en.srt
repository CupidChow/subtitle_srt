17
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,210
Today, the Saengsing band made a comeback.

18
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,570
Applause.

19
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,690
First of all...

20
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,650
I have to thank Auntie Kaewdtah
formaking that shrimp porridge for me.

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,650
Grateen...

22
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,050
you almost gave us a heart attack.

23
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,050
We only have one singer...

24
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,850
and he's allergic to shrimp.

25
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,570
His mouth was
swollen like a goose's egg.

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,660
IG...

27
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,890
do you want be a duet singer?

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,050
That's a good idea.

29
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,120
With IG's singing voice,
he can be a professional singer.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,290
Think about it,
when IG walk from the stage...

31
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,820
the villagers were cheering
because he sings very good.

32
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,930
Yes, very good.

33
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,770
It's a pity that Grandma and
Auntie Kaewdtah are not here.

34
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,410
They probably are
counting money over there.

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,370
Come, let's eat.

36
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,370
Today's meal is very good.

37
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,070
Let's celebrate. A toast!

38
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,050
I'm drinking the
female protagonist drink.

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,170
You said you want
to play the guitar for me.

40
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,250
Play it.

41
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,930
Of course.

42
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,570
You can play.

43
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,890
I can only play 2 chords.

44
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,610
I thought you can really play.

45
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,810
Quit staring at me like that.

46
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,410
As if you're going to eat me.

47
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,050
Can I?

48
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,090
Absolutely

49
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,610
But you have to agree
to be my boyfriend first.

50
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,130
Sure.

51
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,170
For real?

52
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,050
Yes.

53
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,410
Don't go back on your words.

54
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,490
Then...

55
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,810
before becoming my boyfriend...

56
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,370
I'll kiss you one more time.

57
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,650
As a sign reservation.

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,050
I have no objection.

59
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,970
You're too much.

60
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,400
Are you crazy?

61
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,220
This month, next month and the month
after, the queue are all fully booked.

62
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,770
Hello.

63
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,250
Yes, this Saengsing.

64
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,610
Oh yes, what date is it?

65
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,330
Next month, on the 7th, 8th.

66
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,460
You can't for 7th and 8th
because it's fully booked.

67
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,330
We'll be available in the next 6
month, please find a new date.6

68
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,750
This 3 month is really full.
I'm very sorry.

69
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,010
Thank you very much.

70
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,130
Kha.

71
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,570
It's all full.

72
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,610
Money is coming in.
This is money coming in.

73
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,020
Hello?

74
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,070
Correct, this is Saengsing Band.

75
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,330
17 and 18?

76
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, we can.

77
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,090
We're free.

78
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,090
Mom, we can't on 17 and 18.

79
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,330
Yes, we have to.

80
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,050
We can't, give me that.

81
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,890
Hello.

82
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,330
This is Kaewdtah, 17 and 18...

83
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,330
17 and 18?

84
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,330
we really can't.

85
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,410
Yes, we can.

86
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,410
When you want it?

87
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,090
I'll squeeze you in.

88
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,850
Sorry, give me that.

89
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,850
We've received all the deposits.

90
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,970
You can't just accept the job blindly.
You have to ask me first.

91
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,730
This month, next month and the
month after are all fully booked.

92
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,140
If you do this.
we'll be in trouble, you know?

93
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,490
Who hires at a cheap price?

94
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,130
Mom.

95
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,760
No one hires at a cheap price.

96
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,170
This person doesn't agree with the price.

97
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,770
What is it?!

98
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,790
What are you arguing about?
Nobody listens to me.

99
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,750
What is it?

100
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,890
I'm going to the market.

101
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,360
To the market?

102
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,450
So, is your mouth recover yet?

103
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,770
I can speak now.

104
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,770
You can speak now? You poor thing.

105
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,170
Wear a mask to the market.

106
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,530
So you won't be in harm's way and
not being embarrassed. It's very red.

107
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,810
You're going to the market?
OK, good luck.

108
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,090
Good luck.

109
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,370
Mom, you can't do this to me.

110
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,290
It's wrong. Oh,
I look at the wrong queue.

111
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,090
It will increase our income.

112
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,450
The income is not that important
when we can't get the queue right.

113
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,570
Excuse me.

114
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,130
Ruk.

115
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,570
Have a sit and chat with me.

116
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,930
Is there anything, Auntie?

117
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,130
Be straight with me.

118
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,130
You and IG...

119
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,410
what are your guys relationship?

120
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,650
It's hard to say.

121
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,130
Don't be nervous.

122
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,810
I don't have any problem with it.

123
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,970
I just want to be sure
whether you two are dating or not.

124
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,260
Yes.

125
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,650
If it's you...

126
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,770
then I'm at ease.

127
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,130
If you want to date him...

128
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,130
I don't mind it...

129
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,410
if that would make you two happy.

130
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,810
You're OK with this?

131
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,730
That...

132
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,530
he dating a guy.

133
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,130
Why am I not OK with it?

134
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,570
I don't care about it, I don't mind.

135
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,050
Whatever the gender or whatever it is.

136
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,570
Sometimes a relationship between
a guy and a girl doesn't last long.

137
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,970
I don't mind it.

138
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,690
By the way...

139
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,250
Does your father knows about this?

140
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,930
He doesn't.

141
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,690
And I probably can't let him know.

142
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,810
He's a rather difficult person.

143
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,250
Difficult. difficult, difficult.

144
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,570
Can you promise me...

145
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,570
that you won't tell this to anyone?

146
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,290
Of course.

147
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,090
I promise.

148
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,130
Thank you so much.

149
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,090
I'm gonna take my leave now.

150
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,810
Yes, get home safely.

151
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,970
Thank you.

152
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,450
Thank you.

153
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,650
Why did I say that?

154
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,570
Thank you for real.

155
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,650
Yes.

156
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,690
Get home safely.

157
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,890
How adorable.

158
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,160
Uncle.

159
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,690
Uncle, Sawasdee krub.

160
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,130
Sawasdee krub.

161
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,370
Come, have a sit.

162
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,650
Sit, sit, sit.

163
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,610
Where is Ruk?

164
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,610
Ruk is outside, he'll come in later

165
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,250
So, where do
you want to ask him to?

166
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,210
I want to ask Ruk
to play football with me.

167
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,730
Play football?
That's good, doing an exercise.

168
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,490
Is the competition near?

169
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,480
It will be soon, but...

170
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,770
Practice first,
I'll ask Ruk to practice first.

171
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,250
When I'm good at it, I'll go.

172
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,210
- You want to get ready?
- Yes, get my body ready.

173
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,930
Yes, athlete needs
to get their body ready.

174
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,580
But back when I was playing sport...

175
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,970
I don't need to practice,
I'm already expert at it.

176
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,410
I don't need to practice,
I'm already expert at it.

177
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,090
Yes.

178
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,930
Ruk, come on in. Right on time.

179
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,690
P'Tunwa.

180
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,450
I'm thinking about inviting you
for a football practice, are you free?

181
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,490
Yes, absolutely.

182
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,230
Hey, playing football...

183
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,730
During my time, I was the captain
of my university's football team.

184
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,330
Are you really the the captain, Dad?

185
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,120
[ "Dtua yeun" can mean
"Captain" or "Standing" ]

186
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,120
Standing at the side of the field and hand the ball to the team.

187
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,130
I'll be joining for the practice.

188
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,570
At first, I thought you
had moved to the city.

189
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,730
I commit back and forth.

190
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,170
What about your father?

191
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,050
We rarely meet.

192
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,130
Here.

193
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,330
For you.

194
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,290
Expensive stuff like this...

195
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,130
I can't accept it.

196
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,570
I'm sincere.

197
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,890
You have to get used to this.

198
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,130
But it's not cheap, P'.

199
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,770
Ruk...

200
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,610
you're acting like you don't know me.

201
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,570
Just this small thing,
it's no big deal for me.

202
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,250
Take it.

203
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,650
Then, thank you.

204
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,290
By the way, you and IG....

205
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,810
what are your relationship?

206
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,770
IG and I are dating.

207
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,650
Do you know...

208
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,010
if Uncle Yingyod knows...

209
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,530
what will happen?

210
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,690
You'll be in trouble.

211
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,530
You worked hard to get the
football scholarship to study at Bangkok.

212
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,570
You made your father famous.

213
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,370
Besides, your father...

214
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,210
is about to become
the chief of the village.

215
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,570
But if the villagers
know that you like men.

216
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,170
Do you think...

217
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,930
they will accept?

218
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,210
Think carefully.

219
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,370
If you want to date someone...

220
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,050
shouldn't you be dating
someone your father approves?

221
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,410
Ruk!

222
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,650
What I just said...

223
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,130
think carefully about it.

224
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,210
I'm leaving

225
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,690
What are you doing here?

226
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,940
Come here.

227
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,970
Sit.

228
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,650
P'Tunwa wants to claim me.

229
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,730
Tunwa wants to claim you?

230
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,660
Yes.

231
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,330
He has known you for a long time,
did he just realized that he liked you?

232
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,330
I don't know either.

233
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,460
But I know it's weird.

234
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,850
With thing like this...

235
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,170
do you still dare to face him?

236
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,130
I'm not that scared.

237
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,010
But I can feel that...

238
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,170
he's been acting
weird for some time now.

239
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,450
Before...

240
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,930
he's a very close to Dad.

241
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,810
Nowadays,
I rarely see him with Dad.

242
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,130
Tunwa went to study at Bangkok.

243
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,730
He might encountered
some differences.

244
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,370
You should be careful.

245
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,730
Careful not to get stab in the back.

246
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,210
Bastard.

247
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,810
Do you like it?

248
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,210
Do you like it

249
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,050
Are you shy?

250
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,360
Your brother is quite
difficult to understand.

251
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,280
What's wrong?
Are you giving up?

252
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,150
I'm not.

253
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm just sick of him worrying
about what others think.

254
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,400
More than himself.

255
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,320
More than himself.

256
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,120
I don't know why.

257
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,360
P'Nukrop bears
everything in himself.

258
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,720
That's how a perfectionist is.

259
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,520
How far would he go for it,
I have no idea.

260
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,400
That's the reason...

261
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,040
why I'd never break up with him.

262
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,560
I just what to be his comforting spot.

263
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,840
Soft cushion?

264
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,360
How?

265
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,600
Have you ever lean down...

266
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,880
when your shoulder is very tiring?

267
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,920
When he comes home,
I want to be that for him?

268
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,360
When did you start loving him?

269
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,480
Since when?

270
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,480
At that time...

271
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,110
my parents died in a car accident.

272
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,170
Since I was a very small kid...

273
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,080
I have no one else left...

274
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,400
aside from him.

275
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,120
But now..

276
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
having him is better than don't.

277
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,120
What is it? Tell us.

278
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,040
Guys.

279
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,320
I'm dating Ruk.

280
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,800
Shit!

281
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,880
Shit!

282
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,000
Damn.

283
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,120
Give me the money, give them here.

284
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Yes, yes.

285
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,680
Yes, yes.

286
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,160
Is that the extend of your shock?

287
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,360
P', if we don't get the money,
of course we'd be shocked.

288
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,520
Is the family OK with this?

289
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,000
For my family, my mom is chill about it.

290
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,400
She probably knows
about it a long time ago.

291
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,240
I'm not talking about your family.

292
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,920
I mean Ai'Ruk's family.

293
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,920
Kui...

294
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,440
smiling like that,
who's the girl that's calling now?

295
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,040
You're awesome.

296
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,750
Hello. What's up, Petch.

297
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,200
Gui, it's a disaster! Uncle Yingyod
saw the photo of IG and Ruk kissing!

298
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,160
Ai'Ruk!

299
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,240
What are you doing here?

300
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,520
Look!

301
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
How can you do this?!

302
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,960
Dad...

303
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,920
What does this mean?!

304
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,600
It's me and IG, we're...

305
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Are friends!

306
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,000
That photo, we took it just for fun.

307
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,880
For fun?!

308
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,360
Yes, we were just playing with the kiss.

309
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,720
It's a tradition.

310
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,000
Tradition? What tradition?!

311
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,080
Yes.

312
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,360
But the kiss was just for a short moment.

313
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,160
It just happened that someone
took a photo of it and spread it.

314
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,320
Right?

315
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,400
That's right. Like this.

316
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,200
That's true.

317
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,920
If you didn't see that clearly...

318
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
P'Tong can also show you.

319
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,800
Me?

320
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,040
Yes.

321
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,360
Yes.

322
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,160
Ai'Kui, he still doesn't believe us.

323
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Show it to him again.

324
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,120
Of course.

325
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,140
I'll take care of this.

326
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,520
Enough!

327
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,840
What kind of nonsense are you playing?!

328
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,680
Ruk.

329
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,480
Don't do this kind of
thing again, I don't like it.

330
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,040
Yes, Dad.

331
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,800
Why did you kissed me?

332
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,120
The hell with that kiss?!

333
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Why did you open your mouth?!

334
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,140
No!

335
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,960
Thank you so much, guys.

336
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,800
Earlier...

337
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,920
I saw you were smiling.

338
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,440
What smiling?

339
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,760
You saw wrong, maybe.

340
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,240
Someone's voice is high-pitched.

341
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,160
Do you know that a high-pitched
voice shows that you're lying.

342
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,370
Do you like to find someone else' fault?

343
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,840
No.

344
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,560
Only of the people I take interest in.

345
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,440
What about you?

346
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Do you want to find my fault too?

347
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,920
I know, that night...

348
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
you already like me, right?

349
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,640

What's wrong

417
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,820
You're not speaking at all lately.

418
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,780
Well...

419
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,590
You're seem happy...

420
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,270
so I don't know what to talk about.

Don't be mad.

423
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,500
So...

424
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,310
what are you angry about?

425
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,140
Nothing.

00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
If that's the case, why are you angry?

427
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,300
Then...

428
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,510
let's reconcile.

429
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,680
I don't know what you're angry about.

430
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,630
But, let's make up.

431
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,600
Please.

432
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,460
Fine, alright.

00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,900
Is IG here?

434
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,460
He's at his house.

435
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,420
See you later.

436
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,270
Ruk.

437
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:44,910
Ruk.

438
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,740
I...

439
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,070
like you.

440
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,860
I know that.

441
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,540
I like you too.

442
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,340
You're dearest to me too.

443
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,220
I don't mean it that way.

444
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,070
I really like you.

445
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,940
I like you for a long time now.

446
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,060
Can't you tell?

447
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,830
Thank you.

448
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,470
But what we're now...

449
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,390
is good enough.

450
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,700
I think...

451
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,590
you will meet someone
who is suitable for you.

452
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,110
When I said I like you...

453
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,230
I want you to like me back!

454

455
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,910
Understand, Ruk?

456
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,260
But this kind of thing...

457
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,710
can't be forced.

458
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,620
You're dating IG, am I right?

459
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,150
You kissed IG.

460
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,270
That picture was at the party.

461
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,420
I'm not talking about the party.

462
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,880
Listen, P'.

463
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,820
No matter what I'll
be or with whom I'll be...

464
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,160
I can't like you that way.

465
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,940
I'm sorry.

466
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,280

What is it, Dad?

469
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,510
Do you like what we did a moment ago?

470
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,670
No.

471
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,230
I put all my effort into,
how can you not like it?

472

473
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,550
Do you want that?

I will do it for real.

478
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,860

498

00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,710
Dad

501
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,830
Step aside!

502
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,350
Dad, no!

503
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:20,730
Dad, no!

504
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,310
Dad, don't hit him!

505
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,990
Dad.

506
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,190
Don't hit him.

507
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,550
Dad.

508
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:37,070
Dad.

509
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,350
P', call the ambulance!

510
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,400
As for you, go home for now.

511
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,750
Dad, Dad.

512
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,830
Dad, Dad.

513
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:45,870
Dad.

514
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,590
Dad.

515
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,910
♫ Just you coming here makes my heart melt ♫

516
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,070
♫ It melts, melts that I want
to swallow you whole ♫

517
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,950
♫ You didn't come with anyone else, right? ♫

518
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,550

♫ Tell me and I'll find some or you ♫

520
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,670
♫ I’m not rich like others ♫

521
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,390
♫ I don't have what others do ♫

522
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,910
♫ I just wanna say that a guy
like me only have true love ♫

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,990
♫ Nor make you sit in sadness ♫

525
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,550

my heart is sincere ♫

526

528
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,150
♫ please don’t leave me aside
and pulverize my heart ♫

529
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,510
♫ I met you when I didn't have anything left ♫

530
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,430
♫ Will you accept me on the
day I don't have anything left? ♫

531
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,030
♫ The economy is bad,
my house is in troublesome ♫

532
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,270
♫ There is famine,
not enough money to spend ♫

533
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,670
♫ Are you looking at me
from the outside or the inside? ♫
