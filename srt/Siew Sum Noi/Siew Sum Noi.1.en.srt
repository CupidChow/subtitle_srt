I'm from the village called Bang Nong Saen.

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,420
I got a scholarship to become the
football player at Chatreemit School.

This is the first time in my life I come to Bangkok.

Yes, I have.

That's exaggerating.
I'm only gonna be here for awhile.

30
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,050
you won't be able to speak Isaan again.

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,850
Someone who live in the Northern
region can't speak Isaan now, Ai'Pek?

32
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,850
Well, because you're studying in the city.

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,890

There are 500 buses routes.
Think about it.

37
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,970
Yeah, just, try to search carefully.

luggage and they're heavy.

Nong, I saw a ghost.

Most students here are from Isaan.

They can speak Isaan language.

What's wrong with your voice, Chaiya?

104
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,610
It's like a girl's voice.

It's like that since I was born.

You're into guys?

111

whether he wants me to like him or not.

This year, the organizing committee

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,680
If our budget is reduced,
I fear it will damage our reputation.

165
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,000
I agree.

166
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,680
The cheerleading image is
like the spirit of our school.

167
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,400
Aside from the school's reputation,
we're also the face of the school.

168
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,480
If you need a good school's reputation...

169
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,640
you can't reduce the
budget of the music club.

170
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,040
Because we can also
improve the school's reputation.

171
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,480
What sound do you want?

172
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,640
Drums, cymbals,
finger cymbals, saxophone?

173
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,800
We can play all of it.

174
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,640
Ai'Tong, what are you talking about?

175
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,760
The director wants to improve cheu siang(reputation),
not just siang(sound). Are you stupid?

176
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Ai'Katty, why did you insult me?!

177
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,160
You want some?!

178
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,640
Guys, guys!

179
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,000
Can you not butt in, P'?!

180
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm your senior!

181
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Stay out of this.

182
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,760
Go, go.

183
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,800
OK.

184
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,880
Continue.

185
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,560
Stop, stop, stop!

186
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
I said stop!

187
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,640
OK, I understand that every club is important.

188
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,880
But I've decided..

189
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,680
This is all your fault, Ai'Tong. You idiot.

190
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
How's that, P'?!

191
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,520
It's because you were
fighting that the budget was cut!

192
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,400
Serve you right!

193
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,800
You better stop that.

194
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,560
Sorry.

195
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,320
Why don't you guys
find your own budget?

196
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,680
I saw the senior before us
asked for their seniors for help.

197
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,680
Oh yeah.

198
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,400
Then why didn't you
stop us from fighting?

199
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
I didn't have time!

200
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,400
- There were plenty of time. Didn't you see? We were hitting nonstop.
- You guys were fighting fiercely!

201
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,340
If I stop you, would you listen?!

202
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,600
Enough!

203
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,000
It has been decided!

204
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
But one thing's bothering me.

205
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,480
That new guy, who is he?

206
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,400
His name's Ruk, the school brought him here.

207
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,840
Today is his first day.

208
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,760
He's the one who caused our
budget to be cut off, right?

209
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,000
He'll answer to me, I'm telling you.

210
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Let's get him.

211
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,880
Are you looking for trouble again?

212
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,920
Do you want some too?

213
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,440
Sorry.

214
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,720
Pass it.

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,560
Nicely done.

216
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,080
Take it.

217
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,360
Run.

218
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,440
Run, run.

219
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,000
Hurry up, hurry up!

220
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,400
Everyone, we have a new
friend from the Northern region.

221
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,880
His name is Ruk.
He will play in our team.

222
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,760
Take care of your new friend.

223
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,720
Ruk, this is Kim. The team's captain.

224
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Kim, please take care of your friend.

225
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,400
Yes, Coach.

226
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,000
Are you really gonna wear that shoes?

227
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
This is all I have.

228
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,600
I'll give you one tomorrow.

229
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,040
What size do you wear?

230
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,320
42.

231
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,240
We're the same size.
I'm Kui, the goalkeeper.

232
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,280
I'm...

233
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,920
Ruk, I know.

234
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,680
I already got introduced
about you 3 to 4 times today.

235
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,760
Chaiya.

236
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,200
- Natee.
- Yes.

237
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,120
Nathan.

238
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,480
- Kim.
- Yes.

239
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,840
Salabpao.

240
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,680
Kanoon.

241
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,160
Champ.

242
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,560
- Kui.
- Present.

243
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,040
IG.

244
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,480
Why the fuck are you laughing?

245
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
IG?!

246
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,400
What kind of name is "IG"?

247
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,960
Let's just say there is.

248
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,600
IG?!

249
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,960
As usual, he skipped.

250
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,640
Again? Is he gonna graduate like this?

251
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,440
Come, let's train.

252
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Yes.

253
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,400
There really is someone named IG?

254
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,520
Yes.

255
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,440
Ai'Ruk, you're great.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,600
Damn, how did you do that?

257
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,240
Can you do it one more time?

258
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,000
Damn.

259
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,000
Ai'Ruk.

260
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
If you wanna show off...

261
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,320
go back to your hometown for that.

262
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,540
Understand?

263
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,520
This is break time, P'.

264
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,520
I was just kicking the ball.

265
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,600
Ai'Kui.

266
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,080
If IG doesn't want to train...

267
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,430
just let him out of the team.

268
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,760
I don't want to be dragged
down by him, understand?

269
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,680
Ai'Kui.

270
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,520
Is it hurt?

271
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,160
Yes.

272
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,960
P', can you give this to P'Kui?

273
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,960
From whom should I tell him?

274
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,840
It's Noon, also tell
him to call me sometimes.

275
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,000
Sure thing.

276
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,440
Thank you.

277
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,080
IG, come back to practice!

278
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,140
What's wrong with you?

279
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,720
Will you be able
to graduate like this?

280
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,160
- I'm not going!
- IG!

281
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,640
I said I'm not going.

282
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,400
- Let's go.
- No!

283
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,680
Let me go!

284
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,240
IG!

285
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,720
What is Kui doing?

286
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,720
What's his deal?

287
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,720
- IG, let's go
- I'm not going

288
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,240
What's wrong with you?

289
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,720
Will you be able
to graduate like this?

290
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,480
That's my problem.

291
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,700
Get back to practice.

292
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,200
Ai'Kui, let me go

293
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,920
- I'm not going.
- Ai'Kui, what's going on?

294
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,160
- Help me grab him, he's heavy.
- Let me go!

295
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,640
Who the hell are you?

296
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,080
- Hold him!
- Let me go!

297
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,880
- Hold him!
- Let me go!

298
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,560
Fuck, it's blood!

299
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,720
Kui, I won't go to training with
my face wounded like this.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,480
Who the hell are you?

301
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,120
Was that big guy named IG?

302
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,360
Yes.

303
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,160
Did he name himself that?

304
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
What kind of name is IG?

305
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,320
Actually, his name
should be Ai'Chol(prick).

306
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,640
No.

307
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
His mothe
r often goes abroad.

308
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
"I" is from his first name...

309
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,000
and "G" is from his last name.

310
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,040
A girl name Noon
ask me to give this to you.

311
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,480
Which Noon?

312
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,400
Whatever, thank you.

313
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,840
As we close to the football competition, there will
always be a lot of girls giving things like this.

314
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,920
Are you with that
so called god gang, right?

315
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,180
The God Guys.

316
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,880
We're close and we
go anywhere together.

317
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Suddenly there are so
many people following us.

318
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,760
No wonder so many
girls come to watch football.

319
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,000
That can't be help...

320
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,160
because I'm handsome.
Let's go train.

321
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,000
Damn, you so full of yourself.

322
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
Really handsome you are.

323
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,920
Here you are.
I've been looking for you.

324
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,580
Hey...

325
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,960
P'Ruk...

326
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,320
did you hit P'IG until his head bleeds?

327
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,280
I got it from P'IG's Angel's Gang.

328
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,840
They said that you hit
P'IG until he bleed profusely.

329
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,240
Bleed profusely?

330
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
Are they crazy?

331
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,840
That's exaggerating.

332
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,800
The wound is the size of a cat nail.

333
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
Plus, I was just grabbing his bag.

334
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,480
They made it sounds like I killed someone.

335
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,880
That means you still
have no clue who P'IG really is.

336
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,360
Come here.

337
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,480
I'll tell you.

338
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,200
P'IG real name is Intat Gorsaengsin

339
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,560
His mother's name is Kaewdtah.

340
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,680
She is a single mother. She's very beautiful.

341
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,600
She also let P'IG to stop studied for 2 years...

342
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,320
just for him to go in search for himself.

343
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,820
Did he found it?

344
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,520
I don't know, probably he didn't.

345
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,500
Otherwise, he wouldn't come back to school.

346
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,240
Also, during his time out of school, he became a youtuber.

347
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Having a style like rich people...

348
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
to which people like are us won't get to reach.

349
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,520
Let's just say that he's very famous.

350
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,840
Is that so?

351
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,720
That's how it is.

352
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,800
So, you should not get involve with him.

353
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,960
Don't blame me for not warning you.

354
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
I'm worried.

355
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,760
Don't blame me for not warning you.

356
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,100
About P'IG?

357
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,760
I mean you!

358
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,000
Damn, taking advantages now?

359
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,920
I'll kick you until
you fly over there.

360
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,760
IG...

361
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,760
My way, my way.

362
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,560
Give it some.

363
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
That's cool.

364
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,460
Ai'Kaengsom, how can
you do this stuff? So cool.

365
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
This is normal for me.

366
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,960
I tried so many times but can't do it.

367
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,320
What about me? Was it cool?

368
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,920
You are.

369
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
IG.

370
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,520
Is that Fangkao?

371
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,960
The one who's having
her photo taken, right?

372
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,080
He's right, P'.

373
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,040
Go for it, P'.

374
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,280
So?

375
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
What are you gonna do?

376
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,880
Then I'm gonna go see her.

377
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,760
See you.

378
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,540
Go for her, P'.

379
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,200
See you later.

380
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,840
He's so manly.

381
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,160
Look, he's in a hurry.

382
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,240
So quick.

383
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,920
He's full of confidence.

384
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,600
Did you get it?

385
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,320
This is so beautiful.

386
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,240
That's right.

387
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,960
Smile a lot.

388
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,080
Snap it.

389
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,640
- Very beautiful.
- 1, 2, 3.

390
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,290
Fangkao.

391
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
P'IG, is there anything I can do for you?

392
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,760
I'm going home now.

393
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,880
What about you?

394
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,760
Wanna ride home?

395
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,000
No need.

396
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,160
Fangkao will go home with me.

397
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,280
What did you say?

398
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,560
She's with you?

399
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Yes.

400
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,480
What is this, Kao?

401
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,420
Well, Fangkao is...

402
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,760
I'm Kim's girlfriend.

403
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,400
What?!

404
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,440
You broke up with me...

405
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,280
because I'm a football player...

406
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,000
and I'm in 12th grade.

407
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,640
You said...

408
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,120
you and I didn't
have time to be together.

409
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,520
What about Kim then?

410
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,960
How is he different from me?

411
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,720
He and I are in the same team!

412
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,360
I don't mean any bad intention.

413
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,680
I think you should
focus on your studies.

414
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Then you can graduate
normally like other people.

415
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,120
That's all the reason to it?

416
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,400
Why Kao?!

417
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,480
What did I do wrong?

418
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,500
You didn't do anything wrong.

419
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
I just don't love you anymore.

420
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,600
The girl already said it clearly.

421
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,920
What more do you want?

422
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,240
Stay out of this!

423
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,200
You're only an outsider!

424
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,840
The hell is wrong with you?

425
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
What the hell?

426
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,760
IG, you bastard!

427
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,040
What the hell?!

428
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,920
- What the hell?!
- Try me!

429
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,120
Come on then!

430
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
You jerk!

431
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,540
Come on!

432
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,480
P'IG, slowly.

433
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,560
P', slowly.

434
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,320
Calm down!

435
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,760
I can take all 4 of you!

436
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,040
No need for them,
I alone is enough!

437
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,400
- Come on then.
- Come on!

438
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,880
Let him come.

439
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,170
"6 month anniversary."

440
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,500
What is the meaning of this?

441
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,400
You were dating two guys at once?

442
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
We just broke up two months ago!

443
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,040
Let's go.

444
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,480
IG!
- Take it easy, P'!

445
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,920
You bastard!

446
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,940
Come on!

447
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,920
Come on, bastard!

448
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,800
Ai'Tong, get out of here!

449
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,160
I'll make you pay.

450
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,880
P', we should go.

451
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,040
Let's go.

452
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,760
I don't mean any bad intention.

453
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,920
I think you should focus on your studies.

454
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Then you can graduate
normally like other people.

455
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,280
"6 month anniversary."

456
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
What is the meaning of this?

457
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,960
You were dating two guys at once?

458
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,600
We just broke up two months ago!

459
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,200
All women sucks!

460
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,120
Take it easy, P'.

461
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,520
Bro, just come down, man.

462
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,720
I think lately...

463
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,640
our luck is down the drain.

464
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,160
Had a girl but got dump!

465
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,300
We didn't even do
anything for the football event!

466
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
I'm fucking sick of this!

467
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,540
I know now...

468
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,200
how we can find something fun to do.

469
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,880
Do what?

470
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,040
You'll know. I'll tell you.

471
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,680
Why are you bringing me here?

472
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,040
Why does it has to be here?

473
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,920
Are they all asleep?

474
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,480
Why are we here?

475
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,320
Ai'Tong, Ai'Kaengsom.

476
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,840
What's the deal?

477
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,970
Why are you doing it slowly?

478
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,520
Because we have the solution.

479
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,560
We came here in secret.

480
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,880
You came here in secret...

481
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,720
but playing with something big?

482
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,280
Yeah.

483
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,000
So what's the solution
are you talking about?

484
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,720
No need for slow motion!

485
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,480
I have my own way!

486
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,280
Be quiet, P'. We're here in secret.

487
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,240
You've been doing that several times now.

488
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,760
What the hell are you doing?!

489
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,280
Sorry! Sorry!

490
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,880
- Let me go!
- Hold him!

491
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,470
Hurry up.

492
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
Who the hell are you?

493
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,720
Dude.

494
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,280
It's really missing.

495
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,520
If someone found out...

496
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
we're all in trouble.

497
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Yes.

498
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,000
I looked everywhere,
I didn't find it.

499
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,820
IG.

500
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,080
What do you want?

501
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm Ruk.

502
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,160
I'm sorry for causing you
to hit your head the other day.

503
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,840
That's all right.

504
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,480
You seems stressful.

505
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,880
Did you do something?

506
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,080
Huh? No.

507
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,680
This is yours, right?

508
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,800
No.

509
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,000
Mine's at home.

510
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,280
I don't know whose bag is that.

511
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,360
Really?

512
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,000
Then the IPad and
the camera in this bag...

513
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,280
can be thrown away, right?

514
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,600
Don't be rash.

515
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,800
So it's yours then?

516
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,680
No.

517
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,200
Isn't it expensive?

518
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,600
Can you afford to pay for that?

519
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I don't know where the owner is.

520
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,640
Last night, something happened
in the athlete residence building.

521
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,360
I saw this on the ground...

522
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,040
so I took it.

523
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,040
It's yours.

524
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,840
It's not mine.

525
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,720
No idea to whom it belongs to.

526
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,760
The firecrackers were very loud.

527
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,680
The owner might be
panicked and dropped it.

528
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,240
Really?!

529
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,120
How do you know about firecrackers?

530
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,560
I didn't say that someone
sets off firecrackers last night.

531
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,960
You did it, didn't you?

532
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,360
No.

533
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,880
If you're not telling me the truth...

534
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,200
I'll throw this for real.

535
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,600
You will confess to the coach...

536
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,000
or else watch this camera and IPad...

537
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,680
drop to the ground.

538
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,240
Don't do it.

539
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
One...

540
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
- two!!!
- Yes, yes!

541
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,320
Me and my friends did it, I'm sorry.

542
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,840
We were just playing, didn't expect the
firecrackers would light up for real.

543
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,040
That wasn't too difficult, isn't it?

544
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,840
I'm not going
to see the coach with you.

545
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,640
You're such an idiot!

546
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,800
You think you can
threaten me that way?

547
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,120
Such a noob.

548
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,680
Whether I
can threaten you or not...

549
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,160
you'll know soon enough.

550
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,960
- two!!!
- Yes, yes!

551
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
Me and my friends did it...

552
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,840
This kind of behavior
can get you expel, IG.

553
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,760
Endure and
study for just a little while.

554
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,800
Can't you study
and graduate nicely?

555
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,440
I said I didn't do it.

556
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
The whose bag is this?

557
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,160
If you didn't do it,
then who did?

558
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,000
Just admit it.

559
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,440
If you did it...

560
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,040
just admit it.

561
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,040
This is really waste of time, IG.

562
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes.

563
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,960
I did it.

564
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,080
You can expel me
right now if you want.

565
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
A guy like me...

566
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,240
attend school that way.

567
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,240
Sawasdee krub.

568
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,840
Sorry I'm late. I just
watched the security footage.

569
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,320
IG didn't do it.

570
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,840
I also know who did it.

571
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,040
IG.

572
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
IG.

573
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,200
IG!

574
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,760
IG!

575
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,000
What do you want?

576
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,600
I'm sorry...

577
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,680
for misjudging you.

578
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,040
Me and Coach know
now that you're innocent.

579
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,160
That's all right.

580
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,800
Good that you understand now.

581
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,280
However...

582
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,000
everything...

583
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
has a price to pay.

584
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,160
What does that mean?

585
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,080
There.

586
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,680
Behind you.

587
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,960
Good luck.

588
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,400
Noob.

589
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,440
Why are you here?

590
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,000
You did something mean to our IG?

591
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
We can talk about this.

592
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,600
What did you do?

593
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,280
Calm down.

594
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
Please don't.

595
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,840
IG!!!
