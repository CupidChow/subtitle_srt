1
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,880
Han Jianyi.

2
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,280
Leng Sinian has been

3
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,940
locking himself in the study.

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,460
I will definitely do what I promised you.

5
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,680
Doors are meant to be knocked on.

6
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,570
You're in quite a good mood.

7
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,290
Still in the mood to drink here.

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,800
Have you finished dealing with Zhiyao's matters?

9
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,860
The mine is under your control again.

10
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,140
I was supposed to leave today.

11
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,000
I heard about

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
a particularly interesting thing.

13
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,760
Chen Qingyan is going to marry Fang Yanyun.

14
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,520
How could I miss it?

15
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll help you make a scene.

16
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,160
Qingyan, please help me think of something else.

17
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,320
The wedding invitations have already been sent out.

18
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,250
The wedding candies are ready too.

19
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
It's making me dizzy.

20
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,079
Tomorrow you'll be my

21
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,600
official wife.

22
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,250
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

23
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,260
I'm sorry you have to settle for less.

24
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,680
After leaving my family,

25
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm nothing.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,160
I can't even give you a decent wedding.

27
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,280
Not even the traditional betrothal gifts.

28
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,210
I don't care about those formalities.

29
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,760
Marrying you is my blessing.

30
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll show you through my actions

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,080
that you haven't chosen the wrong person.

32
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,610
I also want to show my mother

33
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,370
that we can live a good life too.

34
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,700
Well, let's see how you perform then.

35
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,900
Look at these peonies.

36
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,280
You really are a persistent ghost.

37
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,480
Today is a joyous occasion.

38
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,680
I won't allow you to cause trouble here.

39
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,940
You and I have no more connection.

40
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm just here to offer my congratulations.

41
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
The madam, she's not doing well.

42
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,280
if you don't go back now,

43
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm afraid it might be too late.

44
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,210
Are you sure about this?

45
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,080
He won't come back again.

46
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,440
Between his mother and you,

47
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,420
he will always choose his mother.

48
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,440
You won't be happy together.

49
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,860
Then why are you marrying him?

50
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,580
I have long been in a marital relationship with him.

51
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,730
Will you still take me away?

52
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,400
I'll instruct the kitchen to redo it immediately.

53
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
I am about to marry Qing Yan.

54
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
Why are you doing this?

55
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,380
Am I doing this for myself?

56
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,400
I am doing this to honor

57
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,260
the ancestors of the Fang family.

58
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,740
For your father in the afterlife.

59
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,560
You've really lost your mind.

60
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,720
I will never allow a village girl

61
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,760
to ruin my son's future.

62
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,680
If you dare to see her again,

63
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,260
I'll make sure she doesn't exist in this world anymore.

64
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,120
Do you want to be happy yourself,

65
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,480
or do you want her to live?

66
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,880
Help the young master pack his luggage.

67
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,480
After he rests for a few days,

68
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,800
send him abroad to study.

69
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,800
The gentle breeze softly stirs.

70
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,200
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

71
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,040
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

72
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,640
The breeze gently caresses.

73
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,280
The lake water reflects me clearly.

74
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,480
The lake water clearly reflects my thoughts.

75
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:30,840
Leaves fall rustling, as if you're gently whispering.

76
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,600
Leaves fall rustling, as if hearing your soft whisper.

77
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,930
Leaves fall rustling, as if listening to your soft whisper.

78
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,800
How many times have flowers bloomed?

79
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,200
Flowers bloom repeatedly, rain falls silently.

80
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,840
Flowers bloom repeatedly, rain falls silently.

81
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:42,960
Looking at you, longing to be together, in vain.

82
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,080
Looking at you, longing to be together, in vain.

83
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,280
Looking at you, longing to be together,

84
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,600
yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

85
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,800
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

86
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,440
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

87
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
If determined, if following the heart, if desired.

88
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,300
If determined, if following the heart, if desired.

89
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,840
Delusionally wanting to occupy tender moments.

90
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,690
Delusionally wanting to occupy tender moments.

91
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,160
Your body sways and ripples.

92
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,120
The night ripples and sways like your silhouette.

93
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,360
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

94
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,360
Dreaming back to the past.

95
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,880
Dreaming back to the past, searching for remaining traces.

96
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,280
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles across the sky.

97
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,440
Love has crossed the sky along the vast Milky Way.

98
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,080
Love has crossed the sky along the vast Milky Way.

99
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,840
Love has crossed the sky along the vast river.

100
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,240
How to protect you, what to believe, what is

101
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
How to protect you, what to believe, what is love?

102
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,400
Silently guarding, foolishly.

103
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,120
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

104
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,600
I embrace you with true and sincere

105
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,000
I possess you with a true heart and sincere intentions.

106
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,320
Not in vain to be moved, seeking to love fully.

107
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
Soon to be moved, seeking to love fully.

108
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,400
In vain to be moved, seeking to love fully.
