1
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,460
I'm afraid I'll have to stay by your side for a while longer.

2
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,940
Are you trying to blackmail me again?

3
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,410
Li Eba said he was acting on someone's orders.

4
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,730
They wanted you in the town.

5
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
She has never approved of my relationship with Fang Yanyun.

6
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
I thought publicly refusing the marriage,

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,240
making me the laughingstock of the entire Yunshui Town,

8
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
was her way of getting revenge on me.

9
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,970
I will sever all ties with the Fang family.

10
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,210
I'll go find her now.

11
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
Get out. I didn't mean to.

12
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,500
Brother, I need to ask about someone.

13
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,240
think carefully.

14
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,140
Remember, just leave him breathing.

15
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,000
This should be worth something.

16
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Have you seen this stone before?

17
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,920
If I'm not mistaken,

18
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,519
there's gold inside this kind of stone.

19
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,730
Leng Sinian hasn't been found.

20
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,620
No wonder when we tried to assassinate Leng Sinian before,

21
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,620
he appeared at Yunshui Mountain.

22
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,040
So it was for this thing.

23
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,170
Leng Sinian was previously a military governor.

24
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,160
If he dies quietly this time,

25
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,440
it would solve Lin City's military supply crisis.

26
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,740
Yunshui Town is backed by Yunshui Mountain.

27
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,000
If we want to mine the gold,

28
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,440
those residents who would be affected by the mountain blasting

29
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,840
should be made to leave as soon as possible.

30
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,400
Pour this into the water.

31
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,840
The first time we met, it was a chase to kill.

32
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,500
Now we're being hunted again.

33
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,260
What on earth did he do in the past?

34
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,850
This can't go on like this forever.

35
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,250
We should find a way to restore his memory.

36
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,400
But if he regains his memory,

37
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,340
will he still want to stay?

38
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,650
Maybe he has already regained his memory.

39
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,690
He'll tell you himself.

40
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
How did you sleep last night?

41
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,240
I slept very soundly, very well.

42
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,480
And I also did one.

43
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,090
Where did you get so much money?

44
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,560
I don't want dirty money.

45
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,280
How is money earned through skill not clean?

46
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,780
What exactly have you been doing?

47
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,650
Your skills are so impressive.

48
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,330
Why would she hire you as a thug?

49
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,210
I just wanted to make money.

50
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,890
Didn't I tell you to go out less?

51
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,760
We had a prior agreement.

52
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,460
A gentle breeze stirs your heart.

53
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,800
A gentle breeze stirs your heart.

54
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,730
A gentle breeze.

55
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,040
The lake water reflects my thoughts.

56
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,440
The lake water reflects my thoughts.

57
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,600
Falling leaves whisper, as if hearing your soft words.

58
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,880
Falling leaves whisper, as if hearing your soft words.

59
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,680
Flowers bloom and fall silently, time and again.

60
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:04,960
Flowers bloom and rain falls silently, time and again.

61
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,360
Flowers bloom and rain falls silently, time and again.

62
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,420
Flowers bloom and rain falls silently, time and again.

63
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,880
Gazing at you, longing for companionship, in vain.

64
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,000
Gazing at you, longing for companionship.

65
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Yet unable to resist, the heart persists.

66
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,760
Yet unable to resist, the heart persists on its path.

67
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,160
If determined, if following one's heart, if desired.

68
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,160
If determined, if following one's heart, if desired.

69
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Vainly hoping to occupy tender moments.

70
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,940
Vainly hoping to occupy tender moments.

71
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,840
The night sways, shimmering like your silhouette.

72
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,920
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

73
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,210
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for lingering traces.

74
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,680
Across the vast starry sky, love transcends the horizon.

75
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,760
Love beyond the horizon.

76
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,760
Cherishing you, what to believe, what is love?

77
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,760
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

78
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,360
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

79
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,760
I have you with a sincere heart, singing with pure intention.

80
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,880
In vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

81
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
Not in vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

82
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
Not in vain, the heart seeks to indulge fully.

83
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,240
Not in vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.
