1
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,090
Qingyan, didn't you say you were going to cook for me?

2
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
When you read this letter,

3
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,970
we will be separated by life and death.

4
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,440
Most encounters in this world are miraculous.

5
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,920
How wonderful it would be if you were still A Wang.

6
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,880
We had no suspicions or misunderstandings,

7
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,280
just standing firmly by each other's side.

8
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Since you don't remember anything,

9
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,020
there are no 'what ifs' in this world.

10
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,890
We have long been husband and wife in all but name.

11
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,760
You are the only man in my life,

12
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,320
the greatest blessing heaven has given me,

13
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,820
and also the tribulation I cannot overcome.

14
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,880
Be A Wang once again,

15
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,360
and start your life anew.

16
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,800
You want to give her a grand funeral.

17
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,640
You want to give her the status of the Leng family.

18
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,960
I didn't stop you.

19
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,000
But take a good look.

20
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,280
The way you are now.

21
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,820
Are you forcing me to take away your military power?

22
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,000
For a woman,

23
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,530
are you willing to give up the entire country?

24
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,580
I'm telling you, it's him.

25
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,200
You can know a person's face, but not their heart.

26
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,660
He's being attentive now.

27
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,130
I won't be the military governor anymore.

28
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,400
A gentle breeze stirs your heart.

29
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,120
A gentle breeze stirs, thinking of your heart.

30
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,800
A gentle breeze softly caresses, remembering your heart.

31
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,120
A gentle breeze softly stirs, thinking of your heart.

32
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,760
A gentle breeze softly caresses, remembering your heart.

33
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,040
A gentle breeze softly stirs the heart.

34
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,720
A gentle breeze softly caresses.

35
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:17,800
A gentle breeze softly stirs the heart.

36
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,660
A gentle breeze softly caresses.

37
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,200
The lake water vividly reflects my thoughts.

38
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Leaves fall rustling, as if hearing your soft whisper.

39
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
Leaves fall rustling, as if hearing your soft whisper.

40
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,160
Leaves fall rustling, as if hearing your soft whisper.

41
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,360
Flowers bloom repeatedly.

42
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,120
How many times have the flowers bloomed?

43
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,100
How many times have flowers bloomed and rain fallen silently?

44
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,440
Looking at you, longing to be together, in vain.

45
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,760
Looking at you, wanting to be together, in vain.

46
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,640
Looking at you, longing to be together.

47
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,040
Yet unable to resist, the heart persists.

48
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Yet unable to resist, the heart remains obsessed.

49
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,520
Yet unable to resist, the heart remains obsessed.

50
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:45,880
Yet unable to resist, the heart remains obsessed.

51
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,840
Yet unable to resist, the heart remains obsessed.

52
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
If determined, if following the heart, if as desired.

53
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,840
If determined, if following the heart, if as desired.

54
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:01,120
(Delusions of occupying tender moments.

55
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,520
The night sways and flickers like your silhouette.

56
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,520
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

57
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,280
Alone under the moon, memories surge.

58
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,010
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for lingering traces.

59
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,400
Across the vast starry sky, love transcends the heavens.

60
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,760
Across the vast starry sky, love transcends the horizon.

61
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,160
Cherishing you, what to believe, what is love?

62
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,640
Silently protecting, foolishly pursuing.

63
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,120
I embrace you, asking for truth, singing directly.

64
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,520
I have you, using a sincere heart to sing honest intentions.

65
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
In vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

66
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,720
Not in vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

67
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,000
Soon, the heart will move, seeking only love.

68
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,360
Not stopping, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

69
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,840
Little Du's heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

70
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,280
In vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

71
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,800
In vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.
