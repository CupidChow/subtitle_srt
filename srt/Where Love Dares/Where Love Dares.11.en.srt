1
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,200
Didn't you say you'd leave in a few days?

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
To be honest, I'm leaving tomorrow.

3
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,560
It's only a matter of time before they catch up with us.

4
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
Is this what you meant by doing well?

5
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,080
I went to the Fang family.

6
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
Which part isn't true?

7
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,580
I knew his intentions towards you weren't pure.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
He already has a fiancée at home.

9
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,890
How could you have feelings for someone like him?

10
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,120
One's in heaven, one's on earth.

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,680
You were never from the same world to begin with.

12
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,740
Go out and see the world with Grandpa.

13
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,140
Someone more suitable will come along eventually.

14
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,800
You just want to take back

15
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,930
what belongs to you.

16
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,930
But I've implicated Xiao Dong.

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,440
Whatever you want,

18
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,090
what do you want me to do?

19
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,079
I want Chen Qingyan dead.

20
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,730
I don't know how long it will take to come back.

21
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,480
When did you wake up?

22
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,930
That's not what Grandpa said that day.

23
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,330
Don't let Grandpa deceive you.

24
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,780
I'm not Lin Zhiyao either.

25
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,560
I still don't know how to tell Grandpa.

26
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,020
Didn't I say not to wait for me during the day?

27
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,720
Grandpa, what happened, Grandpa?

28
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,660
I shouldn't have gone to find you.

29
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
My grandfather wouldn't have died.

30
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
It's all because of you.

31
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,520
I will definitely find out the truth about what happened.

32
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,290
Chen Qingyan's grandfather has died.

33
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,450
That woman bullied you so much.

34
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,210
I won't let her off easy.

35
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,450
How I wish it was Chen Qingyan who died.

36
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,890
Then I could focus without distractions.

37
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,200
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

38
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,400
The gentle breeze softly stirs thoughts of you in my heart.

39
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,730
The gentle breeze softly stirs the heart.

40
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,440
The lake water glistens, reflecting me.

41
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,200
The lake water glistens, reflecting my thoughts.

42
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,280
The lake water glistens, brightly reflecting my thoughts.

43
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,080
The lake water glistens, reflecting my thoughts.

44
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
The leaves fall rustling, as if you're gently...

45
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,280
The leaves fall rustling, as if hearing your soft whisper.

46
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,120
The leaves fall rustling, as if hearing your soft whisper.

47
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,320
Flowers bloom and fall countless times.

48
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,800
Flowers bloom several times, rain falls silently.

49
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Flowers bloom.

50
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Rain falls silently.

51
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Dependent, in vain.

52
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,400
Looking at you, longing to be together, in vain.

53
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,560
Looking at you, longing to be together, holding onto hope.

54
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
Looking at you, longing to be together.

55
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,720
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

56
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,640
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

57
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,120
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

58
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,320
If following one's heart...

59
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,200
If insisting, if discussing, if desiring...

60
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,800
Foolishly pursuing.

61
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,000
Delusionally wanting to occupy, preserving time.

62
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Delusionally wanting to occupy tender moments.

63
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,760
Delusionally wanting to occupy tender moments.

64
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,240
The night ripples and sways like your silhouette.

65
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

66
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,040
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for remaining traces.

67
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,720
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for remaining traces.

68
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,280
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for remaining traces.

69
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,960
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for remaining traces.

70
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,320
The Milky Way stretches across the sky.

71
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,040
The Milky Way stretches far, love crosses the horizon.

72
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,240
The stars return across thousands of miles, love crosses the horizon.

73
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
The Milky Way stretches far, love crosses the horizon.

74
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,400
Caring for you, what to believe, what for?

75
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,880
Caring for you, what to trust, what is love?

76
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,360
What to believe, what is love?

77
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,560
Silently protecting, foolishly pursuing.

78
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,880
Silently guarding, foolishly seeking.

79
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:44,920
Silently protecting, foolishly seeking.

80
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,180
Silently guarding, foolishly seeking.

81
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,520
I.

82
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,120
I have you, using a sincere heart to express honest intentions.

83
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,440
Not in vain to be moved, seeking to love fully.

84
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,000
Soon to be moved, seeking to love fully.

85
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,560
The heart seeks to ponder love.

86
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,880
Moved in vain, seeking to love fully.

87
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,280
Not dreaming of moving blue.

88
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,520
Moved in vain, seeking to love fully.
