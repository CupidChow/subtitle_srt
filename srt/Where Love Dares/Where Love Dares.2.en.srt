1
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,690
Why are you here?

2
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,400
Qingyan.

3
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I was wrong.

4
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,120
Qingyan, forgive me.

5
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Let go of me first.

6
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,480
Let go of me. Let go of me.

7
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,440
Let go of me.

8
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,520
Don't you love me?

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,280
What are you doing now?

10
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,560
Let go of me.

11
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,440
Let go of me.

12
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,690
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,300
I came to bring you some porridge.

14
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,690
I didn't expect that out of the blue...

15
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,759
You even made porridge?

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
I didn't make it.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
I bought it at the market.

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Actually,

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,760
you don't need to worry too much about

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,690
what those people said yesterday.

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,680
I believe you.

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,360
You don't know anything,

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,880
yet you believe me?

24
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,680
What's wrong?

25
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,960
Let me see.

26
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,200
I wasn't careful when I was fighting yesterday,

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,760
and

28
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,890
reopened the wound.

29
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,040
I

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,040
might

31
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,160
need to stay

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,320
here with you for a while longer.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,200
Alright,

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,160
then you stay here

35
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,620
and get proper treatment.

36
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,620
Don't move.

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,300
Take the medicine.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,320
Drink it.

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,240
This medicine of yours

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,300
why is it so bitter?

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is carefully brewed for you.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,800
It contains many rare medicinal ingredients.

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,640
Good medicine tastes bitter.

44
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,240
It contains toads and centipedes.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,890
And spiders too.

46
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,140
What are you doing?

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,760
This wound

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,780
is fine if left untreated.

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
That won't do.

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,120
This cost a lot of money.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
We can't waste it.

52
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
This wound of mine

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,760
It doesn't seem to hurt as much anymore.

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,680
It's fine if I don't drink it.

55
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,360
Well, since you don't want to drink it,

56
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,600
and it doesn't hurt anymore,

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,720
let's get going then.

58
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
What? What?

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,320
Go home.

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,660
Let's go, let's go.

61
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,400
Young Marshal,

62
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,240
the people we sent out

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,480
haven't found Leng Sinian yet.

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm afraid he's in grave danger this time.

65
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,620
You go and search for him personally as well.

66
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,850
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,240
It's only been a few days and he's already taking advantage of me.

68
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,840
This debt

69
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
must be repaid with interest.

70
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,240
I have nowhere to go,

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
yet I can't stay here either.

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,610
I still need to find a way to stick around here for now.

73
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,480
Sign it.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,370
What is this?

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,780
Since you're unwilling to leave,

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,800
I can't afford to keep an idle person here.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,400
So,

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,120
starting from today,

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,050
you must work to support yourself.

80
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,930
Master-servant contract.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, right.

82
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,080
Since you don't remember anything,

83
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,480
from today on,

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,080
you'll be called Ah Wang.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,680
A Wang.

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,120
When will I be able to save enough

87
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
money to open a clinic?

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
What's wrong?

89
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,170
Why are you here?

90
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Didn't I ask you to dry herbs at home?

91
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,080
It's too boring.

92
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,940
I don't want to.

93
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,690
What can you do about it?

94
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,620
It's mealtime.

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
Let's make do with what we have.

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,200
Thank you, servant.

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,570
Shopkeeper,

98
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
This price is not acceptable.

99
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,520
It's too cheap.

100
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,000
What?

101
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,520
What's cheap? What's cheap?

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes,

103
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,159
There are only a few items left in stock.

104
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,200
This special offer is only available today.

105
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,880
Folks,

106
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,360
Don't miss this opportunity, it won't come again!

107
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,960
Come and see, come and see!

108
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,680
This doctor is so handsome!

109
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,920
Doctor, I have a headache.

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,840
You have a headache?

111
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,200
Just look at him a bit more and you'll feel better.

112
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,130
What do you mean?

113
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,280
Can't you see?

114
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,840
She likes you. Play along.

115
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,120
Smile.

116
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,320
smile.

117
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,560
No.

118
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
You signed the contract, remember?

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,800
Let me take a look.

120
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,260
How did you get a headache?

121
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,290
I want to see too.

122
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,050
I was here first.

123
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
I belong to her now.

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,460
Please show some respect.

125
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,840
Let go of me!

126
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,960
We did sign a contract, didn't we?

127
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,290
That's right, isn't it?

128
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,770
Excuse me, coming through. Make way, please.

129
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,840
What's going on here?

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,330
Qingyan.

131
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,010
What kind of act are you putting on?

132
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,490
Qingyan.

133
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,400
I know you can't understand this right now,

134
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,680
but I believe one day you'll figure it out.

135
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,880
I am your best

136
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,840
and only choice.

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,920
Qingyan.

138
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,080
Don't be angry.

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
Let's talk this through.

140
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,460
Young Master Fang,

141
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,370
everything that should and shouldn't be said

142
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,930
has been made clear.

143
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,320
Why are you acting like this now?

144
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,720
Qingyan,

145
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,850
She has already clearly rejected you.

146
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,400
you used to listen to your mother so obediently.

147
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,680
Did your mother ever tell you

148
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,010
that behaving like this is very impolite?

149
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
So she's the one who forced a marriage before

150
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,080
and got kicked out of the Fang family.

151
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,610
The old flame isn't extinguished, and now there's another man.

152
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,320
This woman really knows how to play around.

153
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,520
No wonder no one wants to marry her.

154
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,160
Just look at her.

155
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,440
It's truly disgraceful.

156
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,000
Indeed.

157
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't listen to them.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
Let's go home.

159
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,810
Fang Yanyun.

160
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,720
I'll say it one more time.

161
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,000
Take your worthless things.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,680
Get out.

163
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,400
Who could swallow such an insult?

164
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,560
Qingyan, let's go.

165
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,480
How did she leave?

166
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,400
she left quite quickly.

167
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,060
she was just here a moment ago.

168
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,080
It's just as Madam predicted.

169
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,680
The young master met with that woman again.

170
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,800
But I did as you said.

171
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,240
Yes.

172
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
after this incident,

173
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,240
I guess she won't be able to stay here anymore.

174
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,100
this is all for Yan'er's own good.

175
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,240
So she's the one who forced marriage before

176
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,800
and was driven out of the Fang family.

177
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,440
I heard it was to seduce the young master of the Fang family.

178
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320
She deliberately lost her chastity.

179
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,200
Look at her,

180
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,520
she's truly a disgrace to morality.

181
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,050
Exactly.

182
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,640
This woman knows how to have fun.

183
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,480
No wonder no one wants to marry her.

184
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,340
Now she's still being shameless.

185
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,160
Last time because of you,

186
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,040
I broke my arm.

187
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,660
let's see where you can run today.

188
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,440
Let me go!

189
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,120
I didn't expect a little woman like you to be worth so much.

190
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,200
Someone paid a high price this time

191
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,200
for me to have some special fun with you.

192
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,730
Let me go!

193
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,560
Release me!

194
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Still trying to run?

195
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,490
I've got you now.

196
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,320
Let her go.

197
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,490
It's you again, kid.

198
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,380
This time, we'll settle all scores, old and new.

199
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
Ah Wang.
