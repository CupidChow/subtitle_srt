1
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,920
Han Jianyi.

2
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,400
This was prepared especially for me.

3
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,400
Getting married in this place.

4
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,039
Isn't this moving too fast?

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,880
I don't remember anything.

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,880
It's the red string of fate from Yuelao.

7
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,780
What's that delicious smell?

8
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,060
It's the flower cake you love so much.

9
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,200
What are you up to now?

10
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,839
Qingyan, don't misunderstand.

11
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,920
Leng Sinian is keeping too tight a rein on you.

12
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,519
I had no choice but to do this.

13
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
I just wanted to talk to you.

14
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,660
What is there for us to talk about?

15
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,120
I knew he hadn't told you.

16
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,560
You are my fiancée.

17
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
Give me a chance.

18
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,520
Let me take care of you properly, will you?

19
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,290
Qingyan, what's wrong?

20
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,400
I wish to offer this bracelet as an engagement token.

21
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,680
I only wish to spend a lifetime with you.

22
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,330
I will marry no one but Qingyan.

23
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,410
Qingyan, what's wrong?

24
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,760
I really am your fiancée.

25
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,120
This bracelet is the proof.

26
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,170
I once broke my promise.

27
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,820
I don't want to miss out again.

28
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
You say this is my home.

29
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,080
How dare you.

30
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,020
You have the audacity to take my person away.

31
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,170
Leng Sinian, don't forget,

32
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,480
you took advantage of someone's vulnerability by lying.

33
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
That's how you kept her by your side.

34
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,260
If she remembers everything,

35
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,050
she will definitely leave you.

36
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,760
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

37
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,240
Stop your foolish delusions.

38
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,170
How would you know without trying?

39
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,890
What are you going to do?

40
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,540
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

41
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,810
But the person who hurt her the most

42
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,000
If you say one more word,

43
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,330
I'll kill you right now.

44
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,840
I don't remember.

45
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,890
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

46
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,370
If you don't tell me now,

47
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,620
it'll be too late when I remember.

48
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,600
We were really engaged before.

49
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,570
But he abandoned you later.

50
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,020
I've been by your side ever since.

51
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,160
Staying here might help me remember some things.

52
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,290
But I don't want you to suffer too much.

53
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,210
Living in ignorance is what's truly painful.

54
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,090
Then I'll stay with you.

55
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,050
Then I want to live here too.

56
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,370
Because I'm a part of her memories.

57
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,370
Let me stay here.

58
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,940
I'm sure I can help you.

59
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,280
The three of us will live here together.

60
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,919
I've already decided.

61
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,020
If any of you have objections,

62
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
My daughter treated him with sincerity,

63
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,440
but your son has fallen for someone else.

64
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,280
He's in love with a country girl.

65
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,520
Not only did he drive my daughter out of the mansion,

66
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,280
but he also threatened to break off the engagement with my daughter.

67
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,840
Such a great humiliation

68
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,100
is clearly looking down on my Lin family.

69
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,040
Let's cancel the marriage between our two families.

70
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,770
I can't bear such humiliation.

71
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
What are you saying?

72
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,040
The engagement between our children

73
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,600
is a blessed arrangement.

74
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,360
It's truly our Leng family's

75
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,840
Your willingness to marry Zhiyao into our Leng family

76
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,600
is my son's good fortune.

77
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,700
If he really did such foolish things,

78
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,380
I certainly won't let him off.

79
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,440
For a country girl,

80
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,970
he hurt Zhiyao's feelings.

81
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,410
None of this is Sinian's fault.

82
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,120
It's all because of Chen Qingyan's wrongdoing.

83
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,760
She bewitched Sinian,

84
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
causing him to be momentarily confused

85
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,960
and make such a mistake.

86
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
Not only because that woman injured me,

87
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,770
but also put the Yunshui Mountain mining project aside.

88
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,980
I'm afraid my brother will ruin the wedding.

89
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Why don't I take my brother's place?

90
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,520
This is outrageous.

91
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm going to Yunshui Town to see for myself.

92
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
What on earth did he do?

93
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,360
A gentle breeze.

94
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
A gentle breeze stirs your heart.

95
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,160
A gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

96
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,640
A gentle breeze softly stirs... your heart.

97
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,300
A gentle breeze softly stirs.

98
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,360
The lake water reflects my thoughts.

99
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,560
The falling leaves whisper like your gentle voice.

100
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,160
The rustling of falling leaves sounds like your soft whispers.

101
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,360
The rustling of falling leaves sounds like your soft whispers.

102
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,720
The rustling of falling leaves seems to hear your soft whispers.

103
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,920
The rustling seems to hear your soft whispers.

104
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,450
Flowers bloom and fade, rain falls silently.

105
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,320
Flowers bloom and fade, rain falls silently.

106
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,850
Flowers bloom and fade, rain falls silently.

107
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,600
Leaning on each other, in vain.

108
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,320
Looking at you, longing to be together, but in vain.

109
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,180
Looking at you.

110
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,320
Yet I can't resist, my heart follows its own rules.

111
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,560
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

112
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:33,800
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

113
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,840
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

114
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,160
If persistent, if following the heart, if desired.

115
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
If persistent, if following the heart, if desired.

116
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
If persistent, if following the heart, if desired.

117
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,440
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

118
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:13,800
Swaying, your body.

119
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,840
The night sways like your silhouette.

120
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,560
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

121
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,040
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

122
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,560
In dreams, I return to the past, seeking traces.

123
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,440
In dreams, I return to the past, seeking remaining traces.

124
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,600
In dreams, I return to the past, seeking remaining traces.

125
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,920
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, crossing the sky.

126
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, love crossed the horizon.

127
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,400
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, love crossed the horizon.

128
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,440
Believe, what?

129
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Protecting you, what to believe, what is love?

130
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,800
Protecting you, what to believe, what is love?

131
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,200
Silently protecting, foolishly pursuing.

132
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,160
Silently guarding, foolishly seeking.

133
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,440
Silently guarding, foolishly seeking.

134
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,320
Silently guarding, foolishly seeking.

135
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,840
I have your sincere heart and straightforward intentions.

136
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,040
Not in vain to be moved, seeking to love fully.

137
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,160
Soon to be moved, seeking to love fully.

138
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,120
In vain to be moved, seeking to love fully.
