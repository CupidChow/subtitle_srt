1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,040
Mr. Fang and Dr. Chen are such a good match.

2
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,300
How could they cancel their engagement?

3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,000
Dr. Chen comes from a humble background.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,730
Mrs. Fang must look down on him.

5
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,410
I'm sorry, Qingyan.

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,760
you've been wronged.

7
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,720
Then, Sinian and I...

8
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,280
surely won't have this problem.

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Our engagement...

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,560
was arranged by our elders since we were young.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,289
It's exactly what I wished for.

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,000
The Cold family and the Lin family are well-matched.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,480
It's naturally different from us common folk.

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,240
If we're talking about sincerity...

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,500
my love for Qingyan...

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,960
won't lose to anyone.

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,560
General, you should give the clothes to Miss Lin.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm a doctor.

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,880
I know my own body.

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,080
Sinian,

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,960
I'm a bit cold too.

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,970
Zichuan, give her the clothes.

23
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
Chen Qingyan can't stay.

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,770
Dr. Chen, you're finally here.

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,960
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,520
I was delayed by something earlier.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
Miss Lin, where are you feeling unwell?

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,500
I don't feel well all over.

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,640
I'm dizzy, my vision is blurry, and I feel weak all over.

30
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,700
Thank you for your trouble, Dr. Chen.

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,400
Please extend your arm.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,660
I'll check your pulse.

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
Your pulse is steady.

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,240
Your qi and blood are balanced.

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,680
Your breathing is extended.

36
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,810
Your spirit is good.

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,140
She's faking illness.

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,320
Have you found out what's wrong with me?

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,079
Miss Lin, there's nothing seriously wrong with your body.

40
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,410
You just need some rest.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
I see.

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,850
Dr. Chen is young after all.

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,280
Some complex conditions

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,010
are normal to be undetectable.

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,800
Miss Lin, if you're worried,

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
you can ask the Governor

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,880
to find a famous doctor

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,530
to examine you thoroughly.

49
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,579
Dr. Chen, you've misunderstood.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,800
You are, after all, someone Si Nian values.

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,660
I really can't trust anyone else.

52
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,900
I only trust you, Dr. Chen.

53
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,840
Thank you for your personal attention.

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,100
What medicine is this?

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,460
It's for soothing the liver and relieving depression.

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a bit hot.

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,690
You can let it cool down.

58
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,730
What's wrong, Miss?

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,740
It's so bitter.

60
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,250
What kind of doctor are you?

61
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,720
This medicine is both hot and bitter.

62
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839
Who can drink this?

63
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,360
Don't you want our Miss to get better soon?

64
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,480
just say it straight.

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,680
You're full of bad intentions.

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,360
afraid others can't see through you?

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,080
You, go and brew a new batch right now.

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,840
I am Leng Sinian's personal doctor.

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,000
not your Miss's.

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,450
If Miss Lin wants to torment me,

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,780
you've succeeded.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,330
I won't stay any longer.

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,680
This illness of yours, from who knows where,

74
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
go find whoever you want to treat it.

75
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,000
You stop right there!

76
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,480
Is that Si Nian?

77
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't move.

78
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,760
Let me go.

79
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,920
The more you struggle, the more I like it.

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,520
Help!

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,080
Let me go.

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Help! Keep screaming.

83
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,520
Keep screaming.

84
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,050
Are you alright?

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,650
Why are you here?

86
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,000
In the middle of the night,

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,860
I saw him sneaking into your room,

88
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,370
so I followed him in.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,200
What's going on here?

90
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,160
This is Dr. Chen's room.

91
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,770
It sounds like something's happened.

92
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
Dr. Chen?

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,159
Dr. Chen.

94
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,760
What are you doing?

95
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,620
Miss Lin, why did you suddenly come here?

96
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
I heard some noise outside.

97
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I thought something had happened.

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,520
so I rushed over here.

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,700
I didn't expect...

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,640
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

101
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,440
It's alright.

102
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,880
I should really thank you, Miss Lin.

103
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,740
Thanks to you for sending me a man.

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,450
Dr. Chen, have you misunderstood something?

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,850
Misunderstanding?

106
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
This morning, I had just left Miss Lin's room.

107
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,200
when I was knocked unconscious.

108
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,720
Are you saying this has nothing to do with Miss Lin?

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,480
Dr. Chen,

110
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,360
you are the Governor's personal physician.

111
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,840
Even if you were meeting a man in private here,

112
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,640
and I happened to catch you,

113
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
you don't need to sling mud at me, do you?

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
Miss Lin is indeed straightforward.

115
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,880
However,

116
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,140
your plan should have failed.

117
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Si Nian.

118
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
Why is it you?

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,840
Why can't it be me?

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,520
So you're the one who wanted to harm her.

121
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,050
How come even you don't believe me?

122
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,050
Shouldn't you be the one who understands me the most?

123
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
I once

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,840
thought so too.

125
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,000
Come out!

126
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:04,980
Tell me,

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,760
did she send you here?

128
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,760
You'd better tell the truth.

129
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,640
Otherwise, you know I

130
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,880
I understand, I understand.

131
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,240
Yes, yes.

132
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,840
It was me.

133
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,820
I asked him to come.

134
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
You did it.

135
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,760
Zhiyao grew up with us since childhood.

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,039
But these days, you've been constantly

137
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,240
favoring this woman.

138
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,020
Naturally, I won't let her have an easy time.

139
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
Today, whether it was you or not,

140
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,280
or anyone else,

141
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,680
whoever has any ill intentions

142
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,010
towards Dr. Chen again,

143
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,980
there's only one path:

144
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,120
Death.

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,200
Qingyan,

146
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
do you have anything else to say?

147
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Let's forget about today's incident.

148
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
Miss Lin,

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
you've given me a hard time before,

150
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,880
humiliated me,

151
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,410
I won't hold it against you.

152
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,280
But if something like this happens again in the future,

153
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,210
I definitely won't show any mercy.

154
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,250
Come with me.

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,860
Don't move.

156
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,660
You were troubled before.

157
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,300
why didn't you tell me?

158
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm just your doctor.

159
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,720
She is your fiancée.

160
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,460
What could I say to you?

161
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,570
When you're with me,

162
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
you can say anything.

163
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,120
Alright.

164
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,160
I want to leave.

165
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,800
You said before

166
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,560
that when you're healed,

167
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,420
you'd let me go.

168
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,760
Zi Chuan.

169
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,690
Why are you here?

170
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,080
I've already taken care of that man for you.

171
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
He won't say anything.

172
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,600
Thank you.

173
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,880
If that person

174
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,560
had revealed it was me today,

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,600
Si Nian would probably have beaten me instead.

176
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,090
It must hurt quite a bit.

177
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,330
With me here,

178
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,780
I won't let him hit you.

179
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,640
Zi Chuan,

180
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,770
you're so good to me.

181
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Unlike Si Nian.

182
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm definitely different from my brother.

183
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,000
He must have been punished by the General for doing something wrong.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
Indeed, he's a child born of a concubine.

185
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,920
How could he compare to the young commander born of the first wife?

186
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
That's right.

187
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,890
No wonder he's not as good as his brother at anything.

188
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,040
Zi Chuan,

189
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
that article you revised for me

190
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,120
was singled out for praise by the teacher.

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,680
It's even going to be published in the newspaper.

192
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,010
You're really amazing.

193
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,480
I just didn't expect

194
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,100
that Si Nian could actually say such things.

195
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,080
Tell me,

196
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,000
if I had really done something to Chen Qingyan,

197
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,880
would Si Nian really have me killed?

198
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,300
What do you plan to do next?

199
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,160
I'll help you.
