1
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,720
What exactly happened last night?

2
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,050
after Miss Lin arrived,

3
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,570
Madam became like this.

4
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,500
Miss Lin will be here soon.

5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,060
Perhaps the General should ask her himself.

6
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,250
Si Nian, what's wrong with you?

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,330
What did you do to Chen Qingyan?

8
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,880
You were so forward with me.

9
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,460
I just called her over to listen for a bit.

10
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,000
I went back to the city to escort the Marshal last night.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,920
I only rushed back early this morning.

12
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

13
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,340
Last night, we already...

14
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,000
The general was indeed not here last night.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,930
You must be lying to me, aren't you?

16
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Don't let her sully my eyes anymore.

17
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,540
Explain how you destroyed Yunshui Town.

18
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,260
Explain how you caused my grandfather's death.

19
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,560
Explain why you lied about me being your fiancée.

20
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,860
I'll die right in front of you.

21
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,160
It's my fault for not protecting you well.

22
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,290
I also failed to protect Yunshui Town.

23
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,940
Zhiyao, you can't drink anymore.

24
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,520
Are you willing to hurt yourself like this?

25
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,580
The person who was with me that night,

26
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,840
why won't he admit it?

27
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,240
Look at the state you're in now.

28
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,640
No one but him could touch me.

29
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,240
Why can it only be him?

30
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,360
Because I know it can only be him.

31
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,010
I've liked you for all these years.

32
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,040
Your heart and eyes are full of him, Leng Sinian.

33
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,800
Why can't you just look at me?

34
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,800
The person I love is not you.

35
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,780
It's like I've been in a dream.

36
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,010
It seems you've regained your memory now.

37
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,040
Although between us,

38
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,210
so many things have happened, going round and round,

39
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
my feelings for you have never changed.

40
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
I want to try again.

41
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,610
But I still need time right now.

42
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,520
I feel like I can't love anyone anymore.

43
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,010
Are you still willing to be with me?

44
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,100
Time will change everything.

45
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
We still have a long time ahead of us.

46
00:11:59,640 --> 00:11:59,960
The gentle breeze is soothing.

47
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,360
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

48
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:02,840
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

49
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,800
The gentle breeze softly stirs thoughts of you in my heart.

50
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,480
The gentle breeze softly caresses.

51
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
The gentle breeze softly caresses.

52
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
The lake water reflects my thoughts.

53
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,600
The falling leaves rustle, as if hearing your soft whisper.

54
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:14,960
The falling leaves rustle, as if hearing your soft whisper.

55
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,120
The falling leaves rustle, as if hearing your soft whisper.

56
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,560
How many times have the flowers bloomed?

57
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,760
How many times have the flowers bloomed, the rain falling silently?

58
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,680
How many times have the flowers bloomed, the rain falling silently?

59
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,880
How many times have the flowers bloomed...

60
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,360
Leaning on each other, in vain.

61
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,560
Looking at you, longing to be together, but in vain.

62
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,760
Looking at you, longing to be together.

63
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:28,920
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

64
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,960
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

65
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

66
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,460
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

67
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,640
If following one's heart...

68
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,200
If insisting...

69
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,760
If insisting, if following one's heart and desires...

70
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,820
If insisting, if following one's heart and desires...

71
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,120
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

72
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,160
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

73
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,410
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

74
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,600
The night sways with your figure.

75
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,440
The night ripples and sways like your silhouette.

76
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,200
Solitary walk surges.

77
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,320
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

78
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
In dreams, I return to the past, searching for lingering traces.

79
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
In dreams, I return to the past, searching for lingering traces.

80
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,640
In dreams, I return to the past, searching for lingering traces.

81
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160
In dreams, I return to the past, searching for lingering traces.

82
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,520
The Milky Way stretches for ten thousand miles.

83
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,680
Love has crossed ten thousand miles to the horizon.

84
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,360
A love that spans ten thousand miles of river.

85
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,320
Protecting you, what to believe, what for?

86
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:40,840
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

87
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,720
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

88
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,050
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

89
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,360
I have you, singing with a sincere heart and straightforward intention.

90
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,200
Not in vain to be moved, seeking to be unrestrained.

91
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,720
Not in vain to be moved, seeking to be unrestrained.

92
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,760
Soon to be moved, seeking to feel love.

93
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,560
In vain to be moved, seeking to be unrestrained.
