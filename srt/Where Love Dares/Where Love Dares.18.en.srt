1
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,720
If he intended to let you go,

2
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,650
you wouldn't have drunk the soup laced with musk.

3
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,570
I don't know anything about it.

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,060
Actually, after Zhiyao left,

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,580
if we hadn't been born in the Marshal's mansion,

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,080
if we didn't have so many unavoidable circumstances,

7
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,240
would the outcome have been different?

8
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,080
In fact, you and Leng Sinian aren't

9
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,280
without the possibility of happiness.

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,400
But he won't let you go,

11
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,680
nor will he give up his position as the Military Governor.

12
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,140
It's not possible to have both love and career success.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
We actually don't have a choice.

14
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,490
Sleeping will help you relax a bit.

15
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,440
If you really want to put my mind at ease,

16
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,640
then come with me.

17
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,240
I'll tell you the truth about the child.

18
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,880
I can protect you and the child completely.

19
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,459
You shouldn't be alive in this world.

20
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
This was Zhiyao's favorite flower.

21
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,680
I planted it here.

22
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,780
If she hadn't been so persistent,

23
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,850
So you also reminisce when seeing familiar objects.

24
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,450
I'm different from my brother.

25
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
You said earlier that you could help me leave,

26
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,530
but this place is heavily guarded.

27
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,280
Who upset you?

28
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,970
I haven't been good to you these past few days.

29
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,940
I'm not used to the food and lodging at the governor's mansion.

30
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
Let's go back to my place for a few days.

31
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,400
How about I cook for you?

32
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,280
No one can stop us.

33
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
After our child is born,

34
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,490
we'll discuss everything after the baby is born.

35
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,200
A gentle breeze

36
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,160
A gentle breeze stirs your heart.

37
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,000
A gentle breeze stirs thoughts of you in my heart.

38
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,400
A gentle breeze caresses

39
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,800
The lake water reflects me

40
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,200
The lake water reflects my thoughts.

41
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Rustling as if your soft

42
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Falling leaves rustle as if hearing your whispers.

43
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Falling leaves rustle as if listening to your whispers.

44
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,440
How many times have flowers bloomed

45
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
How many times have flowers bloomed, rain falls silently.

46
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,000
Flowers bloom... rain falls silently.

47
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
How many times have flowers bloomed...

48
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,740
Opening degree

49
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,440
Leaning on each other, in vain

50
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Looking at you, longing to be together, in vain.

51
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,680
Looking at you, leaning on each other inside, in vain.

52
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,160
Yet unable to resist, the heart persists

53
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,960
Yet unable to resist, the heart is obsessed.

54
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,280
Yet unable to resist the heart's obsession.

55
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,000
Yet unable to resist, the heart's obsession.

56
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,920
Yet unable to resist the heart's obsession.

57
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,840
If determined, if following the heart, if as desired

58
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,770
If determined, if following the heart, if as desired

59
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,320
Delusions occupy, preserving light

60
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,280
(Delusions occupy, cherishing time

61
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,800
Delusions occupy, cherishing time.

62
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,240
Delusions occupy, cherishing time.

63
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,500
Delusions occupy, cherishing time.

64
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,600
The night sways, swaying your body.

65
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,600
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

66
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,360
Dreams return to the past, searching for traces

67
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,000
Dreams return to the past, searching for remaining traces.

68
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
Dreams return to the past, searching for remaining traces.

69
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,520
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, crossing the sky

70
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,320
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, love crossed the horizon.

71
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,160
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, love crossed the horizon.

72
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
Believe, what for

73
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,480
Protecting you, what to believe, what is love?

74
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Silently protecting, foolishly pursuing

75
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,920
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

76
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,320
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

77
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,650
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

78
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,520
I have you with a true heart, singing sincere intentions.

79
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
In vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully

80
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,220
Not in vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

81
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:51,920
The heart moves, seeking to indulge fully

82
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,280
In vain, the heart moves, seeking to indulge fully.

83
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,840
In vain, the heart moves
