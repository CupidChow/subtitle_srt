1
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,040
Why would I lie to you?

2
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,580
Miss Chen is indeed pregnant.

3
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,080
The meal is ready.

4
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,940
Shall I bring it to you now?

5
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,639
Please let me know if you need anything.

6
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,320
Why are you following me?

7
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,760
Aren't you his adjutant?

8
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
To protect your safety at all times.

9
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,440
I almost forgot.

10
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,250
I can't just swing on a whim.

11
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,360
Didn't your governor say

12
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
that he could fulfill all my wishes?

13
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,610
As long as Miss Chen orders,

14
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Then go prepare a car now.

15
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,300
Now that I'm pregnant with Fang Yanyun's child,

16
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,530
since the governor won't let me leave,

17
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,060
I'll give birth here at the governor's mansion.

18
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,050
Let Chen Qingyan stay in the Governor's mansion.

19
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Actually, I'm quite envious of you.

20
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
She can still make you worry so much.

21
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,180
That's why they say you're capable of great things.

22
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,920
You're being cuckolded and happily becoming a father.

23
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,320
Now everyone in the mansion knows about it.

24
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,340
This bastard child staying in the Governor's mansion.

25
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,330
Either get rid of the child,

26
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,159
or leave with her.

27
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,880
There's no other choice.

28
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,490
It will be like a natural miscarriage.

29
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,480
Put the pears into the pot.

30
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,280
Haven't you added a bit too much?

31
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,840
I thought you had died in battle.

32
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,920
So you're that eager for me to die?

33
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
You lock me up here and then avoid me.

34
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,220
As long as you're willing to stay.

35
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
Everyone in the mansion knows.

36
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,120
This is not your child.

37
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,640
General, don't you even care about your own

38
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,200
reputation anymore?

39
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,930
My affairs are none of their business.

40
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
The general specifically instructed,

41
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,980
you must have proper meals three times a day.

42
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,520
even if you can't eat,

43
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,180
you should think of the child.

44
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,680
This is made with wild ginseng from Yunshui Mountain.

45
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,890
I heard the general personally led people to collect it.

46
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,800
I'm at their mercy.

47
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,260
Your blood is indeed cold.

48
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,760
Why don't you have some snacks instead?

49
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,500
As long as you're willing to stay,

50
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,730
Dr. Chen's morning sickness is so severe.

51
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,600
Are you really not hungry?

52
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,570
You should try to understand Leng Sinian.

53
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,120
He's already fallen out with the Lin family for your sake.

54
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,780
Now you're pregnant with someone else's child.

55
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,880
It's difficult to explain to the Shuai family.

56
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,980
He doesn't want the position of military governor.

57
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,200
If he intended to let you go,

58
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,940
you wouldn't have drunk the soup with musk in it.

59
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,920
The gentle breeze caresses.

60
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

61
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,480
The gentle breeze softly stirs thoughts of you in my heart.

62
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
The gentle breeze softly caresses.

63
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,800
The lake water reflects me clearly.

64
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,000
Falling leaves cover the ground, as if you're gently here.

65
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,840
The rustling of falling leaves seems like your soft whisper.

66
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,360
The rustling of falling leaves seems like your soft whisper.

67
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,000
The rustling of falling leaves seems like your soft whisper.

68
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
How many times have the flowers bloomed?

69
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,860
How many times have the flowers bloomed? The rain falls silently.

70
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,160
Together, yet in vain.

71
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,200
Looking at you, longing to be together, all in vain.

72
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,400
Looking at you, shaping our togetherness, all in vain.

73
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,440
Looking, if it's you, longing to be together.

74
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,600
Yet unable to resist, the heart's law.

75
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,680
Yet unable to resist, the heart's obsession.

76
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:02,800
Yet unable to resist, the heart's obsession.

77
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,080
Yet unable to resist, the heart's obsession.

78
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,560
Yet unable to resist, the heart's obsession.

79
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,280
Yet unable to resist, the heart's obsession.

80
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,600
If persistent, if following the heart, if desired.

81
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:06,600
If insistent,

82
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,480
following the heart, if desired.

83
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,320
If insistent, if following the heart, if desired.

84
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,880
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

85
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

86
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,280
The night sways like your silhouette.

87
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,440
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

88
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,000
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for traces.

89
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,320
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for remaining traces.

90
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,360
In dreams, returning to the past, finding remaining traces.

91
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,200
(The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, love beyond the horizon.

92
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,000
The river stretches for thousands of miles, love beyond the horizon.

93
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,200
Protecting you, what to believe, what is love?

94
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

95
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,840
I hold you, true, singing directly.

96
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,240
I have you, using a true heart to sing sincerely.

97
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,480
Not in vain to be moved, seeking to love fully.

98
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
Soon to be moved, seeking to love fully.

99
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,400
In vain to be moved, seeking to love fully.

100
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,480
In vain to be moved, seeking to love fully.
