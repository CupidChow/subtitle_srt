1
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,680
You are the happiest person.

2
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,400
I wanted to protect you and the child in your womb.

3
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,120
Your A Wang has returned.

4
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,020
But where have you gone again?

5
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,860
You and father are both like this.

6
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
You've taken everything from me.

7
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,410
I've never taken anything that doesn't belong to me.

8
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,810
Then you shouldn't have monopolized Zhi Yao.

9
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,900
If Chen Qingyan sees this,

10
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,079
he would surely be heartbroken.

11
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,140
You should be awake by now, right?

12
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,930
Don't bother looking for a mechanism.

13
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
I never intended for you to come out alive.

14
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,079
How could I be so foolish

15
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,079
to put my life and my child's life

16
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,450
Leng Sinian certainly won't let me go.

17
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,770
So you must commit suicide.

18
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,020
Just like you're really dead.

19
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,160
I'll have someone set up a mechanism in the coffin.

20
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,440
Can I trust you?

21
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,410
Right now, other than trusting me,

22
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,440
do you have any other choice?

23
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,580
Aren't you a medical student?

24
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Can't you even distinguish this level of drug effect?

25
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
The doctor from Shanghai Tongxin Hall

26
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,890
personally prepared the fake death drug.

27
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
You must be so annoying,

28
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Chen Qingyan, in order to leave you,

29
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
In her coffin, I

30
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,040
so that she could escape on her own after waking up.

31
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,040
I nailed her coffin shut.

32
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,240
This is already the third day since she woke up.

33
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,440
This is what makes it interesting.

34
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,970
Otherwise, my victory would be meaningless.

35
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,000
Leng Zichuan, I want you dead.

36
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,640
You finally want to live.

37
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,800
We must save our children.

38
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,159
These people are still ungrateful.

39
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,960
It's a shame, General. You've been so good to them.

40
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
giving them tax exemptions and medicines.

41
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,000
Remember to buy some sacrificial cakes tomorrow.

42
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,450
So this is where you are.

43
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,520
A gentle breeze.

44
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,320
A gentle breeze stirs your heart.

45
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,400
A gentle breeze caresses and reminds of your heart.

46
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,600
A gentle breeze stirs thoughts of your heart.

47
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,120
A gentle breeze stirs thoughts of your heart.

48
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,980
A gentle breeze softly caresses.

49
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,240
The lake water reflects my thoughts.

50
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,900
The lake water vividly reflects my intentions.

51
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,720
Leaves.

52
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Like a whisper, you're gentle.

53
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,280
Leaves fall softly, like your whispers.

54
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,560
Leaves fall gently, as if listening to your soft words.

55
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,280
Leaves fall softly, as if hearing your gentle words.

56
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,800
Leaves fall softly, as if hearing your gentle words.

57
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Flowers bloom.

58
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
Flowers bloom again and again, rain falls silently.

59
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,120
Flowers bloom again, rain falls silently.

60
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,000
Flowers bloom again and again, rain falls silently.

61
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,400
Flowers bloom again, rain falls silently.

62
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:41,840
Leaning on each other, in vain.

63
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,760
Looking at you, leaning on each other, with futile intentions.

64
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,120
Looking at you, longing to be together, with futile intentions.

65
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,720
Looking at you, longing to be together, with futile intentions.

66
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,050
Gaze.

67
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,560
Yet I can't resist, my heart set on its path.

68
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:48,920
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

69
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,180
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

70
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,800
If you insist.

71
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,840
If you insist, if you follow your heart, if you desire.

72
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,840
If you insist, if you follow your heart, if you desire.

73
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,680
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

74
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,640
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

75
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,970
Delusional to occupy tender moments.

76
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,000
The night ripples and sways like your silhouette.

77
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:34,760
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

78
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,920
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

79
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,680
In dreams, I return to the past, searching for traces.

80
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,360
In dreams, I return to the past, searching for remaining traces.

81
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,880
In dreams, I return to the past, searching for remaining traces.

82
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,720
In dreams, I return to the past, searching for remaining traces.

83
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,080
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, crossing the sky.

84
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,680
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, love crossed the horizon.

85
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,080
Love crossed the horizon.

86
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Believe, what for?

87
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Ah.

88
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,160
Cherish you, why believe, what is love?

89
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,520
Cherish you, why trust, what is love?

90
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,040
Cherish you, why believe, what is love?

91
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,320
Silently, foolishly protect and pursue.

92
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,580
Silently protect and foolishly pursue.

93
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,000
I have you, inspiring true feelings and sincere intentions.

94
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,840
Not in vain to be moved and seek passion.

95
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,240
A simple heart seeks passion.

96
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,360
Not in vain to be moved and seek passion.
