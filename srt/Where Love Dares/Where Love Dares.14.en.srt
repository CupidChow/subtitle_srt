1
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,880
Han Jianyi.

2
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,060
What's wrong with you?

3
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,360
If I remember correctly,

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,130
wasn't it thrown away long ago?

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,180
things like washing dishes and cooking,

6
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,020
I'll be with you every day from now on.

7
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,079
You're so busy with countless affairs,

8
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,880
how could you have time for that?

9
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,120
Young Master Fang seems to have plenty of free time.

10
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,450
I'm afraid your leisure

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,329
will only trap you in the Fang family compound in the future.

12
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,240
Even if I'm in the Fang family compound,

13
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm still living in this Yunshui Town.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,530
Unlike you, Governor Cold,

15
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,650
who will leave sooner or later.

16
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,760
I won't be the governor anymore.

17
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,000
I know why you came.

18
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,370
I want to take you to see a place.

19
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,040
The person who affects the plan.

20
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,730
Qingyan, what's wrong?

21
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,900
Qingyan, are you alright?

22
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,280
I'd like to see it too.

23
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,920
These streets and shops that affect mining operations

24
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,380
have all been cleared out,

25
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
and marked accordingly.

26
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,159
They are all confirmed locations of gold deposits

27
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,420
where we plan to conduct further mining.

28
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,020
I invite you, General, to inspect the mountain.

29
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,320
I didn't expect you to have such capabilities.

30
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,360
In the future, it's best not to

31
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,220
readily believe what others say.

32
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,520
Sometimes he acts foolishly.

33
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,800
As his older brother,

34
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,720
you'll need to be more understanding.

35
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,250
But if he causes me trouble,

36
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,720
I heard you hit him because of a woman.

37
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,100
It was because he wanted to silence someone.

38
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,560
But I've heard

39
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,290
you're very protective of that woman.

40
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,500
Everything is for the sake of Yunshui Mountain.

41
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
If you're just putting on an act,

42
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
then let it be.

43
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,720
After all, your choice of marriage partner

44
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,490
Just because her father is the richest man

45
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,170
She will be of help to you in the future.

46
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,040
Quickly remove

47
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
those irrelevant women around you.

48
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,520
Let Zhiyao stay by your side.

49
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,820
What if I don't want to?

50
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
I heard you lost your memory.

51
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,400
It's okay if you don't recognize me.

52
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,159
I can introduce myself again.

53
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,840
I am Leng Sinian's fiancée.

54
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,600
But Sinian told me himself

55
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,800
that I am his fiancée.

56
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,450
He was just playing along with you.

57
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,880
The person Sinian really wants to marry

58
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,690
is someone who can help him.

59
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,680
I'll prove it to you today.

60
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,500
Don't let anyone find out.

61
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,520
No one noticed you left the room.

62
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Your door has been locked from the outside.

63
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,410
They must think you're asleep.

64
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,660
This incense is specially prepared for Si Nian.

65
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,800
After tonight, you'll know

66
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
who he truly loves.

67
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I advise you not to stay here either.

68
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
Father just said

69
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
he allows me to stay here.

70
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,500
If you dare touch my people again,

71
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,840
it won't just be your arm.

72
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,040
I won't give you that chance.

73
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,690
Later, you'll take me back to the city.

74
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,640
Don't you have time?

75
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,840
How long has it been since you've been home?

76
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,559
It's a good opportunity to visit home.

77
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,090
I still have some matters to attend to at the Governor's office.

78
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,960
I just saw her carrying some things.

79
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,540
She went into Leng Sinian's room.

80
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,210
Let me hold you a little longer.

81
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

82
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,120
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

83
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,320
The gentle breeze softly stirs.

84
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
The gentle breeze softly stirs.

85
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,760
The gentle breeze softly stirs your heart.

86
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,000
The lake water drenches me.

87
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,640
The lake water reflects my wishes.

88
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,120
The falling leaves whisper softly like your gentle words.

89
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
Flowers bloom again and again, rain falls silently.

90
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,160
Flowers bloom again and again, rain falls silently.

91
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,480
Flowers bloom again and again, rain falls silently.

92
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,410
Flowers bloom again and again, rain falls silently.

93
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,960
Leaning on each other, in vain.

94
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,520
Looking at you, longing to be together.

95
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Yet I can't resist my heart's obsession.

96
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,200
Yet I can't resist my heart's obsession.

97
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,280
Following the heart, as if...

98
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,240
If you insist.

99
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,160
If following the heart, if as desired.

100
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,090
If insisting, if following the heart, if as desired.

101
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,600
Delusional to possess.

102
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Delusional to possess the tender moments.

103
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,120
The night ripples, swaying your body.

104
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,120
The night ripples, swaying like your silhouette.

105
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,680
...swaying like your silhouette.

106
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,160
Walking alone under the moon, surging.

107
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:25,800
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for remaining traces.

108
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,530
In dreams, returning to the past, searching for remaining traces.

109
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,240
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, crossing the sky.

110
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,280
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, love beyond the horizon.

111
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,080
The Milky Way stretches for thousands of miles, love beyond the horizon.

112
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,600
Protecting you, what to believe, what is love?

113
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,480
Silently protecting, foolishly pursuing.

114
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,440
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

115
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,770
Silently guarding, foolishly pursuing.

116
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,120
I have your sincere heart and straightforward intentions.

117
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,440
Not in vain to be moved, seeking to enjoy fully.

118
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,320
In vain to be moved, seeking to enjoy fully.

119
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,800
Soon to be moved, seeking to enjoy fully.

120
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,400
No longer moved, seeking true feelings.

121
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,200
In vain to be moved, seeking to enjoy fully.

122
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,360
In vain to be moved, seeking to enjoy fully.
