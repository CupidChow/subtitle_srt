1
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,220
I'm afraid I won't be able to kill you.

2
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,120
I advise you to give up this idea.

3
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,840
You can't leave anyway.

4
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,160
why don't you stay here and figure out a way?

5
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,880
see how you can kill me.

6
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,079
What if I leave?

7
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,250
Are you threatening me?

8
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,840
I can't leave now.

9
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,920
I must take you with me today, no matter what.

10
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,650
I can't let you stay here alone.

11
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,820
General Leng still wants to snatch people, doesn't he?

12
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,160
You staying here now

13
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,580
will only give me more headaches.

14
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,410
Since when did you become so considerate?

15
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,240
As my personal doctor,

16
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,490
your wound has already healed.

17
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,650
I just finished bandaging you.

18
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,460
It's soaked. We can rebandage it.

19
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
Why are you making things so difficult for me? What do you want?

20
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,730
I'm just your personal doctor.

21
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
Well, if you really don't want to...

22
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,480
What will it be like in the future?

23
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So it was you following me all along.

24
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,080
After all, you are my doctor.

25
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,450
It's better if nothing goes wrong.

26
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,650
But if you hadn't been following me...

27
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
You faked amnesia to get close to me.

28
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,060
Actually, you really did lose your memory, didn't you?

29
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,840
But none of that matters now.

30
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
As long as you destroy this place...

31
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Will it make any difference?

32
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,840
But I can't put you in danger now.

33
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,760
And if I don't agree to destroy the mountain...

34
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,620
someone else will take over here.

35
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,280
Then you and Yunshui Mountain...

36
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,340
will only fall into an endless abyss.

37
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,520
How did you end up sleeping here?

38
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,420
Weren't you sleeping over there?

39
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
The gentle breeze stirs your heart.

40
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,360
The gentle breeze softly caresses your heart with longing.

41
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,000
The gentle breeze softly stirs Asan's heart.

42
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,920
Gentle breeze.

43
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,080
The lake water reflects my thoughts.

44
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,880
The shimmering lake water mirrors my intentions.

45
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Xiao Bofu, you gently...

46
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,640
Leaves.

47
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:06,960
Leaves fall softly, as if you're gently...

48
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,020
Leaves fall softly, as if hearing your gentle whisper.

49
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,770
Flowers bloom several times, falling silently.

50
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,200
Flowers bloom several times... rain falls silently.

51
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,400
Flowers bloom... (extended ellipsis)

52
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,920
Leaning on each other.

53
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,760
Looking at you, longing to be together, in vain.

54
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,960
Looking at you, longing to be together.

55
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,520
Yet I can't resist, my heart follows the law.

56
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,680
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

57
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,160
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

58
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,880
Yet I can't resist, my heart is obsessed.

59
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,360
Follow your heart, as you wish.

60
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,000
If determined, if following your heart, if as you desire.

61
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,760
Delusions of possession.

62
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,600
Delusions of possessing tender moments.

63
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,240
Delusions of possessing tender moments.

64
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,000
Delusions of possessing tender moments.

65
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,640
Delusions of possessing tender moments.

66
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,040
The night ripples and sways like your silhouette.

67
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,920
Walking alone under the moon, memories surge.

68
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,560
In dreams, I return to the past, seeking traces of humble existence.

69
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,160
In dreams, I return to the past, seeking remnants of memories.

70
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,840
In dreams, I return to the past, seeking remnants of memories.

71
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,800
A galaxy of stars stretches for thousands of miles.

72
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
Love beyond the horizon.

73
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,920
A galaxy of stars stretches for thousands of miles, love beyond the horizon.

74
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,920
What to believe in protection, what is love?

75
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,360
Silently protecting, foolishly pursuing.

76
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,820
Silently protecting, foolishly pursuing.

77
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,040
I have you, singing sincerely and directly.

78
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,680
Not in vain to be moved, seeking to the fullest.

79
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Moved in vain, seeking to the fullest.
