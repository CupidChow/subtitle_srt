Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

2

You don't have to worry about me.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,480
Denis, are you okay?

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,020
Are you okay?

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,980
Do you know why Dongbaek fainted?

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,350
Do you know what he was so busy with?

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,720
You don't care about what he wants or likes.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,990
Min Youdam, isn't this your specialty?

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,570
You're good at using people and then abandoning them.

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,090
Stop pretending in front of me.

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,600
I want to kill you.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,660
Maybe it's because I've been exhausted these past few days.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,850
Also you didn't spend much time with me...

14
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,720
Youdam.

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,440
What if it's because I held onto you

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,940
that made you unhappy?

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,310
I keep thinking about this.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,840
No.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,930
If you think like that,

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,470
tell me right away.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,080
I'll tell you that it's not like that.

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,520
The wound won't hurt anymore for a while now.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,989
It's a bit of a pity.

24
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,610
Because that's one less reason to stick by you.

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,910
I didn't have the right to have you,

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,780
but I was greedy.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,690
It's okay.

28
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,600
Whether it's back then or now,

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,880
I chose you so I don't regret it.

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,500
Because I won't be able to see you while working.

31
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,979
Don't get involved with that jerk.

32
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,550
Come to your senses! He only thinks of you as an object.

33
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,860
You understand me,

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,920
right?

Going to take Seol Dongbaek away from you and protect him!

You can’t leave me like this again.

If I lose you again, I won't be able to live.

65

It's my fault.

You can take me away.

67
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,310
I will give up Seol Dongbaek.

68

It's predicted that this response will continue in the future.
