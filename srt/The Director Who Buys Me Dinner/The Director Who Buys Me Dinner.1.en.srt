or both.

Do you want to date me?

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,660
Director Min, are you practicing acting, too?

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,720
Seol Dongbaek, I’m asking you seriously.

So…

He really is crazy.

21

Hello?

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,070
Hey, is your stomach okay?

26
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,450
My stomach was killing me on my way to work.

27
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,130
You're on your way to work, right?

What?

29

You drank so much last night to celebrate getting a job

33
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,270
now you're late for your first day, great job.

34
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,720
Gosh!

35
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,910
Oh no... I'm hanging up!

My name is Seol Dongbaek, 27 years old.

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,200
Today is my first day at my dream job: Min Entertainment's Performance Planning Team.

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,730
I can now plan the performance of Denis myself.

No.

It should be the Performance Planning Team.

50
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,600
follow me.

51
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,570
My department was suddenly changed?

52
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,630
But I applied on my resume and entry notice for the Performance Planning Team.

53
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,890
Why did it suddenly change?

54
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,040
Take a look,

55
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,110
this is the labor contract you signed, right?

56
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,530
Yes, sir.

What's going on?

69

Let's talk about it another day.

70
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,860
I don't know if there will be another day.

71
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,760
I can't believe I'm seeing Denis on my first day of work.

72
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,690
Can you move aside?

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,670
Okay...

Do you really not remember me?

79
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,530
Or are you pretending to not remember?

80
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,220
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

81

Don't you remember anything?

82
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,810
You really don't feel anything?

83
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,240
Wow...

84
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,690
How could you be so selfish and forget everything.

85

Seol Dongbaek, I’m asking you seriously.

So…

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,340
Seol Dongbaek, let's date.

90
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,070
Yes, he’s crazy.

91
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,250
That's when it started,

92

this weird director's weird behaviors.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,950
Director Min, have some tea.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,960
I wanted a hot drink.

95
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,310

101

Hurry and give me the materials for the meeting.

102
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,190
God, why are you testing me like this?

103
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,210
Forget it.

104
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,320
If he could hear me he wouldn't punish me like this.

105
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,070

Darn it!

116
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,270
I'm so busy why did you call me out?

117
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,290
I was assigned to the Secretary Team.

118
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,220
What?

119
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,030
Aren't you part of the Performance Planning Team?

120
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,230
Exactly, that's what I'm saying, but turns out it's the Secretary Team.

121
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,530
I don't even know how to write "secretary".

122
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,080
Should I just quit?

123
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,180
Should I just apply for another company?

124
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,610
Even if you transfer to another company,

125
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,080
can you find a better department than Min Entertainment's Secretary Team?

126
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,180
Darn it!

127
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,340
Let's think of this nicely,

128
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,120
whichever department it is

129
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,900
as long as you have work experience you won't have to start from the bottom.

130
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,110
Also, who knows?

131
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,310
Maybe one day you'll be transferred to the Performance Planning Team.

132
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,550
That's true...

133

Hey, is Director Min always like this?

134
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,650
He's a bit strange.

135
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,380
Why?

136
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,490
When we first met he mentioned dating...

137
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,190
Nevermind.

138
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,980
Director Min is a bit picky but he's not a strange person.

139
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,780
You jerk, already talking behind your boss's back.

140
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,070
I'm leaving if you're going to keep talking nonsense.

142
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,560
Denis is especially sensitive today,

143
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,610
it's pure torture.

144
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,100
Hey! Hey!

145
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,460
How can I go to school again?

146
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,200
Monthly rent, tuition, credit card and living expenses.

147
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,500
Since I already started working,

148
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,510
like Kihong said, my goal is to find a chance to transfer to another department.

149
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,470
Okay! Thank you.

150
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,180

152
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,630
Yes.

153
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,320
What are you doing?

154
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,890
I haven't finished the work you assigned.

155
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,210
You don't have to finish it today.

156
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,880
Really?

157
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,360
Anyways, do you have any plans after work?

158
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,450
No.

159
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,990
If you don't have any plans,

160
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,210
have dinner with me.

161
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,340
What? Me?

162
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's meet in the lobby in half an hour and leave together.

163
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,400
Do you like the food?

164
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,610
Yes.

165
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,540
It's so delicious that I can't tell if my mouth is enjoying it or my nose is enjoying it.

166
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,730
That's good.

167

But, why did you want to eat with me?

168
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,990
Because we need to date.

169
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,200
I guess I really should quit.

170
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,650
(On the next episode)

171
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,260
But I'm a man.

172
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,520
Do you think I don't know that?

173
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,110
Even if we put aside the fact that I'm a man,

174
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,780
how can you date someone you don't even know?

175
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Ouch!

176
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,000
Can't you just love me on your own then?

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,980
What do you mean?

178
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,570
Since you're involved you should love me, too.

179
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,620
You have a heart-shaped mole on your chest, right?

180
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,980
What... how did he know?

181
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,820
Director Min, did you put a curse on me

182
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,290
because I didn't agree to date you yesterday?

183
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,260
Calm down

184
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,620
and listen to me.

185
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,070
You're only feeling pain right now

186
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,660
but if you keep refusing to date me,

187
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,650
you might really die.

188
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm... I'm going to die?

189
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,680
If you don't believe me, you can try.

190
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,820
Director Min,

191
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,280
is having dinner together considered as dating?

192
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,010
Then when will the curse end?

193
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,920
When I really fall in love with you.

194
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,200
I thought I could just

195
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,280
date and marry normally like others.

196
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,380
Seol Dongbaek.

197
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,040
Seriously.

198
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,620
Director Min, what are you doing?

199
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,630
Don't act like a virgin and make a fuss about it.
