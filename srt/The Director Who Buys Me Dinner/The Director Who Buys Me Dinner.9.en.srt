1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,880
Director,

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
it's been a while since we last had dinner together,

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,710
do you want to eat together?

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,460
You want to have dinner at this hour?

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,030
Do you think I'm doing this because I'm hungry?

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,810
I'm doing this because I want to go to your house.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,770
I want to go to your house today.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,810
I noticed when I first came here,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,080
that there's someone living in this home but it's so empty.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,210
If I still haven't appeared in front of you,

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,340
what would you have done?

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,410
I would've kept waiting.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,950
From now on, let's do everything together one by one.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,070
I will become Youdam's trace from now on.

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,090
Don't ever turn your back on me again.

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,180
I'm not done talking yet, don't just leave me alone like this!

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,120
Why are you taking so many pills?

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,620
Tranquilizer.

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,390
When did you start taking it?

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,770
I don't know I can't remember.

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,130
Don't take so much medicine.

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,570
Calm down.

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,830
I'll help you.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,450
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,850
You did a great job.

26
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,110
Good job.

27
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,570
You look pale.

28
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,580
I'm not feeling well today.

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,470
I’ll go hug you after I finish my work.

30
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,370
Seol Dongbaek.

31
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,740
(The Director Who Buys Me Dinner. Episode 9: Words I haven’t said yet.)

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,840
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,820
It's not that serious.

34
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,530
I'll probably get better after getting some sleep at home.

35
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,740
But still...

36
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,010
You don't have to worry about me.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,740
Denis, are you okay?

38
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,920
Are you okay?

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,410
What's wrong with you? You should've sent him to the hospital right away.

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,550
It's all your fault.

41
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,380
What?

42
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,920
You make people miserable.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,220
Don’t you know?

44
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,010
Do you know why Dongbaek fainted?

45
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,980
Do you know what he was so busy with?

46
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,360
You don't care about what he wants or likes.

47
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,700
Min Youdam, isn't this your specialty?

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,579
You're good at using people and then abandoning them.

49
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,460
Stop pretending in front of me.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,940
I want to kill you.

51
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,460
Let's go.

52
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,120
Are you okay?

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,590
What's wrong?

54
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,890
I'm really fine.

55
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,670
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

56
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,149
I feel much better after taking a nap.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,280
Maybe it's because I've been exhausted these past few days.

58
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Also you didn't spend much time with me...

59
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,230
Exhaustion?

60
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,770
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry,

61
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,480
but there was a small problem in the Performance Planning Team.

62
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,680
I promised to help them do Denis' stage design.

63
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,909
Youdam.

64
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,380
It's all my fault.

65
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,710
What if it's because I held onto you

66
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,080
that made you unhappy?

67
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,550
I keep thinking about this.

68
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,760
No.

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,440
If you think like that, tell me right away.

70
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,730
I'll tell you that it's not like that.

71
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,180
When did you wake up?

72
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,440
Just now.

73
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,880
You're lying, your face isn't swollen at all.

74
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,200
Yet I'm too sleepy to even open my eyes.

75
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,130
I usually don't swell easily.

76
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,390
Let me see.

77
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,560
You're indeed a little swollen.

78
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,340
Come on.

79
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,940
The wound won't hurt anymore for a while now.

80
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,430
It's a bit of a pity.

81
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,590
Why?

82
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,450
Because that's one less reason to stick by you.

83
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,250
Even if there's no reason...

84
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,840
What do you mean?

85
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,870
You must be hungry, do you want to eat breakfast? I'll cook for you.

86
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,390
Do you know how to cook?

87
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,090
I can cook kimchi fried rice.

88
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,700
How can I let a sick person cook?

89
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,630
I'll cook for you, just wait.

90
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,420
Okay.

91
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,440
I...

92
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,290
have something that I haven't told you yet.

93
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,870
What? What is it?

94
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,790
In the past, I mean, in your past life,

95
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:03,550
you were killed because of me.

96
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,790
You killed me?

97
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,140
Didn't you tell me that I left without saying goodbye?

98
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,650
I forgot about this,

99
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,800
because I felt too guilty towards you.

100
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,530
I didn't have the right to have you,

101
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,320
but I was greedy.

102
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,680
Because of me,

103
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,210
you were killed in front of me. I saw it all.

104
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,780
It's okay.

105
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,400
I don't remember anything anyways.

107
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,210
Even if I did remember,

108
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,290
whether it's back then or now,

109
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,160
I chose you so I don't regret it.

110
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,690
Are you leaving already?

111
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,780
If I leave later there might be a traffic jam.

112
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,700
Then help me take a look at this before you leave.

113
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,160
Because I won't be able to see you while working.

114
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,480
(Denis)

115
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,330
I have to get rid of him.

116
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,470
(I'm going home now. Where are you, sir?)

117
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,900
I'm going home now.
(I'm going home now. Where are you, sir?)

118
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,530
Where are you, sir?

119
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,160
What are you doing, Denis?

120
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,160
Where's Min Youdam?

121
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,780
Why?

122
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,590
Don't get involved with that jerk.

123
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,800
What are you talking about suddenly?

124
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,360
Come to your senses! He only thinks of you as an object.

125
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,330
Denis.

126
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,690
He's always been like this,

127
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,830
abandoning people after he's done using them.

128
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,280
I'm used to it.

129
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,860
I tried my best to not be abandoned by him, but look at me.

130
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,120
Look at me!

131
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,450
You understand me,

132
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,490
right?

133
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,000
You are

134
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,800
the only person who can understand me, right?

135
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,140
(Director)

136
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,890
Denis, let go of me.

137
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,580
I need to take this call.

138
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,890
Hello?

139
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,360
I’m almost at the company parking lot.

140
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,410
Dongbaek, is something wrong?

141
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,700
Dongbaek, are you okay? What’s wrong?

142
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,330
I’m fine... I’ll go down now.

143
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,400
(The Director Who Buys Me Dinner)
