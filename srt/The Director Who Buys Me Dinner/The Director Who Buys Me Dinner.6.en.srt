1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,750
I'm going to love you seriously from now on.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,010
If, after I'm done with my work,

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,460
I see you waiting for me here,

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,750
I’ll assume that we feel the same way about each other.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,280
If we end up sharing the same feelings,

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,000
then what?

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,900
Seol Dongbaek,

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,820
didn’t you plan on joining the Performance Planning Team?

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,620
Please save our team.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,960
You can definitely do it!

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,860
What?

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,090
Don't just keep rejecting me,

13
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,410
but close your eyes

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,600
and try to accept me.

15
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,789
Why did you wait for me?

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,670
Because I want to see you.

17
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:37,360
Now,

18
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,700
you'll have no chance to run away.

19
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:23,020
(The Director Who Buys Me Dinner. Episode 6: Dongbaek, do you have a girlfriend?)

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,050
Do you know Seol Dongbaek?

21
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,980
Dongbaek?

22
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,290
We’re friends from the same hometown.

23
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,990
I’ll tell Seol Dongbaek to come to the photo shoot.

24
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,880
No, he's Director Min's direct employee,

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,640
how can he come to the set?

26
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,590
He should be off on weekends.

27
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,670
When we terminate the contract,

28
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,320
should I tell them that my manager wasn't sincere?

29
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,560
How could you say that?

30
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,630
My family motto is to be honest.

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,030
I'll do my best.

32
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,220
As you know,

33
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,150
Denis' contract expires this year.

34
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,280
Considering that the new idol group hasn't debuted yet,

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,710
the company needs to hold onto him.

36
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,320
(The MV Proposal of Denis' New Song)
the company needs to hold onto him.

37
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,040
the company needs to hold onto him.

38
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,740
If this new song is better than the last one,

39
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,150
there's a bigger gain in renewing the contract,

40
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,600
so the company has prepared it carefully.

41
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,130
By the way,

42
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,410
Denis has something he wants to tell you directly.

43
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,530
Director Min?

44
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,030
Director Min?

45
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,240
I'm sorry,

46
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,480
what did you say?

47
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,870
Denis said he has something...

48
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,950
What a good timing, are you talking about me?

49
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
I told you to watch your actions no matter where you are.

50
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,020
You only told me to be careful at the station.

51
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,990
Send me a secretary on the day of the shoot.

52
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,800
Me?

53
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,029
All of a sudden?

54
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,730
For what reason?

55
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,660
Well, I'll think about the reason later.

56
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,970
I'm sorry,

57
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,370
but the company isn't that relaxed yet.

58
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,909
I heard that the new idol group still isn't ready to debut.

59
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,520
As far as I know, I'm also not that free of a person.

60
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm so happy and thankful that you came,

61
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,090
but why did Director Min come here?

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,890
I don't know.

63
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,050
Look at how busy our Director Min is.

64
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,390
I know,

65
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,980
why would such a busy person come here?

66
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,800
That's what I'm saying!

67
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,090
I'm sorry, but I need to go out for a bit.

68
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,100
What? Now?

69
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,460
Something urgent?

70
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,060
I'll be right back after I'm done.

71
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,740
Yes, Sir.

72
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,070
Please take care of the set.

73
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,220
Yes, Sir.

74
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,510
You don't have to come back if you're busy.

75
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,300
You know what I mean, right?

76
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,159
Okay, let's change the concept.

77
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,310
Dang it, I'm sure Denis wants coffee but I haven't bought it yet.

78
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,740
I'll go get some coffee real quick.

79
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,850
Do you want something to drink?

80
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,940
No, it's okay. Come back soon, or he'll give you a hard time again.

81
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,020
-Okay, he ends in 30 seconds! -Okay.

82
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,090
Good work.

83
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,480
Where's my manager?

84
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,580
He went out to buy you coffee.

85
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,280
Instead of coffee I want water.

86
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,740
What's wrong?

87
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,270
Nothing.

88
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,070
But... I'm older than you, I'm the same age as Kihong.

89
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,390
I was born abroad so I don't know about that.

90
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,500
But you always call Kihong "brother" you jerk.

91
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,330
Do you want me to call you brother?

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,740
No, just call me what you want.

93
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,050
If you’re that busy, don’t promise me you'll come back.

94
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,900
Seol Dongbaek?

95
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,840
Seol Dongbaek.

96
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,520
Yes.

97
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,220
What do you think?

98
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,080
Oh, it's pretty.

99
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,950
What?

100
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,130
What... What are you doing?

101
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,740
I need a picture with a lipstick mark on me.

102
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,420
Seol Dongbaek, you help me.

103
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,930
What? Why me?

104
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,120
There are many other people here.

105
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,630
Because I don't like them.

106
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,890
Don't move,

107
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,950
if it's crooked, we'll have to draw it again.

108
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,410
Just kiss here.

109
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,020
You have to kiss hard, not too lightly.

110
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,260
You... want me to kiss you?

111
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,190
This is work.

112
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,040
Hurry up and end things.

113
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,250
Where did Yoon Kihong this jerk go? Why isn't he back yet?

114
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,870
Is this okay?

115
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,810
On the cheek, too.

116
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,010
I'm done.

117
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,120
Hey, where are you? Why aren't you back yet?

118
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,970
When I came running back with the coffee,

119
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,490
I bumped into a truck in the alley

120
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,090
and passed out.

121
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,110
What? Are you okay?

122
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,050
I'm fine, I just woke up in the emergency room.

123
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,420
But...

124
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,210
I'm not hurt anywhere.

125
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,970
Apparently the truck was damaged though.

126
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,030
You scared me.

127
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,880
Then I'll take Denis home. Go home and rest.

128
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
Really?

129
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,320
Just park the car in front of his house.

130
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,950
Okay, I'll call you later.

131
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,380
Okay, I love you.

132
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,750
They're giving me both the director and the manager's work.

133
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,990
(Performance Planning Team Director)

134
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,920
Are you not going to pick up?

135
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,540
Sorry, I’ll answer it.

136
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,240
Dongbaek!

137
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,230
I received the final draft of your stage design yesterday!

138
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,330
Although we still need Denis to decide,

139
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,170
he will definitely agree.

140
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,150
I think we can just use your version.

141
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,300
Okay, then I'll see you at the office director.

142
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,890
Okay.

143
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,000
After the showcase, let's have dinner at a nice place.

144
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,990
Thank you, goodbye director.

145
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,980
You too...

146
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,780
You're in charge of the design of my showcase?

147
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,350
It's a long story... I just helped out for a bit.

148
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,600
Then why are you staying in the Secretary Team?

149
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,020
The department I first got into was the Performance Planning Team

150
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,310
but somehow...

151
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,230
I can't let Director Min know...

152
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,840
Good work.

153
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,670
If I start my own company,

154
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,390
Seol Dongbaek, will you come?

155
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,680
What?

156
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,690
You can do whatever you want with me then.

157
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,560
Whether it's the stage or the theme.

158
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,700
Thank you for saying this, but suddenly?

159
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,860
I'm interested in you

160
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,630
so I made a suggestion.

161
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,950
I'm sorry, but it hasn't been long since I started working here

162
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,120
and I still have a lot to learn.

163
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,970
I'm thankful for what you said.

164
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,800
Are you rejecting me because you think I'm going to terminate the contract soon?

165
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,620
What do you mean? Why would I think like that?

166
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,390
I have all your records at home.

167
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,690
I know you work harder than anyone else.

168
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,610
Don't think like that.

169
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,420
Go home.

170
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,510
Do you have a girlfriend?

171
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,590
What?

172
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,740
I'm asking if you're seeing someone.

173
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,910
Is it your habit to let other's repeat the same thing twice?

174
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,530
Why are you suddenly asking such a private question?

175
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,150
Then how about me being your boyfriend?

176
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,270
When I told you on set today to leave a lipstick mark,

177
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,380
I'm sure you could tell I did it on purpose.

178
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,440
Seol Dongbaek, I think I like you.

179
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,010
What are you doing?

180
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,750
Don't go. I'm not done talking yet.

181
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,470
Are you not going to let go?

182
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,700
Why should I?

183
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,460
Stop arguing!

184
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,660
What if there are reporters nearby?

185
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,990
Director, let's go.

186
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,900
Denis, you should go back.

187
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,960
Let's go.

188
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,030
Director.

189
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,890
Why are you acting like a child?

190
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,240
Do you think you have the right to be mad at me right now?

191
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,820
What were you two doing?

192
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,300
It's not even your job, why did you agree to go to the set?

193
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,180
Didn't you say you need to renew the contract with Denis?

194
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,550
Do you think I want to work on weekends?

195
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,920
I'm went for your sake.

196
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,740
To me, the company isn't important at all.

197
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,330
Do you still not get it?

198
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,540
You're all I need.

199
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,220
Then don't just say it, prove it to me through actions.

200
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,940
You left me at the set today and disappeared for a day.

201
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,349
Do you know how much I waited for you?

202
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,430
I'm sorry.

203
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,860
I keep missing out on what's important.

204
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,610
If you're sorry, give me a hug.

205
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,980
My wound seems to hurt a little again.

206
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,650
I forgive you...

207
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,300
Hurry!

208
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,750
(On the next episode)

209
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,890
I don't have a name.

210
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,690
Then let me give you a name.

211
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,890
Seol Dongbaek!

212
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,440
You brat!

213
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,000
Die!

214
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,480
A shaman's child shouldn't leave the house!

215
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,860
You're the child of God, so you don't have a name...

216
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,090
then let me give you a name.

217
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,050
Dongbaek. Seol Dongbaek.

218
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,840
How about I call you Seol Dongbaek?

219
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,710
Dongbaek!
