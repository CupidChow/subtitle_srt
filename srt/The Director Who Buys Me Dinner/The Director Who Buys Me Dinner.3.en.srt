1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,360
Because we need to date.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,740
But I'm a man.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,370
Do you think I don't know that?

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,510
Even if we put aside the fact that I'm a man,

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,100
how can you date someone you don't even know?

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,830
There's a heart-shaped mole

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,680
on your chest, right?

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,010
What... how did he know?

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,050
I've never been in a relationship before yet,

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,060
I won’t let him drag me into this.

Seol Dongbaek!

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,840
Director Min, did you put a curse on me

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,170
because I didn't agree to date you yesterday?

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,960
Do you think I'm a goblin?

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
Calm down

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,870
and listen to me.

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,900
You're only feeling pain right now

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,590
but if you keep refusing to date me,

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,450
you might really die.

20
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,250
I'm... I'm going to die?

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,800
If you don't believe me, you can try.

22
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,700
Whether it be the scar on my chest,

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,800
or what you said, they're all the truth right?

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,260
If this is all true,

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,289
I guess we really need to date.

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,640
Director Min,

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,160
we've been eating dinner together for the past week,

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,130
is having dinner together considered as dating?

29
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,820
Of course.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,180
Then when will the curse end?

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,310
When I really fall in love with you.

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,890
Why didn't you take me home?

33
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,060
I don't even know your address.

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,960
If I had known this would happen,

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,710
I would've just left you on the streets.

36

38
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,180
Are you feeling better now?

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,040
I guess hugging doesn't work.

40

No, I'm okay now.

44
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,680
I'll have cold noodles at lunch to cure my hangover.

Tomorrow as well, also the day after.

Yes.

You're falling in love with someone else.

53
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,500
What do you mean falling in love? Do you think I don't have friends?

54

Then what about next week?

63

This problem seems to be getting bigger,

64
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,080

No.

67
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,110
Denis, this is...

68
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,940
I did nothing wrong.

69
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,770
They're the rude ones.

70
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,810
If they don't want to see it, tell them to not look.

71
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,170
I don't care.

72
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,830
How did it go?

73
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,250
What?

74
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,480
Overseas schedule!

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,240
Did you tell Director Min about the adjustment?

76
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,760
Yes, I did

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,330
but Director Min said the schedule is going to go according to the original plan.

78
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,430
I told you three days ago,

79
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,630
to make adjustments to the concert ticket prices,

80
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,040
but you sold it at the original price?

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,200
-Well... -It's 400,000 won for a single concert ticket.

82
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,920
Would you guys go if I asked you to pay that much for a concert?

83
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm sorry,

84
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,750
it's taking a long time to adjust the homepage

85
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,480
but the tickets are selling very fast...

86
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,159
Do you guys not read the articles?

87
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,020
An article about the controversy of Denis' attitude came out today.

88
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,270
If an article comes out about the ticket prices right now,

89
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,080
who will be responsible for what happens next?

90
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,900
No matter what,

91
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,440
I guess we can only prepare a concert worth 400,000 won.

92
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
So what's your solution?

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Since the theme of the concert is closely related to the country,

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,090
I don't think it'll be appropriate to add more content.

95
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,290
If it was appropriate,

96
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,930
the ticket price wouldn't be twice the amount for a domestic concert.

97
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,840
Do you think this is a solution?

98
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,050
I'm asking for a solution.

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,440
Um... I think we can extend the concert time

100
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,790
for about half an hour.

101
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,610
We will also add more stage effects.

102
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,450
That's terrible.

103
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,490
Denis is here.

104
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,490
I was nearby so I decided to stop by.

105
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,250
Go on, I will wait.

106
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,730

113
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,440
and tell them to share the new song as soon as possible.

114
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,550
It seems that the plan for the overseas music ranking is not ideal.

115

I waited because I was worried.

167
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,270
Do you want to go home with me today?

168
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,450
I don't want to sleep alone.

169
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,150
Don't you want to be with me, too?

170
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,750
You must have lived a long life,

171
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,210
you’ve become more sensitive and observant.

172
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,980
Leave Seol Dongbaek’s body immediately.

173
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,290
Well, what should I do?

174
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,020
Isn't it enough that I'm cursed?

175
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,810
The Seol Dongbaek now doesn’t remember anything.

176
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,720
I don’t think your memory is complete either.

177
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,730
What?

178
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,760
Pull yourself together

179
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,800
if you don't want to hurt this child again like you did in your previous life.

180
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,450
What do you mean?

181
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,420
Seol Dongbaek suffered

182
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,200
because you named the child of God.

183
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,230
The one who started it should end it.

184
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm going to take care of this.

185
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,230
Had I never met you, I wouldn't have suffered like this.

186
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,670
I wish I could kill you right now

187
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,490
but because this child needs you, I'm bearing it for now.

188
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,380
Stop wasting time

189
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,710
or else it'll become really dangerous.

190
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,660
(On the next episode)

191
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,730
Hello, Director Min.

192
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,190
Is it okay to just let you be played in the palms of God?

193
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,660
Isn't he an artist who has totally gone downhill?

194
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,990
It seems like the company will give up on him soon.

195
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,090
It's too kind of Min Entertainment to still keep him.

196
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,340
He's old and despised but he still hasn't gotten it together.

197
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,050
His skills are also dropping, how is he so confident?

198
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,280
Is this also one of the curses?
