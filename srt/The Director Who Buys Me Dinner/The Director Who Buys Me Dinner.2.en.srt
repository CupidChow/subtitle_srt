1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,730
You're late for your first day, great job.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,440
Gosh!

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,840
Oh no... I’m hanging up!

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,720
My name is Seol Dongbaek, 27 years old.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,830
Today is my first day at my dream job: Min Entertainment's Performance Planning Team.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,580
My name is Seol Dongbaek, I’m a new employee.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,650
Did we recruit a new employee?

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,030
No.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,160
Our youngest member is here already.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,310
(Date of Entry: December 4, 2021 (Monday) 10 A.M. Address: 24 Gangnam-daero, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea 4th floor Secretary Team)

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,410
Secretary Team...?
(Date of Entry: December 4, 2021 (Monday) 10 A.M. Address: 24 Gangnam-daero, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea 4th floor Secretary Team)

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,370
My department was suddenly changed?

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,960
(According to Party A, Party B's department can be changed at any time.)
My department was suddenly changed?

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,970
But I applied on my resume and entry notice for the Performance Planning Team.
(According to Party A, Party B's department can be changed at any time.)

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,070
But I applied on my resume and entry notice for the Performance Planning Team.

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,300
Why did it suddenly change?

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,420
My name is Seol Dongbaek and I'm a new employee.

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,580
-We finally meet. -What?

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,190
Do you want to date me?

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,410
So…

21
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,150
Seol Dongbaek, let's date.

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,400
That’s when it started,

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,230
this weird director's weird behaviors.

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,080
This isn't a dream.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,460
Darn it!

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,440
Hey, is Director Min always like this?

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,850
He's a bit strange.

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,039
Why?

29
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,980
When we first met he mentioned dating...

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,130
Nevermind.

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,539
Do you have any plans after work?

32
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:29,670
No.

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,740
(Director's Office)
No.

34
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,190
If you don't have any plans,
(Director's Office)

35
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,560
have dinner with me.
(Director's Office)

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,580
What? Me?

37
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,280
Let's meet in the lobby in half an hour and leave together.

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,210
But, why did you want to eat with me?

39
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,690
Because we need to date.

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,680
I guess I really should quit.

41
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:27,500
(The Director Who Buys Me Dinner. Episode 2: Are you going to endure it?)

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,700
But, why did you want to eat with me?

43
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,170
Because we need to date.

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,760
But I'm a man.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,110
Do you think I don't know that?

46
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,140
Director Min, do you like men?

47
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,550
You could say that.

48
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,630
What do you mean?

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,340
Even if we put aside the fact that I'm a man,

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,910
how can you date someone you don't even know?

51
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,110
I've lived a long life.

52
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,070
Definitely longer than me.

53
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,480
I've lived 300 years.

54
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,120
What?

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,090
I've been waiting for you for 300 years.

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,740
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,390
I'm going crazy.

58
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,950
If I tell you what's going to happen in the future will you believe it?

59
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,480
If we keep wasting time like this,

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,100
the man above will be furious.

61
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,490
Director Min,

62
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,650
I've been living well for the past 27 years.

63
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,700
Can you stop saying that I don't remember you

64
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,430
or that you've been waiting for me for hundreds of years?

65
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,530
Like you, I also don't know why I'm being punished like this.

66
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,800
If you're going to keep talking nonsense, I'm leaving.

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
There's a heart-shaped mole

68
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,500
on your chest, right?

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,280
What... how did he know?

70
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,750
I've never been in a relationship before yet,

71
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,400
I won’t let him drag me into this.

72
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,840
Seol Dongbaek!

73
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,140
Director Min, are you able to predict the future?

74
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,840
What do you mean?

75
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,440
Last night I dreamt that I got shot

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,290
and even after I woke up, it hurts here as if I was actually shot.

77
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,050
Isn't it considered lucky to dream of dying?

78
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,860
Do you want me to buy you a lottery?

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm not kidding.

80
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,160
I've seen people who are able to predict the future in TV dramas.

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,980
Director Min, did you put a curse on me

82
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,290
because I didn't agree to date you yesterday?

83
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,250
Do you think I'm a goblin?

84
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,540
If I had those powers,

85
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,890
I would have dealt with my problems first.

86
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,790
Director Min, you appeared in my dream, too.

87
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,080
Me?

88
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,000
I only heard your voice,

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,580
but it was definitely you.

90
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,290
You can recognize me with my voice?

91
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,390
Because you're so annoying

92
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,240
I mean... because I often hear your voice

93
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,770
so I could recognize it in my dream.

94
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,140
Maybe he made you have that dream on purpose

95
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,170
because he said the curse can only be lifted if I fall in love with you.

96
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,720
What?

97
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,680
What does that mean...? Curse?

98
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,370
Why are so many things happening one after another.

99
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,930
Calm down

100
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,950
and listen to me.

101
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,970
You're only feeling pain right now

102
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,620
but if you keep refusing to date me,

103
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,360
you might really die.

104
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm... I'm going to die?

105
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,610
If you don't believe me, you can try.

106
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,670
Is it here?

107
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,410
Lower...

108
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,540
What? Why? Why are you coming closer?

109
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,860
Ouch!

110
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,450
I'm... I'm sorry.

111
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,710
Why did you kiss me?

112
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,409
I mean, why did you put your lips on me?

113
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,300
It's fine.

114
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,950
Dongbaek, are you alright?

115
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,170
I’m... I'm fine.

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,330
First, report your work schedule to the Director this morning

117
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,270
and later just make a brief memo during the meeting.

118
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,840
What's going on? It doesn't hurt anymore.

119
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,020
If you need any help, let me know.

120
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,600
Okay.

121
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,770
Am I really going to die?

122
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,100
How would I know what God is thinking?

123
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,610
After all, you are the one God likes.

124
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,220
If God likes me, why would I die?

125
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,920
It was like that in the past.

126
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,510
Whether it be the scar on my chest,

127
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,440
or what you said, they're all the true right?

128
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,200
If this is all true,

129
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,800
I guess we really need to date.

130
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,770
It's been about a week since we decided to date.

131
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,890
Like a job with unavoidable negotiation terms,

132
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,720
we've been having dinner together every day and going home separately.

133
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,470
Director Min,

134
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,970
we've been eating dinner together for the past week,

135
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,270
is having dinner together considered as dating?

136
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,390
Of course.

137
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,470
This isn't any different from having a dinner buddy,

138
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,930
are you sure we won't die even if all we do is have dinner?

139
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,280
Do you still dream of getting shot?

140
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,140
No.

141
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,980
Does your chest still hurt?

142
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,190
No.

143
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,470
That means it's working.

144
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,760
Director Min... you said you waited for me for hundreds of years

145
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,820
so your appearance never changed and you never grew old?

146
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,590
Yes.

147
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,160
It's stayed like this since the day you left me without saying goodbye.

148
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,000
But I don't remember anything.

149
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,430
Anyway, so you're saying

150
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,260
that man called God

151
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,220
put a curse on you and I, right?

152
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,590
Yes.

153
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,230
Then when will the curse end?

154
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,060
When I really fall in love with you.

155
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,150
Can't you just love me on your own then?

156
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,150
What do you mean?

157
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,870
Since you're involved you should love me, too.

158
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,770
But you at least remember everything, I don't remember anything!

159
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,170
I thought I could just

160
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,950
date and marry normally like others.

161
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,010
I never thought I would need to spend my life eating with this person.

162
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,040
You drank a lot, let's go.

163
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,410
Why is there no wine?

164
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,370
Seol Dongbaek. Seol Dongbaek.

165
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,160
Seriously.

166
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,480
The elevator door is closing.

167
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,980
Director Min, what are you doing?

168
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,310
Goodness.

169
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,240
You are vigorous in the morning.

170
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,850
What do you mean what am I doing?

171
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,680
Why am I sleeping here?

172
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,030
Then should I just let someone who threw up sleep on my bed?

173
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,080
You were so drunk

174
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,810
dragging you here was exhausting.

175
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,880
Are you always this vigorous in the morning?

176
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,750
How can I wake up calmly

177
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,810
when you are sleeping naked next to me.

178
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,150
But I wasn't naked...

179
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,710
are you disappointed?

180
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,870
Maybe I should've slept naked...

181
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,230
should I take it off now?

182
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,030
Nothing happened so

183
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,230
don't act like a virgin and make a fuss about it.

184
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,940
How do you know if I'm a virgin or not?

185
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,870
Also, why didn't you take me home?

186
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,050
When I was unconscious you wouldn't have done...

187
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,830
I don't even know your address.

188
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,580
If I had known this would happen,

189
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,870
I would've just left you on the streets.

190
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Then you should've left me alone and gone home yourself.

191
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,940
Are you okay?

192
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,350
It's hurting again, the place where I got shot.

193
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,250
No.

194
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,500
Are you just going to endure it?

195
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,820
(On the next episode)

196
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,810
I guess hugging doesn't work.

197
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,350
You're free after work today right?

198
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,340
I have plans.

199
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,770
Tomorrow as well, also the day after.

200
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,260
You're falling in love with someone else.

201
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,990
He's the child of God who was abandoned by God.

202
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,240
We don't even know if they're dead or alive

203
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,000
why are you trying so hard to go back?

204
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,240
Could you please tell me what I should do?
