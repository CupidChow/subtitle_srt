1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,440
(Director)

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,890
I don't have a name.

3
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,990
Then let me give you a name.

4
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,110
Seol Dongbaek!

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,040
You brat! Die!

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,420
Goodness.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,030
I was born in that shaman's house,

8
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,520
so I don't have a name.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,830
What are you doing? Take it.

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,820
You're the child of God, so you don't have a name...

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,230
Then let me give you a name.

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,710
You are like a little flower that blooms in winter.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,510
Dongbaek. Seol Dongbaek.

14
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,680
How about I call you Seol Dongbaek?

15
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,240
It suits you.

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,420
You not only named the child of God,

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,440
you even got caught in a rumor with him.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,470
Till when are you going to bring disgrace upon the Min family?

19
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,710
Dongbaek,

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,350
leave with me on New Year's Eve.

21
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,500
Let's go to a place where no one knows us.

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,400
Just the two of us.

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,970
Young Master! Bad news!

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,120
Master found out about your plan to elope with Dongbaek

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,750
-and is about to kill him! -Dongbaek!

26
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,270
Seol Dongbaek!

27
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,340
My lord!

28
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,990
Dongbaek!

29
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,550
(The Director Who Buys Me Dinner. Episode 8: I'm going to become Youdam's trace.)

30
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,150
You should've arrived in Seoul by now

31
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,970
but you didn't call me.

32
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,220
(New Message.)

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:20,900
Dongbaek,

34
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,030
(Ms. Seo)
Dongbaek,

35
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,910
send me the promotional report by tomorrow.
(Ms. Seo)

36
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,740
Right,

37
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,990
I've only written half of the report.

38
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,800
Darn it.

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,250
I just need to do a little bit more and I'm done.

40
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,470
Director?

41
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,450
When did you come?

42
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,280
Just now.

43
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Dongbaek, why are you still here?

44
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,300
I just finished my work.

45
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,710
I'm tired,

46
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,700
so let's call it a day and go home.

47
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,590
Director,

48
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,020
it's been a while since we last had dinner together,

49
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,800
do you want to eat together?

50
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,110
You want to have dinner at this hour?

51
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,810
All the restaurants are closed now,

52
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,909
let's eat another day.

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,090
Then... what about your house?

54
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,020
What?

55
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,110
Can we have dinner at your place?

56
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,390
There's nothing to eat at my house.

57
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,330
Seriously...

58
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,640
Have you fallen for someone else?

59
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,030
What?

60
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,940
Do you think I'm doing this because I'm hungry?

61
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,140
I'm doing this because I want to go to your house.

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,710
I want to go to your house today.

63
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,150
Let's go.

64
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,820
I noticed when I first came here,

65
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,590
that there's someone living in this home but it's so empty.

66
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,650
There's nothing at home,

67
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,680
and you don't have friends or family.

68
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,490
Did you wait for me all alone like this?

69
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,710
Because to me,

70
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,040
those things don't have meaning.

71
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,190
It's okay, because I found you now.

72
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,180
But this is different from my plan.

73
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,240
I started an entertainment company

74
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,720
because you were beautiful in your past life

75
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,800
so I thought you'd become a celebrity in this life.

76
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,550
I never thought you would pursue the Performance Planning Team.

77
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,820
I ended up in the Secretary Team though.

78
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,440
If I still haven't appeared in front of you,

79
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,230
what would you have done?

80
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,720
I would've kept waiting.

81
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,710
From now on, let's do everything together one by one.

82
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,920
I will become Youdam's trace from now on.

83
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,160
There's your trace everywhere now.

84
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,120
(Director)

85
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,350
I'm not feeling well today.
(Director)

86
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,350
(Director)

87
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,800
I'll go hug you after I finish my work.
(Director)

88
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,680
(Director)

89
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,690
Who are you talking to?

90
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,330
Denis, you're here.

91
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,320
Let me introduce the stage to you.

92
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,200
Don't ever turn your back on me again.

93
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,050
I'm not done talking yet

94
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,810
don't just leave me alone like this!

95
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,550
I'm sorry,

96
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,060
I didn't know you would be angry.

97
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,990
Denis, what's wrong?

98
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,990
Kihong, wait,

99
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,570
I'll explain to you later.

100
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,020
Why are you taking so many pills?

101
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,240
Tranquilizer.

102
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,340
When did you start taking it?

103
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,880
I don't know I can't remember.

104
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,450
Don't take so much medicine.

105
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,490
Calm down.

106
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,460
Take your time. I'll help you.

107
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,830
Breathe slowly.

108
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,190
Good job.

109
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,680
Because I got mad at you earlier,

110
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,490
do you hate me now?

111
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,420
I'm sorry.

112
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,920
I didn't mean it.

113
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,350
No, it's okay,

114
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,660
you acted like that because you're sick.

115
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,230
All staff, please gather on the stage.

116
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,400
I'll go first.

117
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,590
Let me know if anything's wrong.

118
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,640
Good work.

119
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,980
The results are good.

120
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,030
Not bad.

121
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,770
Of course.

122
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,540
Dongbaek, you've really worked hard,

123
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,280
but what’s wrong with your face?

124
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,980
Are you okay?

125
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,870
Yes, thank you.

126
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,280
You look pale.

127
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,450
I'm going to the bathroom.

128
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,480
Okay.

129
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,470
Team leader!

130
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,330
Seol Dongbaek!

131
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,470
(On the next episode)

132
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,490
You don't have to worry about me.

133
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,030
Are you okay?

134
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,070
Min Youdam, isn't this your specialty?

135
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,820
You're good at using people and then abandoning them.

136
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,280
Stop pretending in front of me.

137
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,070
I want to kill you.

138
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,120
Youdam.

139
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,080
I don't have the right to have you,

140
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,020
but I was greedy.

141
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,940
Come to your senses!

142
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,610
To him, you're just something he can throw away after he's done using.

143
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm almost at the company parking lot.

144
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,340
You are

145
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,110
the only person who can understand me.
