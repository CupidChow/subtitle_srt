1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,140
You're free after work today right?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,040
I have plans.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,920
Tomorrow as well, also the day after.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,300
You're falling in love with someone else.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,110
Do you have feelings for me?

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,410
What do you mean feelings...

7
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,770
(Report: In the second half of 2021, the growth rate of Min Entertainment was made by Director Min Youdam. Director Min Youdam is a bit handsome.)
What do you mean feelings...

8
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:12,770
All my life

9
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,540
I never thought I would come here for a guy...

10
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,710
(Fairy Bodhisattva)
I never thought I would come here for a guy...

11
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,500
I never thought I would come here for a guy...

12
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,630
Get out!

13
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,530
One is the child of God who was abandoned by God,

14
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,080
and the other is someone who doesn't know if he's dead or alive.

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,590
Why are you two trying so hard to go back?

16
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,470
I'll leave after I see you go inside.

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,840
I'm worried.

18
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,600
I'm a grown man, what's there to be worried about?

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,920
Don't make excuses tomorrow and let's...

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,110
Seol Dongbaek.

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,880
Isn't it enough that I'm cursed?

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,890
The Seol Dongbaek now doesn’t remember anything.

23
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,960
I don’t think your memory is complete either.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,220
Pull yourself together.

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,310
if you don't want to hurt this child again like you did in your previous life.

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,250
Seol Dongbaek suffered

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,789
because you named the child of God.

28
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:24,760
The one who started it should end it.

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:16,750
(The Director Who Buys Me Dinner. Episode 4: Dongbaek I want to be with you.)

30
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:24,460
Ms. Seo, you’re here.

31
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,960
Dongbaek, did you catch a cold?

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,560
Yes.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,190
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,140
It's not that serious.

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,570
Hello, Director Min.

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,740
Is it okay

37
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,680
to just let you be played in the palms of God?

38
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,470
Am I being too greedy?

39
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,280
This is today's work schedule.

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,380
Is there anything special?

41
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,860
No, nothing has changed.

42
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,560
Okay.

43
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,040
Tonight...

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,350
What?

45
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,810
I'll be free at 4 P.M.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,560
so move the last schedule to this time.

47
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,910
Okay.

48
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,640
Actually, I can drive.

49
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,320
It's okay.

50
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,620
Wait for me.

51
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,540
This is cold medicine.

52
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,550
Drink this first.

53
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,360
Thank you.

54
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,440
Did anything happen after you went home yesterday?

55
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,760
Nothing happened.

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,920
You didn't have a nightmare either?

57
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,250
No.

58
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,100
That's good.

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,030
Thank you for worrying about me.

60
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,370
Hello, Director Min.

61
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,930
Good work.

62
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,280
How's the set preparation?

63
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,260
It’s getting closer to perfect.

64
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,420
Seol Dongbaek, go inside and see how the artist is doing.

65
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,590
Yes.

66
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,960
Isn't he an artist who has totally gone downhill?

67
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,290
It seems like the company will give up on him soon.

68
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,370
It's so kind of Min Entertainment to still keep him.

69
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,570
He's old and despised but still stubborn.

70
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,370
His skills are also dropping, how is he so confident?

71
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,560
Denis?

72
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,080
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

73
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,549
It's fine, I'm always like this.

74
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,360
Denis,

75
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,230
what are you doing here?

76
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,740
Dongbaek, why are you here and not at the office?

77
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,040
Denis' health condition...

78
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,090
See you.

79
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,220
There are many equipments,

80
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,110
so pay special attention to safety measures.

81
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,190
We've checked several times, everything's fine.

82
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,050
Stop wasting time

83
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,550
or else it'll become really dangerous.

84
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,240
-Call the doctor! -What happened?

85
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,400
Please wake up.

86
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,530
I told your manager that you didn't have to come.

87
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,330
You got injured at my concert. How can I not come?

88
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,290
I'm already seen as a troublemaker at the company.

89
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,660
How are you a troublemaker?

90
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,510
You're the company's representative artist who earns the most money.

91
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,880
Director Min, in your eyes, do I only look like money to you?

92
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,830
I think I treated you better than that.

93
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm human, too.

94
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,640
I feel bad when someone gets hurt.

95
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,890
Alright, I'm leaving.

96
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,550
You... came because you're worried about me?

97
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,240
Of course I'm worried, I was so shocked.

98
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,510
It feels alright to have someone worry about me.

99
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,940
I'm sorry. I wasn't being careful.

100
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,450
Since you're not hurt, it's fine.

101
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,060
If I can eat the fruit you peeled,

102
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,600
the pain will be relieved.

103
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,710
But,

104
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,700
is this one of the curses, too?

105
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,840
Probably.

106
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,670
I've always cared about safety first.

107
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,530
Is it because we didn't eat together last time...

108
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,980
Darn it.

109
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,100
Ah!

110
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,720
What are you doing?

111
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm hurt, how can I eat by myself?

112
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,860
Feed me.

113
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,750
Delicious.

114
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,250
One more.

115
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,020
Okay, I'll visit you soon.

116
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,620
Okay.

117
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,360
Ms. Seo was really funny today.

118
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,700
Well...

119
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,990
Ms. Seo...

120
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,230
Didn't you hurt that arm?

121
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,630
How can you lie about something like this?

122
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,840
I was so worried about you.

123
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,910
I didn't mean to lie to you...

124
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,360
the doctor said we can remove the cast today,

125
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,390
but it still hurts.

126
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,720
What are you doing?

127
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,510
Because I want to be with you.

128
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,350
Why do you have to hug me to say that...?

129
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,940
I'm... afraid you'll run away.

130
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,750
I was actually just going to go drink water.

131
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,470
It can't be helped, I have to stay by your side all the time.

132
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,840
Because that way I can protect you.

133
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,230
So, in order for me to protect you,

134
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,490
please don't run away.

135
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,830
(On the next episode)

136
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm going to love you seriously from now on.

137
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,770
Don't just keep rejecting me,

138
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,180
try to accept me.

139
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,040
If, after I'm done with my work,

140
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,470
I see you waiting for me here,

141
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,960
I’ll assume that we feel the same way about each other.
