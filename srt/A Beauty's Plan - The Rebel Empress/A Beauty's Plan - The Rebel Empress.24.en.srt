=The Final Episode=

3
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,120
Ci'er!

4
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,360
Xiao Che! Xiao Che!

5
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,880
Xiao Che! Xiao Che!

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,440
Xiao Che!

7
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,040
Xiao Che!

8
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,720
Please, please wake up!

9
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,000
Open your eyes and look at me!

10
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,480
Why are you this stupid?

11
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
Isn't it good to stay in the palace

12
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,480
and be the Emperor?

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,560
Ci'er,

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm fine.

15
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm fine.

16
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,000
Nothing can happen to you.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm fine.

18
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,640
Please don't cry.

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't cry.

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,800
When you cry, my heart hurts.

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,280
I won't cry, I won't cry.

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,520
I grew a garden of hibiscus
in the Imperial Garden,

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,680
and originally wanted to gift it to you

24
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,040
for your 26th birthday.

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
Remember to go and see it.

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,120
This life, I didn't manage to
have the cross-cupped wine with you.

27
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,880
In the next lifetime,
I will marry you as my wife.

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,920
And love you, my whole life.

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,400
Xiao Che! Xiao Che!

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Xiao Che! Xiao Che!

31
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,040
Xiao Che! Xiao Che!

32
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,960
Xiao Che!

33
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,160
I promise you! I promise you!

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,520
If there is an afterlife,

35
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,720
I will wait for you to marry me.

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,040
Xiao Che!

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
I promise you!

38
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
Xiao Che!

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Xiao Che!

40
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,800
I promise you!

41
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,320
If there is an afterlife,

42
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,680
I will wait for you to marry me.

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
If there is an afterlife,

44
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,360
I will wait for you to marry me.

45
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,880
Turns out it is just a dream.

46
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,080
Look, sister, this is the cloth tiger

47
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,680
Sister Chisu sewed for me yesterday.

48
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,600
Is it pretty?

49
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,920
Yes, it is pretty.

50
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,000
Of course, it is pretty.

51
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
Why are you crying, Elder Sister?

52
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,400
It's okay.

53
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,800
Stop the carriage.

54
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
Where are we now?

55
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,840
We will be reaching Wenfeng Mountain

56
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,200
after turning left ahead, Miss.

57
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,840
Wenfeng Mountain?

58
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,840
(No, this is not a dream.)

59
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,680
(What is happening on me now)

60
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,120
(is real and true.)

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,840
What year, month and day is it today?

62
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
It is the third of April

63
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,200
of the 23rd year of Taizheng.

64
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,320
The third of April,
the 23rd year of Taizheng.

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
Who gives you the guts to dare to block

66
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
the carriage of
Imperial Tutor Wang's daughter?

67
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,680
Me, the big brother of Wenfeng Mountain.

68
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,920
Since you are at Wenfeng Mountain,

69
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,320
you should obey
the rules of Wenfeng Mountain.

70
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,080
If you want to pass through safely,

71
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,640
you better leave money behind.

72
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,280
Do not blame us for being rude otherwise.

73
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,480
(Yes, it is this day,)

74
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,160
(when I brought Dabao up
Wenfeng Mountain to play.)

75
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,920
(Not long after we went up the mountain,)

76
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,640
(we encountered
a bunch of mountain bandits.)

77
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,160
(The bandits held Dabao hostage)

78
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
(until that person arrived.)

79
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
(And he saved Dabao.)

80
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
Change route

81
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,600
and go on the small road to the right.

82
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,520
Sister, are we not going to
Wenfeng Mountain anymore?

83
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,920
No, we are not going.

84
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,000
Dabao, be good.
Follow elder sister to save someone.

85
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,080
Quick! Go and save
that person who is surrounded.

86
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,720
Yes.

87
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,000
