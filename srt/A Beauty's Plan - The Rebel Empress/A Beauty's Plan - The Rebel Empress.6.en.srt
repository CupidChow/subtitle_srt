=Episode 6=

3
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,960
Call Prince Duan in.

4
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,600
Absurd.

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
No need for courtesies.

7
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,114
I lost my cool for a short while.

8
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,371
Because those officials
say you're not satisfied

9
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:05,560
with the marriage that I've granted you

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,270
and abandon the
Princess Consort on purpose,

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,360
making me look bad.

12
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,610
Besides, they even use the fact
that you brought the army

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,571
back to the palace
without permission seven years ago

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,600
to provoke the relationship between us.

15
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:18,080
Based on your opinion,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,720
what should I do to them?

17
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:23,160
I have no such attention.

18
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:25,520
It's just because
I'm not interested in a relationship.

19
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,370
As for the thing
that happened back then...

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,120
(Brother.)

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,960
(Where's father?)

22
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:34,200
(Seven Years Ago)

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,160
Where's father? I want to meet father.

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,480
Prince Duan.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,920
Without military order,

26
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,360
you brought the army back to the palace.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,600
You want to commit treason?

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Prince Duan.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,120
If you sincerely
think of the late Emperor,

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,560
then you should fulfill
the final wish of him,

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,280
pass over the military power
and support the new Emperor.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,240
Yes.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,714
You should pass over the military power.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,816
Prince Duan, please
pass over the military power

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,960
and support the new Emperor.

36
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,493
Prince Duan, please
pass over the military power

37
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:06,600
and support the new Emperor.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,152
Prince Duan, please
pass over the military power

39
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:11,240
and support the new Emperor.

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,040
I can pass over the military power.

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,880
Brother, please let me
see father for the last time.

42
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:32,320
I'm willing to follow
the posthumous edict

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
to pass over the military tag

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,080
and support the new Emperor.

45
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:48,480
Seven years ago, I've already
passed over the military power.

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm merely a free person now.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,760
I know that you do not
have the thought of rebelling.

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,560
But there are always
people with bad intentions.

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
So don't put me
in a difficult situation.

50
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,680
Yes.

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,720
I understand.

52
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,120
I will take my leave now.

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,120
Your Highness.

54
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,440
Your Highness, please spare me.

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,480
Please spare me.

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,080
It's alright, get up.

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,320
(Dress?)

58
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,371
(The fire burnt my body because)

59
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,080
(Princess Consort Duan
ordered someone to)

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,771
(add a large amount
of cotton to the dress.)

61
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,640
(However, my clothes and jewelry)

62
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,280
(were always managed by
Hua Jian and Chi Su.)

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,160
(If someone did something,)

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
(how did the person avoid them?)

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,480
It's alright. Get up.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
It's already late.

67
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,990
Why is Her Highness
not going back to the mansion

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,720
but going to
His Majesty's chamber instead?

69
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,160
Someone once said

70
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,120
that Jiang Jinli's looks
and mine have some resemblance.

71
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,200
Seeing it today,

72
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
it's true.

73
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:14,200
Your Majesty, please spare me!

74
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,880
Please spare me!

75
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,440
Spare you?

76
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,440
If I spare you,

77
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,200
will Chi Su and the rest
agree on it in the underworld?

78
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,280
I'm also forced by others.

79
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,800
Forced by others?

80
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,920
How many benefits
that Jiang Jinli promised you

81
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,400
to make you harm me like this?

82
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,640
Your Majesty.

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,320
Princess Consort Duan found me

84
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,840
and promised me two hundred gold.

85
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,080
She asked me to add a large amount
of cotton with saltpeter

86
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,320
in the dress that you wore
on your birthday.

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,960
At first, I didn't agree with it.

88
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,280
However, after that,
His Majesty had given orders.

89
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,720
I didn't dare to go against it.

90
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
His Majesty said

91
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
he only wanted to warn the Wang family.

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,480
I really didn't expect

93
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,600
that the fire would cause your death.

94
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,800
I treated you well.

95
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,040
You grew up with me since young.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,360
What did he promise you

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,280
to let you harm me like this?

98
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,680
Your Majesty, please spare me.

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,880
His Majesty said

100
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,510
after it was done, he would
give me a place in the harem.

101
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,120
(What?)

102
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,400
(You know his secret.)

103
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:11,840
(He'll just kill you!)

104
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,000
Your Majesty, please spare me.

105
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,560
A place in the harem.

106
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Your Majesty, please spare me.

107
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,800
What else did he ask you
to do behind my back?

108
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,040
Be honest.

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,200
If you don't tell me everything,

110
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,914
I will drag you to the hell
and let you experience

111
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,760
the misery of eyes dug and nose sliced.

112
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,560
Don't.

113
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,120
I will confess.

114
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,600
His Majesty...

115
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,280
His Majesty ordered me
to add cold medicine

116
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
to your food

117
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,360
so that you'll be infertile.

118
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,880
Even if you're pregnant,
the fetus will die in the womb too.

119
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,520
Why did he do this?

120
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,160
I'm not sure about this too.

121
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,360
He simply said

122
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,520
he don't want a prince of
the Wang family's bloodline.

123
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,120
For your own benefit,

124
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,240
you betrayed me

125
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
and caused my death.

126
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,160
You also killed Chi Su who was
as close as a sister to you,

127
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
as well as the servants
in Fengxi Palace.

128
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
Do you know that every skin and flesh

129
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,360
burnt off by the fire

130
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
was like torture?

131
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:28,720

are you still able to sleep peacefully?

132
