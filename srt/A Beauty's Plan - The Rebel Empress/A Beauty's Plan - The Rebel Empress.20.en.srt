=Episode 20=

3
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,600
By decree of His Majesty
bestowed from celestial realm,

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,400
I have but just ascended to this throne.
Now I change the reign title to Yongning.

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,440
All those who have laboured diligently
shall be recompensed.

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,240
Those who have proffered no assistance
shall be dismissed as their chastisement,

7
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,760
for the iniquitous to be warned.
That is all.

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,200
We bow in respect before Your Majesty.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,920
Long live Your Majesty.

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,960

Beloved officials, please rise.

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

13
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
You were born to belong in the sky

14
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
and should be flying free and far.

15
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,440
Go.

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Had it not been for you,

17
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,480
I would still be chained down now

18
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,000
and wandering in darkness.

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
Your Majesty has the ambition of
Kunpeng

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,360
and will surely be
able to show your abilities.

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,600
Your Majesty's new policies
are well-received by the people.

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,640
Having such a wise emperor
is the blessing of our dynasty.

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,760
Ci'er,

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,320
from now on,

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
you will also be like this free bird.

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,920
The world is so wide and complicated,
what freedom can I have?

27
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,280
(It turns out)

28
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,040
(that what is trapping isn't the palace,

29
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,920
(but your heart.)

30
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,720

(Now, let everything)

34
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,720
(end in this cold winter.)

35
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,440
(Being on this trip with you has been
my biggest blessings in my life so far.)

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,480
(Wish your empire prosperity
and do good care of yourself.)
