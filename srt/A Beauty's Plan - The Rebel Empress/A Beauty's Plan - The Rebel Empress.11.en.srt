00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,480
(Oh no! The poison!)

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,120
Your Highness!

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,320
Your Highness!

6
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,480
Your Highness!

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,440
Your Highness!

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,040
Don't come here!

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,320
I beg you...

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
Don't come here.

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,120
Eunuch, Prince
and Princess Consort have gone to bed.

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,200
You must not go in there.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,520
How dare you

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,600
stand in my way!

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Eunuch! Eunuch!

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,000
You really can't go in there!

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,160
The Prince Duan's Mansion would not be
hiding anyone, would it?

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,520
Get out of my way!

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,440
What happened?

20
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:41,160
Don't be afraid.

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,280
Don't talk.

22
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,280
Who dares to enter

23
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
my mansion without my permission?

24
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,000
Your Highness, please calm down.

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,800
There was an unsuccessful
assassination in the palace today.

26
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,120
It is said that the assassin
fled into your mansion.

27
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
I am here to apprehend the assassin

28
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,480
on the orders of His Majesty.

29
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,560
What makes you think that
I am hiding the assassin?

30
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,760
Get the hell out of here!

31
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,240
Yes, I shall take my leave.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm sorry, just now I...

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,640
Don't go...

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,560
Don't move!

35
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,240
(It's strange.
Why did the poison not react)

36
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,920
(when the Love Spell Poison
meets blood?)

37
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,400
There's no need to say sorry.

38
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,480
I mistook Your Highness for a murderer

39
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,000
and cast the Love Spell Poison upon you.

40
00:04:29,857 --> 00:04:31,571
I should take responsibility
for this matter.

Your Majesty, I went to Prince Duan's
mansion and found out

56
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,920
that Prince Duan
has indeed suffered injuries.

57
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,400
It can be inferred that

58
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,280
it was Prince Duan
who rescued Eunuch Zhang.

59
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
I also saw that...

60
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
What? They...

61
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,920
Indeed.

62
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,771
I can confirm with certainty
as I witnessed it.

63
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,200
Oh, you clever one, Jiang Jinli.

64
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,920
Your Majesty, if the posthumous edict
is indeed in Eunuch Zhang's hands,

65
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,920
I am afraid Prince Duan already has it.

66
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,960
Why don't we use the Empress's matter

67
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,320
to hit two targets at once?

68
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,160
Plotting to murder the Empress

69
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
is punishable by beheading.

70
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,000
The Empress's maid, Hua Jian,

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
isn't she still there?

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Xiao Che.

73
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,720
I will let you see

74
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,280
who is really in charge.

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,000
Are you saying

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,000
the reason they
tried to kill Eunuch Zhang,

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,600
was not just to eliminate a witness,

78
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,280
but to obtain the edict?

79
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,680
Yes, Eunuch Zhang told me.

80
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,160
If he had not been captured alive,

81
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
the Wuqing Sect
would have already killed him.

82
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,200
No wonder,

83
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,720
Xiao Mo tried to prevent

84
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
me from seeing my father
one last time that year.

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,120
After my father passed away,

86
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,600
he left an edict to pass the throne
to the second prince, Xiao Mo.

87
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,160
At that time, some officials
questioned its authenticity.

88
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,120
However, Xiao Mo had them
all killed ruthlessly.

89
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Since then, no one has dared to bring up
the issue again.

90
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,720
(It turns out Xiao Mo had me search for
the silken box,)

91
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,840
(was actually to find the true edict.)

92
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,960
(He suspected the edict
was with Prince Duan,)

93
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,720
(so he placed Jiang Jinli by his side.)

94
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,720
(What a skillful usurpation
of the throne.)

95
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
(Even God is on my side.)

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
(The next day)

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,200
The latest news is here!

98
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,040
The latest news is here!

99
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,600
(The posthumous edict is fake.)
(Prince Duan is the real Emperor)

100
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,680
Is it true or false?

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
It's true.

102
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,657
Now the entire royal kitchen
is talking about it.

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Have you heard it?

104
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
The current Emperor is fake.

105
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Don't talk nonsense.

106
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,240
If anyone hears this, you'll be
punished by beheading.

107
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,280
But I've heard...

108
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,800
Shh...

109
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,840
(Fengxi Palace)
Your Highness, please spare my life!

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,920
As long as you do as I instruct,

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,960
I will spare your life.

112
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,440
Otherwise, I'll
come after you every day,

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,720
making your life a living hell!

114
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,040
The Emperor is fake.

115
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,680
The edict is fake.

116
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
It is Prince Duan
who is the true Emperor.

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,640
The Emperor is fake.

118
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,280
The edict is fake.

119
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,560
Prince Duan is the true Emperor.

120
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,720
The true Emperor...

121
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,400
Prince Duan is the true Emperor.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,240
Summon Princess Consort Duan for
an audience.

123
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,960
His Majesty
has finally lost his patience.

124
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
I shall take my leave.

125
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,840
Your Majesty.

126
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,440
Jiang Jinli, how dare you

127
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,120
collude with Xiao Che to deceive me!

128
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,160
Deceiving the Emperor...

129
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,320
Your Majesty,

130
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

131
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
I must have misjudged
and loved the wrong person.

132
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,320
If you don't believe me,
then take my life.

133
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,920
I've heard you have been intimate
with Prince Duan in his residence.

134
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
Not like an act, but true affection.

135
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,000
I regret...

136
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,080
I regret sending you to Xiao Che.

137
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,440
You suspect me?

138
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,040
I married Prince Duan
for Your Majesty's sake.

139
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,280
I have endured
his humiliation day and night.

140
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,080
Last night, I don't know
what sudden madness came over him.

141
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,760
One moment he
was keeping distance from me,

142
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,640
and the next he suddenly became a best.

143
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
If Eunuch Liang had not arrived in time,

144
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,840
I would have been...

145
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,080
Li'er, you have suffered injustice.

146
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,280
That Xiao Che has been hypocritical.

147
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
He must have been wary of you all along.

148
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,000
No wonder the silken box
you presented to me

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,971
only contains the powers
from the Western Regions

150
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,560
What?

151
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,360
It seems that I have been exposed.

152
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,840
No wonder you would suspect me.

153
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,280
Since that is the case,

154
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:01,885
I shall find another way
to deal with this.

155
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,200
Can you return to my side, Li'er?
