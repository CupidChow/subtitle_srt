=The Rebel Empress=

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,000
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,360
His Majesty has decreed

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,080
that Princess Consort Duan should recite
scriptures and pray for the Empress.

5
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,120
This is His Majesty's edict.

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,720
Eunuch Liang, since the Princess Consort
was injured,

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,560
she hasn't recovered.

8
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,520
How dare you!

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,760
Thank His Majesty.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,080
It is my fortune to have the opportunity

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,480
to pray for the Empress.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,880
I'll go change now
and prepare to enter the palace.

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,240
Ci'er.

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
(Love Spell Poison...)

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
(I will explain it
to the prince one day.)

16
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,800
(Xiao Mo, just wait and see.)

17
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,040
Princess Consort Duan, His Majesty
has been waiting for a long time.

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,400
I shall take my leave.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,760
Yunci...

20
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,914
The mourning has troubled you
these past few days.

22
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,760
I have been unable
to sleep soundly

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,920
and kept dreaming about the Empress.

24
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,600
I am responsible for her unjust death.

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,000
Will she come and find me?

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,600
Rest assured.

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,240
I've ordered the Ministry of Rites
to arrange a lavish funeral

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,520
and promised her endless
posthumous glory and honor.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
That sounds nice

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,600
but all the bad tasks
have been left for me to do.

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560
Your Majesty is perfectly
at ease and justified.

32
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:25,800
This position of the Empress

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
is reserved for you all the time.

34
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,880
I not only
desire the position of the Empress

35
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,040
but only want to win your heart.

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,720
All under the heaven,

37
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,240
nothing is not the king's land.

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
The borders delineated by the land,

39
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,285
none are not the king's loyal vassals.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,440
As long as I'm determined
to grant this to you,

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,920
who would dare to voice any objection?

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,760
However, there is one more thing
you must do for me.

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,360
I wonder what you want me to do?

44
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,120
I've heard that Prince Duan
attained a precious treasure.

45
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,000
He kept in a silken box
and never parted from him.

46
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,520
Go get it for me.

47
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,880
(Inside the box is my stamp,)

48
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
(but what does he
want to do with the box?)

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,240
What's inside the box?

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,200
You need not ask about that.

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,480
Prince Duan
is an extremely cautious person.

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,040
He's never shared a room with me
even after marriage.

53
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,771
I find it difficult
to take action against him.

54
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
You don't need to worry about that.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,760
I have already warned him yesterday,

56
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,960
and he dares not
to neglect you again later.

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,800
After returning,
you just use your charms a little.

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,720
Which man in the world

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,240
can resist your allure?

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,280
(Unexpectedly, Jiang Jinli is also)

61
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,000
(just a pawn you've placed
beside Prince Duan.)

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,640
(You've used her love towards you)

63
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,800
(to have her entangled
between you and your brother.)

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,960
(Xiao Mo,)

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,680
(you are so ruthless.)

66
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,600
Alright.

67
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,040
After this is accomplished,

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,640
you must not forget
the promise made to me.

69
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,360
Your Majesty, don't rush.

70
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,914
Wait until the mourning
for the Empress is over,

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
then I will serve you wholeheartedly.

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,120
Alright,

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,080
you may take your leave for now.

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,120
Alright.

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,360
(Jiang Jinli, you and I have no enmity,)

76
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,360
(yet we have both been deceived
by Xiao Mo's ambitions,)

77
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,920
(ending up like this.)

78
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,480
(If you also hate him,)

79
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,360
(let's make sure
he'd end up buried with us.)

80
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,280
Oh, isn't this Princess Consort Duan?

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,240
Is it because the Prince
doesn't want to see you?

82
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,400
You dare to wander around in the palace?

83
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,720
Do you think
it's your Prince Duan's mansion?

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Consort Wise has misunderstood.

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
It's His Majesty who has summoned me to
the palace to pray for the Empress.

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,920
If Consort Wise does not believe me,

87
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,320
you can go to His Majesty to verify.

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,720
You are so audacious,

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,400
daring to invoke
His Majesty to confront me!

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,120
Let's see who dares to touch

91
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,480
my woman.

92
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,440
Didn't you say Princess Consort
entered His Majesty's chamber alone?

93
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm innocent, Your Highness.

94
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,800
I truly only saw
Her Highness enter the palace.

95
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,840
But who knows...

96
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,440
They say they aren't getting along well,

97
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,200
yet now they seem so affectionate.

98
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,200
Don't move.

99
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,480
If you break free,

100
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,560
tomorrow everyone will spread the rumor

101
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,800
that we're not getting along,

102
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,920
and I will end up
being implicated again.

103
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Why are you here?

104
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm worried about you being alone.

105
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you for helping me out today.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,600
Please do not interfere in
my affairs in the future.

107
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,080
The harem is as deep as the sea.

108
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,360
In the past, as the Empress,

109
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,640
no one dared to disrespect you,

110
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,000
but now it's different.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,760
From now on, do not act on your own.

112
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,960
Do I need to seek your approval
when handling matters?

113
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,760
But don't you forget,

114
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,800
you are now my wife.

115
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,257
You've crossed the boundary.

116
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,257
It's better not to tell Prince Duan
about the matter of the silken box.

117
00:08:14,257 --> 00:08:16,742
After all, the more people involved,
the less advantageous it is.

118
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,640
It'd be better to use this empty box
to prevaricate for now

119
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,320
and see what His Majesty is up to.

120
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,920
Come in.

121
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,200
Why are you here?

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,040
To stop the rumors.

123
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,120
Don't worry, I won't
be sleeping on the bed.

124
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,880
Don't...

125
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,840
Don't...

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,680
Don't!

127
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,360
Don't!

128
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,120
Don't...

129
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,920
It's alright now.

130
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,960
Ci'er, it's alright now.

131
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,440
It's alright now.

132
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,560
It's alright now.

133
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,320
The grand funeral
for the Empress has ended.

134
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,360
Why I did not see
Princess Consort Duan at the funeral?

135
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,480
Your Majesty, it was reported
that she had a headache.

136
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,960
However, Princess Consort Duan
and Prince slept together last night.

137
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,160
The two had a long night together.
