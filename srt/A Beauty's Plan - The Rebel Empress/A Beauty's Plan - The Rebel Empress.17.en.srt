=Episode 17=

3
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,320
Xiao Che.

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,080
Doctor, doctor, hurry!

5
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Doctor, why hasn't he woken up yet?

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,920
Please, take a look quickly.

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
The prince's injuries are too severe
and have been hypothermic for too long.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,120
Even if he regains consciousness,

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,200
it will be difficult for him
to wake up immediately.

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,520
What should we do then?

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,720
I can't let anything happen to him.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,640
Please, tell me quickly.

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
A certain amount of

14
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,800
Western Region Safflower Powder
is needed to calm him,

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,280
but this medicine is only
available in the imperial palace,

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
and I am powerless to help.

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,040
(The Wang family practiced
medicine in the early years)

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
(and was granted many rare
medicinal materials by the Emperor.)

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,160
I know a place where we can find it.

20
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,600
Qing Yi, come with me to get it.

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,520
Sure.

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,920
Lift your veil and let me see.

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Quickly.

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,440
checkpoints have been set up

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,760
at the city gates, streets,
and other transportation hubs.

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,680
We have also placed people to watch over

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,240
major medical halls
and pharmacies within the city.

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
So far, nothing has been found.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,040
Useless, what are you all even good for?

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,880
Issue orders to the
commanders in the city.

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,640
If they are caught within three days,

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
all of you will be
stripped of your uniforms.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Yes.

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,520
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,520
I don't know why,

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,600
I have been feeling weak

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
and exhausted these days.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,640
You have been working tirelessly day
and night on the matter of Prince Duan.

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,560
I will immediately have the royal kitchen

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,040
prepare some tonics for you.

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,560
Oh, no! Come help quickly!

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,760
Gauze.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,560
Here.

45
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,280
Western Region Safflower Powder.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,280
Be quick.

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,080
Hurry!

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,240
Gauze.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Hurry!

50
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,160
Fortunately, you brought back the
Western Region's safflower powder,

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,040
which has temporarily
saved the Prince's life.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,160
He needs to rest well

53
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,760
and must not aggravate the wound again.

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,240
Sure.

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,280
Xiao Che.

56
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,400
Xiao Che.

57
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,480
Qing Yi, go back and rest.

58
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,000
I will keep watch tonight.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,120
You haven't slept for
several days as well.

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,400
Let me do the watch tonight.

61
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,040
Once he wakes up, I
will go inform you.

62
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,280
I hope I am the first person he sees

63
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,880
when he wakes up.

64
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,760
Go ahead.

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,480
Your Highness.

66
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,240
Your Highness.

67
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,400
It's me.

68
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,360
Please wake up soon, okay?

69
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,800
Please wake up soon.

70
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
I'll agree to anything you say,

71
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,640
as long as you wake up.

72
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,120
Has the Prince woken up?

73
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,360
Your Highness, let me take
care of his washing and dressing.

74
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,800
Please go and rest.

75
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,040
If he wakes up and sees you like this,

76
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,000
he will be worried too.

77
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,480
Okay.

78
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Your Highness.

79
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,400
Please don't open your eyes just yet.

80
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,680
The Princess Consort
has stayed here all night,

81
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,520
hoping to be the first person you see

82
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,640
when you open your eyes.

83
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,720
I will go call her now,

84
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,520
so please wait a moment longer.

85
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,800
Your Highness,

86
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,840
The Prince has woken up.

The situation outside is now critical.

109

Xiao Mo no longer cares

110
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,440
about the royal family's dignity

111
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,720
and is conducting a
city-wide manhunt for us.

112
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,720
His actions are crude, and
public resentment is growing.

113

The top priority now

114
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,600
is to find the true
posthumous edict as soon as possible.

115
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,840
I think Xiao Mo is
making such a big fuss,

116
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,520
probably also looking
to take this opportunity

117
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,680
to find the real posthumous edict.

118
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,840
Perhaps we could find some
clues at uncle's place.

but there's no rush at the moment.

Your injury is the most
important thing right now.

The doctor said that your
wounds have just healed,

124
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,680
and you should drink more
ginger soup. Here, take this.

125
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,000
Is this ginger soup?

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes.
