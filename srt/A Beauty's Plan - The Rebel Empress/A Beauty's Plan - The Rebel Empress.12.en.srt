=The Rebel Empress=

2
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,300
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,680
(Three.)

4
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,440
(Two.)

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
(One.)

6
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,080
(Xiao Mo)

7
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,680
(You have been poisoned by
Tian Can Poison and will die soon.)

8
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,080
(This is your retribution.)

9
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:53,320
You've been so busy
with administrative matters

10
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,920
that your health has been affected.

11
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,480
Do take a good rest,

12
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,040
and I will come again another day.

13
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,240
Li'er,

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,440
there is something now

15
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,000
that is making me frustrated.

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,880
You're Reign
of Supreme Nine and Five,

17
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
enjoying the respect of the people.

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,840
What could make you troubled?

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,400
Although I am above all,

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,880
but I am exhausted from
country matters every day.

21
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,440
Things are complicated in the court.

22
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,680
I have to work hard.

23
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,040
You are my only confidant.

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,840
But for the country's sake,

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,280
I cannot keep you by my side.

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,800
You can share with me

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,640
your troubles.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,000
Even if I am dumb and cannot help you,

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,040
you can feel better by talking it out.

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,600
You have suffered much
by marrying Xiao Che,

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,000
in order to get the silken box,

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,120
you have sold your body
and faked love for him.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,960
You have really done so much for me.

34
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,160
But you also know,

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
Xiao Che is coveting my throne

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,440
and has been fighting with me

37
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,520
all these years.

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,760
For our brotherly love,

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,800
I have been bearing with him,

40
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,200
but he is not treasuring my grace.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,120
He is getting more daring

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,628
because I am not strict against him.

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,028
There are many rumors in
and outside the palace,

44
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,150
saying that the Late Emperor
had another posthumous edict

45
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,360
to decree the throne to Xiao Che.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,600
I think it is also him
orchestrating this

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,280
to fool the people with lies.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,960
Prince Duan has let you down.

49
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,000
I can see it,

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,560
and my heart hurts for you.

51
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,600
I only hate that I am useless

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,342
and cannot help you
to solve troubles.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,480
If there is anything
that I can do to help,

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,960
even if I have to walk through fires,

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,600
I am also willing.

56
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,440
Now, there is actually one thing.

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,160
What is it?

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,200
It is not something hard.

59
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,960
As long as you
expose Prince Duan in public,

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,760
and say that you were threatened by him

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
to make Empress Wang die in an accident.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,000
When the Late Emperor was dying,

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
Imperial Tutor Wang
and your father drafted

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,480
the Late Emperor's
posthumous edict together.

65
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,040
So I was able to inherit the throne.

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,800
Xiao Che hated the Jiang and
Wang family for a long time.

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,280
When Empress Wang
ruled over the imperial harem,

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,880
she would naturally be a sore eye.

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,680
But...

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,920
But wouldn't doing this

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,640
involve the whole Jiang family?

72
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,160
You don't need to worry about this.

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
I know

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,600
how loyal the Jiang family is to me.

75
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,800
When Xiao Che is defeated,

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,920
I will send you to Jokhang Temple
outside the capital

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,400
to stay for a few months.

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,880
When the situation is stable,

79
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
I will send for you

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,120
to enter the Central Palace and
confer you as Empress.

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,000
With you as Empress Jiang,

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,520
the Jiang family will only be
more prosperous and powerful.

83
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,360
You will also be
the pride of the Jiang family.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,760
As long as I can help
with your troubles,

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,880
I will do as you request.

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,440
(Xiao Mo, what a move
of throwing me to the wolves)

87
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,400
(to keep your hands clean.)

88
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,120
Your Majesty.

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,920
Jiang Jinli, you scheming woman!

90
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,360
You really have no shame.

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,280
When people gossiped,
I didn't believe it.

92
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,280
The Late Empress's
mourning period has not ended,

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,800
but you dare to use your looks

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,760
to carry out such adulterous behaviors.

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,680
It is all thanks to Her Highness

96
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,485
that Your Highness
is able to heal so quickly.

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,800
I should thank her.

98
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
(This smell.)

99
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,640
Your Highness,

100
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,600
I heard that Her Highness
entered the palace today

101
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,160
but His Majesty did not summon her.

102
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,600
You really have no care for your life.

103
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:44,971
What are you doing?

104
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,120
Xiao Che, you are crazy!

105
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,000
I am crazy!

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
But I cannot compare to you!

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,760
What is this?

108
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,840
Since you've already seen it,

109
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,160
what else do you want me to say?

110
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,840
As you can see,

111
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
this is Chinese redbud powder.

112
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
Inhaling it for a long time
will worsen asthma symptoms,

113
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,600
making Xiao Mo suffer in pain

114
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,880
until he dies.

115
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,280
Do you know

116
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,800
what Chinese redbud powder does to you?

117
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,480
It is life-threatening!

118
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,840
Xiao Mo is highly suspicious.

119
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,400
If he suddenly dies,

120
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,000
it will surely attract speculation
and instability of the country.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,880
To both of us,

122
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,440
this is the best way.

123
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
It is just one Xiao Mo!

124
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,760
Is he worth you using your life?

125
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,640
Life and death
is no longer important to me.

126
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,080
I have already died once.

127
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
It does not matter to die again.

128
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,400
Xiao Che,

129
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
I told you before

130
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,640
that I don't need you to care about me.

131
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,320
From now on...

132
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,320
Xiao Che!

133
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,720
Do you know what you are doing?

134
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,160
I saved your life.

135
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,120
Even if you view it as worthless,

136
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,920
you have to get my permission.

137
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,280
Without my permission,

138
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,520
don't you leave the mansion!

139
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,880

140
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,760

are doing this for my good,)

(but I am already
surviving in secret now.)

142
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:08,314
(I have gambled everything
I have to get revenge,)

143
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800

and hope for nothing else.)
