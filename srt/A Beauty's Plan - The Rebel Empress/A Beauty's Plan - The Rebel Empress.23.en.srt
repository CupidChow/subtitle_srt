=Episode 23=

3
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,040
What are you thinking about?

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,880
I'm thinking

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,000
that the prosperous world now

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,040
must be what my father hoped for.

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,560
It's really nice.

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,120
Do not be sad.

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Imperial Tutor Wang's soul in heaven

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,400
would also wish
that you and Dabao are happy.

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,320
Your Majesty,

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,800
I had been blessed
by the heavens and live again.

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,520
Now everything has been righted
and a bright future is within sight.

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,400
After everything, I am glad to have you.

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Meteor stars!

16
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,040
Quick, make a wish!

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,200
Alright.

18
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,400
(Xiao Che, I did not manage
to be married to you this lifetime.)

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,800
(If there is an afterlife,)

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,800
(I want to be with you)

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,720
(and never do wrong to you.)

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,800
What did you wish for?

23
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Reporting to Your Majesty,

24
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,200
ever since the ban
on the night market was lifted,

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,960
the city has been prospering
and the people have been ever more joyful.

26
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,840
Your Majesty, ever since
the new policies have been implemented,

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,880
the trade business in Jiangnan

28
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,600
has been constantly increasing!

29
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,840
Now, the people
have safe homes and good jobs,

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,440
the country is prosperous
and we all feel very proud.

31
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,280
All hail Your Majesty!
Long live Your Majesty!

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,480
Long live Your Majesty!

33
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,200
My beloved court officials, rise.

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,960
(Father, the new policy)

36
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,640
(that you persisted on for so long
did not go to waste.)

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,360
(The sights and state of the empire now
is what you wished for.)

38
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,120
This is the letter that Dabao sent to you.

39
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,840
Today is a fine day,

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
suitable to fly kites.

41
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,800
Which brother

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,240
took Dabao out to play?

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,480
It was...

44
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,720
someone who was Dabao's brother-in-law

45
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,640
who wanted to take him to fly kites.

46
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,920
Brother-in-law?

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,720
Yes.

48
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,240
(The Empress's memorial hall. Come alone.)

49
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,360
Dabao!

50
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,480
Elder sister! Elder sister!

51
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,440
Elder sister! Elder sister!

52
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,080
Brother-in-law lied!
He said he would take Dabao to fly kites,

53
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,880
but he kidnapped Dabao here.

54
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,640
Save me, sister!

55
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,040
What do you want?

56
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,400
Wang Yunci, it really is you.

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,680
Dabao has been taking

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
you as his sister.

59
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,800
I thought that

60
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,520
he was dumb and couldn't
address his relatives properly.

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,840
Now that you are here alone

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,240
and you care so much for him,

63
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,760
it seems that you are really Wang Yunci.

64
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,160
Is it that your soul has returned?

65
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,920
Or you had planned this from the start

66
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,520
with Xiao Che?

67
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,120
Xiao Mo,

68
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,280
let go of Dabao

69
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,120
and I will tell you everything.

70
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Alright?

71
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,120
Wang Yunci, how you managed
to come back to life

72
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,280
does not matter to me.

73
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,760
Dabao is innocent,

74
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,560
I will do whatever you want me to do.

75
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,040
Even if you want to kill me again,

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,400
I'd let you do it.

77
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,240
Kill you?

78
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,040
How can I bear to kill you?

79
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,960
All these years,

80
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
I have been wary of your identity,

81
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,160
not daring to let you get pregnant,

82
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,360
but also can't help

83
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,520
but be mesmerized by you.

84
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,920
The love that I gave you

85
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040
was more than

86
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
the love all the other women had.

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,320
But yet,

88
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,840
yet Xiao Che coveted my throne.

89
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
I could not eat properly or rest soundly.

90
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,360
The Wang Family,
Jiang Family and Xiao Che,

91
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,080
were like

92
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,480
three sharp knives over my head,

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,280
not knowing when they would drop.

94
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,560
Coincidentally,
Jiang Jinli that dumb woman,

95
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,840
hoped to get my love and favor.

96
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,120
I played along with her,

97
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,960
tricked her into marrying Xiao Che,

98
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,800
and misled her to kill the Empress.

99
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,480
So I managed to hit three targets at once!

100
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,880
Don't you think

101
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,360
it is such a brilliant idea?

102
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,640
But I totally did not expect

103
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,600
that after you really died,

104
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,800
I would realize that

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,440
I missed you even more.

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,840
It was so painful
that I couldn't sleep at night.

107
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,880
I wanted to kill Jiang Jinli

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,640
and take revenge for you.

109
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,040
Take revenge?
How are you going to take revenge?

110
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,920
You are the one who killed me!

111
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
Xiao Mo,

112
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,520
you speak of your pain,

113
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,680
the pain of missing me,

114
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,320
but have you really loved me?

115
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,640
Up until the end,

116
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,760
I still died for your personal interests.

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,240
You died for my empire,

118
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
I gave you great honor after your death.

119
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,200
When I pass away,

120
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
I will also be buried with you,

121
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,920
I will always be with you.

122
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
Is it not enough?

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,960
No!

124
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,880
All this is not what I want.

125
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,840
True love is not like this.

126
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,720
He is really here!

127
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,520
Who?

128
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,760
As like summoning you,

129
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
I told him that

130
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
you were in my hands.

131
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,080
I told him to evade others and come alone

132
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,520
or I would kill you both.

133
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,040
But I don't think

134
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,000
he loves you that much.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,520
He must have

136
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,360
brought many soldiers.

137
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,320
But it does not matter
how many men he brings,

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,200
I have already ordered people to bury

139
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,120
a thousand kilograms of saltpeter
in the ground.

140
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,880
It is enough for everyone to be killed.

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,480
Don't you love him?

142
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,440
Then let this place

143
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,240
be your burial places!

144
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,920
Go to hell and be a loving couple!

145
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Ci'er!

146
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Ci'er!

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,480
I am late!

148
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,760
Go save Dabao!

149
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,360
Dabao!

150
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,920
Big brother!

151
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,600
Don't be anxious!

152
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,040
I will save you!

153
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Ci'er!

154
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,080
Bring him out!

155
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,240
Dabao, go find Imperial Uncle Wang now!

156
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,800
Yes.

157
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,600
Ci'er!

158
