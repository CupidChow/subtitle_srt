00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,200
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,680
You are awake!

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,520
Your Highness, you are awake!

5
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,160
You...

6
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,440
Why are you here?

7
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,440
You are injured.

8
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,240
Go back and rest.

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,720
Your Highness,
this is Princess Consort's chamber,

10
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,160
Princess Consort knew that

11
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,680
you were not only drenched
in the rain all night at her door

12
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,720
but also barged into
the palace to rescue her.

13
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,520
She took care of you the whole night.

14
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,920
Since you are awake,

15
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,760
let me walk you back to your chamber

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,480
and let Princess Consort rest properly?

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Let's go, Your Highness.

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,840
Right.

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,320
Your Highness, your robe.

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,520
Come in.

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
Why are you out and walking about?

22
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,760
You are still injured

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,680
and need to rest.

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,240
There is nothing wrong with my body.

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,120
Thank you for saving
my life yesterday, Your Highness.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,280
Previously, I had not thought it straight.

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,480
What happened that day...

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
What are you doing?

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Xiao Che, you are crazy!

30
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,680
Xiao Che, do you know
what you are doing?

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,880
I wasn't able to
keep my emotions in check that day.

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,320
Your Highness, don't mention it.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
I am here to inform
Your Highness of a matter.

34
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,480
A few days ago,
His Majesty summoned me to the palace

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,440
and wanted me to search for
the posthumous edict in your residence.

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,560
Prince Duan received a precious object

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
and hid it in a silken box.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
Go and take it for me.

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,200
And he asked me
to accuse you in the court

40
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,240
that I was abetted by you
to kill Empress Wang.

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,720
As long as you accuse Prince Duan

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
and say that you were threatened by him

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,520
and accidentally killed Empress Wang.

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,480
Xiao Mo has not been able to find
the posthumous edict after so long

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
that he wants to accuse
of a crime like murdering the Empress.

46
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,920
So that,

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,760
the posthumous edict
cannot threaten him anymore.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,680
But once this is done by Xiao Mo,

49
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
it will be a capital crime.

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,680
Your Highness must take extra care.

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,640
When the Late Emperor was sickly,

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,320
he once summoned Prime Minister Jiang
and Imperial Tutor Wang

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,920
to draft the posthumous edict,

54
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
leaving the throne to me.

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,480
But Xiao Mo bribed Prime Minister Jiang

56
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,760
to change the edict
and succeed the throne.

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,440
Imperial Tutor Wang also suddenly died,

58
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,440
leaving the whereabouts
of the edict to be unknown.

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,320
If that's the case,

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,240
my father's death years ago is fishy.

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Your Highness,
we cannot sit back and wait anymore.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
Ci'er, rest assured.

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,480
I will return the world

64
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,840
and the Wang Family justice.

65
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,000
The most important thing now
is to find the real edict.

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,600
Whoever finds it first
will have the upper edge.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,960
Since my father

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,080
and Prime Minister Wang were both there,

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
we might be able to find the trace of it
at the Wang's and the Jiang's residence.

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,440
Yes.

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,920
Empress,

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,400
today is the 14th day of your death,

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,200
I am here to visit you.

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,160
Your Majesty!

75
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,000
Your Majesty has been frightened,

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,440
why not go back and rest.

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,760
You are excused.

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
I want to speak to the Empress.

79
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,960
Yes.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
Rest assured, Empress.

81
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,600
I will let Jiang Jinli

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,640
die for you soon.

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,440
Greetings to father.

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,480
(Jiang's Residence, Prime Minister Jiang)
Why are you here?

85
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Father, I'm here today

86
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,640
to ask you about an important matter.

87
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,320
Empress Wang's death

88
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,360
was not an accident.

89
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,040
This is related to
the whole Jiang family.

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,840
Brat!

91
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,040
Is Empress Wang's death related to you?

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,720
Yes.

93
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,040
But the mastermind behind it
is His Majesty.

94
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,560
It is His Majesty
who wants to kill Empress Wang,

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,720
I was clueless and blinded by him

96
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,880
so I bribed Hua Jian,

97
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,440
the Empress's maid.

98
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
His Majesty wanted to kill Empress Wang?

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,320
His Majesty seemed to
treat Empress Wang very well,

100
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,160
but secretly fed her injury medicine.

101
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,040
Because he didn't want children
with the Wang Family's blood.

102
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,000
A bunch of lies!

103
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,960
Prince Duan,

104
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,160
if my daughter is investigated
by the Ministry of Punishments

105
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,640
and Dali Temple with concrete evidence,

106
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,560
not only will the
Jiang Family be affected,

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
so will you, Prince Duan.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,120
Since she has already been married to me,

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,800
I will, together with her,
bear all the consequences.

110
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,800
Father, Xiao Mo is still wary of
the Jiang and Wang Family,

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,760
but is more wary of Prince Duan.

112
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,120
So he abetted me to kill the Empress

113
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,320
and accuse His Highness.

114
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,400
With this move,

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,240
His Majesty can then
hit everyone in one go

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,200
and kill off future problems.

117
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,520
The Jiang Family and Your Highness
are on the same boat.

118
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,320
We win together and lose together.

119
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
I am here today

120
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,680
not only for myself

121
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
but also for the livelihood
of the Jiang Family.

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,160
Then what does Your Highness think

123
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,760
should be done now?

124
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,520
I have a question to ask you first.

125
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,520
Back when my father
the Late Emperor was ill,

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,240
you and Imperial Tutor were summoned.

127
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,480
What actually happened?

128
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,040
Father, with the situation now,

129
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,320
if things are brought into the light,

130
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,200
the Jiang Family will not be spared.

131
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Xiao Mo will definitely
give me up to save himself.

132
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,360
Murdering the Empress
is a capital crime for the whole family!

133
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,480
His Majesty is really ruthless.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,040
Back when the Late Emperor was sick

135
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,240
and Imperial Tutor Wang and I
were told to draft the edict

136
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,320
to pass the throne
to the third son, Prince Duan.

137
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,160
Xiao Mo knows that
Imperial Tutor Wang is righteous

138
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,640
and refuses to submit to him,

139
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,120
so he poisoned him.

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,320
I was threatened by His Majesty

141
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,920
and had no choice but to read
the fake edict out later at Jinluan Hall.

142
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,040
All these years,

143
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,960
I have been unable to rest soundly
and eat properly,

144
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
I feel ashamed to the Late Emperor

145
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,120
and to you, Your Highness.

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,480
Now I have no other wishes,

147
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,720
except for the safety
of the Jiang Family.

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
If in the future, Your Highness
still wants the help of me,

149
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,040
I will do my best.

150
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,560
I promise you that

151
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,520
as long as I'm here,
the Jiang Family is safe.

152
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,880
Father, do you have clues

153
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,200
on the real edict?

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Only finding the real edict now

155
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,640
can resolve the situation.

156
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,320
Are you... trying to commit treason?

157
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520
If anything goes wrong,

158
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,360
we will be doomed.

159
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,320
Treason?

160
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
In recent years,
Xiao Mo has been dominant and brash,

161
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,000
causing cries from the people

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,880
and dissatisfaction
from the court officials.

163
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,080
All I am doing is to right the wrong.

164
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,320
If you don't revolt,

165
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
your whole family line will be convicted

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
and the entire Jiang Family executed.

167
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,640
If you revolt,

168
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
you will become Royal Father-in-Law.

169
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
The entire Jiang Family

170
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,960
will enjoy riches and prestige.

171
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,360
But, but I do not dare

172
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,640
deceive Your Highness.

173
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,920
I really do not know anything

174
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,600
about the posthumous edict.
