=Episode 22=

3
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Your Majesty, Her Lady has awakened.

4
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Forgive my presumption
in speaking out of turn,

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,880
but please, Your Highness,
advise His Majesty.

6
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,320
He has long been troubled at heart

7
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
and suffers from insomnia.

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,320
These days, he has not slept at all.

9
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,480
If this continues,

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm afraid his body won't
be able to withstand it.

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,120
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
Ci'er,

13
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,280
please don't be angry.

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
I just wanted to see you.

15
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,440
If you don't want to see me,
I'll leave immediately.

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,400
Come in.

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,880
I heard you've agreed
to select a consort.

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,040
Yes.

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,160
That's how it should be.

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,640
In the past, I always
wanted to have everything.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,800
I was reluctant to let you go,

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,320
but it wasn't until the moment you fell

23
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,840
that I realized

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,920
the one thing I cannot
bear in this world

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,720
is to be without you.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,680
No,

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,280
you never restrained me.

28
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,800
It was I who couldn't
bear your kindness,

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,360
and in the end, I could only flee away.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,480
I cherish those times

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,440
we had before.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,800
Ci'er,

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,960
I won't pressure you
anymore from now on.

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,760
Let's interact

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,800
in the way you like.

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,340
Okay?

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,360
Okay.

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
Ci'er,

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,600
take good care of
yourself and get well soon.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,600
Okay.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
Look at me

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
as I restore clarity and order
to this world.

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,800
Okay.

The night market will

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Would you like to go take a look?

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,240
Sure.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,160
Nowadays, the city is filled with
a pleasant and lively atmosphere,

54
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
and the noise of bustling
carriages is incessant.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,440
The people

56
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,160
must be especially grateful
to the current emperor.

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
This is what the capital
should look like.

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,920
Brother, sister. Brother, sister.

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,720
Brother, sister.

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,280
I want to eat candied haws.

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
Candied haws.

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,600
Two, please.

63
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,280
One for Dabao,

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,200
and one for Ci'er.

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,200
Thank you.

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
Thank you, sir.

67
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,680
Big brother,

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,760
Do you guess whether this candied haw

69
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
is sour or sweet?

70
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,200
Let me have a taste.

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,520
It's sweet.

72
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,480
Brother, I want to play pitch-pot.

73
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,960
Okay.

74
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,600
Let's go.

75
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,320
His Majesty hasn't been this happy

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,440
in a long time.

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
Brother, brother,

78
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,480
I want that.

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,880
Okay.

80
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,640
Kid, this is a prize
for the pitch-pot game,

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,840
it's not for sale.

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
You have to throw it into this pot,

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
only then can you get the lantern.

84
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,920
Let me try.

85
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,600
Okay.

86
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,360
Here, take this.

87
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,080
Go sister, go sister!

88
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,000
You can do it!

89
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,560
Come on, you can do it!

90
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,360
Keep it up!

91
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,000
Yay, got it, got it!

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
Big brother is amazing.

93
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,120
Congratulations, young lady.

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,680
Thank you.

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,360
Thank you.

96
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,040
You're welcome.

97
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,280
Dabao, don't run too fast.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,080
Goodbye, brother and sister.

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,960
Be careful.

100
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,520
Let's go.

101
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,560
Dabao is really overjoyed today.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
Sorry for troubling you.

103
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
I haven't been this happy
in a long time either.

104
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,400
It's raining.

105
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,400
Hurry up. Hurry up.

106
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,080
What's wrong?

107
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,280
My stomach hurts.

108
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,400
You've always been weak,

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,040
and you caught a cold in the rain today.

110
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,760
It must be the poison taking effect.

111
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,600
Don't worry. I will take
you back to the palace.

112
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,320
No, it's not the poison.

113
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,560
It's my period.

114
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
What should we do then?

115
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,840
Here.

116
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,920
Here?

117
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,840
Let's go.

118
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,280
Who is it?

119
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,120
Hello, ma'am.

120
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Hello.

121
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,280
How may I address you?

122
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,080
My surname is Meng,
you can call me Granny Meng.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,320
Granny Meng,

124
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,240
my sister is not feeling well.

125
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
Could you please do us a favor?

126
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,280
Alright, please come in quickly.

127
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,880
Thank you, ma'am.

128
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,920
Here.

129
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,920
It's a cold rainy night today,

130
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,400
I'll give you an extra blanket.

131
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,240
Thank you, ma'am.

132
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,520
Young lady, your brother
really cares about you.

133
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,360
What are you doing?

134
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,800
Madam said this would
make you feel a bit better.

135
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,360
I'll do it myself.

136
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,960
You're not feeling well,

137
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,880
so let me do it.

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Not here.

139
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,960
It's

140
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,480
here.

141
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh.

142
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,000
What are you thinking about?

143
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm thinking...

144
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,680
It's really nice.
