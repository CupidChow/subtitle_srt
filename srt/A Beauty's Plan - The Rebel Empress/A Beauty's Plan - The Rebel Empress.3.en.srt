=Episode 3=

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,110
(It's said that the poison powders from
the Western Regions are very strong.)

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,314
(If he accidentally eats it,)

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,240
(he'll die of colic instantly.)

6
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,228
(Love Spell Poison)

7
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,440
(Xiao Che, I will make you die tonight.)

8
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,400
Where have you been?

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,680
The chamber is so boring,

10
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,160
so I'm just walking around.

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,600
How lonely is
Your Highness to drink alone.

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,360
Let me drink with you.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
You don't trust me?

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,640
(I'd like to see how long
you can keep on acting.)

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,920
(I'd like to see how long
you can endure.)

16
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,600
Xiao Che,

17
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,240
just wait to die!

18
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,080
Just by you?

19
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,000
(Why hasn't the poison reacted?)

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,200
(Even if I die again,)

21
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:35,740
(I'll drag you to my grave.)

22
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,640
You think you can kill me by doing this?

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,040
Xiao Che!

24
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,520
Xiao Che!

25
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,800
Let go of me!

26
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,280
What are you doing?

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,080
Let go of me!

28
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,200
What are you doing?

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,360
Xiao Che!

30
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:34,257
Xiao Che!

31
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,240
What are you trying to do?

32
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640
What do you think?

33
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,400
You planned to murder me.

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Today I'll let you...

35
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,000
How could this be?

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Xiao Che.

37
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,960
Xiao Che.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
You...

39
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,440
Ci'er?

40
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,280
Bear with the pain.

41
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,360
Grab me if it hurts.

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,200
(Side courtyard of western suburb)

43
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
Ci'er?

44
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Xiao Che.

45
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm not!

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,520
Xiao...

47
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,280
Ci'er,

48
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,600
this time,

49
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,960
I will never let you go again.

50
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,760
I will protect you for sure.

51
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Alright?

52
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,960
Ci'er.

53
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
Does he have
ulterior motives against me?

54
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
If that is the case,
why did he try to kill me?

55
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,742
Could it be that
the murderer was someone else?

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,720
(Oh no, the poison!)

57
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,640
(Xiao Che can't die now!)

58
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:17,720
(When the Deep Valley
tributes the poison powders,)

59
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,200
(they will offer the antidote as well.)

60
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,120
(The antidote is surely inside the box.)

61
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
(Love Spell Poison?)

62
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,440
(Activates by blood
and is life-threatening,)

63
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,040
(but a kiss can slow down the effect.)

64
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,600
Xiao Che!

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,120
Xiao...

66
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,080
Don't come over here.

67
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
It's him.

68
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,560
Don't come here.

69
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,800
I won't hurt you, so don't be afraid.

70
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,180
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

71
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
(No, it's impossible.)

72
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
(Impossible.)

73
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,520
Don't come here!

74
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Xiao Che!

75
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,400
Xiao Che!

76
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,880
Xiao Che!

77
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,120
Please excuse me, Your Highness.

78
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,720
Xiao Che, what are you doing?

79
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,240
Let go of me!

80
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,680
Xiao Che, you maniac!

81
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,960
Let go of me!

82
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,000
Let go of you?
Don't even think about it.

83
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,760
Xiao Che, you maniac!

84
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,000
Jiang Jinli, how dared you

85
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,480
to poison me!

86
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,520
What are your dirty secrets

87
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
about trying to kill me?

88
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,160
I hurt you accidentally
yesterday to protect myself.

89
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,160
I didn't want to kill you,
Your Highness.

90
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,608
Instead, do you remember

91
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,480
when you were drunk yesterday...?

92
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
What happened? Tell me.

93
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,400
Yesterday when you were drunk,

94
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,440
you mistook me for the Empress.

95
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,390
You have fantasies
of your sister-in-law...

96
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,000
Shut up!

97
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,880
Be careful with your words.

98
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
The Empress has always behaved so well.

99
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,080
For the Emperor
and the consorts, she is flawless.

100
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,760
She is not the one
you can fantasize about.

101
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,840
Just for spreading rumors,

102
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,080
I can punish you
for disrespectful behaviors.

103
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,560
Qing Yi.

104
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,080
Yes.

105
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,440
(He cares so much about me.)

106
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,714
(Was it really him in the first place?)

107
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,440
(Then who killed me?)

108
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,857
(I wonder when His Majesty
will return to the palace.)

109
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,160
(I have to meet His Majesty
to investigate this matter.)

110
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,310
Find out as soon as possible

111
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,520
if Princess Consort is related
to the death of the Empress.

112
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:01,880
Yes.

113
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,040
After releasing Xue Lian,

114
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,360
did anyone contact her in private?

115
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,240
After she was released,

116
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,160
she locked herself
in her room all the time.

117
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
Our men are monitoring day and night

118
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,942
but have yet to discover anything.

119
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,960
Princess Consort seems to have no idea
of Xue Lian's disappearance.

120
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,240
Keep on monitoring.

121
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:22,920
Yes, Your Highness.

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,280
(Jiang Jinli, what exactly do you want?)
