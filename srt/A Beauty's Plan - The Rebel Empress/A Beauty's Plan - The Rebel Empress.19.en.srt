=Episode 19=

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,200
Here arrives the Royal Decree!

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,160
The Late Emperor's posthumous edict,
to be taken as the Late Emperor,

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,880
Prince Duan to receive.

6
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,280
Third royal son, Prince Duan, Xiao Che,

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,280
who is virtuous, pure and kind,

8
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,520
is very similar to me
and will be able to continue my reign,

9
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,320
and is now chosen
to succeed my throne as emperor.

10
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,720
This decree is to the world
for all to know.

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,440
End of the edict.

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,160
Your official, receives the decree.

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,800
This is impossible! This is impossible!

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,880
The edict is fake.

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,440
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,000
(Posthumous Edict)

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,880
I have been looking for it for years

18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,640
but have never succeeded.

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,080
How can this be real?

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,280
Imperial Tutor Wang had good intentions

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,760
and knew that whoever held this edict

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,160
would have trouble coming after them.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,960
So he decided to

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,320
hide it in an intricate box

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
and gave it to Dabao as a toy.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,720
Until the time when all has calmed down.

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,040
and the sun is seen again,

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,200
will the Wang Family bring this item

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,000
and provide an ending.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,320
May all see, if there are any objections.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,960
Elder Sister,

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,440
Dabao dreamed of Father,

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Father said that
as long as Dabao helps him

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,040
take care of this silken box,

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,560
he will reward me
and take me to ride horses.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,680
What silken box?

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,240
This one.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,480
It has the Late Emperor's seal!
This is real!

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,680
Congratulations to Your Highness,
clearing up injustice,

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
righting the wrong,
and succeeding the throne.

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,000
Congratulations to Your Highness!

42
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,840
You all have been frightened,

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,720
I have private matters to deal with today.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,920
Please may you all be excused first.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,880
Yes, Your Highness.

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,000
This is impossible! Every step

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,160
has been in my expectations,

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,120
how could I have lost?

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Why do those court officials,

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,920
and Father, that old thing,

51
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,800
are all inclined towards you!

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,920
Could it be that me in power

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
really went against the heavens?

54
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,320
I should never have let you off!

55
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,480
Xiao Mo.

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,440
Seven years ago,
I returned my military powers

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,360
and went far away from the court.

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
It was because I firmly believed

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,880
that you would be a good emperor.

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,120
So I chose to stay in the dark

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,040
and maintain peace
and a prosperous empire with you.

62
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,680
Xiao Mo,

63
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
from then till now,

64
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,160
I have never thought of

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
fighting with you for the throne.

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,600
Do you have the ability to fight with me?

67
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
From the start to the end,

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,120
I have never lost to you.

69
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,960
Without you,

70
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,920
I will still be able to regain land,

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,960
make the temple last

72
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,880
without affecting the empire!

73
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,600
Xiao Mo,

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,280
up until now, you still don't get it.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,440
In your heart,

76
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,160
me, Empress Wang, Consort Wise,

77
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,640
all the court officials
and even the people

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,680
have only been

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,520
your tools in the fight for power.

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,360
But.

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,920
But they are all live people.

82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,920
They have happiness and sadness,
and have kindness and evil.

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,440
They all have someone

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,760
they will do anything to protect.

85
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,880
Even if you are crowned Emperor,

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,640
you also cannot step on them carelessly

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,400
and do whatever you want.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,880
So what?

89
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,640
Ever since my mother passed away,

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
it does not matter how many years
I spent in the palace.

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,880
This gigantic palace
is filled with knives everywhere.

92
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,520
The road ahead is long and dangerous,

93
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,760
I suffered so many hits and attacks

94
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,040
to reach the situation now.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
Once born into royalty,

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,800
you can't ever be yourself.

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,760
What's wrong for me?

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,760
Brother,

99
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,640
no matter who sits on the throne,

100
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
what we should do
is to strive for the peace of the empire

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,600
and for the happiness of the people.

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Is it not so?

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,920
My good brother,

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,440
if you want to have control
over your empire,

105
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,000
you need to have political support.

106
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,200
You don't even understand such concepts.

107
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,120
Xiao Mo,

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,400
are you familiar with this smell?

109
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,600
How dare you ignore my love for you

110
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,840
and poison me?

111
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,880
Jiang Jinli, you are a witch!

112
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,880
Since you call me a witch,

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,400
I will definitely live up to it.

114
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,560
Xiao Mo, I will not only

115
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,120
make you be tortured by pain

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,040
but also remove your ability as a man!

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
I will make you suffer pain
like never before!

118
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,200
Do you remember exhausting

119
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,640
all methods to find the silken box?

120
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,320
You! You dare!

121
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,360
Even if I am going to die,

122
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,120
I am also going to die on this throne.

123
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,200
You changed the Late Emperor's
posthumous edict and usurped the throne,

124
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
ignored the laws for your own benefit,

125
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,160
and killed court officials and concubines.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,400
Your sin is so terrible.

127
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,120
If you die just like this,

128
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,480
do you think they will agree?

129
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,840
I'll expel you to the borders
to pay for your sins.

130
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,280
Xiao Mo,

131
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
today you will see

132
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,640
the empire changing owners,
and the lands changing colors.

133
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Come in, guards!

134
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,800
Yes.

135
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,200
Lock him up!

136
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,440
The throne is mine!

137
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Let go of me!

138
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Let go of me!

139
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,440
It has finally ended.
