00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,360
(Mansion of Prince Duan)

2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,800
(Happiness)

3
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
It's so hot.

4
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,160
It's winter right now.
Maybe you are too impatient.

5
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,520
Today is so important,

6
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
but you're still here
to fool around with me.

7
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:25,085
Aren't you afraid of
messing up the important thing?

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
What's that?

9
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,600
You are the only one important now.

10
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,600
=The Rebel Empress=

11
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:42,960
=Episode 1=

12
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,160
(Xiao Che, Prince Duan)

13
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,240
Is she awake?

14
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,890
Your Highness, the Imperial Physician
had just come to do a checkup.

15
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,200
(Why do I hear a man's voice
in my chamber?)

16
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,880
(The Prince?)

17
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,960
Xiao Che?

18
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,160
How dare you address me by my name?

19
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
Why wouldn't I dare?

20
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm the Empress of the Yuan dynasty.

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,160
Why can't I call you by your name?

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,160
You've lost your mind
dreaming of becoming the Empress.

23
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,600
Xiao Che, you're truly fearless.

24
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,960
How dare you touch me?

25
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll report it to His Majesty.

26
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,840
Jiang Jinli.

27
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,800
Who do you think you are?

28
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,560
(Jiang Jinli?)

29
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:03,880
(Jiang Jinli, Princess Consort Duan)

30
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:07,628
Be the Princess Consort Duan
that you're supposed to be.

31
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't challenge my patience.

32
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,560
(Princess Consort?)

33
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,520
If not, don't blame me

34
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,657
for not taking care of
the Jiang family's honor!

35
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:16,942
Your Highness, please don't be mad.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,520
Her Highness
was suffocated for so long.

37
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,400
She may had a nightmare.

38
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,880
Please don't take her words to heart.

39
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
The Jiang family?

40
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,240
(No.)

41
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,680
(I'm not at my Fengxi Palace.)

42
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:34,457
(I don't see my violet gold throne
that I always sit on.)

43
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,280
(My Hua Jian and Chi Su
are not around either.)

44
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,720
(Jiang Jinli's Chamber)

45
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Your Highness, what's going on?

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,200
It's not right.

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm the Empress of the Yuan dynasty.

48
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm Wang Yunci, the daughter
of the Wang family in Langya.

49
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,360
My husband is the all-mighty Emperor.

50
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
No, it's impossible.

51
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,020
Are you going crazy again?

52
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:08,200
You just fainted due to suffocation.

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Your face is not ruined.

54
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Since you're awake,

55
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
go to Yide Hall tomorrow morning.

56
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
Prepare well for
the Empress's funeral ceremony.

57
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,280
The Empress's

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
funeral ceremony?

59
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
Your Highness.

60
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:47,740
(Eight hours ago,
the Side Pavilion of Fengxi Palace)

61
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,640
Your Majesty.

62
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:50,257
Is this a present from His Majesty?

63
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:51,600
Your Majesty.

64
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,410
It's a congratulatory
present from Prince Duan.

65
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:55,480
(Wang Yunci, the Empress)
He's patrolling the palace tonight,

66
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,870
so he can't come to congratulate you.

67
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
(Hua Jian)
He said it had to be

68
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,250
(Maid of the Empress)
delivered to you.

69
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,920
Your Majesty, be patient.

70
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,400
His Majesty must be
preparing a surprise for you.

71
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,920
Look at the golden butterfly flower
dress that you're wearing.

72
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,240
His Majesty specially ordered
the Bureau of Garment Production

73
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,200
to customize for you.

74
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,600
His Majesty doted on you the most.

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
I'll go to place the present down.

76
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,371
It's the Empress's birthday.

77
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,040
Jiang Jinli still dares to come late.

78
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,400
(Consort Wise)
Her behavior is really unacceptable.

79
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:43,840
(Jiang Jinli's mother)

80
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
Your Majesty is so pretty.

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,640
Your Majesty, is this
what you're talking about?

82
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,640
Yes.

83
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,680
I heard the leader of the Deep Valley

84
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,000
sent all sorts of
poisonous worms and powders.

85
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:13,200
Worms are the thing I'm most afraid of.

86
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,360
This jade pendant
had followed me for years.

87
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,228
It's able to detoxify
and chase insects away.

88
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,280
Tonight,

89
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:21,320
I'll be depending on it.

90
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:36,857
Just go now.

91
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

92
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,720
Let's go.

93
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:45,840
Don't let them wait for too long.

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,480
Her Majesty has arrived.

95
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
(Fengxi Palace)

96
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,680
Wish the Empress prosperity

97
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
and longevity.

98
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
His Majesty has arrived.

99
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,560
Yunci, do you like it?

100
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,480
Thank you for your love, Your Majesty.

101
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,800
I love it a lot.

102
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,200
This is the most gorgeous fireworks
that I've ever seen

103
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,600
in my 25 years of life.

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
However, the making process
of the fireworks is too complicated,

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,320
and the transportation is a hassle.

106
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,600
To me,

107
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,120
watching fireworks like this,

108
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,640
once in a lifetime is more than enough.

109
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,600
(Xiao Mo, the Emperor)
Yunci, you're tolerant and loving,

110
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,200
abandoning luxury
while favoring frugality,

111
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,914
and showing solicitude
towards the people.

112
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,880
I'm very happy with it.

113
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Yunci!

114
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
There's a fire!

115
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,160
Yunci, be careful!

116
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,440
Your Majesty, you can't come inside!

117
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,120
Yunci!

118
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,742
Your Majesty!

119
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,400
Your Majesty!

120
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,440
Li'er!

121
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,840
Li'er!

122
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,200
Let's leave here, everybody!

123
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,160
Your Majesty, you can't go there!

124
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,880
I think I've really died before.

125
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,200
But how did I
become Princess Consort Duan?

126
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,760
The jade pendant is still here.

127
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,180
I didn't expect that it would be here

128
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,320
when my body had changed.

129
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,840
Even this knot could
stay unharmed in the fire.

130
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,600
Your Highness,
you were frightened today.

131
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,971
Please take this medicine.

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,960
Good medicine is bitter.

133
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,320
You must endure it.

134
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,640
Warm spa and the things
that you asked for

135
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,910
were all prepared, Your Highness.

136
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,314
Do you still want
to go to the warm spa today?

137
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:10,428
(What did Jiang Jinli prepare?)

138
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,942
(But seeing the state I'm in right now,)

139
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:15,657
(I do need to have a washup.)
