It's so high.

4
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,240
Fly!

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,600
Dabao?

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,680
It's so high.

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:02,960
Dabao.

8
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,800
Dabao.

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,080
Dabao!

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,000
Sister.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,160
I knew it.

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,080
You would never leave Dabao.

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,080
Sister, did you return from heaven?

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,680
Dabao,

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,960
how did you recognize me?

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,480
Sister! Sister!

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,760
If I say you are my sister,

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,960
you are my sister.

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,600
(Never mind,)

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
(maybe it's because we are
born from the same mother.)

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,200
Sister, can you fly a kite with me?

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,200
Sure.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,120
Go slowly.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,480
Okay.

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,840
Fly.

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,160
I saw you were drunk yesterday.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Maybe you were in a bad mood,

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
so I let Dabao into the mansion
without asking you.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,320
You won't be angry, will you?

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,000
I must thank Your Highness.

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,840
With the status I have now,

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
it's really difficult to
see Dabao even once.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,040
It's just that if Dabao comes to the
Prince's Mansion secretly like this

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,280
and is seen by others,

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,400
it would be hard to explain

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
and might lead to a lot of trouble.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,360
You can rest assured.

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,760
I have dismissed the servants.

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,200
No one knows that Dabao is here.

40
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,840
Your identity will not be suspected.

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,120
Sister! Sister!

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,640
Come here quickly!

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,080
Okay.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:24,880
Here.

45
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,480
Come.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Fly.

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,240
Dabao.

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,280

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,840
Okay, rest assured.

(Prince's Mansion)

75
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,040
(Entrance of Wang's Residence)
Dabao, you must remember what I said.

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,920
No matter who asks
you, don't tell anyone

77
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,080
that you came to the mansion
and met me, got it?

78
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,040
I got it.

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,320
When will I be able to see you again?

80
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,400
Soon.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,520
Go.

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,840
Okay.

83
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,240
Uncle.

84
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,000
Uncle.

85
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,160
Oh, you little kid.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,800
Where have you been all day?

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
The streets were
particularly lively today,

88
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,120
so I went to eat candied haws.

89
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:05,360
Let's go.

90
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,770
Return to the residence for a meal.

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,080
Okay.

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,200
Uncle, Dabao...

93
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
We will be able to reunite very soon.

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,720
Eunuch Zhang,
it's not safe to stay here.

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,800
Let's leave quickly.

96
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:31,257
Let's go.

97
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,440
After all this time,

98
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,828
Xiao Mo must have already
opened that silken box.

99
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:43,650
I need to think of a way
to get into the palace.

100
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,857
Who is it?

101
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,760
It's me.

102
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,000
Let me help you.

103
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,120
It might hurt a little.

104
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,840
Bear with it.

105
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:56,657

so I thought you might lose this arm.

128
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,840
I didn't expect that
under my meticulous care,

129
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,640
it would recover so quickly.

130
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,360
Maybe I have a talent for
practicing medicine after all.

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,080
I'll find an imperial physician
someday to learn from.

This wound

140
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,600
looks similar to the one
seven years ago.

141
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Both...

142
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
are difficult to heal.

143
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,040
Only the weapons of the Wuqing
Sect can cause wounds like this.

144
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,720
Seven years ago,

145
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:55,840
when I went to Yunnan
to provide disaster relief,

146
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,850
I received the news that
my father was critically ill.

147
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,880
On my way back to the capital,

148
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:02,400
I was ambushed and severely injured

149
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,160
by the Wuqing Sect

150
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,720
and was saved by you.

151
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
By the time I returned to the palace,

152
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,685
Xiao Mo had already taken
control of the entire palace.

153
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,760
I didn't even get to see my father

154
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,240
for the last time.

155
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:23,240
What's even more unexpected is that

156
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
when I saw you again,

157
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,840
you had become my sister-in-law.

158
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,400
Your injuries are severe.

159
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll go prepare some more medicine.

160
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,840
Useless!

161
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,120
You can't even catch an old eunuch.

162
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,942
Didn't you say there's no
one the Wuqing Sect can't kill?

163
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,640
Your Majesty, please calm down

164
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,085
Your health is of utmost importance.

165
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,160
The person who came had
extraordinary martial arts skills.

166
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,914
Most of them were killed
with a single blow.

167
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,960
By the time I arrived,
there was no one left,

168
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,200
but there were traces
of blood in the inn.

169
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
This person was injured.

170
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,720
Probably he couldn't run far.

171
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,520
However, the only one
in the capital who can

172
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,560
evade the Wuqing Sect's
swords is Prince Duan.

173
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,371
Hurry, take people to Prince Duan's
Mansion to find out what's going on.

174
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,080
