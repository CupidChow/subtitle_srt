=The Rebel Empress=

2
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,300
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,880
Why did Princess Consort Duan

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,760
not appear at the funeral today?

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,000
Your Majesty, it was reported
that she had a headache.

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
But...

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,680
Just speak, don't mumble!

8
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,720
Yes.

9
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:06,800
According to rumors
from the Prince's Mansion,

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,360
Princess Consort Duan
and Prince slept together last night.

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,800
The two had a long night together,

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,080
hence Princess Consort Duan
could not wake up today

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,400
and slept till noon.

14
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:23,857
Please calm down, Your Majesty!

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,480
I deserve to die! I spoke too much.

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,960
Why did you not wake me up today?

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,419
I saw you sleeping so soundly
that I couldn't bear to wake you.

18
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:45,800
Then...

19
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,360
You...

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,520
You can't go to

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,840
Empress Wang's funeral alone.

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,742
What if he calls punishment on you?

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,200
Are you showing concern for me?

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,360
I.. I am not...

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,640
I didn't say anything
that I shouldn't say last night, right?

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,040
What should be said?

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
What shouldn't be said?

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,480
Xiao Che, be serious.

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,240
I was asleep the whole night till dawn

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,371
and didn't hear anything.

31
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:04,057
(Thank god it is a false alarm.)

32
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:05,720
(It seems like I was overthinking.)

33
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,200
You are hurting me!

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,840
Jiang Jinli!

35
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,720
Your Majesty, what's wrong with you?

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,400
Who allowed you to enter?

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,480
Go away!

38
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,280
Your Highness, your letter.

39
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,640
Go ahead.

40
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,600
Yes.

41
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,840
(May Princess Consort
find the silken box as soon as possible)

42
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,560
(and enter the palace
to meet His Majesty.)

43
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,640
Are you sure it is Eunuch Zhang?

44
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,760
Yes, that's correct.

45
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,560
Our men have arranged him
to stay in the inn.

46
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,800
But he insists on meeting with you.

47
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,828
Greetings, Your Highness.

48
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:21,400
Wait for me to return.

49
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,800
(This smell.)

50
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
Thank you for
saving my life, Your Highness.

51
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,320
Please have a seat, Eunuch Zhang.

52
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,520
I did not expect to live to see you.

53
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,440
What do you mean?

54
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,960
I was serving the Late Emperor
at the Imperial Mausoleum

55
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,080
but who knew
that someone wanted to kill me.

56
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,280
I have hence been
in hiding for seven years.

57
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,760
I'm now very old,

58
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,080
and do not have much time left.

59
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,800
Hence must risk an audience
with Your Highness.

60
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,400
Who dares to go after people

61
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,680
for the Late Emperor's seal?

62
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,120
It's the current Emperor!

63
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,520
Royal Brother?

64
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,160
Your Highness, you don't know

65
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,880
that when the Late Emperor was ill,

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,000
he ordered Tutor Wang and Minister Jiang
to draft his posthumous edict.

67
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,560
I personally ground ink
for the Late Emperor

68
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,200
and heard that he wanted
to pass the throne to you.

69
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,600
Who knew that Xiao Mo
would end up succeeding on the throne.

70
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,920
I guess that

71
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,640
the Emperor is coming after me

72
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,640
to kill me!

73
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,920
Your Majesty.

74
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,280
Your Majesty.

75
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,280
I heard that you and Prince Duan
have been very loving recently.

76
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,640
I would like to see

77
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,240
whom his Princess Consort loves more.

78
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,160
Li'er, you are mine!

79
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,120
The silken box!

80
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
Li'er, you are so amazing.

81
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,200
You have not opened it, right?

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,800
I would've liked to open
and see what treasure is inside

83
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,640
but I can't open it at all.

84
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,400
Does Your Majesty know what is inside?

85
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,800
It is a thing from my childhood.

86
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,920
Xiao Che picked it up

87
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
and wants to keep it for himself.

88
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Then it seems that it has
returned to its owner at last.

89
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,120
Li'er,

90
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,960
I find that

91
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,640
I am getting unwilling
to send you back to Xiao Che.

92
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,560
Rest assured.

93
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,600
The moment the Empress's funeral ends,

94
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,400
I will confer you as Empress.

95
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,840
Return to the palace.

96
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Li'er,

97
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,760
you are mine.

98
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,360
Xiao Mo,

99
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,400
I will pull apart
every layer of your face

100
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,360
and let the world see
