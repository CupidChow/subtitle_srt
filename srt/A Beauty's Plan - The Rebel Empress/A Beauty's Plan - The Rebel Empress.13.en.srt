=Episode 13=

3
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,080
Eunuch Liang has been the one
who conveys the Emperor's order,

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,000
why is it a different person today?

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
Eunuch Liang has other matter today.

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,520
Princess Consort, just follow me.

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,320
This is not right.

8
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,280
You are not a servant to His Majesty.
Who are you?

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,240
Ci'er.

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,320
Ci'er.

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,120
Your Highness, what is going on?

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,200
Where is the Princess Consort?

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,800
His Majesty sent someone here
to take Princess Consort into the palace.

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,440
Princess Consort went early in the morning

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,560
and haven't come back till now.

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,840
How dare you!

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,920
I asked you
to check Princess Consort out closely,

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,240
don't even let her step a single step
out of the Prince's residence.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,200
You...

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,560
Your Highness,
without His Majesty's order,

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,640
you are not allowed to enter the palace.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,680
Your Highness, your shoes!

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,480
You are awake.

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,800
Who are you?

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,640
How dare you kidnap the Princess Consort
of the present royal family?

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,960
If Prince Duan knows about this,

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,920
you will be killed for sure.

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
Prince Duan?

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,280
Even if Prince Duan
searches through the whole palace,

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,880
I'm afraid that he won't be able
to find this place.

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,040
Moreover, without the Emperor's order,

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,880
how can Prince Duan come into the palace?

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,520
It's rumored it that Prince Duan and you
are not close to each other.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,960
You are still holding
this wishful thinking,

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
hoping for Prince Duan
to come and rescue you?

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,720
Continue dreaming then.

37
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,960
What a daring person you are.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,200
Still being stubborn
when you are about to die.

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,240
Wait here quietly and die!

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Don't move!

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,160
Anyone!

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,680
Save your energy.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Even if you shout
until you lose your voice,

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,680
no one will be here.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,520
I've been using needles
for a few ten years.

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
I even know the trick of

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,480
carving patterns
between skin and flesh using needles.

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,960
Does Princess Consort want to have a try?

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,400
You good-for-nothing wretch.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,640
If I don't give you some real punishment,

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
you won't be obedient.

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,800
Have you tasted this?

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,240
Do you want to try the taste of hot wax?

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,960
Who is the one that wants me dead?

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,760
You want to know who?

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,040
Why are you dragging it?

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,240
Just end her.

58
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,680
I don't have so much patience.

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,080
Your Highness.

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,480
It's you.

61
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,080
Qing Yi, have you found her?

62
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,720
Prince, not yet.

63
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
I found out that

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,320
His Majesty did not call Princess Consort
into the palace today.

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,080
Princess Consort went missing
right after entering the palace.

66
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,960
Let's go.

67
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,040
There's nothing
between Consort Wise and I.

68
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,600
Why do you want me dead?

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,360
If Prince Duan found out
that I wasn't back till now,

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
he will come into the palace
to find me for sure.

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,960
If His Majesty knows about this,

72
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
what will you do by then?

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,880
You!

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What a vixen good at talking.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,320
No wonder with those looks of yours,

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,600
you make Prince Duan
and His Majesty surround you.

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
You've reminded me.

78
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,320
I need to think of a good way,

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,000
so that no one will blame me.

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,320
Tear her clothes.

81
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,600
Don't!

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,720
Let me go!

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,480
How about the Princess Consort
having an affair with a royal guard

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,240
and was given poison to end her own life
by the kind Consort Wise?

85
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,160
How does that sound?

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,080
Consort Wise.

87
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,040
I have been in love with Prince Duan.

88
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
Have you ever thought that

89
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,880
I did not cling onto
His Majesty intentionally.

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,760
He's the one who forced me to!

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,520
Nonsense!

92
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,000
His Majesty's harem
is full of pretty concubines.

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,960
It's impossible for him
to take a liking of you

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,920
simply because you resemble
the passed Empress a little?

95
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,240
What a joke.

96
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
Nanny, do it now.

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,640
Don't.

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,320
Don't!

99
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,880
How are you?

100
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,800
Are you alright?

101
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Consort Wise, how dare you
perform punishment without permission?

102
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,040
Do you not wish to live anymore?

103
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,480
Your Highness.

104
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,520
Don't kill her. That poison is fake.

105
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
She begged mercy for Dabao last time,

106
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,040
I owe her once.

107
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,000
I will return it to her this time.

108
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,560
Tonight, for the sake
of the Princess Consort,

109
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
I will spare your life.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,480
However, listen closely.

111
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,880
If this happens again,

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,920
I will tear you into pieces for sure.

113
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,200
Consort Wise.

114
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,680
He's not worth it.

115
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,680
Wait for me.

116
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,640
Don't move.

117
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,960
The wound from the needle on you
must be treated immediately.

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,160
It will be a little painful.

119
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
Hold me.

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,240
Hold me tight.

121
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,200
Done.

122
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,440
This can ease your pain.

123
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,600
Take a good rest.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,440
Prince.

125
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,240
Prince!

126
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,440
Someone, come in.

127
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,240
Someone, come in!
