1
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,700
=The Rebel Empress=

2
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,200
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,640
Let the funeral begin!

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,040
Moan.

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,000
End.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,800
Here comes His Majesty!

7
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,840
His Majesty is here
to pray for Her Majesty,

8
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,720
praying for her soul to last forever

9
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,560
and rest in peace.

10
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Yunci,

11
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm sorry for being late.

12
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,160
Here are

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,360
our letters from the past

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,240
and my unspoken love for you.

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,080
You haven't seen them yet.

16
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,480
We are not prepared to be separated.

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,040
I want to cry but have no sound.

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
I regret that papers are limited,

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,720
and unable to write down my feelings.

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,160
(Your Majesty!
You have finally returned!)

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,520
Her Majesty reigned over the consorts,
being virtuous and kind.

22
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,280
In light of her sudden passing,

23
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:46,560
the Empress is specially conferred

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,640
to titles of Mercy, Virtue, Harmony

25
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,920
Honesty, Grace, and Erudition.

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,080
Fengxi Palace is to be restored.

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,652
And the Bureau of Garment Production
will replicate

28
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:00,720
the Golden Butterfly Flower Dress,

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,880
in respect of the Late Empress.

30
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,560
This is His Majesty's edict!

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,600
From this day on,

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,440
all Imperial Consorts and Royal Ladies

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,560
are to moan for the Late Empress
for three days.

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,840
Your Highness,

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,440
please look here.

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
These are the gray powders

37
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,480
found in Fengxi Palace during the fire.

38
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:50,240
It's the same as what
Princess Consort left in your chamber.

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
As you guessed,

40
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
the fire was not an accident.

41
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,200
I went to the mortuary
to investigate the bodies

42
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,010
and found that only
seven people died from the fire

43
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,560
while the rest were strangled to death.

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,200
Jiang Jinli!

45
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Your Majesty!

46
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
When have we been so estranged?

47
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,160
A few days ago, you...

48
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,560
You were frightened a few days ago,

49
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,000
so take care of yourself.

50
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,360
Alright, stop crying.

51
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,960
You are making my heart ache.

52
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
I know you feel wronged.

53
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
It was my problem that night.

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,800
It won't happen again.

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,640
What are you saying?

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Aren't you angry with me

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
that I sent servants
to save the Empress

58
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,800
and just left you alone?

59
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,257
There were a lot of people back then.

60
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,160
I had to do that.

61
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,080
Moreover,

62
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,320
the reason why I arrived late
before the Empress and court officials

63
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,640
was all because of you.

64
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
Today is so important,

65
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:51,360
but you're still here
to fool around with me.

66
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:54,400
Aren't you afraid of
messing up the important thing?

67
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,280
What's that?

68
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,520
You are the only one important now.

69
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,280
(I can't believe the nightmare I had
while unconscious is true.)

70
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,320
(The Emperor and Princess Consort
are having an affair!)

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,320
I still fall to your tactics.

72
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,320
Unlike the Empress,
who is plain and boring.

73
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,840
But aren't you being too impatient?

74
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,600
Choosing the Empress's birthday

75
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,990
to add such a large amount of cotton

76
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,200
laced with saltpeter dust in her dress,

77
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,280
then switching Prince Duan's present
and lacing it with yellow phosphorus.

78
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,040
But what if someone realizes it?

79
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,200
How should I protect you?

80
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,600
Alright, don't cry.

81
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,960
Don't be afraid,

82
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,000
Everything is over.

83
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,240
I also put the people
of that palace to death

84
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,680
for you.

85
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
(So the accomplice
is right in front of me,)

86
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840
(and someone I love the most!)

87
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,720
You! How dare you!

88
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
So what?

89
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,240
You adulterous couple!

90
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,080
I will make you die with me!

91
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,520
So, how are you going to thank me?

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,560
What do you want, Your Majesty?

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,400
What's wrong? Why is your face so pale?

94
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,880
Are you feeling unwell?

95
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,760
Or do you miss me again?

96
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,560
It is inconvenient today,

97
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,600
but we do not need to have fun

98
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,520
at Prince Duan's Mansion later.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
When the Empress's funeral is over,

100
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,880
I will confiscate Prince Duan's Mansion

101
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,080
and confer you as the Empress.

102
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,000
Are the things in place?

103
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,600
Why is this here?

104
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,840
(So this is a whole planned trap)

105
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,520
(to make me die in an accident,)

106
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,942
(and push the blame onto Prince Duan.)

107
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:50,457
(What a brilliant scheme
of hitting two birds with a stone!)

108
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,440
Your Majesty,

109
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:54,000
Prince Duan is highly suspicious
and wary,

110
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,514
and the door of his chamber
is locked day and night.

111
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,560
I haven't been able
to find a chance all this time.

112
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,280
What a cunning fox Xiao Che is.

113
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,040
It doesn't matter. I'll find other ways.

114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
(Xiao Mo.)

115
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,800
(You have bullied me,
wronged me, and hurt me,)

116
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,880
(causing misfortune
to people around me.)

117
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
(You'll die a tragic death!)

118
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,680
So you are here.

119
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,720
I come to seek her to discuss matters.

120
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
Please allow me to excuse myself.

121
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,520
Alright.

122
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,040
(Turns out that I am
just a pawn for Xiao Mo.)

123
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,400
(We had been married for seven years)

124
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,080
(but he had parted with me already.)

125
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,200
(Yunci,)

126
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
(What a sad joke.)

127
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,000
My life is complete to have you.

128
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,440
But the daughter of the Jiang Family
is unparalleled in beauty

129
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,080
and enjoys great prestige
in the capital.

130
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,280
She also looks similar to me.

131
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,320
If she enters the palace and serves you,

132
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,960
it will also become a beautiful talk.

133
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
You are obviously getting jealous,

134
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
but still want to pretend
it doesn't matter.

135
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Rest assured,

136
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,880
she cannot compare to you.

137
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:33,160
I will not allow a daughter of
the Jiang Family to enter the palace.

138
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,520
I think she can be granted to
Prince Duan, Xiao Che.

139
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,560
(Although my body is buried now,)

140
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,000
(you'll end up like me one day.)

141
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,520
(Xiao Mo, I will make you pay
with your life!)

142
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,520
What are you acting up to again?

143
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
Stop acting.

144
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,520
Xiao Che!

145
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,440
Your Highness.

146
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,880
Please calm down!

147
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,560
When Fengxi Palace caught fire,

148
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
there were about 20 people,

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,680
among which seven died from the fire,

150
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,440
while the rest were strangled to death.

151
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,440
I also put the people
of that palace to death

152
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,800
for you.

153
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,990
(As expected, Prince Duan is also
investigating my death.)

154
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,880
People know that you

155
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
are jealous of Empress Wang,

156
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,480
and you dare say
you are unrelated to it?

157
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,320
It's Your...

158
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,120
(If I confess now,)

159
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,371
(I'll be able to get my revenge.)

160
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,680
(But I cannot die now.)

161
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,880
(I must get revenge
for everyone in Fengxi Palace.)

162
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,640
(But if I step out
and disclose Xiao Mo in my identity,)

163
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,720
(who will believe me?)

164
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,360
It's not me!

165
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,600
If I planned this accident,

166
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,040
why would I enter Fengxi Palace that day

167
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,840
and put myself in danger too?

168
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,240
If you hadn't arrived in time,

169
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,280
I would have...

170
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,080
You dare to still argue.

171
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,280
The fire in Fengxi Palace

172
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,160
was the result of yellow phosphorus.

173
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,920
And how do you explain sneaking into
my chamber yesterday

174
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,240
and leaving yellow phosphorus powder?

175
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,360
I did that yesterday

176
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,200
to improve our relationship

177
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,240
and serve you wholeheartedly
in the future.

178
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
As for the yellow phosphorus powders
you mentioned,

179
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,880
I really have no idea!

180
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,200
The truth has yet to be revealed,

181
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,480
but you want to use punishment
on me in the palace...

182
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,720
Jiang Jinli!

183
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,680
I'm warning you.

184
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,480
I will continue to
