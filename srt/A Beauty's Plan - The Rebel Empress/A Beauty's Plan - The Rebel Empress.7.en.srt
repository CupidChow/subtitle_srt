=Episode 7=

3
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
Why am I here?

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,160
Your Highness,

5
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,840
you fainted in the palace.

6
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
His Highness carried you back.

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,440
You have caught a chill.

8
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,880
His Highness specially
ordered me

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,280
to take a bath for you
to drive out the cold from your body.

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,120
The Jiuqu Intricate Box?

11
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:45,160
(The descendants of the Gongsun family
are skilled in intricate mechanisms.)

12
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,480
(This Jiuqu Intricate Box
is joined by mortise and tenon.)

13
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,566
(It's secretly aligned with
the Celestial Stem, Terrestrial Branch,)

14
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,520
(Five Elements, and Eight Trigrams.)

15
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,480
(It is impossible to
open it with brute force.)

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,640
(But it's so easy for me.)

17
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,680
Today is the eighth day of the first
month of winter in the Year of Ding Mao.

18
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,296
The current time is the first quarter

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,760
of the Xu hour. [*7 PM to 9 PM]

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,800
(Why is my jade chop here?)

21
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,120
It really is you.

22
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,428
(Seven Years Ago) Dabao!

23
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Don't move!

24
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
Sister.

25
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,280
Let go of my brother!

26
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,320
Behave yourself.

27
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't try any tricks!

28
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
If you want to keep your brother alive,

29
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,920
bring a thousand taels of gold
to redeem him before nightfall.

30
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,040
Otherwise...

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,360
Don't!

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,280
Leave.

33
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:26,840
Run!

34
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,240
Dabao!

35
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
Thank you for your help, young master.

36
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:43,028
Young master.

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,560
Someone, help him
into the carriage quickly!

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,560
Did you see an injured man
in blue clothes?

39
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,960
Who is making noise here?

40
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,700
How dare you block the path of the
daughter of the current Imperial Tutor?

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,800
My apologies, Miss.
I was being reckless.

42
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't come closer.

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,760
Don't be afraid.

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,640
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm afraid I might hurt you.

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,360
You're joking, Young Master.

47
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,600
It was you who saved me
and my brother just now.

48
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,320
Why would you hurt me?

49
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
Since you've woken up,

50
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,120
remember to take this bowl of medicine.

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,400
The doctor said your wound is deep,

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,120
and you need to rest for a while.

53
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,040
This is a suburban residence,

54
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,400
so the soldiers won't find you here.

55
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,080
You can rest here safely.

56
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,840

You also saved my brother that day.

But you saved my life,

83
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
This jade pendant
is an ancient artifact.

84
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:41,820
It keeps you warm in winter,
cool in summer,

85
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,228
repels insects, and
wards off evil spirits.

86

Sister.

00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,800
This jade pendant is so beautiful.

91
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,520
Dabao.

92
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,640
Then why don't you
give me something in return?

93
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,240
So I can always remember your kindness.

94
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,400
Well...

95
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,320
I'll give you this puzzle box.

96
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,680
This puzzle box, in all the world,

97
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,080
besides the craftsman who made it,

98
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,640
only I can open it.

99
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,800
It's a pretty unique item.

100
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Wait for me.

101
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,920
Dabao, have you seen
the chop that father carved?

102
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,240
Oh, that day
you opened the intricate box,

103
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,720
so I put the chop in it.

104
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,040
Oh no!

105
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,240
The box is fine,

106
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,520
but that chop

107
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,040
was carved by father
with my maiden name.

108
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,400
It's not good to be
in the hands of outsiders.

109
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,640
Never mind.

110
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,800
He can't open it anyway.

111
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,640
I hurt you.

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,320
You...

114
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,640
When did you discover my identity?

115
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,440
Earlier,

116
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,840
I was secretly investigating

117
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,000
the truth of your murder.

118
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
Many clues point
to Jiang Jinli and Xiao Mo.

119
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,160
Until yesterday,

120
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
I met you at Fengxi Palace.

121
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,360
I wanted to make a clean break

122
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
but I accidentally
discovered this jade pendant.

123
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,400
So you used the
Jiuqu Intricate Box to test me?

124
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,040
And you didn't try to hide it from me.

125
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,440
Isn't it?

126
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,440
You told me

127
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
besides the craftsman
who made this puzzle box,

128
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,800
only you can open it in the world.

129
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
After the fire that day,

130
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,560
I became Jiang Jinli.

131
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,040
But this jade pendant
I always carried was still here.

132
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
They say it has the power
to revive the dead.

133
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,760
I didn't believe it, but it's true.

134
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,400
This jade pendant

135
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,000
is called "Return".

136
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
It was given to me
by my master years ago.

137
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,960
It was crafted from the
ancient artifact, the Kunlun Cauldron.

138
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,200
It can ensure safety.

139
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,840
It seems that you met with
misfortune that day

140
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,720
and perished unjustly.

141
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,000
Your soul then went to
Jiang Jinli's body.

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,880
This is the cycle of reincarnation,

143
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
and it returns at the end.

144
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,480
I see.

145
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,880
But if this jade pendant
is an ancient artifact

146
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,600
and your master gave it to you,

147
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,080
why would you give it away so casually?

148
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,480
I didn't just give it away casually.

149
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,400
It's just fate's cruel play.

150
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,640
When I saw you again,

151
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,400
you had already
become my Imperial sister-in-law.

152
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,640
From now on,
I'll always be by your side.

154
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,120
You need to believe me,
I won't let you

155
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,480
go through those terrible things again.

156
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,560
And I won't let anyone hurt you again.

157
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm not the naive and innocent

158
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,720
Wang Yunci I was before.

159
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,040
What we were before is impossible.

160
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,080
And it's even more impossible now.

161
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:33,760
Please respect yourself, Your Highness.

162
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,200
(My sincere heart was given to
a heartless and ungrateful person.)

163
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,040
(Thankfully, God had mercy
and allowed me to have a new life.)

164
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,280
(This life was born from hatred
and carries resentment.)

165
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,840
(Xiao Che, I can't drag you down.)

166
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,920
(Ci'er.)

167
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720
(I will protect you
with my life in this lifetime.)

168
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,920
It's spring now.

169
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,371
But the cold of spring
hasn't passed.

170
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:41,840
You are always afraid of the cold.

171
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:44,028
The coldness in your body
hasn't been eliminated yet.

172
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:46,520
Be careful not to catch a cold.

173
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,120
Thank you, Your Highness.
I can handle it myself.

174
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,960
I remember you
loved Hibiscus very much before.

175
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,280
But why are you
so enchanted by this Bauhinia now?

176
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,720
Hibiscus is good,

177
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,080
but its bloom is fleeting,
and its beauty lasts only a moment.

178
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,640
The Bauhinia is more resilient

179
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,920
and able to grow in any harsh
and difficult environment.

180
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,640
(How should I tell him
about the Love Spell Poison?)

181
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,160
His Majesty has decreed.
