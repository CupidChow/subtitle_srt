00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,084
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:54,800
Tell me, is the death
of Empress related to you?

4
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,560
Was it Xiao Che
who ordered you to do it?

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,880
Mother, I don't understand
what you are saying.

6
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,970
It's better if it has nothing
to do with you.

7
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,680
Prince Duan has always been at odds
with the Jiang and Wang families.

8
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,200
Your father and I

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,680
are also worried that you
might be ordered by him

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,600
and used by him.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't you forget,

12
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,000
although you've married Prince Duan
and become his consort as you wish,

13
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:21,142
you are still the daughter
of our Jiang family.

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,560
Your every action

15
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:24,960
is related to the reputation
and honor of our Jiang family.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,200
You must not bring troubles

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,160
to our entire family because of you.

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,640
I dare not forget your teachings.

19
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,480
Although I've married Prince Duan,

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,520
I'll prioritize the wishes
of the Jiang family and His Majesty.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,320
I wish you had known it earlier.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,720
If you had listened to your father

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,760
and entered the palace,

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,600
now that the Empress has passed away,

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,480
then the position of Empress

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,200
would most likely have fallen to you.

27
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:55,040
(Jiang Jinli actually
took the initiative)

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,720
(to marry Xiao Che.)

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,760
(Then why did she have an affair?)

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,800
(It seems the matter is not just about)

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,560
(coveting the Empress position
or killing me.)

32
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:14,228
Greetings, Your Highness.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Your Highness?

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,240
Such a harsh and unfamiliar title.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,480
(In the past, I had a husband,)

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
(a family,)

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,480
(and a status
that garnered the attention of all.)

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,880
(Now, I have to wander in this world)

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,400
(in the name of a murderer.)

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Your Highness,
Xue Lian was assassinated.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
By the time we arrived,

42
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,760
she was barely alive.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,400
She remained silent
about the silken box

44
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,560
but she has confessed the truth

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,640
about the Empress's death.

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,480
She said she was ordered
by Princess Consort Duan

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,800
and colluded with the maids to insert

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
a large amount of cotton laced

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,800
with saltpeter dust
into the hem of the Empress' dress,

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
which lets her body
be completely destroyed

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,628
and her face be disfigured.

52
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,342
Also, the princess consort...

53
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:10,228
Tell me.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,310
It's said that Princess Consort
and His Majesty have an affair.

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,160
She dared to commit
such a rampant crime

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,760
because she had
His Majesty's support.

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,560
As expected,

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,440
the death of the Empress

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
is related to them.

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Where is Jiang Jinli?

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
Her Highness is taking a bath.

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,760
Jiang Jinli,

63
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
come out!

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
Don't play dead!

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,880
Jiang Jinli.

66
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,800
Xiao Che.

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
Jiang Jinli.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
Get out!

69
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,857
Don't treat me the same way
you treat His Majesty,

70
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,360
I'm not interested in you.

71
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,400
Now that Xue Lian has confessed,

72
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,920
there are both witness
and physical evidence.

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
It's clear that you killed the Empress.

74
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,880
Xue Lian?

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,520
Xiao Che,

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,600
don't falsely accuse me.

77
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,400
I saw with my own eyes
that Xue Lian was killed by you!

78
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,120
I deliberately let Xue Lian go

79
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
just to see who the real culprit was.

80
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,520
I didn't expect it to be you.

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,560
(Xue Lian was not killed
by Prince Duan.)

82
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
Do you think I'm completely unaware

83
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,840
of your affair with His Majesty?

84
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,880
Do you think you can replace the Empress

85
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,440
by killing her?

86
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,200
I've already said.

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,640
I didn't kill her.

88
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:50,320
If you don't believe me,
there's nothing more I can say.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
Go ahead and kill me.

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,960
Do you think I don't dare?

91
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll let you taste the pain
of suffocating too.

92
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,200
(As expected, the Love Spell Poison
will take effect when it sees blood.)

93
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,240

95
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,571

Let him in.

121
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,920
Let me go.

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,320

Your Majesty.

125
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,510
(A man intruding
and making noise here is disrespectful.)

126
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,280
(If someone with ill intentions
were to use it,)

127
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,360
(it'll affect the Wang family.)

128
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,350
She died like my parents.

Where did this child come from?

131
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,560
How disrespectful.

132
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,760
Daring to disturb the Empress' funeral?

133
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,520
Such disrespect,

134
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,080
hurry up and drag him out.

135
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,840
His Majesty hasn't spoken yet,

136
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,480
but Princess Consort Duan

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,200
is already scolding
the Empress' brother.

138
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,560
The Empress' body is not yet cold.

139
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,440
Do you want to lecture her
younger brother in front of her coffin?

140
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,400
It's okay.

141
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,571
Wang Xi was overwhelmed
by the grief of losing his sister,

142
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:56,371
which can't be considered disrespectful.

143

149
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,600

But the person
has been dealt with cleanly.

Please rest assured.

154
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,760
Xue Lian was a strong-willed girl.

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,840
No matter how Prince Duan tortured her,

156
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,600
she didn't reveal a single detail
about the silken box.

157
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,080
However, now that Prince Duan
treasures that item dearly.

158
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,280
Retrieving the silken box
will be even more difficult.
