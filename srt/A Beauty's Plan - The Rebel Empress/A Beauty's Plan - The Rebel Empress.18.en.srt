00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,684
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,520
His Majesty has become more and more
ruthless these days.

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,360
The ministers don't dare
to advise anything.

5
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,440
If this continues, what should we do?

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,480
Someone, comes in.

7
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Uncle, I'm Ci'er.

8
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,600
Nonsense!

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,640
Uncle, listen to me.

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,720
When I was young,
my father was busy with his duty,

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,080
so I live here all the time.

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you still remember when I was five,

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,160
I took you as a tree and climbed on top.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,800
The both of us then fell down together.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
There's still a scar on the waist.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,360
How do you know about these?

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,040
Brother, sister,
come and play with Dabao now!

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,560
Dabao.

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,640
You recognize the wrong person.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,480
I didn't.

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,400
They are brother and sister.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,440
The person who stole medicine
at the drug institution that day

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
is the one who wrongly recognize others.

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,320
How you know the way
to open the Jiuqu Intricate Box?

25
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,520
Only the Empress...

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,600
You are really Ci'er.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,480
Ci'er.

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,600
But why do you look like this?

29
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,840
What happened?

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,920
It's the work of Xiao...

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
Dabao, come outside to play with brother.

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,040
Sister will come and find us later.
Let's go.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,200
Ok.

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,520
Uncle.

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,400
It's a very long story.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,520
I will explain to you after this.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
The reason of me coming today

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,000
is to ask uncle something.

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,920
Does uncle know

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,320
Xiao Mo altered the posthumous edict
and claimed the throne back then?

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,640
It's most likely that
father knows about the posthumous edict,

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,560
which led to him being killed.

43
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,360
Your father was always healthy and fit.

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,520
However, he died from serious illness
all of a sudden.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,840
He must have been murdered by others.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
If back then, uncle was able to realize

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,840
something suspicious earlier,

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,040
maybe your father wouldn't be...

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
Seeing it now,

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Xiao Mo is truly a nasty person.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,800
Uncle.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,640
It's not your fault.

53
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,880
Regarding the posthumous edict,

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,640
do you know anything else about it?

55
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,360
Your father was always cautious.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,840
He will never say anything
that he's not supposed to say.

57
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,000
Regarding the posthumous edict,

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,880
I really don't know a single thing.

59
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,480
Dabao likes to play with these?

60
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,080
Oh, father likes it.

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,160
Sister likes it.

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,280
Dabao also likes it.

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,760
Don't worry.

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,440
I'm here.

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,280
Alright.

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Uncle.

67
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,440
I still need to ask for a favor from you.

68
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,960
The Emperor has arrived.

69
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,280
Welcome the arrival of Your Majesty.

70
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,640
It's my fault too.

71
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,280
Ci'er treats you well.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,640
Something bad happened to her.
You must be really sad.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,000
But till today,
only I'm here to visit you.

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,560
Thank you for Your Majesty's concern.

75
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,200
I only hope that

76
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,920
the culprit will be caught
as soon as possible.

77
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,760
Recently, Prince Duan
spread rumors and created a hassle.

78
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,240
Regarding the authenticity
of the posthumous edict

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,880
left by the late Emperor,

80
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,080
the rumor had spread
and made a mess throughout the city.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,360
Do you know anything about it?

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
Your Majesty should know.

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,840
This is a baseless joke,

84
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,160
I've never heard anything about

85
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,200
a fake posthumous edict.

86
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,960
Rise up.

87
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,400
I don't mean to blame you.

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
Come, drink some tea.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,840
Why didn't I see Dabao today?

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,560
Previously, as long as I'm here,

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,280
he will ask me to play with him.

92
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,240
Dabao is tired.

93
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,000
Why grandfather hasn't come

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,320
to play hide and seek with Dabao?

95
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,080
Brother-in-law, can you

96
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,160
play hide and seek with Dabao?

97
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,640
Dabao.

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,280
Alright, we'll play hide and seek.

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
Turn around and don't peek.

100
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,120
Count to eight.

101
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,480
Alright.

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,000
Eight.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,160
Seven.

104
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,280
Six.

105
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,480
Five.

106
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,000
Four.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,120
Three.

108
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,680
Two.

109
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,760
One.

110
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,280
It's alright now.

111
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
You come down first.

112
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,200
I think I'm stuck.

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Alright, Dabao.

114
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,520
Brother-in-law
has other stuff to do today.

115
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
I will play with you another day.

116
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,640
Okay.

117
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
See you again, brother-in-law.

118
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,640
It seems that the old minister

119
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,440
really doesn't know about
the posthumous edict.

120
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,360
If that's the case, why is he nervous?

121
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,400
(I was in great danger.)

122
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,360
(My niece is alone,
with no one to rely on.)

123
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
(I wish to propose that)

124
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,280
(there're a lot of doubts
in the Empress' death.)

125
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,400
(Hope Your Majesty
can think twice before acting,)

126
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,040
(Don't trust others easily
nor make judgement lightly.)

127
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Is it because of the punishment

128
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,880
I've given to Prince Duan and his family,

129
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,160
he wishes to impeach me?

130
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,120
How is the search in the city?

131
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,880
Is there any news about Prince Duan
and Princess Consort Duan?

132
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,920
Not yet, but recently,

133
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,520
there's always people from Wuqing Sect who
went missing without reason.

134
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,560
Arrange more men to guard the palace.

135
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
Enhance the defense of the outer city.

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,760
It's better to kill innocents,

137
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,840
than to let go of one.

138
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,760
The Under the Moonlight Action continues.

139
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,640
Change the spies that were in the palace
for more than three years

140
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
into the important posts.

141
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,200
Get rid of the filthy ones
and keep the clear ones.

142
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,280
Remember, don't harm the civilians.

143
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,880
Long live

144
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,800
the Emperor.

145
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,920
Your Majesty.

146
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,080
I think that there are some doubts

147
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,800
in the case of Prince Duan
murdering the Empress.

148
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,880
The death of the Empress has valid proofs.

149
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,080
Xiao Che had admitted his crime
and ran away that day.

150
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,560
This is fact.

151
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,600
No further discussion is allowed.

152
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,000
Since when Prince Duan admitted his crime?
Why did he run away?

153
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,200
And the three institutes' joint hearings,
why do we not know anything?

154
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
Isn't it because the court
wished to end the case fast

155
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,960
and forced Prince Duan to admit?

156
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,840
Hope Your Majesty investigate it well.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,680
Old Minister Wang's pain
in losing your niece, I can understand it.

158
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,600
However, this can't be the reason for you

159
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,880
to cause disruption in the palace.

160
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,840
Guard!

161
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,880
Your Majesty, what do you mean by this?

162
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,800
Take him.

163
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,640
Who dares to move?

164
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,720
Protect the Emperor!

165
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,760
How dare you!

166
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,080
Xiao Che, are you trying to rebel?

167
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,440
Xiao Mo, you are the rebel!

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,160
The royal order is here.

169
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,960
Posthumous edict of the former Emperor,
it's the same as facing the Emperor.
