=Episode 2=

3
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,000
(Ci'er.)

4
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,028
(May you have a happy and healthy life.)

5
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,914
(And your beauty will be as dazzling
as ever when we meet.)

6
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,040
(Fire!)

7
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,360
Fengxi Palace is on fire!

8
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Quickly! Your Majesty, be careful!

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,714
Protect the Prince!

10
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:19,160
Your Majesty, you can't go in.

11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,960
Yunci!

12
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Your Majesty, no!

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,760
No!

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,080
Let me go!

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,720
Li'er!

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,720
Put out the fire quickly!

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,428
Be careful.

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,280
Your Majesty!

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Your Majesty!

20
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,680
Your Highness,
Princess Consort is there!

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,800
Let's go find the Empress!

22
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,160
(Ci'er.)

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,880
(If I had come earlier,)

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,280
(I'd have saved Ci'er.)

25
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,320
(Why did everyone in Fengxi Palace
die in the fire?)

26
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,942
(There's something wrong with it!)

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Jiang Jinli?

28
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,280
What tricks are you playing again?

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,800
(Oh no!)

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,920
(Could it be that Jiang Jinli
had Xue Lian)

31
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,314
(prepare these flirtatious things?)

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,360
(Xiao Che and Jiang Jinli
got married a month ago.)

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
(If he were to be with me tonight...)

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,920
(then I...)

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,840
The way you flung yourself
to me is truly novel.

36
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,480
Are you still

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,320
expecting something from me?

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
(What can I expect from you?)

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,120
(My husband is the Emperor
of the Yuan dynasty.)

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,520
(No.)

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,120
(Prince Duan implied that Jiang Jinli
was showing favor to him?)

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,200
Jiang Jinli, if you dare to
play any more tricks,

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
I will not spare you.

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,120
(It seems the rumors are true.)

45
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,630
(Prince Duan and his Princess Consort
have a strained relationship.)

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,880
(I'll be careful about my behaviors
in the mansion later.)

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,880
(But why is my soul)

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,960
(connected to
the Princess Consort Duan?)

49
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,600
(Jiang Jinli has been
so abnormal lately.)

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,240
(Is she scared out of her wits)

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,560
(or is she guilty of something?)

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,880
Your Highness, Xue Lian dared to steal
your personal jewelry box.

53
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
Why not just kill her?

54
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,680
The truth behind the Empress's
death has yet to be solved.

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
Don't act rashly.

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,920
Xue Lian has been exposed now.

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,880
No matter who is behind her,

58
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,000
her master probably
wants her dead more than we do.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
Send more people watching her secretly,

60
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,800
and inform me immediately
if there's any news.

61
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Yes.

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
(If Jiang Jinli did it,)

63
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,160
(why does she need
this jewelry box?)

64
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,680
(I only heard that Prince Duan
changed drastically)

65
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,114
(after the Late Emperor passed away,)

66
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,520
(but I never thought
he would become a cold-blooded killer.)

67
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,000
(But why did he kill Xue Lian?)

68
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
Greetings, Princess Consort Duan.

69
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,000
Where is Chi Su?

70
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,800
She died together with the Empress.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,640
(Fortunately,
Hua Jian survived that day)

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,600
(due to stomachache.)

73
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,840
(It's such a pity about Chi Su.)

74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,880
Who else died yesterday?

75
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,080
Fengxi Palace caught fire
suddenly yesterday.

76
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
The concubines on the first floor
escaped safely,

77
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,200
and you were rescued from the fire
by Prince Duan.

78
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,000
But...

79
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,400
all the servants
in Fengxi Palace died in the fire.

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,200
Let me go!

81
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,000
Your Majesty!

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,560
Yunci!

83
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,600
Protect the Prince!

84
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,360
Yunci!

85
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,800
You mean...

86
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,080
Everyone in Fengxi Palace was dead

87
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,720
except for you?

88
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,760
Yes.

89
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,120
(No.)

90
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,440
(The fire was too suspicious.)

91
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,680
(There must be some hidden secrets.)

92
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,914
(A birthday was turning
into a death day.)

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,960
(Who is so cruel to kill everyone?)

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,320
Greetings, Prince Duan.

95
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:19,560
Are the funeral arrangements ready?

96
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,800
They are all ready.

97
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,320
(It was him?)

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,257
(Yes, he said he was busy
with official duties)

99
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,550
(and couldn't attend on that day.)

100
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,480
(But he appeared
right when the fire started.)

101
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:40,171
(Rumors say he has
treacherous intentions for so long.)

102
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,510
(The Wang family in Langya
has always been loyal to the Emperor,

103
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,680
(so he must see them
as thorns in his side.)

104
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,800
(So last night Xue Lian...)

105
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
(He killed her to keep her mouth shut?)

106
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,760
(He's just pretending
and putting on a show.)

107
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,960
(I need to find evidence
before the funeral starts.)

108
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,960
(Files)

109
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Your Majesty.

110
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,720
This is a gift from Prince Duan.

111
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,880
Isn't this the amulet
Prince Duan gave to me?

112
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,320
How did it end up here?

113
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,057
(Indeed, it's yellow phosphorus.)

114
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,280
(So the fire wasn't an accident.)

115
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,160
(I must inform His Majesty immediately.)

116
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,600
His Majesty is praying for the Empress
at Jokhang Temple.

117
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,120
All the ladies
are staying at Yide Hall.

118
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:37,800
(His Majesty is not in the palace.)

119
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,680
(It's just me alone.)

120
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,000
(How should I deal with Xiao Che?)

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,920
(Imperial Drug Institution)

122
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,720
Right.

123
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,057
The leader of the Deep Valley presented
many powers from the Western Regions.

124
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,200
On my birthday,
I ordered people to seal them here.

125
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,080
They might be useful now.

126
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:54,057
Greetings, Princess Consort Duan.

127
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,840
Forgive us for disturbing you.

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,120
It's Immortal Beauty Insect
from the Deep Valley.

129
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,320
We're asked to deliver it to Yide Hall.

130
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,680
(It seems that Jiang Jinli is used to
being domineering.)

131
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,520
(The maids are so afraid of her.)

132
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
Get out!

133
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,080
Don't ever show up in front of me
with insects again.

134
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,560
Yes, Your Highness.

135
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,520
Didn't Princess Consort Duan request

136
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,600
Immortal Beauty Insect
from His Majesty a few days ago?

137
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Why is she...

138
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
Shh, stop talking!
Our lives are at stake.

139
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,280
Someone came by.

140
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,320
Report, Your Highness.

141
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,320
I heard that the Princess Consort
returned to the mansion alone today.

142
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,680
Yellow phosphorus.

143
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,520
How could there be
such a flammable material in my chamber?

144
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,440
Qing Yi.

145
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,657
Now sneak into Fengxi Palace
to investigate

146
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,680
whether this substance
is related to the fire.

147
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Yes.

148
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,120
Where did you go?
