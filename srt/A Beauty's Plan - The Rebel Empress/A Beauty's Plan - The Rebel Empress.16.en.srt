3
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,720
Che,

4
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,160
don't look at me like that,

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,800
I don't like it.

6
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Brother? You are not worthy of this title.

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,520
I don't deserve it?

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,520
I have been snubbed
by the Late Emperor since young,

9
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,280
and my mother was targeted too.

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,160
Ever since then, I knew

11
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,120
I had to hold

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,720
power tightly in my hands.

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,520
Xiao Mo, I am not your brother.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,920
What I regret most

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,360
is overlooking you,

16
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,480
and giving you military power
seven years ago.

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,360
Shut up!

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,080
Since we have no brotherly ties,

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,960
there is also no need for me
to have mercy.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,840
Yes.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,720
This is the look of hating my guts

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,560
but also so helpless.

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
I want to step on you,

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
and step you into the dust.

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,040
Xiao Mo.

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,640
All along, you can only use

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,040
such inferior tricks against me

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,960
and fulfil your fake dreams.

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
Inferior?

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,880
You are so arrogant,

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,200
but the more arrogant you are,

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
the more excited I am,

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,920
and the more I want to push you
into the ground.

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,120
I want to make sure your wishes

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
are all unfulfilled, your love,

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,600
your power and your prestige.

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,920
Xiao Mo. All my life I have been
of indomitable spirit

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,440
and have never bowed down
to immoral people.

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
Xiao Che,

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,160
I shall send you to see Father tomorrow.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
Luckily, we retreated in time.

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,000
If we were caught by His Majesty,

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,680
we wouldn't have enough heads to beheaded!

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,520
Thank you for helping me today,
Consort Wise.

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,840
If there are any places where I can help,

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,920
I will do my best and help.

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,680
The Meng Family
does not like owing favors.

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,320
That day you saved me.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,480
Today, consider us even.

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
(Confession statement)

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,800
Prince Duan has admitted to his offenses.

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,580
Make him parade on the streets first thing
in the morning,

53
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,760
and execute him at noon.

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,920
Yes.

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Your Majesty,
Princess Consort Duan has escaped!

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,000
You useless piece of garbage!

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
Your Majesty,

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,680
Princess Consort Duan
held Consort Wise hostage

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,080
so the palace servants
did not dare to tell.

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,720
Now, her whereabouts are unknown.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,560
Search the whole city.

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
The moment she is caught, kill her.

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,720
Yes.

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,520
Princess Consort, it's me.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,400
Quick, follow me and leave.

66
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,760
Princess Consort,
this place is inconspicuous.

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,000
The soldiers will not find you.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,680
Your Highness needs not
worry about the Prince.

69
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,800
I can use his life to guarantee that

70
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,960
as long as I am alive,

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,160
I will not allow
anything to happen to you.

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,520
Run, go.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
His Majesty's royal decree:

74
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,520
Prince Duan Xiao Che
has committed a terrible crime,

75
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,040
killing the Empress
and attempting to revolt.

76
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
He shall be paraded on the streets today

77
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,080
and executed at noon,

78
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,520
to warn others of his actions.

79
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,440
Xiao Che, I will let you see

80
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,880
who is the real owner of this empire.

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
You all, leave!

82
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
Kill them!

83
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,120
Your Highness.

84
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,400
(Xiao Mo, I can't believe

85
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,880
that we would end up like this.)

86
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
You all, leave quickly.

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Go after them!

88
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,240
Be careful, Your Highness.

89
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,640
Slow down.

90
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,000
How are the manpower movements
in the palace?

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,240
Rest assured, Your Highness.

92
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,920
Half of them are our men.

93
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,960
Please take care of His Highness,
Princess Consort.

94
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
I will go and find a doctor.

95
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
Alright.

96
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
You've returned.

97
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,560
You've returned.

98
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,480
Does it hurt?

99
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,840
Ci'er, don't worry,

100
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm fine.

101
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,680
Your Highness! Your Highness!

102
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,680
Why do you feel so cold?

103
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,080
Wake up!

104
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Wake up!

105
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,080
Xiao Che,

106
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,840
you better listen to me.

107
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,240
You are not allowed to die.

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,120
Do you hear me?

109
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,960
You better stay strong.

110
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,680
You have to hang on.

111
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,080
A bunch of useless people!

112
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
If Xiao Che doesn't die, you all will die!

113
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,800
Your Majesty,

114
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
please calm down, Your Majesty!

115
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
Your servant has already
called a citywide search,

116
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
but to our surprise,
Prince Duan have private soldiers.

117
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,840
Jiang Jinli!

118
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
How dare you betray me?

119
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,120
Alright.

120
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I will fulfil your wishes

121
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,320
and let you two love birds

122
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,440
go on the road to death together!

123
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,520
Quickly go and notify Wuqing Sect,

124
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,240
as long as the two of them are spotted,
kill them right away!

125
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,880
Yes.

126
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,840
Enter.

127
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,120
Yes.

128
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,240
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

129
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,520
The day has become cold.

130
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,160
The servants might get lazy.

131
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,200
I haven't gone to find you

132
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,440
and yet you show up by yourself.

133
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,040
If you hadn't been so useless,

134
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,400
would Jiang Jinli
have been able to escape?

135
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,120
Would Prince Duan
have been able to escape?

136
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,840
If I didn't have to rely on your brothers,

137
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,360
do you think you would still be alive?

138
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,520
Useless garbage.

139
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,080
Sure enough, in the deep palace,

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,280
one cannot survive with a heart.
