Everyone is excused.

4
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
This matter is not to discussed anymore.

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,880
All the excerpts today

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,280
are encouraging Your Majesty
to select consorts.

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,280
But who knew it would anger His Majesty

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,760
to abolish the rules totally.

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,520
Yes, that's right.

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,960
Through dynasties, this
has never happened before.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,320
How...

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,600
In my view,

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,680
aside from lacking heirs
from the imperial concubines,

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,720
the present Emperor
is sagacious and diligent,

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,640
as well as just and equitable.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
That's right.

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,320
Speed up. Don't waste the time.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,480
Do you think you are still the Emperor?

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,760
Take a look at your current position.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,640
Yes, back when you didn't
differentiate loyal and disloyal,

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,920
and at the time when you
killed the innocent and the loyal,

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,240
you should've already
thought about the consequences.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,440
If the Emperor hadn't been merciful,

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,520
you would've been in hell already.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,280
Three,

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,400
two,

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,760
one.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,640
This is the Killing Powder.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Remember to take the antidote first,

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,800
and kill them unknowingly.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,000
Your Majesty, you have finally returned,

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
things like planting

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,000
can be left to the
Imperial Household Department,

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,600
why do you have to do it by yourself?

35
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,560
Take back the

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
court-like statements.

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
Sunrises and sunsets, are signs of life.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,560
The winds in the world are like my heart.

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,480
Look.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,480

the Emperor does not
want to take in new consorts?

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,920
Through history, emperors have had to have

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
a full harem to garner political support

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,640
and balance powers in the court.

75
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,320
Could it be that the Emperor

76
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,800
is captivated by the daughter of that
traitorous Jiang Family?

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,960

did not come easily,

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,040

It can warm the body. Try it.

87
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,360
I heard that Your Majesty abolished

88
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,880
the consort selection system.

89
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,760
Does Your Majesty know

90
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,920
that it has never
happened before in history?

91
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,920
Your Majesty has just ascended the throne.

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,320
If you want the court to be stable,

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,480
the harem must be well-filled

94
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
in order to secure your reign.

95
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,160
If at this time...

96
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,720
Are you here only to talk about this?

97
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,760
Your Majesty, I just wanted to tell you.

98
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,480
As I said before,

99
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,320
I'll never take in new consorts.

100
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
I will only

101
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,240
love one person.

102
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,440
Your Majesty,
please put down your obsession

103
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
and don't have
any more illusions about me.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Your Majesty and I

105
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,920
were never meant to be together.

106
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,920
No matter what kind of person you are,

107
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
you will always be my wife.

108
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,800
You are Wang Yunci,

109
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,040
I have been in love
with you for seven years.

110
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,520
If Xiao Mo hadn't usurped the throne,

111
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,920
you would have been
my empress seven years ago.

112
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
You are Jiang Jinli,

113
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,800
then you are all the more

114
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
my lawful wife.

115
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,200
There is nothing wrong

116
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,280
with being with me.

117
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,360
Who am I?

118
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,080
I am no one.

119
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,760
Xiao Che,

120
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,440
can you stop lying to yourself?

121
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,160
I now carry the shell of Jiang Jinli

122
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,280
and the soul of Wang Yunci,

123
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,760
I am half of a shell,

124
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
how can I match
the prestige of the Emperor?

125
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,520
The valley between the two of us

126
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
can never be crossed.

127
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,880
Ci'er,

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,400
I don't care about anything from the past,

129
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,760
I can wait,

130
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,280
even if it means
waiting another seven years.

131
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,840
Wait?

132
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,320
How will you wait for me?

133
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,520
Xiao Che,

134
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
up until now do you still not understand?

135
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,640
You were just a chess piece

136
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
on my road to revenge.

137
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
What makes you think you can wait for me?

138
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,320
Because I am the Emperor!

139
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
My heart is set.

140
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,080
All I want is to make you my Empress,
what is wrong with that?

141
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
Even if Your Majesty
confers me as Empress,

142
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,600
you will not win my heart either.

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,480
I don't believe you.

144
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,280
I don't believe
that you have never loved me.

145
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,480
The heart of the Emperor,

146
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,800
throughout history has been cold and hard.

147
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,000
Emperors should be the most heartless.

148
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,880
I will not allow myself
to go through the same thing again.

149
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,160
Xiao Che,

150
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
from then till now,

151
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,600
I have never loved you.

152
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,960
If you have never loved me,

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,440
then how do you explain
the Love Spell Poison?

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,560
(A kiss of true love
can cure this poison.)

155
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,480
Ci'er.

156
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,360
Don't come near me!

157
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,440
No, don't!

158
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,000
If you insist this,

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
if you still choose to ignore the people,

160
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
I can only die to appease the people.

161
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,080
Alright, alright, I promise you,

162
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,160
I will never disturb your life anymore.

163
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,840
I will become a wise and good emperor.

164
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,000
I beg you,

165
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,640
beg you to live well,

166
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,360
to live well.

167

Your Majesty's words of wisdom,

168
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
I hope that will be carried out too.

169
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,280
From now on,
the two of us shall bid farewell,

170
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,360

Ci'er.

182
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,200
Ci'er.

183
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,240
Ci'er.

184
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,080
Ci'er!

185
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,040
Reporting to Your Majesty,

186
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,320
the life of Royal Consort has been saved,

187
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,800
but Her Lady's body is originally weak,

188
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,640
coupled with long-term use
of Purple Orchid Powder,

189
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,880
the flower's poison
has long entered her lungs.

190
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,640
This has caused
long-lasting harm to her base.

191
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,000
I am unable to predict

192
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,360
when she will wake up too.

193
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,720
Ci'er, I beg you, please wake up soon.

194
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,520
It's all my fault.

195
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
I am really wrong.

196
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,000
Your Majesty,

197
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,200
the court officials are waiting for you
to go and discuss consort selection.

198
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,120
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

199
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
At this rate,
before the Royal Consort awakes,

200
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,960
you would have collapsed already.
