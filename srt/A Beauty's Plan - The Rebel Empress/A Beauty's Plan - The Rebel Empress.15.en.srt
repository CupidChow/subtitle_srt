00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,100
=The Rebel Empress=

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,959
Calling Prince Duan
and Princess Consort Duan for an audience.

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,560
Your servant has erred,
your servant has erred.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,840
I should not have taken
Princess Consort Duan's bribery

6
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,960
and killed the Empress.

7
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,440
I am sorry,
I have committed terrible sins.

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,480
I deserve to die.

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,280
Reporting to Your Majesty,

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,440
Bureau for Royal Clothing Affairs
has accused Hua Jian.

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,400
All these cotton

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
has been found in

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
the Empress's burnt gown.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,560
Evidence is confirmed.

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,840
Hey! It really is her.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,680
Jiang Jinli,

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,680
how dare you?

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
The Empress had always
been so good to you,

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,080
how could you do

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,440
something so treacherous?

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,360
Speak! Who was ordering you behind?

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,240
It is...

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,600
It is Prince Duan.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,760
What are you saying? Don't accuse me!

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,200
Xiao Che! You are not only narrow-minded
but also ruthless!

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
Because you hate the Wang Family,

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,880
you used private punishment on me
a few times,

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,800
forced me to kill the Empress.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
Xiao Che, how dare you still deny?

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
No, no, no, no.

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,600
Liar! Liar!

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,120
You are all liars!

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,160
It is me!

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,960
I am sorry to Empress Wang!

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,920
The real, the real murderer

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,800
is, is,

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,280
is...

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,480
Once the vigorous poison from
the Western Regions has been swallowed,

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,800
within 30 minutes,

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,080
one will be poisoned to death
and die on the spot.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,920
Even if Hua Jian wanted to change sides,

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,360
she could not even say anything.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,760
(Xiao Mo.)

44
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
(How could you treat Hua Jian)

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
(as ruthlessly as such?)

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,560
it is such a pity.
Then how should she be settled?

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,560
Prince Duan, you threatened me
to keep the truth for you,

48
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,800
but how many will you kill
before you stop?

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,600
What are you talking about?

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,480
I have found out that

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,840
the source of the fire was the gift
from Prince Duan.

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,720
It contained a large amount of
yellow phosphorus,

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,880
resulting in Fengxi Palace fire.

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,760
A bunch of lies!

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,920
Your Majesty, this case is fishy,
please look into it properly.

56
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,240
Both witness and evidence
are clearly presented,

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,200
men, imprison Prince Duan!

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,080
Confine Princess Consort Duan
to the Cold Palace,

59
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,720
never to be released!

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,160
Your Majesty, let go of me!

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,240
May Your Majesty look into it.

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,440
Let go!

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Let go of me!

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,080
How dare you treat me like this?

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,040
Let me out!

66
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,200
I want to see His Majesty!

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,480
Your Majesty!

68
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,240
I already did what you told me to do.

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
Why are you still going back on your words

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,960
and locking me up in such a place?

71
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,080
Li'er, I know that you have been wronged
this period of time,

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
but don't worry.

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,560
When Xiao Che
admits to his crimes tonight,

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,880
and is executed at noon tomorrow,

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,160
I will realize

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,240
my promise to you immediately

77
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,400
and send you out of the capital.

78
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,200
But this ghost-like place,

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,120
I do not want to spend even a day here.
I want to leave.

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Listen to me!

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
I promise

82
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,440
that the throne of the Empress

83
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,000
will soon be yours.

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,400
Alright.

85
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,160
Send over the things that I require.

86
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,800
Alright.

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,320
Monitor Jiang Jinli.

88
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,440
If she makes a fuss out of nothing,

89
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,280
there is no need to be kind to her.

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,840
When Xiao Che and the Jiang Family
has been cleaned up,

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,880
send her to die.

92
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
Yes, your servant understands.

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,400
Prince Duan Xiao Che,

94
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,480
you abetted Princess Consort Duan

95
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,800
to collude with maid Hua Jian,

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
causing Fengxi Palace to catch fire.

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,920
The Empress and palace servants all died.

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,880
Do you recognize your crimes?

99
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
What right do you have?

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,280
You are just one of

101
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,680
Xiao Mo's underdogs.

102
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,600
Yes,

103
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,880
even a small character like me

104
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,160
would one day have the chance
to interrogate Your Highness.

105
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,160
I suppose there is something fishy
about my father's death so many years ago.

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
Your Highness,

107
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,640
we can't just and wait anymore.

108
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,680
I have an idea.

109
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,080
We play along with his trick.

110
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,200
I admit to killing Empress Wang,

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,680
and you clear any relation to me.

112
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,800
No,

113
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,120
no.

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Xiao Mo promised me before

115
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,160
that he would guarantee my safety.

116
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,480
Your Highness, don't worry.

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,000
if you do not point me out,

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
he will not let go of you.

119
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
Follow what he says,

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,160
I have my own plan.

121
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
What is Your Highness planning to do?

122
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,480
If Your Highness
does not tell me your plan,

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,880
I will not accuse you.

124
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,040
Under the Moonlight Action
is confidential,

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,120
I cannot let you know.

126
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,600
But that day,

127
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,280
I have to be in prison.

128
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,920
Protect yourself properly,

129
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,200
if there is danger

130
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,840
I will send people
to save you the next day.

131
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,280
Ci'er, rest assured.

132
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,800
I will return this world
and the Wang Family

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
justice.

134
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,280
I can't wait till tomorrow,

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,920
I have to make a gamble today.

136
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
Consort Wise!

137
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,960
Leave quickly!

138
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,760
Wait! May I ask Consort Wise for a favor?

139
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,760
Jiang Jinli, don't go overboard!

140
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Sir,

141
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,160
Your Majesty has ordered you to go.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Stubborn!

143
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
Give him more punishments,

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
but make sure he is still alive.

145
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,440
Men, watch him closely!

146
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,240
Yes!

147
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,280
Your Highness!

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,680
Your Highness! Your Highness!

149
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,760
Your Highness!

150
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Your Highness!

151
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
Why are you here?

152
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,440
We should not stay here for long.
Let's go!

153
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
Xiao Mo will execute you tomorrow at noon,

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,680
I will release you and save you now!

155
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
No, Ci'er,

156
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,960
listen to me,

157
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,680
this is also part of
Under the Moonlight Action.

158
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,920
I must stay in prison tonight

159
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,600
to divert Xiao Mo's attention.

160
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,080
So that Dark Shadow Guard

161
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,680
can complete the manpower switch

162
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,400
with the least casualties.

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,680
Have you gone crazy?

164
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,120
You are now still poisoned.

165
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,400
If you don't leave now,

166
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,760
how will you escape tomorrow?

167
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,040
Listen to me.

168
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
The poison has been cured already.

169
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,400
Trust me.

170
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,680
When Dark Shadow Guard
completes the manpower switch tomorrow,

171
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,240
Qing Yi will create chaos

172
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,400
and rescue me out.

173
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
Are you sure, Your Highness?

174
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,240
Rest assured.

175
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,520
After you leave,

176
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,840
Qing Yi will send you
to the side courtyard of western suburb.

177
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,680
I will seek you out tomorrow.

178
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,520
Go. Leave now!

179
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,280
Your Majesty, His Highness
refuses to admit even through beating,

180
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,440
I have also tried many cruel punishments.

181
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,040
At this point,
he will definitely not be able

182
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,280
to escape out of your palms.

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,360
Xiao Che used to
fight wars for many years,

184
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,280
what is the pain on the body

185
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,760
to him?

186
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,200
It seems that I will have to

187
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,560
