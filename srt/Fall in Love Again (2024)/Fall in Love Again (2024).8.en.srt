[Episode 8]

4
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,000
Miss.

5
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,550
Why aren't the stars shining?

6
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,010
Are they damaged like us?

7
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,630
The stars are not damaged.

8
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,860
You're not damaged either.

9
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,990
Look.

10
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,870
The stars are shining.

11
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,050
You'll shine too.

12
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,700
What brings you here?

13
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,540
If I hadn't come,

14
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,590
those stars wouldn't be shining.

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,810
How did you make those stars shine?

16
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,870
They're electric lights.

17
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,410
What?

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
I thought it was a fairy tale.

19
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,590
I didn't expect that it was science,

20
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,750
not magic, that made that happen.

21
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,360
Our life has been changed by science and technology.

22
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,920
Thank you for what you did today.

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,040
But for you,

24
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,590
the kids wouldn't have felt that happy.

25
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,190
The credit is yours.

26
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,840
It was your idea.

27
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,520
I did do something selfish.

28
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,100
I didn't tell you

29
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,430
you needed a remote control device to make those stars shine.

30
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,160
It's because

31
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,190
I wanted to give you a surprise.

32
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,720
I was surprised.

33
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,670
You came out of the darkness.

34
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,220
You were like...

35
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,700
Like what?

36
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,430
The Superman?

37
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,620
Mr. Lu, the Superman is not Chinese.

38
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,480
Oh, I was like Monkey King, right?

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,840
No, you weren't.

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,810
You didn't save anyone.

41
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,390
You were a hero for the kids for a short time

42
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,310
after you pressed the button.

43
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,520
How I wish

44
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,800
I could save you.

45
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,630
What?

46
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,960
Nothing.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,420
It's windy by the beach today.

48
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,740
Let me dust down my coat.

49
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,900
After I got to know those kids today,

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,760
I realized how difficult

51
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,910
life was for them.

52
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,910
But all of them

53
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,900
smiled so happily.

54
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,960
It reminded me of my past.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,740
I already had so many good things in the past.

56
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,830
But I still paid too much attention to those so-called long-term plans.

57
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,140
When I looked back,

58
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,100
I realized that I had lost my most precious thing.

59
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,019
Do you think

60
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,240
I'll get back what I lost?

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
I'll give a pair of artificial cochleas

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,370
to every one of the deaf kids present at today's event

63
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,500
in the name of Wuxin.

64
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,200
I want to help them

65
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,690
become the brightest stars.

66
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,720
In the future, I'll work with the company foundation

67
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,350
to establish a long-term charity program.

68
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,790
Let me thank you on behalf of those kids.

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,180
You're welcome.

70
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,950
Do you think by doing that, I'll help more people

71
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,190
and be a hero for more people?

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,330
You're already a hero for many people.

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,850
But you were never my hero.

74
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,900
All right, you need to engage in some social activities later.

75
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,760
Let's go there.

76
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,280
Hello, Mr. Lu.

77
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,730
I want to talk to you.

78
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,020
Is it convenient for you?

79
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,280
Yes, it'll be my honor.

80
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,790
This is Chairman Wang from the Design Association.

81
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,990
Do you want to join us?

82
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,320
Let's go.

83
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,070
Please.

84
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,150
A glass of whiskey, please.

85
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,530
Thank you.

86
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,840
You drunkard, stay away from me.

87
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,750
You stink.

88
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,850
You're so drunk.

89
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,990
Looks like today's event was a failure.

90
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,670
Yes, you're right.

91
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,150
Didn't you have a sharp tongue?

92
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,860
Now you can only drown your sorrows.

93
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,910
I was right.

94
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,810
Someone stole the idea of our proposal.

95
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,180
We could only make a new proposal for the event.

96
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,790
And now it ended up like this.

97
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,950
A vicious and arrogant person like you

98
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,460
should have some failures.

99
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,510
You're right.

100
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,070
If someone hadn't stolen the idea of our proposal,

101
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,310
I wouldn't have realized I was so lame.

102
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,390
I should thank the person who stole the idea of my proposal.

103
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,430
Otherwise,

104
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,060
I would be arrogant forever.

105
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,620
You always go against me.

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,680
Now you said you should thank me.

107
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,220
I said

108
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,909
I should thank the person who stole the idea of my proposal.

109
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,640
I didn't say I should thank you.

110
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,510
It was I who secretly gave your proposal

111
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,570
to the group's domestic subsidiary.

112
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
It was really you.

113
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,350
How many times are you going to play your dirty tricks?

114
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,030
You were just lying to yourself and lying to others.

115
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,430
You're really so stupid.

116
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,550
That's why

117
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,370
you were so happy just because you thought your tricks had worked.

118
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,070
You're not drunk.

119
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,020
How could you pretend to be drunk in front of me?

120
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,060
You really think

121
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,770
I would be that sad

122
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,490
just because an event failed?

123
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,680
Are you out of your mind?

124
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,090
Let's see

125
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,380
who the clown is.

126
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,470
Sorry.

127
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,130
I let you down.

128
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,860
Who do you think you are?

129
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,120
How could you lie to me?

130
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,280
Don't provoke her.

131
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,130
Yunkai, listen to me.

132
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,740
She...

133
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,570
What are you trying to say?

134
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,350
I don't want to listen to you.

135
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,130
I'm always on her side unconditionally.

136
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,390
She said something mean to me.

137
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,520
-And she teased me.
-Don't let me repeat what I just said.

138
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,590
Yunkai.

139
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,910
We grew up together.

140
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,050
Everyone says we'll be a couple sooner or later.

141
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,790
I know you're smarter than me

142
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,060
and you're better than me.

143
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,060
So I'm always willing to follow you.

144
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,430
But Lu Yunkai,

145
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,110
why haven't you never looked back at me?

146
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,670
In what way

147
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,580
do you think Helsin is better than me?

148
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,860
Is it because she

149
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,610
is a dead ringer for that woman?

150
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,600
No matter she is good or not,

151
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,340
as long as she stands here,

152
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,260
I will always look at her.

153
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,290
What am I to you then?

154
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,900
Nothing.

155
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,640
You...

156
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,100
You know

157
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,910
it was Song Ruozhao who told the idea of previous proposal

158
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,310
to Baifei's subsidiary?

159
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,310
She did?

160
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,270
You don't know?

161
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,400
Why did you...

162
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,910
She was making you unhappy.

163
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,440
That's why I took your side.

164
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,490
If he had nothing to do with

165
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,270
what happened to the toy factory,

166
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,430
these words

167
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,830
might...

168
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,220
He isn't gentle and kind.

169
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,400
He doesn't see me as his childhood sweetheart.

170
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,670
We have similar family backgrounds but he doesn't like me.

171
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,280
They're all liars.

172
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,810
Lu Yunkai, Zhou Mian and Helsin.

173
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,960
You're all bad people!

174
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,470
What are you looking at?

175
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,200
Haven't you ever seen any beautiful girl before?

176
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,950
[Maybe I'm just a passer-by, but there won't be a second passer-by just like me.]

177
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,950
[You turned around but you didn't see me and in this life I'm doomed.]

178
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,630
When did that slut become a WeChat contact of mine?

179
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,310
Who did it?

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,330
Are you done saying goodbye to those kids?

181
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,620
Vice President.

182
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,360
Vice President, can you

183
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,480
give Mr. Lu a ride?

184
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,740
Our car broke down.

185
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,340
I need to get it fixed.

186
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,420
But it's so late.

187
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,780
Are you sure you can get it fixed now?

188
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,930
Yes.

189
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,030
Fine.

190
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,360
Mr. Lu.

191
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,370
You organized this event.

192
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,110
Their questions should be answered by you.

193
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,040
I'll be with you.

194
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,260
Today, Wuxin gave wonderful Shehuo performances.

195
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,950
The traditional arts passed down from generation to generation

196
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,990
made the event a huge success.

197
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,010
Your event has become a trending hashtag.

198
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,510
Many young netizens

199
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,390
have found the charm of the traditional cultures.

200
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:48,980
How did you

201
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,820
get the idea of the event?

202
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,470
Wuxin has always been a platform

203
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,540
that has been offering support for the spread of traditional cultures

204
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,720
and for the protection of intangible cultural heritage.

205
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,990
Many veteran craftspeople

206
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,580
and craftspeople of the local fashion brands

207
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,690
have gained a lot of attention

208
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,080
on our platform.

209
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,950
Our corporate culture has never changed.

210
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,110
And we always hope to give people new ideas.

211
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,430
The Shehuo performances

212
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,350
are mainly seen during traditional festivals.

213
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,970
Today is a very meaningful day and worth celebrating.

214
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,910
The Shehuo performances also made the day special.

215
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,620
Wuxin will always contribute

216
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,080
to the revival the traditional cultures

217
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,490
and let people know that our traditional cultures can be charming in this age.

218
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,620
How do you feel about today's event?

219
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,160
How do you feel

220
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,500
about getting along with those deaf and hard-of-hearing kids?

221
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,120
It was a great honor to be present at today's event.

222
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,370
These kids are innocent, sensitive and kind.

223
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,030
When I was communicating with them,

224
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,340
I was touched a lot.

225
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,870
So this time,

226
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,780
in addition to our previous donation,

227
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,700
Wuxin will offer a new batch of artificial cochleas to those kids.

228
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,030
Though those children

229
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,490
are with disabilities,

230
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,280
they're gifted

231
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,180
with great DIY ability and artistic talent.

232
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,610
I believe

233
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,450
they will shine like the stars in the sky.

234
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,550
A lot people are born with disabilities or became disabled because of an accident.

235
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,750
In their daily life or at the workplace,

236
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,380
they may suffer discrimination.

237
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,390
Wuxin will eliminate discrimination in our employment.

238
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,920
They'll be fairly treated.

239
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,560
As long as one's capable, they'll be hired.

240
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,990
We have started a new business line

241
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,050
and we're recruiting talents for it.

242
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,580
We hope more and more good designers

243
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,980
can join our platform.

244
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,640
Thank you.

245
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,830
Do you have anything else to say, Mr. Lu?

246
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,010
We have only one spokesperson at home.

247
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,090
What she said is what I wanted to say.

248
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,620
At home?

249
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,310
Are they going to disclose their relationship?

250
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,040
I think "home" refers to Wuxin.

251
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,510
Today's event has been warmly received.

252
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,740
We gave a big blow to Baifei this time.

253
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,350
Come in.

254
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,800
Vice President, please take a look.

255
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,030
This is the JD

256
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,530
drafted and submitted by the HR Department.

257
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,510
They did it so fast.

258
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,680
Last night, after I said Wuxin

259
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,900
would be willing to hire deaf and hard-of-hearing designers,

260
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,750
my speech became a trending topic.

261
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,960
Some people at our company asked me if I really meant it or I was just saying some nice words.

262
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,490
I haven't replied them yet.

263
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,830
I didn't expect the HR Department

264
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,670
to draft the JD so soon.

265
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,050
Thank you for your cooperation.

266
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,150
This decision will have an influence not only on our company's image,

267
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,160
but also on the operating cost of our company.

268
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,310
Because if we hire

269
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,060
people with disabilities,

270
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,359
it will increase the communication cost, operation cost,

271
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,089
and other cost.

272
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,190
This decision

273
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,250
did cause controversy at our company.

274
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,450
But Mr. Lu has persuaded everyone at our company to agree.

275
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,670
We will definitely

276
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,710
cooperate with you in the future.

277
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,440
Personally,

278
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,880
I think this is a good decision.

279
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
There are two good KOLs on our platform

280
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,370
who make excellent hairpins.

281
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,430
But they're born with disabilities.

282
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,160
Contact them later

283
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,660
and see if they would like to

284
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,940
do original design for our ornaments.

285
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,990
Okay, I'll contact them.

286
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,410
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

287
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,590
Please check the documents

288
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,790
and give me a reply later.

289
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,120
Okay.

290
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,160
Thank you.

291
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,600
You're still working?

292
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,080
There's one more thing to do before I get off work.

293
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,580
You were in the R&D Department just now?

294
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,920
The R&D Department has been working overtime lately.

295
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,410
The Testing Department has been busy too.

296
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,440
Are they busy with some new project?

297
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,860
They're working on a mobile app.

298
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,020
So I'm really an unimportant vice president to you?

299
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,590
How could you not tell me anything about this project?

300
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,650
You're important.

301
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,520
I didn't mean that before.

302
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,440
You've been busy lately.

303
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,570
So I didn't tell you much about the R&D.

304
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,640
But if you have time,

305
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,560
let's have dinner together.

306
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,380
I don't have the time.

307
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,470
There's only one meeting room that is still being used.

308
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,000
That's exactly the meeting room I'm going to.

309
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,720
What a coincidence. We meet again.

310
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,130
Are you looking for me?

311
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,450
Yes.

312
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,510
Are you familiar with Song Ruozhao?

313
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,840
No.

314
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,470
That's not what she said.

315
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,250
She...

316
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,200
What did she say?

317
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,550
She said

318
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,440
that you two cooperated well

319
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,490
that you were the best partners.

320
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,630
Do you want me to be more direct?

321
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,660
I met you at the company that day.

322
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,520
Ms. Cheng.

323
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,540
Are you here to attend the meeting?

324
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,460
Yes.

325
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,780
But your meeting room

326
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
isn't nearby, right?

327
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,310
I...

328
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,030
My meeting is over.

329
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,350
I wanted a cup of coffee to refresh myself.

330
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,020
Someone guided me here.

331
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,320
But I think I went the wrong way.

332
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,550
And I couldn't find the coffee machine.

333
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,720
You told me you happened to pass by.

334
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,410
You were eavesdropping on me, right?

335
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,150
Yes.

336
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,350
I did it.

337
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
Nice try.

338
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,570
But Song Ruozhao wouldn't say that.

339
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,970
I'm not that close to her.

340
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,990
You don't think I shouldn't have done that?

341
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,630
Zhou Mian.

342
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,210
You deserved it.

343
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,470
What's that look?

344
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,190
We lived together for four years.

345
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,040
I could recognize you easily.

346
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,570
Sorry.

347
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,980
Zhou Mian?

348
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,700
Why did you do that?

349
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,570
I thought we were good friends.

350
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,640
Good friends?

351
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,990
It was you who abandoned me!

352
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,120
I didn't.

353
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,680
You didn't?

354
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,440
You were my best friend.

355
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,800
You gave me hope.

356
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,890
You made me rely on you.

357
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,900
But then you abandoned me!

358
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,270
In your eyes, I was like a puppy.

359
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,370
But I was so naïve

360
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,940
to think of you as my best friend.

361
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,550
You must think I was a joke.

362
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,410
Enough.

363
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,450
You gave up everything for this man.

364
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,160
You fell in love with him, you would get pregnant with his child and you would get married with him.

365
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,890
You gave up everything for him!

366
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,300
The first draft of your design was passed at the Topic Selection Meeting.

367
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,810
You could have had a successful career.

368
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,290
But you just gave it up. You gave up the chance to have a bright future.

369
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,310
Didn't you say you wanted to inherit Zhou's career,

370
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,590
do what you like,

371
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,800
and finish design drafts with me forever?

372
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,750
What's so good about this man?

373
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,030
I asked you if you regretted it at the toy shop.

374
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,640
What did you say to me?

375
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,540
They were all my personal choices.

376
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,900
I can't say which one is a better choice.

377
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,270
It was nonsense.

378
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,780
You abandoned me because of him.

379
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,710
I didn't abandon you.

380
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,570
It was because my hand was injured.

381
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,210
The doctor said I couldn't finish a draft anymore.

382
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,190
I didn't dare to tell you.

383
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,870
I was afraid that you would be sadder than me after knowing it.

384
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,450
So I lied to you

385
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,800
and told you I quit because I was getting married but it was a lie.

386
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,030
I was a joke just now, right?

387
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,560
But for me,

388
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,950
your hand wouldn't have been hurt that badly.

389
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,410
It was Cheng Shan's fault.

390
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,840
She shouldn't have made that mistake at the workplace

391
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,300
just because she hates me.

392
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,290
Because of what she did,

393
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,950
so many people's efforts were wasted.

394
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,940
But luckily,

395
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,470
our event was successful in the end.

396
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,300
So please don't punish her.

397
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:15,980
Okay.

398
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,160
I'll do anything

399
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,540
you ask me to do.

400
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,400
At that meeting,

401
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,390
everyone wanted you to investigate it.

402
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,910
Why did you say you wouldn't do that?

403
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,580
I thought it was you

404
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,980
who had let them know the idea of our proposal.

405
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,830
The words of "Rimu Tuyuan"

406
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,250
came from the story of Wu Zi Xu's revenge.

407
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,630
I thought

408
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,610
you were still holding a grudge against me because of what I had done in the past.

409
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,830
So I thought you were taking revenge on me.

410
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,830
I thought you should have done that.

411
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,270
Don't think you know me well.

412
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,660
I do hold a grudge against you.

413
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,000
But I'm professional.

414
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,590
Got it.

415
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,630
You're a good person.

416
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,750
You always are.

417
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm not good enough.

418
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,540
Are you hungry?

419
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,140
Do you want to eat something?

420
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,890
Any new dishes on the menu?

421
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,790
No.

422
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,400
The owner of the restaurant hasn't changed at all.

423
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,130
He's so lazy.

424
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,410
When will you stop staring at each other?

425
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,950
Will you order or not?

426
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,170
Boss.

427
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,450
Why haven't you ever updated the menu

428
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,920
throughout our college years?

429
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,490
You only serve these dishes all the time.

430
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,890
Those dishes are enough.

431
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,840
Every time you come here,

432
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,530
you always order the same dishes.

433
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,830
I'll bring the dishes you always order.

434
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,740
Boss, order.

435
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,110
Okay. Coming.

436
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,470
I'll bring the dishes you always order.

437
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,320
What would you like to eat?

438
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,990
Oh, you two.

439
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,080
No wonder you look familiar.

440
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,440
How are you now?

441
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,150
Are you two married to each other?

442
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,250
You have a good memory.

443
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,760
I've been running the restaurant for years.

444
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,810
I'm not bragging.

445
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,170
I can recognize every old customer of mine

446
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,280
even if they haven't come for over a decade.

447
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,040
What would you like to order today?

448
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Those old dishes ?

449
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,540
Yes.

450
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,640
No chilies in those dishes.

451
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,500
No chilies?

452
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,390
This is a restaurant which serves Sichuan cuisine. We put chilies almost in all our dishes.

453
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,680
Girl, I remember

454
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,300
you used to enjoy spicy food.

455
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,070
Just do as I said, thank you.

456
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,030
Okay.

457
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,130
The dishes will be ready soon.

458
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,920
Has your preference for food changed?

459
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,720
I know you don't like spicy food.

460
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,830
How did you know that?

461
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,590
Pang told me about it.

462
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,260
Actually,

463
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,710
it's not that I don't like spicy food.

464
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,630
I'm allergic to chilies.

465
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,830
Allergic to chilies?

466
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,660
You ate Sichuan cuisine with me so many times in the past.

467
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,780
I was inarticulate in the past.

468
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,480
As long as you like it,

469
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,610
I'll be okay with it.

470
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,280
Lu Yunkai.

471
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,770
You lied to me

472
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
about such a trivial matter.

473
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,380
You hid it from me.

474
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,280
You thought you were being considerate.

475
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,640
You thought you were noble.

476
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,840
You made me make you allergic every day.

477
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,130
I was with you because I loved you.

478
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,550
I didn't want to hurt you.

479
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,040
You made me

480
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,860
someone who hurt her boyfriend.

481
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,010
Did you think you were superior?

482
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,170
Someone stole the idea of our proposal.

483
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,610
But you did nothing about it.

484
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,740
You said you were trying to protect me.

485
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,690
You haven't changed a bit over the years.

486
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,830
Are you

487
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,670
addicted

488
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,310
to telling lies?

489
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,070
No, I'm not.

490
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,480
I just wanted...

491
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,280
You did those things

492
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,120
for me?

493
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,340
Have you ever treated me as an equal?

494
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,340
Have you ever treated me as an independent individual?

495
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,250
You think loving me is sacrificing everything for me?

496
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,050
You're wrong.

497
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,220
To love me, you need to first

498
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,520
understand me, treat me as equal,

499
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,910
and respect me.

500
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,490
Ask yourself.

501
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,130
Have you really loved me?

502
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,290
You were with me

503
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,570
because you enjoyed getting me out of trouble.

504
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,260
Being with me was your way to go against your family.

505
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,330
You saw yourself as a great man in love.

506
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,330
But it was you

507
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,730
who brought me the greatest pain.

508
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,610
When I fell into the sea,

509
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,980
despite so many hurtful words I had heard,

510
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,730
I first saw your image

511
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,990
in my mind.

512
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
I was thinking...

513
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,350
Yunkai was so good.

514
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
He would definitely find me, right?

515
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
But you didn't.

516
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,070
Mian.

517
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,320
You were too loud.

518
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,440
The light bulbs were broken by your voice.

519
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,130
I agree.

520
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,520
I was self-centered.

521
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,760
I always thought of myself as someone who should protect others.

522
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,430
And I was used to hiding things from you.

523
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,560
I was also used to making decisions without telling you.

524
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,750
That's why

525
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,260
I did a lot of things that hurt you and I didn't realize it at all.

526
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,940
But Mian…

527
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,280
I was just a college student at that time.

528
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,990
I was only in my early twenties.

529
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,420
It was my first time to be in a romantic relationship.

530
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,250
It was my first time to try to protect someone.

531
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,730
I didn't know how to love.

532
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,990
I was figuring it out on my own.

533
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,670
I wanted to give you the best.

534
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,790
I didn't mean to hide anything from you.

535
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,740
I'm sorry.

536
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,590
Sorry.

537
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,000
There is something wrong with the electrical circuit.

538
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,860
Sorry, please wait a few minutes.

539
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,710
I didn't mean to hide my family background from you.

540
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,490
I was just afraid that you would dislike me for my family background.

541
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,490
Because you said

542
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,140
that kids from rich families were all spoiled,

543
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,580
and that you didn't like those rich kids.

544
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,290
I also remember you looked down upon them

545
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,490
because you thought those who were born rich and relied on their families

546
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,750
were arrogant and liked to bully others.

547
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,910
So I didn't dare tell you my family background.

548
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,070
I was afraid

549
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,700
you would think I was also one of them

550
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,560
who always depend on their family.

551
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,810
You said you liked me

552
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,470
because you thought I was diligent and ambitious.

553
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,310
And you said you would be willing

554
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,190
to create a bright future with me.

555
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,180
I thought as long as we were together,

556
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
as time went by,

557
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,420
you would know my true love for you.

558
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,340
You thought?

559
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,110
Why didn't you think I would be happy after marring you?

560
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,180
After all, by marrying you

561
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,420
I would be a member of a rich family.

562
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,330
And then I don't have to work hard anymore.

563
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,590
I'll be successful and be happy forever.

564
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,310
You wouldn't think that way.

565
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,610
Because you're Mian. I know what kind of person you are and I love you so much.
