[Episode 12]

4
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,230
You're back.

5
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,940
The dumplings are ready.

6
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,850
Let's eat.

7
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,380
Mr. Jiang.

8
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,810
Is this a gift for me?

9
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,390
These two cups are even identical.

10
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Thank you.

11
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
That isn't...

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,390
I bought one and then got another one free.

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,540
[If a girl gives a boy a cup as a gift, what does it mean?]

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,540
[A cup sounds similar to "a lifetime" in Chinese.]

15
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,590
Mr. Jiang, did you ask to see me?

16
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,950
Why are you blushing?

17
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,800
I...

18
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,070
Do you have a fever?

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,390
Do you need me to help you make an appointment with a private doctor?

20
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,920
I'm fine.

21
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,920
I'm not sick.

22
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,170
By the way,

23
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,510
these are the original documents of the contracts which I don't need.

24
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,630
Help me shred them.

25
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,710
Besides,

26
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,340
I'll have a meeting with the two Vice Presidents this afternoon.

27
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,470
I might be back late.

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,270
Are you going to have a meeting with the Vice Presidents again?

29
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,740
What's wrong?

30
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,450
Nothing.

31
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,390
It's just that you work hard and deal with all the work personally.

32
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,470
But recently, you've always asked the two Vice Presidents

33
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,420
to deal with the key business lines.

34
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,350
I'm thinking...

35
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,770
Nothing.

Heshan Toy Factory.

38
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,440
Jiang Fei.

39
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,000
Tong Wan, just say it.

40
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,950
Although you didn't take over the business affairs of the Lu Family,

41
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,880
you know that your cousin Jiang Fei

42
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,960
has been working for the Lu Family.

43
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:16,839
Right?

44
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,940
So you've known that all the time.

45
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,640
At that time, the Lu Family asked Jiang Fei

46
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,270
to take charge of accelerating the demolition of the whole land.

47
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,150
You've also known that

48
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,210
I've been investigating the case of the Heshan Toy Factory,

49
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,140
but you still hid the truth from me.

50
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,690
You made a vow by the river.

51
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,390
It turns out that you were taking advantage of me.

52
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,990
Jiang Fei grew up with me.

53
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,790
I know his personality very well.

54
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,960
I believe that

55
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,970
-he knows nothing about this.
-You believe in him?

56
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,350
On what ground do you believe in him?

57
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,409
You were not involved in this matter.

58
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,780
It turns out that

59
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,330
your promise to find the truth with me

60
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,150
is such a way of pretending that everything is fine

61
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,590
and deceiving me.

62
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,130
Zhou Mian,

63
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,950
can you stop being so emotional

64
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,150
when you mention this every time?

65
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,860
Be careful!

66
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,650
Yunkai!

67
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,130
Don't move.

68
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,620
Are you done?

69
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,050
Not yet. Wait a moment.

70
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,300
It's okay. Thank you.

71
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,790
It's not done yet.

72
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,250
Yunkai.

73
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,250
What are you doing?

74
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,390
Lu Yunkai asked me to change the ward for him.

75
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,250
Did he say that?

76
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,860
If you're making so much troble,

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,030
it won't be good for his condition at all.

78
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,910
Besides,

79
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,350
he hasn't woken up yet.

80
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,710
He told me in my dream.

81
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,330
What on earth did the doctor say?

82
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,310
He hurt his brain.

83
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,110
I don't think it's a minor injury.

84
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,100
Maybe when he wakes up,

85
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,700
he'll suffer from dementia.

86
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,670
The worker who sent you two here told me that

87
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,710
he hurt his head

88
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,130
to protect you.

89
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,100
I already asked someone to investigate the case on the construction site.

90
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,140
I'm just curious

91
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,630
why you had to

92
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,320
argue with him so fiercely that

93
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,150
you didn't even notice it when the scaffold

94
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,270
fell down.

95
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,950
What happened at that time....

96
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,080
I have no interest in

97
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,480
the love relationship and conflicts between you two.

98
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,610
I just want to tell you that

99
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,050
Lu Yunkai has been used to
affectation since he was a kid.

100
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,780
He has been pretending to be a gentle and elegant man

101
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,580
who is also calm and restrained.

102
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,980
But because of you,

103
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,780
he failed to maintain this image again and again.

104
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,040
He may have done something wrong before.

105
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,800
However,

106
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,070
he has been trying to make up for it all these years.

107
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,670
Of course,

108
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,740
whether you forgive him or not has nothing to do with me.

109
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,540
But I hope that

110
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,590
you'll stop using

111
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,320
his love and obsession with you

112
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,390
to hurt him wilfully.

113
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,910
What do you mean?

114
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:08,920
Miss Zhou,

115
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,680
may I venture to ask you something?

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,870
Ever since you came back,

117
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,940
other than the fact that he has become sadder and suffered more,

118
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,310
in this relationship,

119
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,400
what efforts have you made?

120
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,550
You don't know what happened between us.

121
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,150
I only know that after you went missing,

122
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,710
he followed the maritime search and rescue team

123
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,040
to look for you without rest like a crazy man.

124
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,040
At that time, the wind and waves were quite strong at sea.

125
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,380
He once fell into the water accidentally.

126
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,820
If the members of the search and rescue team had not saved him immediately,

127
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,480
he even wouldn't have intended to save himself.

128
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,310
He...

129
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,430
He looks gentle and rational,

130
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,390
but he is actually a foolish man who is so obsessed with love.

131
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,190
But Miss Zhou,

132
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,030
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,510
I'm on the same side

134
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,790
with this stupid fool.

135
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,740
So, even though you might feel annoyed with me,

136
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,000
I still want to say that

137
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,870
all these years,

138
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,970
Lu Yunkai has suffered

139
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,659
no less than you.

140
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,930
Besides, after you came back,

141
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,430
he happily went to stay by your side

142
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,910
like a loyal dog.

143
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,990
But if

144
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,390
he can only

145
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,190
get hurt like this again and again,

146
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,250
and see you have an ambiguous relationship with Mike,

147
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,430
who always thinks about replacing him and inheriting

148
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,890
the Lu Family's property,

149
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,910
then I hope that

150
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,120
you won't torture him with the excuse that you love him.

151
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,630
Replacing him?

152
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,090
Inheriting the property?

153
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,150
Jiang Fei is very angry.

154
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,190
Maybe it's because you're badly injured.

155
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,480
He also said that

156
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,750
your brain is severely injured.

157
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,870
After you wake up,

158
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,430
you might suffer from dementia.

159
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,100
Don't worry.

160
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,920
I'll always stay with you here.

161
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,590
I won't leave you at all.

162
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,480
You need to get well soon

163
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,800
and prove to him that

164
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,220
you won't be like that.

165
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,630
Okay?

166
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,420
Thank you.

167
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,670
So,

168
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,070
why can't you talk to me in the company?

169
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,910
You even had to ask me out for this.

170
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,760
It's a personal affair, not business.

171
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,360
So,

172
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,670
it's more convenient to talk outside.

173
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,120
It's a personal affair.

174
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,790
Okay.

175
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,150
Well,

176
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,590
just say it.

177
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,580
I'm ready.

178
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,390
I...

179
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,200
I have something to ask you.

180
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Okay.

181
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,280
I saw a file accidentally

182
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,150
when I shredded the paper yesterday.

183
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,830
It says

184
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,890
the Lu's Group owned a large tract of real estate in the surburbs,

185
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,470
and back then,

186
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,870
you were fully in charge of the demolition.

187
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,220
Yes.

188
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,740
So?

189
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,470
So,

190
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,830
were you also the one who asked your subordinates

191
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,980
to accelerate demolishing

192
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,580
the Heshan Toy Factory violently at that time?

193
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,020
The Heshan Toy Factory?

194
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,100
Why should I accelerate demolishing this factory?

195
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,420
Hmm?

196
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,510
So,

197
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,170
this is the reason why

198
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,440
you made me feel surprised

199
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,510
as soon as I stepped into the office?

200
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,120
This demolition agreement

201
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,320
was signed by Uncle Zhou personally indeed.

202
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,780
He signed it voluntarily.

203
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,500
He had no conflict with the real estate company.

204
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,700
Of course I know that.

205
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,800
However,

206
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,680
at that time, the doorkeeper said that

207
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,150
a group of people rushed to the factory angrily to accelerate demolishing it.

208
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,080
It happened right before the fire.

209
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,680
Then I...

210
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,600
Then I don't know.

211
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,550
Anyway, all I know is that

212
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,550
I hate angry subordinates the most.

213
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,500
So,

214
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,570
I've told you the truth.

215
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,520
When can you restore

216
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,520
all these surprises for me?

217
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,950
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,790
Mr. Jiang.

219
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,630
I'll restore them immediately.

220
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,110
In order to apologize to you,

221
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:20,880
how about

222
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,770
I treat you to dinner tonight?

223
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,950
Let's have dinner after seven o'clock.

224
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,070
I've entrusted the subsequent

225
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,310
toy lines to Mr. Li.

226
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,410
There are still many follow-up details which we haven't discussed clearly.

227
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,500
Just clear up my room first.

228
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,160
I have to go.

229
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,790
So,

230
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,900
you're really delegating your power to the lower levels.

231
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,350
Mian.

232
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,880
Mian.

233
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,030
Don't go!

234
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,230
Yunkai.

235
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,090
Yunkai.

236
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,150
Mian.

237
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,680
Be careful.

238
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,470
Mian.

239
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,470
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,280
I shouldn't have

241
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,080
yelled at you unintentionally.

242
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,030
You're reflecting on yourself so carefully.

243
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,960
You seem to have the virtues of men.

244
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,610
I really can't bear the pain

245
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,770
of seeing you leave me again.

246
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,910
When you turned around and was about to leave,

247
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,990
I really panicked.

248
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,250
I swear that

249
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,280
I won't

250
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,880
yell at you fiercely again.

251
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,590
You have such a sweet mouth.

252
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,460
Why didn't I notice it before?

253
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,710
It looks like

254
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,040
you're not suffering from dementia after you hurt your head.

255
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,280
I preteneded

256
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,580
to be calm and composed

257
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,610
for so long that

258
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,750
I missed so many things.

259
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,130
If I can make you

260
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,360
stay by my side forever by playing dumb,

261
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,050
I'd rather suffer from dementia.

262
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,760
How shameless.

263
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,810
Change the dressing first.

264
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,610
You two can continue after that.

265
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,770
After you go back, just change the dressing according to the doctor's advice.

266
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,500
If there are no other problems,

267
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,670
finish the procedure to get discharged soon.

268
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,750
Okay. Thank you. Thanks for your hard work.

269
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,680
You're welcome.

270
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,950
Aren't you going to rest for a while?

271
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,510
Why have you never told me

272
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,650
about your relationship with Mike?

273
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,810
I heard it from Jiang Fei in front of

274
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,270
the door of the ward today.

275
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,030
Actually,

276
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,140
it's not that I'm not willing to

277
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,470
tell you about my relationship with Mike.

278
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,160
But I'm worried that after I tell you about it,

279
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,330
you'll be unhappy.

280
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,750
You don't need to worry about my relationship with him so much.

281
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,000
We're lovers

282
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,700
and the partents of our child.

283
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,430
We should be sincere and honest to each other without reservation.

284
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,750
Actually, I didn't mean to hide it from you.

285
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,550
Mike

286
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
is the child of my father's ex-wife.

287
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,110
He is four years younger than me.

288
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,570
As he wants to inherit the family business,

289
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,700
he has treated me as an imaginary enemy since he was a kid.

290
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,680
He's your younger brother.

291
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,910
How come he's your younger brother?

292
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,960
Isn't he

293
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,370
the son of your father's ex-wife?

294
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,340
For adults,

295
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,550
after two people get divorced,

296
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,550
there will still be some entanglements between them.

297
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,790
When I was four,

298
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,670
my father's ex-wife gave birth to Mike.

299
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,950
That was why

300
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,730
they weren't well treated

301
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,230
in the Lu Family.

302
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,460
Just tell me.

303
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I want to hear the subsequent story.

304
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,990
Do you know why Jiang Fei

305
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,790
changed the ward for me that day?

306
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,200
The ward at the end of the hospital

307
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,740
could help me avoid disturbance from the passers-by.

308
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,470
It was easy to discover people who acted weirdly.

309
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,630
Look.

310
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,400
Actually, before we went to the construction site,

311
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,330
and before the accident happened,

312
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,680
I discovered a worker who acted weirdly.

313
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,910
That worker's figure is quite similar to this man's.

314
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,740
So I think he must have come to the hospital at once

315
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,440
to learn about my condition

316
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,420
after he hurt me successfully.

317
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,540
Then he could report it to his boss.

318
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,800
I seem to have seen this man before.

319
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,070
I remember that

320
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,680
when I once had dinner with Mike,

321
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,710
I met him as soon as I went out of the door.

322
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,710
Since we've talked so much about it,

323
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,890
I also want to tell you

324
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,490
what happened six years ago,

325
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,710
when your hand got hurt.

326
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,450
Actually,

327
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,380
I don't think it was an accident.

328
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,510
The patient's hand nerves are badly injured.

329
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,440
Even if she could recover well later,

330
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,230
it might be hard to do those movements

331
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,960
of drawing pictures and lines.

332
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,839
But he once saved me.

333
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,070
At my most difficult times, he stayed by my side

334
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,450
and gave me warmth.

335
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,450
I've even treated him as my own younger brother.

336
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,560
I didn't force you to make a choice.

337
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,060
Nor did I ask you

338
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,280
not to associate with him.

339
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,420
It's just that you said you wanted to hear it,

340
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,620
so I told you about it.

341
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,150
You got to know each other in a situation like that.

342
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,830
I know

343
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,900
you must trust him very much.

344
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,830
I even feel

345
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,110
very grateful to him.

346
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,960
He saved you

347
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,170
and helped you.

348
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,310
I can even

349
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,780
forgive him

350
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,470
for what he did before.

351
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,080
But we both know that

352
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,660
a person's good deeds

353
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,980
can't cover up his evil deeds.

354
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:23,630
Oh.

355
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,700
What's wrong with you?

356
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,970
Do you have a headache?

357
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm fine.

358
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,050
But you haven't kissed me today.

359
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,690
Here.

360
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,990
It's just a minor injury.

361
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,460
You don't have to follow me all the time.

362
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,310
What's wrong?

363
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,900
Do you want to go inside and take a shower with me?

364
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,760
The doctor has said you can't be exposed to hot steam for so long,

365
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,240
and you can't let your wound get wet.

366
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,070
Got it?

367
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,150
Yes, Ma'am.

368
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,310
Later, if I don't come out after taking a shower

369
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,380
for ten minutes,

370
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,530
just come inside and catch me.

371
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,060
The training will help to heal the wound on your hand.

372
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,950
Mian.

373
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,350
Go on.

374
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,940
As long as you want it,

375
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,150
you can achieve the things which you really like.

376
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,800
I can do it.

377
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
I'll be able to draw pictures again.

378
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,400
We can finish what we want to do.

379
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
We can also defeat our common enemy.

380
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,790
By the way,

381
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,680
recently,

382
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,370
the network has not been very good.

383
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,780
I can't see any information after refreshing the pages.

384
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,310
I want to read the news of China and...

385
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,880
That's what the network

386
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
is like in Europe.

387
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,050
You'd better not often read the news of China.

388
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,840
It's inevitable that you will feel sad when you think of those memories.

389
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,440
It'll affect your recovery.

390
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,230
Mian.

391
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,010
It's me.

392
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,230
It's so chaotic outside.

393
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,200
Why are you here?

394
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,550
The riot here is very serious tonight.

395
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,510
I was worried that you might feel scared,

396
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,670
so I came to check on you.

397
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,400
Are you okay?

398
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,030
Mian.

399
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:32,750
Mian.

400
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,870
Mian, what's wrong with you?

401
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,850
Do you know Mukal?

402
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,650
The Fashion King, Mukal.

403
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,690
I helped an old man

404
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,260
on the street today.

405
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,830
He was wearing a neat suit

406
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,340
with silver hair all over his head and a slicked-back hairstyle.

407
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,270
He accidentally

408
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,340
caught a glimpse of my design draft.

409
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,180
He said,

410
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,790
"Wow, diamond bear."

411
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,190
Then he asked me to have coffee with him at Tina's headquarters.

412
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,600
The Fashion King, Mukal,

413
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
asked me out to have coffee with him!

414
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,810
I told you

415
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,910
you can do it.

416
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,040
You're always very brilliant.

417
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,780
The weather is getting cold.

418
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,270
Put on a coat.

419
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,510
Mian, help me put on a coat.

420
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,040
Mr. Lu, could you please

421
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,920
be serious?

422
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,470
You hurt your head, not your hands.

423
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,770
I have a headache.

424
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,710
Can you stand up?

425
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,830
Mian.

426
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,130
Don't think too much anymore.

427
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,320
Every time I saw you look like that,

428
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,170
I felt very sad for you.

429
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,200
Everything will be in the past.

430
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,900
Everything will be fine.

431
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,100
Trust me.

432
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,620
I will help you find the truth.

433
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,000
I understand.

434
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,880
Actually, it happened so long ago,

435
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,660
and I've already got through the period of grief.

436
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,860
But my dad loved toys

437
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,620
so much when he was still alive.

438
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,280
If he knows that his design

439
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,410
is missing,

440
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,970
I think he'll feel very sad.

441
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,840
I don't want to see him get disappointed.

442
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,410
That's why I insist on

443
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,130
protecting his design.

444
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,080
After my hand got hurt,

445
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,220
I didn't touch toys

446
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,620
for a long time.

447
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,150
At that time,

448
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,160
I carved spring-festival

449
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,910
wood engraving every day,

450
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,200
while receiving rehabilitation treatment

451
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,960
and crying.

452
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,320
I often had a dream.

453
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,670
In my dream, my father

454
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,440
looked at me disappointedly.

455
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,320
He said that I didn't inherit his will.

456
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,780
Zhou Mian only got some scratches.

457
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,470
She's fine.

458
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,400
Lu Yunkai hurt his head.

459
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,860
But he was discharged from hospital

460
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,720
after living there for just a day.

461
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,370
Lu Yunkai...

462
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,940
was discharged from hospital after living there for just a day?

463
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,200
So they fooled me by saying that he was in severe condition.

464
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,300
It's necessary to teach Wuxin a lesson.
