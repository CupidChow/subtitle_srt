00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,560
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,110
You wouldn't.

5
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,520
Because you're the Mian who I love.

6
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,740
If you love me so much,

7
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,289
then why didn't you show up on the wedding day?

8
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,930
You made me wait for you for so long,

9
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,590
all alone in my wedding dress.

10
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,660
You may not even believe it when I tell you.

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,100
I was locked up at home.

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,850
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

13
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,170
I'm in my twenties

14
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,539
and I can't even make my own decisions

15
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,210
about my freedom of movement.

16
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,440
The day before the wedding,

17
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,150
my family called and said

18
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,880
my mother was sick and I had to go back to visit her.

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,830
I've always wanted to be independent.

20
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,430
I don't want to have any contact with my family.

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,530
But after all, my mother was sick.

22
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,850
I rushed back.

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,460
Who knew.

24
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,660
They found out that I was getting married behind their backs

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,850
and planned it.

26
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,110
My parents were furious.

27
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,090
They had it all planned out for me.

28
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,890
My life and my marriage.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,900
they want to control everything.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,990
But you know what, Mian?

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,930
I told you before

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,190
that I envy your family.

33
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,160
It's not a lie.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,210
My family is cold and mercenary.

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,150
I don't understand why they're slaves to money

36
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,079
when they're already rich enough.

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,470
I refused the marriage they arranged.

38
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,400
I told them

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,600
I already have someone I want to spend my life with.

40
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,720
My mom said

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,970
she won't give us her blessing.

42
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,650
I don't need her blessing.

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,220
I never even thought of

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,079
letting them attend our wedding.

45
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,640
And then?

46
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,290
I was surprised when you showed up at my house that day.

47
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,750
Father came out to see you.

48
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,510
I don't want them to get anywhere near you

49
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,910
and make things difficult for you,

50
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,950
so I sent you away

51
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,210
and stayed behind to stall for time.

52
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,230
But I didn't expect my mom

53
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,090
to put sleeping pills in my glass,

54
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,360
and locked the door.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,620
and took my phone away.

56
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,100
When I woke up the next morning,

57
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,630
I had no choice

58
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,090
but to jump out the window.

59
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,260
When I got to the harbor,

60
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,650
the wedding ship had already returned.

61
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,940
Everyone told me

62
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,470
you were gone.

63
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,890
I don't understand what that meant.

64
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,120
How could you be gone?

65
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,490
Didn't we agree to get married?

66
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,060
I asked the helmsman to take me out on the water to look for you

67
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,850
But they said

68
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,940
there was a sudden change in the sea.

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,900
No one dared to sail at that time.

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,920
When the weather got better,

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,540
I got a few boats to look for you out at sea.

72
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,990
But the sea is too big.

73
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,230
I'm not your hero.

74
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,680
I couldn't save you.

75
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,790
I'm just an incompetent man.

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,680
I couldn't even save the one I love the most.

77
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,880
You think, if you said that

78
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,060
I'll understand

79
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,580
and forgive you?

80
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,770
Why didn't you choose to be honest back then?

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,370
The wound is already there.

82
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,310
Even if there're scabs,

83
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,430
when they come off,

84
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,830
there'll still be marks.

85
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,740
At that time,

86
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,899
I fell into the sea.

87
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,279
I felt like I would die every second.

88
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,830
I loved you so much

89
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,250
and I trusted you.

90
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,210
I wanted to give my life to you

91
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,430
but you did that to me.

92
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,270
And when I woke up,

93
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,610
you weren't by my side.

94
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,720
I started hating you then.

95
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,790
But you didn't forget me,

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,760
right?

97
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,710
Mian.

98
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,330
You haven't let go of this relationship.

99
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,930
As long as you are still here,

100
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,220
I still have a chance.

101
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,950
If one day doesn't work, two days then.

102
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,790
If one year doesn't work, two years then.

103
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,440
I'll be by your side for the rest of your life.

104
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,910
You can't get rid of me.

105
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,840
It's finally fixed.

106
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,170
The circuit is always malfunctioning.

107
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,470
Don't speak too soon.

108
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,270
One day, it's going to be a slap in the face.

109
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,210
All I know is

110
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,080
that if I show my sincerity,

111
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,190
I'll get there in the end.

112
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,250
Why did she leave without eating?

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,930
Did you have a fight?

114
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,900
Yes, we did.

115
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,780
You can't do that.

116
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,430
How can you fight with your wife?

117
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,000
I've had experience with this.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,730
Listen.

119
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,050
Go and coax her.

120
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,740
No matter whose fault it is,

121
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,020
bow your head and apologize first.

122
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,770
It's embarrassing.

123
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,660
Yes, I got it.

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,850
Don't worry.

125
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,210
We will be fine.

126
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,990
Something's wrong with you.

127
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,520
You've been acting strange since last night.

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,930
Go to your morning meeting.

129
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,360
Bye.

130
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,240
As long as you're here,

131
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,870
I still have a chance.

132
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,690
I'll be by your side

133
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,220
for the rest of your life.

134
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,810
It's not a good day to drive.

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,730
I think I should take a taxi.

136
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,770
30 minutes?

137
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,620
Sigh.

138
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,340
I miscalculated the morning rush hour.

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
It's not easy, doing bad things.

140
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,540
You have to get up so early.

141
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,880
Cut the crap.

142
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,370
Mind your attitude.

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,060
Do you know why we are here?

144
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,030
I don't know why you're here,

145
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,200
but I know who sent you here.

146
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,970
Ms. Song Ruozhao.

147
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,070
Come out.

148
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
I was well-hidden.

149
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,280
How did you find me?

150
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,070
Was it hard?

151
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,980
We're all adults.

152
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,370
Why do you always play

153
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,830
childish games like this?

154
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,110
You...

155
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,110
Cut the crap.

156
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,090
Can't you see what's going on?

157
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,100
There's 5 of us.

158
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,330
You're alone.

159
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,990
How dare you be so arrogant?

160
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm not trying to go there.

161
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,230
Stop!

162
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,810
Lu Yunkai?

163
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,740
Why is he here?

164
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,680
Don't lie to me.

165
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,470
You can't see me.

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,620
You can't see me.

167
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,050
Go now.

168
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,790
Right.

169
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,320
Let's go.

170
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,480
Go.

171
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,320
We're leaving?

172
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,480
I...

173
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,660
I'm fine.

174
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,880
Why did Song Ruozhao come here?

175
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,410
What does she want with you?

176
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,340
She...

177
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,390
I'm really fine.

178
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,430
But

179
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,880
why are you here?

180
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,820
I wanted to follow you to work this morning

181
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,040
but I saw you turn in

182
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,390
so I followed you.

183
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,360
Did you run? Yes.

184
00:09:59,470 --> 00:09:59,980
Yes.

185
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,030
I just can't handle the fact that

186
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,290
you aren't here anymore.

187
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,510
Sis.

188
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,750
Are you free?

189
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,890
I was hoping to talk to you.

190
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,960
You want to talk to me? I'm here to talk to you. I'm here to see you.

191
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,690
But Sis,

192
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,580
I haven't seen you for a long time.

193
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,350
Sorry.

194
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,640
I've been busy lately.

195
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,300
Is it

196
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,270
work stuff?

197
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,720
It's not just work, is it?

198
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,810
He's... He's...

199
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,280
You guys...

200
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,410
Can you stop with the attitude?

201
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,480
I didn't agree with your plan in the first place.

202
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,050
Because you were too close to him.

203
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,240
I didn't expect

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,530
it to still end up like this.

205
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,600
Mike.

206
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,490
We're all adults here.

207
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,070
You did save me,

208
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,390
take care of me

209
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,830
and stayed by my side.

210
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,400
But

211
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,370
I have my own thoughts too.

212
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,900
Sis,

213
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,470
I'm worried about you.

214
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,810
You are too close to him.

215
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:11,900
That man

216
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,540
is cunning and selfish.

217
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,720
You used to love him.

218
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,260
And now his shadow is in your heart again.

219
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,760
Every word he's ever said to you

220
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,690
affects you more than you realize.

221
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,070
I...

222
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,610
There's no need to say more.

223
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,580
You can fool me,

224
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,210
but can you fool yourself?

225
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,270
I just think that,

226
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,230
if I blame everything on him,

227
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,310
it's a little unfair.

228
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,980
When you fell into the sea and almost drowned,

229
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,390
when your family's toy factory was forcefully seized,

230
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,880
indirectly causing your parents' accident,

231
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,050
did he ever think

232
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,650
if it's unfair to you?

233
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,550
I've looked at the leads for the toy factory.

234
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,220
Maybe it really has nothing to do with him.

235
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,350
Mike.

236
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,820
Did you have a misunderstanding with him?

237
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,520
Maybe.

238
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,490
Misunderstanding?

239
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,610
You've been brainwashed by him

240
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,810
and now you're questioning me instead?

241
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,510
We've been together for so many years abroad.

242
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,800
There should be some trust between us at least, right?

243
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,490
Maybe this is also a misunderstanding with you

244
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,220
and about the trust between us.

245
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm sorry Sis.

246
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,600
I was out of line.

247
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,730
I just hope you can get what you want

248
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,460
instead of getting hurt again.

249
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,020
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,250
That's not what I meant.

251
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,060
Don't apologize to me.

252
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,110
No matter what happens,

253
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,390
I won't get mad at you.

254
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,980
I bought you custard cream bread.

255
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,040
Remember to eat it.

256
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,190
Okay.

257
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,210
Why are you in the mood

258
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,030
to invite me out for coffee today?

259
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,510
Of course it's because I miss you.

260
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,870
Such a sweet talker.

261
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,070
You're in a good mood.

262
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,550
just so so.

263
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,480
You don't look it.

264
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,060
Tell me.

265
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,560
How are you and Lu Yunkai?

266
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,870
Why do you ask?

267
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,640
Otherwise, why did you ask me to meet here?

268
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,440
This is downstairs from our office.

269
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,650
We could bump into people we know any time.

270
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,600
That means

271
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,490
we don't have to pretend that we don't know each other.

272
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,150
Smart girl.

273
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,050
Here's a piece of chocolate for you.

274
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,240
Well,

275
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,300
I can't eat sweet food these days.

276
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,990
I'm controlling my sugar intake.

277
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,780
So?

278
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,770
He knows who I am.

279
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,250
He wants to get back together.

280
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,330
He also explained many misunderstandings back then.

281
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,130
So his explanation convinced you?

282
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,470
I don't know.

283
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm really confused right now.

284
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,790
I understand his helplessness and difficulties,

285
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,430
but we can't turn back time.

286
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,190
And I still haven't gotten the truth about

287
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,990
my dad's patent certificates that disappeared.

288
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,070
If I don't,

289
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,230
I can't let it go.

290
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,070
Meals need to be taken one bite at a time.

291
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,790
Solve the problems one by one.

292
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't be anxious.

293
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,710
This will weaken your body's energy circulation.

294
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,830
As long as we're alive,

295
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,290
we should care about every hair on our heads.

296
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,320
But

297
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,680
I didn’t find any clues

298
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,150
about those patents on Jiang Fei's side.

299
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,420
I'm secretly wondering

300
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,390
if the leads are going in the wrong direction.

301
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,590
Actually, that night,

302
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,820
when he came to your house drunk,

303
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,030
I could see that he really misses you.

304
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,830
Don't people say that

305
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,680
people tell the truth after drinking?

306
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,610
I don't mean to influence your judgment.

307
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,920
I'm just afraid that if you're confused,

308
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,170
you might regret it.

309
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,810
You've been hurt.

310
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,480
It's inevitable that you look at him subjectively.

311
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,190
Could there be some misunderstanding

312
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,300
or do you want to talk to him again?

313
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,810
Why are you all...

314
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,680
What?

315
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,270
Nothing.

316
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,670
Have some goji berry water.

317
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,910
It's not even on the menu.

318
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,820
I got it for you.

319
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,020
Thank you.

320
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:34,960
Cheers.

321
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,270
Cheers.

322
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,440
[President's Office]

323
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,500
Tong Wan.

324
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,380
Mr. Jiang.

325
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,880
I thought you

326
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,450
weren't coming to the office this afternoon.

327
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,250
After I was done, I noticed the flowers hadn't been watered

328
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,510
so I came to take a look.

329
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,080
You seem to be in a good mood.

330
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,930
Good news?

331
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,350
I had tea with someone I like.

332
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,430
Are you so happy to see Zhou Mian?

333
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,660
Did he hear something?

334
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,370
Is it bad?

335
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,190
I know

336
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,800
you and her have always been good friends.

337
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,830
So,

338
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,910
you resigned and have been acting strange these days,

339
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,040
is it because of her?

340
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,030
Mr. Jiang, I really don't plan to resign.

341
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,170
At least you acknowledged the last item.

342
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,500
Because you've reunited with her,

343
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,100
you've gone off the deep end,

344
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,070
even making stupid mistakes

345
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,530
you've never made before.

346
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,340
What kind of reaction is this?

347
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,250
Is this how you criticize your employees?

348
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,810
You used to think only of me.

349
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,010
You worked hard

350
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,210
I gave you.

351
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,990
Sometimes, you even think of things before me.

352
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,480
But now you've changed.

353
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,350
In your eyes, in your heart,

354
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,810
there's someone else now.

355
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,340
You'd even

356
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,320
scald me with hot jasmine tea!

357
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,350
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

358
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,210
It's my fault for not doing my job.

359
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,119
Mr. Jiang.

360
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,980
What are you...

361
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,010
This is for you.

362
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,990
Mr. Jiang.

363
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,130
Flowers for girls

364
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,030
are usually plucked.

365
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,440
Those will wither.

366
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,710
What I gave you is different.

367
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,710
It can accompany you for a long time.

368
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,130
So I hope

369
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,380
you can stay with me for a long time too.

370
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,360
So you will take good care of these flowers

371
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,270
and stay in the company,

372
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,610
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

373
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,060
Yes.

374
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,090
Okay.

375
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,530
You're done here.

376
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,520
Okay. Okay.

377
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,360
Well...

378
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,790
Okay.

379
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,710
I'm not getting tricked, am I?

380
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,370
Is Mr. Jiang using the legendary

381
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,230
honey trap on me?

382
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,480
This event is quite interesting.

383
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,910
Every invitation comes with a random image.

384
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,080
The designers who receive the invitation have to submit a design,

385
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,900
using the image as the theme, in order to attend.

386
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,100
The problem is whether the submissions are acceptable to them.

387
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,500
I heard they eliminated a lot of them.

388
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,090
There'll be a competition at the event too.

389
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,270
Mr. Song said

390
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,070
he would invite the young winner

391
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,470
to have dinner together.

392
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,560
I think they're searching for new talent.

393
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,810
Everyone is very interested.

394
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,900
Why don't I participate too?

395
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,340
I can take a look

396
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,130
and poach a few designers too.

397
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,440
You're being modest.

398
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,990
Just a few?

399
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,440
There's more than a dozen designers on that list that you're interested in.

400
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,800
So that's your plan.

401
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,360
You...

402
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,210
Miss Song has

403
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,090
become more and more friendly lately,

404
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,950
even to the extent of eavesdropping on

405
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,350
others' conversations.

406
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,890
I heard it by accident.

407
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,920
By accident?

408
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,370
I kept my voice so low

409
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,350
and you could still hear it by accident.

410
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,470
You must be

411
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,860
too careless then.

412
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,000
You can talk now.

413
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,720
When I beat you at the event later

414
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,630
and you lose face,

415
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,890
no one will go with you.

416
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,750
Oh.

417
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,330
Okay.

418
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,000
You can't win with me around.

419
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,260
Don't you understand?

420
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
Are you coming in?

421
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,230
If you're not, I'm pressing the button.

422
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,090
Stop pretending to be calm.

423
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,040
You must be scared to death.

424
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,090
You have a nice plan,

425
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,930
but it's all in vain.

426
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,580
How could Mr. Song Bingzhu,

427
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,580
an experienced designer and entrepreneur,

428
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,950
have such a lively and talkative granddaughter like you?

429
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,910
That's strange.

430
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,040
How did you know he was my grandpa?

431
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,830
Maybe it's because I'm good at searching the web.

432
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,350
[Song Ruozhao]

433
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,820
This photo is nice.

434
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,090
But you wrote this page yourself, right?

435
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,240
The granddaughter of a business tycoon.

436
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,840
You guys are just jealous of me.

437
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,870
I heard that Mr. Song

438
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,150
is well-known for being incorruptible.

439
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,750
I'm sure he won't be biased.

440
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,590
At your level,

441
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,170
it's hard for you to beat me.

442
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,500
I have many ways.

443
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,600
Just you wait.

444
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,450
Don't tell me

445
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,430
you're going to cry to your grandpa?

446
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,030
You...

447
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,980
Helsin, I hate you!

448
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:50,810
Grand...

449
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,040
Hello, Mr. Song.

450
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,110
Miss Helsin.

451
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,150
You recognize me?

452
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,470
The design draft you sent back with the invitation

453
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,110
was so impressive.

454
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,560
To be praised by Mr. Song

455
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,770
is a great honor.

456
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,330
Each new generation surpasses the previous one.

457
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,760
Luckily, I'm old.

458
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,270
If I were the same age as you, Miss Helsin,

459
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,960
it's inevitable that I would feel like I'm not up to the task.

460
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,160
You're being modest.

461
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,970
Everyone knows that when you started out,

462
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,570
you changed the standards of

463
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,590
the Designers Association with a single piece of work

464
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,280
and won the Designer's Prize?

465
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,790
You know about that too?

466
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,130
Sir, we should go.

467
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,810
Excuse me.

468
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,470
Boss, I'll be away for a bit,

469
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,670
I'll come back later.

470
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,860
Okay.

471
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,080
What are you looking at?

472
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,670
Aren't you going in?

473
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,400
Oh.

474
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,630
Why do you call him Mr. Song too?

475
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,330
Grandpa doesn't like us

476
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,060
to parade around using his name ostentatiously.

477
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,450
So when we're outside,

478
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,190
I can only call him Mr. Song.

479
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,780
So strict?

480
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,850
Why did you write it on your wiki page then?

481
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,110
He can't see it anyway.

482
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,160
Don't tell anyone.

483
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,860
Or else...

484
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,800
Or else?

485
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,380
Or else...

486
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:29,900
Or else...

487
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,260
Or else I'll have to change it.

488
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,430
You're quite cute.

489
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,310
What are you up to this time, you evil woman?

490
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,100
[Fashion Boundless]

491
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,300
Thank you for participating

492
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,190
in today's competition.

493
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,110
We're down to the last two beautiful designers.

494
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,550
Let's look forward to

495
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,050
their exciting battle.

496
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,110
The next part is the overall styling competition.

497
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,280
Let's welcome our models

498
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,690
who'll appear one by one.

499
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,620
Models, please!

500
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,870
Hello?

501
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,170
Why didn't you ask me why I sighed?

502
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,780
Because I don't want to know.

503
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,550
I'm going to tell you then.

504
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,640
Helsin.

505
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,910
I really hate you.

506
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,000
Can you say something I don't know?

507
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,970
Why does everyone like you?

508
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,470
Yunkai likes you.

509
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,450
People in the company like you.

510
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,890
Even Grandpa likes you.

511
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,940
Maybe you'd like to think about

512
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,610
why you don't like me?

513
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,240
I want to be liked, too.

514
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,830
I'd like to have a flair for design, too.

515
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,670
I want to amaze everyone.

516
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,810
I want Grandpa to see me.

517
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,760
He loved me when I was a kid.

518
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,830
Why do people have to grow up?

519
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,690
If I didn't grow up,

520
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,650
Grandpa would've continued to love me.

521
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,900
So you participated in this competition

522
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,590
to make your grandpa happy.

523
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,250
So you care a lot about him.

524
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,960
Yes.

525
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,270
But I'm too useless.

526
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,430
Grandpa hasn't smiled once

527
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,110
at my designs.

528
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,980
Once I even heard him sighing

529
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,600
that the Song family

530
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,450
has no successor.

531
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,630
Grandpa is already so old

532
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,470
and he still has to worry about the company

533
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,170
because I'm useless.

534
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,670
All right.

535
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,230
Your snot and tears are all over me.

536
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,690
I'm crying.

537
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Do you have any sympathy?

538
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,800
The dry cleaning fee is expensive.

539
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,510
And we're going on stage soon.

540
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,770
Your eyes are swollen.

541
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,100
Turn it around.

542
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,970
You can use it to ice your eyes.

543
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,630
Thank you.

544
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,870
I'm not thanking you.

545
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,560
Even so,

546
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,670
I will still hate you.

547
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,250
Do you think

548
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,340
I care if you like me or hate me?

549
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,020
Let's welcome Helsin.

550
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,300
Evil woman.

551
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,270
Next, let's give the contestant who came in first

552
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,350
in the first two rounds,

553
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,570
Miss Helsin, the first choice.

554
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,920
Miss Helsin, please.

555
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,910
The improvisation of the overall look

556
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,110
requires finding the balance between subversiveness and beauty.

557
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,150
If it were me,

558
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,880
I wouldn't have chosen a professional model.

559
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,310
It's a trap.

560
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,390
Indeed.

561
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,710
Professional models are definitely

562
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,170
a hard choice.

563
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,910
They naturally have an edge when it comes to image,

564
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,710
so it's hard to cause a big change through styling.

565
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,790
Why did you choose such a well-built

566
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,190
and fashionable model?

567
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,570
How will the effects show if she's already so pretty?

568
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,000
Are you...

569
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,400
Helping me?

570
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,020
-Next, let’s welcome...
-Why?

571
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,480
Miss Song Ruozhao, please make your choice.

572
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,120
Let's go.

573
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,220
Don't you want to watch?

574
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,550
There's nothing to see.

575
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,820
Let’s give a round of applause to congratulate Designer Song Ruozhao

576
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,420
for being the final winner of the competition.

577
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,490
Congratulations.

578
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,350
Congratulations.

579
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,800
Congratulations, Miss Song.

580
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,750
Congratulations, Miss Song.

581
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,830
The transformation of the amateur model just now

582
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,670
made her look so cultured and elegant, it was amazing.

583
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,280
Thank you.

584
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,730
Grandpa, I have something to do.

585
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,490
I have to go.

586
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,280
Okay.

587
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,090
Congratulations, Mr. Song.

588
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,950
Evil woman, I didn't ask her to let me win.

589
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,190
I want to talk to her.

590
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,820
This is...

591
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,910
Well,

592
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,910
You were participating in the event in there.

593
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,360
Congratulations on winning first prize.

594
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,760
I didn't win first prize.

595
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,550
Well,

596
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,030
to celebrate our upcoming dinner then.

597
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,470
I didn't agree to have dinner with you.

598
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm asking you now.

599
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,460
Mian.

600
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,240
I finally managed to get a reservation

601
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,900
at your favorite restaurant.

602
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,920
He called her Mian.
