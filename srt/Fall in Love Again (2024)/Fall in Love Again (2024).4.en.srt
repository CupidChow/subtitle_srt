[Episode 4]

4
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,490
It's not in the photo storage.

5
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,620
Will there be a copy of the patent certificate among the scanned documents?

6
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,289
What are you doing?

7
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,990
Mr. Jiang.

8
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,230
I’m asking what you are doing.

9
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,560
During your lunch break,

10
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,670
the cleaning lady came

11
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,100
to clean the keycaps of your mechanical keyboard.

12
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,259
However, she doesn't know much about peripherals

13
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,770
and misplaced a few keycaps.

14
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,570
I thought

15
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,150
I'd quickly fix them before you return.

16
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,509
Good work. Fix them quickly.

17
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,479
Luckily, my boss has OCD.

18
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,000
Alright, Mr. Jiang.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,090
If there's nothing else,

20
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:52,960
I'll go out.

21
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,520
Okay.

22
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,110
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,789
No way.

24
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,750
There shouldn't be any trace.

25
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,150
Is the angle of this picture frame

26
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,760
different from before?

27
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,950
The computer monitor's extension cord and the picture frame

28
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,350
are at a 30-degree angle.

29
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,140
There's no problem.

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,100
I've checked.

31
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,660
Maybe I've been too nervous lately.

32
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,440
By the way,

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,220
did a lot of employees

34
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,620
go to the coffee shop downstairs?

35
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,270
They've started making the tiramisu that was once popular on social media.

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,270
Everyone is rushing to take a photo.

37
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,870
Do you like it?

38
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,590
I'll treat you if you like it.

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,450
Has he finally decided to be a human?

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,020
I looked through his computer today, but I couldn't find it.

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,680
I was even caught at the scene.

42
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,370
Please enjoy.

43
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,510
Thank you.

44
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,510
Mr. Jiang, please.

45
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,079
This waitress is not a good person.

46
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:00,320
What?

47
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,070
What’s wrong, Mr. Jiang?

48
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,390
She drew a butt

49
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,670
in your plate.

50
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,910
Is it true that someone can't tell the difference between a heart and a butt?

51
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,650
I thought about your resignation.

52
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,070
I think

53
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,640
I can't do without you.

54
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,120
Uh?

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
So if you have any difficulties recently,

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,590
I can help you.

57
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,440
Don't let it affect your work.

58
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,520
I hope you can

59
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,710
retire from

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,620
this position.

61
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,200
Excuse me.

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,870
I thought too much.

63
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,160
What bad intentions could a capitalist have?

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,960
He just wants me to work for him forever.

65
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,710
Well,

66
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,140
thank you.

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,340
Look, there's the sea.

68
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,200
You slept for over two hours.

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Why are you tired?

70
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,339
I drove for two and a half hours.

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,910
Thank you.

72
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,870
This pair of partners is also very compatible.

73
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,640
[Sister!]

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,460
Today is another day to ship someone.

75
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,600
[If that pit doesn't have sugar for now, should we try this one? It has some feeling.]

76
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,830
Come on, let's gather.

77
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,870
Take your keys and rest.

78
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,470
Let's talk in the group chat if there's any problem.

79
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,530
OK.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Thank you.

81
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,990
It's okay.

82
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,460
Aren't you leaving?

83
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,790
Oh, my.

84
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,880
Vice President.

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,740
What a coincidence. Mr. Lu's room

86
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,920
is opposite yours.

87
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,190
Mr. Lu.

88
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,240
I'll unpack your luggage for you.

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,920
Why do you look

90
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,260
sleepy?

91
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,430
Oh.

92
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,620
The livestream was too long yesterday.

93
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,460
I'm going to get some sleep later.

94
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,540
Have a good rest.

95
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,909
Okay.

96
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,860
[Lu Yunkai specifically chose the room opposite mine. We want to observe him, and he might be thinking the same.]

97
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,860
[Let's be careful when you come over.]

98
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,910
Mr. Lu.

99
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,390
What's wrong with me?

100
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,670
What's wrong with this room?

101
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,610
Did you deliberately arrange it?

102
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,430
Yes.

103
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,190
It's my arrangement.

104
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,420
I asked the lady from the administration department

105
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,880
to arrange for only you two

106
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,050
to live in this villa.

107
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:25,820
Oh.

108
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,790
Mr. Lu.

109
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,070
Here.

110
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,230
Hey. Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

111
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,400
I prepared it

112
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,870
according to your capacity for alcohol.

113
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,980
When you two are chatting and the atmosphere feels right,

114
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,750
you can have a little drink or two.

115
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,630
Make sure

116
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,140
to open up to each other.

117
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,790
Mr. Lu.

118
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,360
Come on.

119
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,230
Now that he hinted,

120
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,510
it feels so strange.

121
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,080
The site of the old toy factory

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,860
was reconstructed not long after the accident.

123
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,730
It was connected to a large factory area nearby.

124
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,890
It's well-planned.

125
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,670
The entire area is under the ownership of Lun Yunkai.

126
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,600
The original shops were long gone.

127
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,190
I tried to visit them for two days.

128
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,850
I haven't found anything yet.

129
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,080
There must be some clues

130
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,100
left behind for everything done.

131
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,040
Later, you should check Lun Yunkai's personal phone

132
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,200
to see if you can find any leads.

133
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,070
Hope we can find something.

134
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,560
Got it.

135
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,230
Mr. Lu.

136
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,680
Are you busy?

137
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,150
The backend traffic for the recent cultural festival activities

138
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,350
has been quite heavy.

139
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,850
Therefore, I'm monitoring it in real time.

140
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,550
The operations and maintenance teams are stationed at the company.

141
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,570
Any updates

142
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,830
should be synchronized with you promptly.

143
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,230
So don't keep an eye on it.

144
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,630
Okay.

145
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,030
Mr. Lu,

146
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,370
you're such a considerate person.

147
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,200
Why are you still working

148
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,600
when everyone is out to play?

149
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,150
You're acting like a supervisor.

150
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,880
Shouldn't I?

151
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,130
I used to work in my own room.

152
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,960
I came here because

153
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,830
I wanted to get along with everyone else.

154
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,940
You're a good person.

155
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,070
It's a pity that you've never worked for others.

156
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,470
What?

157
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,010
The boss

158
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,000
just needs to foot the bill.

159
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,360
He doesn't need to be present before that.

160
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,890
Let's go.

161
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,720
Let's go out.

162
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Mr. Lu left with the vice president.

163
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,150
We can finally have fun.

164
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,410
Isn't the sea view nice?

165
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,920
It's perfect for team building.

166
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,710
Do you like it?

167
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,170
I'm coming in.

168
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,670
Goodness.

169
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,750
They all looked pretty slim normally.

170
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,140
But they don't look nice after they take off their clothes.

171
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm so disappointed.

172
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,290
I really want to pull their heads off.

173
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,760
Typical oily men in the workplace.

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,670
They bully young girls if they don't have any skills.

175
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,270
Young girls?

176
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,220
A group of middle-aged women who entered the workplace

177
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,620
still dare to call themselves young girls.

178
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,990
The real young girls

179
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,100
are all in college.

180
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,160
What are you looking at?

181
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,840
The way you phrase it

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
really makes one imagine

183
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,320
your mouth is directly connected to your intestines.

184
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,630
You two

185
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,090
are really strict with others

186
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,650
but lenient with yourselves.

187
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,130
Just joking.

188
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,180
Why are you being so mean?

189
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,590
Yeah.

190
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,710
I was just joking with you.

191
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,430
What?

192
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,670
Isn't it funny?

193
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,470
Don't worry about the matters of the beauties anymore.

194
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,470
If you have time to lecture others,

195
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,350
why don't you go back

196
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,430
to improve your performance ability?

197
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,710
I've seen your performance evaluation results this week.

198
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,510
Your performance is a bit risky.

199
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,380
Tingwen, Lu Wei, Emily.

200
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,380
Go swimming.

201
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,550
You even remember our names?

202
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,690
I remembered them during the morning meeting.

203
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,770
Remembering someone's name

204
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,230
is the minimum level of respect.

205
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,560
This is what I should do.

206
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,900
We'll go play.

207
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,850
We're leaving.

208
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,820
As a newly appointed executive,

209
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,020
your words were a bit sharp.

210
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,960
There's always something to learn in the live stream room.

211
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,520
What?

212
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,480
Mr. Lu, are you afraid I'll offend someone?

213
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,470
I don't think so.

214
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,270
Pleasing oneself

215
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,760
is much more comfortable than pleasing others.

216
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,620
But I don't understand these men.

217
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,220
They don't do physique management

218
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,190
and they don't work out.

219
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,470
Yet they insist on insulting

220
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,100
others' physique and age.

221
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,430
I have something to do.

222
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,430
So I'm going back.

223
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,760
It's not easy for you to come out.

224
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,020
Don't think about work.

225
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,350
I heard there's a Ferris wheel over there.

226
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,520
The wish made at the top of the Ferris wheel

227
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,730
is easy to come true.

228
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,930
We can go there and pray

229
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,040
for the smooth operation of the program

230
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,300
and a perfect finale.

231
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,820
Is there such a saying?

232
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,230
Yes.

233
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,340
Let's go.

234
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,260
It seems like

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,530
there's no attendant here.

236
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,400
We need to scan the code to buy the tickets.

[Legend of Ferris wheel]

238
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,130
[Self-service scan code payment]

239
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,880
I've heard of Unmanned Supermarket.

240
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,950
But I've never heard of unmanned Ferris wheels.

241
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,230
For safety's sake, let's not ride it.

242
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,360
It doesn't look like

243
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,530
there is any other customer around here anyway.

244
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,430
Mr. Lu.

245
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,730
Are you reluctant to pay for the ticket?

246
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,630
Anyway, I can't let you go back.

247
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,320
It's raining.

248
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,630
I remember I only paid once.

249
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,860
Why does it keep spinning?

250
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,090
Could there be a malfunction?

251
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,890
Don't say ominous things.

252
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,130
Why is there no signal?

253
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,140
Are we going to be trapped here?

254
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,890
No.

255
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,460
If they find out we're not in the villa,

256
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,820
they will come to us.

257
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,380
At least,

258
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,200
Pang will come to me.

259
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,140
Mr. Lu.

260
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,530
Mr. Lu.

261
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,140
Isn't Mr. Lu in his room?

262
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,340
The water should be ready.

263
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,430
Let me go back and take a bath first.

264
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,860
It's not easy for me to come out for team building.

265
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,660
I'm going to forget about my job.

266
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,030
Hey.

267
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,950
Wake up.

268
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,650
You'll catch a cold if you sleep now.

269
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,910
You shouldn't fall asleep either.

270
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,310
Okay. I won't sleep.

271
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,600
Hang in there.

272
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,230
Hey.

273
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,250
Why are there defense measures?

274
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,870
I didn't expect it to come in handy.

275
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,070
It can warm me up.

276
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,980
Why is it so little?

277
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,180
It's all the weight of the wine pot.

278
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,570
For you,

279
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,640
it's quite a lot.

280
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,030
Do you remember

281
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,390
on Tangyuan's birthday,

282
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,980
you saw

283
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,950
a photo of us three, right?

284
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,130
She is Zhou Mian.

285
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,290
When I first saw you,

286
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,260
I couldn't believe my eyes.

287
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,089
Because you were so alike.

288
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,230
Despite your different tastes,

289
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,780
dressing styles,

290
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,310
ways of doing things,

291
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,200
and even areas of expertise

292
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:21,960
are different,

293
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,560
besides,

294
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,109
her hand being injured,

295
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,510
there were moments

296
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,870
when you two overlapped in my eyes.

297
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,020
I didn't notice it at all.

298
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,120
Besides,

299
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,130
it's normal.

300
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,700
I remember when I was young,

301
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,390
I saw photos of people

302
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,650
from different countries who looked exactly alike.

303
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,450
Besides, humans are subjective beings,

304
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,380
and emotions can affect judgment.

305
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,060
Really?

306
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,710
Have you been apart for a long time?

307
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,940
I really

308
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,960
miss her.

309
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,830
Because she told me

310
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,230
I have to stand high to see wide.

311
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,660
So I created Wuxin

312
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,630
to

313
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,060
walk to higher places

314
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,220
step by step.

315
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,590
When my vision is wide enough,

316
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,590
maybe I can

317
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,440
get her information.

318
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,600
Because I never believed what others said

319
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,120
that she disappeared into the sea

320
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,650
just like that.

321
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,170
I even feel

322
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,030
I've found her.

323
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,300
Mr. Lu.

324
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,480
So that's what you meant.

325
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,080
I thought

326
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,000
no one would use those

327
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,870
outdated tricks in body-double literature.

328
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,600
I didn't expect to see it again.

329
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,220
You're saying sweet words about missing your lover one moment,

330
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,070
then implying strange relationships

331
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,070
with female subordinates the next.

332
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,560
So this is your preference, huh?

333
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,300
But, Mr. Lu,

334
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,650
I like

335
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,410
your physique and appearance.

336
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,110
There's no harm

337
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,660
in enjoying it a bit.

338
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,950
After all, I was parachuted into the upper echelons of the company.

339
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,280
Rumors are inevitable.

340
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,270
It's fine to confirm one of them.

341
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:40,980
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,930
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,870
I misspoke while under the influence of alcohol.

344
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,840
What did you say?

345
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,870
Helsin.

346
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,240
Helsin.

347
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,380
Mr. Lu, the VIP ward is full.

348
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,940
Sorry, but we can only arrange this lady in a double room for now.

349
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,320
Goodness.

350
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,030
Look at him.

351
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,540
It's just hypoglycemia.

352
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,520
She'll be fine after taking a bottle of glucose and a nap.

353
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,500
Don't worry.

354
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,790
But she was caught in the rain.

355
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,710
I wonder

356
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,360
if there might be an inflammation.

357
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,160
Please add a blood routine check

358
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,330
to check her white blood cell count.

359
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,190
Nurse.

360
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,510
We also want to add some tests.

361
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,910
Give us the full package,

362
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,800
the most expensive and comprehensive one

363
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,390
you have.

364
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,680
Our full medical examination includes...

365
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,150
Hush.

366
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,260
Just arrange it.

367
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,800
Alright.

368
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,470
Please wait a moment.

369
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,880
Thank you for helping her get changed.

370
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,480
Thank you.

371
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,800
You're welcome.

372
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,260
Give this patient a full check-up.

373
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,360
Seems like he's read too many romance novels about domineering bosses, huh?

374
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,350
Are you okay?

375
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,160
I heard from your company

376
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,360
you arrived at the hospital early in the morning.

377
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,220
What happened?

378
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,430
I'm fine.

379
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,310
Actually, I'm not fine.

380
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,380
There's good news.

381
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,700
Good news?

382
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,980
What good news can there be in the hospital?

383
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,740
I just wanted to check

384
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,360
her white blood cell count.

385
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,220
But then I found out...

386
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,130
B-type blood.

387
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,090
Hypoglycemic anemia.

388
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:22,740
And...

389
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,440
This is...

390
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,440
This is Ms. Helsin's blood routine examination report.

391
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,800
When I was changing her gown just now,

392
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,610
I noticed a pretty clear cesarean section scar

393
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,040
on her abdomen.

394
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,330
If needed,

395
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,790
our hospital can provide

396
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,590
scar removal surgery services.

397
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,420
Zhou Mian had a cesarean section.

398
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,490
Isn't it matched?

399
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,140
Whose medical report is this?

400
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,070
It's Helsin's.

401
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,910
Oh.

402
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,860
Now that you mention it,

403
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,020
I just ran into an acquaintance in the garage.

404
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,420
I was wondering why he came to the hospital.

405
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,060
It all makes sense now.

406
00:23:59,390 --> 00:23:59,920
Let's go.

407
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,870
Since I'm here,

408
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,750
I'll go check on the patient.

409
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:03,780
Let's go.

410
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,230
Okay.

411
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,000
Let's go.

412
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,640
Look.

413
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:36,900
No matter how I see it,

414
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,030
it seems like someone with ulterior motives

415
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,160
is exploiting your vulnerabilities.

416
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,860
The wound can be faked.

417
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,120
Blood type is not a rare distinguishing criterion.

418
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,360
Your words just now

419
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,810
were hardly convincing.

420
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,210
Can you stop badmouthing her in front of me?

421
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,030
What?

422
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,940
Is this behavior

423
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,370
what they call "bitchy"?

424
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,980
You've been undermining

425
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,860
our relationship by speaking ill of my wife

426
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,290
in front of me all this time.

427
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,800
Please, I know you're a die-hard protector of your wife.

428
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,180
But could you first figure out

429
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,270
if she's your wife or not?

430
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,130
How come I haven't figured it out?

431
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,220
She gives me a different feeling.

432
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,240
I have a premonition

433
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,280
that she's Mian.

434
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,400
It's strange to survive

435
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,190
falling into such a vast ocean.

436
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,350
If you're not convinced,

437
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,770
let me check it for you.

438
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,050
Oh my.

439
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,940
The smiley lip makeup I did today looks really nice.

440
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,480
It's making me look really cheerful.

[Mr. Jiang: Come here for a moment.]

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,450
Mr. Jiang, what can I do for you?

443
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,070
After the afternoon visit to the cooperative partners,

444
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,760
remind me to stop by the plant shop

445
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,070
to buy some fertilizer.

446
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,470
Okay.

447
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,340
What are you...

448
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,670
This is the flower I carefully picked online.

449
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,130
Windmill jasmine.

450
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,050
It will be very beautiful when it blooms.

451
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,770
I didn't know you were interested in gardening.

452
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,550
I wasn't before.

453
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,230
But I just discovered it.

454
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,600
That man is useless.

455
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,730
I might as well take care of the plants

456
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,730
so that I won't get angry with him.

457
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,900
Did something good happen today?

458
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,110
You've been smiling

459
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,780
and looking so cheerful.

460
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,940
Maybe

461
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,340
it's because of the new lip color I tried.

462
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,810
It's almost two o'clock.

463
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,670
It's time to go.

464
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,990

465
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,800
Mr. Jiang.

466
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,560
Why are you not smiling?

467
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,720
Because the smiley lips I drew

468
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,450
got smudged while eating.

469
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,950
I'll smile right now.

470
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,030

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,930
I had hypoglycemia.

486
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,540
So I was a little grumpy.

487

is how you rescued me from the Ferris wheel.
