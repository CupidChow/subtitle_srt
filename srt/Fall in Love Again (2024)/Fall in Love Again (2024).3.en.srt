[Episode 3]

4
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,760
Mian.

5
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,860
You're not much of a friend.

6
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,950
Why didn't you contact me

7
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,500
for such a long time?

8
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,250
Sorry.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,530
Something did happen to me.

10
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,020
I came back this time

11
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,750
because I accidentally found some clues.

12
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,120
My dad

13
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,020
was suspected of appropriating the students' works

14
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,150
and was fired.

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,080
After that, he came home to run the family's toy factory.

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,539
But there was an accident.

17
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,259
Things aren't as simple as a circuit fire on the surface.

18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,710
So this time, I'm back

19
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,070
to find out the truth.

20
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,580
Are you

21
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,470
suggesting foul play?

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,010
Yes.

23
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,830
I suspect

24
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,270
this has something to do with Lu Yunkai.

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,560
Lu Yunkai?

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,450
How could it be Lu Yunkai?

27
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,590
A friend of mine told me.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,700
To be precise,

29
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,870
he saved my life.

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Back then when I fell into the water,

31
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,360
he pulled me out.

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,570
In the following days,

33
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,390
he stayed with me every day

34
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,950
until I recovered.

35
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,940
Sis.

36
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,150
Go on.

37
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,180
As long as you're willing,

38
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,440
things you really like

39
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,650
can be accomplished.

40
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,910
It's chaotic here tonight.

41
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,110
I was worried you might be scared, so I came to check on you.

42
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,050
Today is New Year's Eve. In China, people usually eat dumplings.

43
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,720
But I don't know how to make them.

44
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,130
I could only buy some frozen dumplings

45
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,990
in a nearby Chinese supermarket.

46
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,500
So you trust him?

47
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,750
Yes.

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,710
After the fire,

49
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,750
I went back once.

50
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,710
I was looking for

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
the patent documents left by my dad.

52
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,250
I remember those documents

53
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,050
were locked in my dad's cabinet.

54
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,120
But they were gone when I went back.

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,050
There were no traces of burning.

56
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,550
Someone must have taken them.

57
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,710
Perhaps

58
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,450
finding the person who took the patents

59
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,360
can lead me to the real culprit.

60
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,100
How do you want to investigate?

61
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,650
I'm now getting close to Lu Yunkai again

62
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,390
under the guise of being Helsin.

63
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,430
Although he may still be suspicious of me,

64
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,680
out of curiosity,

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,180
he won't resist me.

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,760
I plan to gradually approach him,

67
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,760
and I'm sure I'll find some clues eventually.

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,210
Tong Wan, you're here.

69
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:52,890
Morning.

70
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,630
By the way,

71
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,960
just now, Mr. Jiang said

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,420
for you to go to his office.

73
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,040
But

74
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,870
why didn't he

75
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,720
message you himself?

76
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,800
That's strange.

77
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,150
Maybe

78
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,510
because he doesn't have a phone.

79
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,410
He left his phone in my car before he got off.

80
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,440
Oh no.

81
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,370
I completely forgot about him

82
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,550
after talking to Mian last night.

83
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,480
There aren't many cars passing by.

84
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,440
He wouldn't walk back, would he?

85
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,350
Tong Wan, wait and see.

86
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,310
I'm doomed.

87
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,340
Mr. Jiang.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,400
Your phone.

89
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,840
Is he

90
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,210
going to fire me directly?

91
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,240
Although the salary here is good,

92
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,640
and the benefits are nice,

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
if I can't hold onto this job,

94
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,040
might as well do what I want to while I can.

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,210
Alright.

96
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,500
Before I go, there are some things I must say.

97
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,670
I admit it was my fault yesterday.

98
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,270
I left without saying goodbye.

99
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,110
That's because it was an emergency.

100
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,760
I've been working for you for so many years.

101
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,360
I've been diligent these years.

102
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,230
I’ve been working hard.

103
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,070
I even wish we had a 007 work system.

104
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,770
I may not have merits, but I have definitely put in effort, right?

105
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,100
Now you want to fire me over this one thing.

106
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,130
Can't it be resolved

107
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,930
with a deduction from my salary?

108
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,040
Jiang Fei,

109
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,020
do you know how annoying you are?

110
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,890
You're cold, demanding, and difficult to serve.

111
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,640
If it weren't for being born into a good family,

112
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,570
you wouldn't have made it this far.

113
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,950
I feel like I've been

114
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,750
as patient with you as a Buddha for all these years.

115
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,770
Feels good.

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,970
Are you done?

117
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,460
Yes.

118
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,570
If you're done, send out the invitation

119
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,300
according to the address on it.

120
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Okay, Boss.

121
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,680
I'm on it.

122
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,040
Anything else?

123
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,750
No.

124
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,220
Wait.

125
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,520
I don't want to do this,

126
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,620
but since you said it yourself,

127
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,580
I'll deduct your salary for a month.

128
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,440
Tell the HR Department yourself.

129
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,680
Boss, you are wise.

130
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,230
It is here.

131
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,210
Mian, you are here. Please come in.

132
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,640
Miss, let me take the stuff for you.

133
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,950
You're welcome to come...

134
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,130
I know what you're going to say.

135
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,330
You're welcome to come here. Why bring gifts?

136
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,450
He's a kid.

137
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,850
You will spoil him.

138
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,630
But, Daddy, I'm a cute kid.

139
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,810
Everyone will definitely dote on me.

140
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,490
Don't say that next time.

141
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,130
Got it.

142
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,520
This is Mr. Liu.

143
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,020
Mrs. Liu's husband.

144
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,670
He takes turns with Mrs. Liu to take care of Tangyuan.

145
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,710
He's really good at

146
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,520
organizing and cleaning.

147
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,120
A male live-in nanny?

148
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,470
Is there something wrong with having a male live-in nanny?

149
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,180
Oh.

150
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,230
That's fine.

151
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,490
A male mom.

152
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,590
Do you like putting sugar in tomato and egg stir-fry?

153
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,300
Put some sugar in, okay?

154
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,400
Please.

155
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,570
Okay.

156
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't like it.

157
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,450
Is anyone else coming?

158
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,060
No.

159
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,830
Tangyuan only invited you.

160
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,430
Maybe it's the cake delivery.

161
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,230
I'll go get it.

162
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,320
Ding.

163
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,550
Here comes the cake.

164
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,890
I ran into the delivery guy,

165
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,890
so I just took it.

166
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,630
Miss Song is here.

167
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,270
Good boy.

168
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,390
Mian, let’s go.

169
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,030
Is the cake here?

170
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,740
Yunkai.

171
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,150
We have guests.

172
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,050
Shouldn't you entertain them?

173
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,710
Mian, come to my room.

174
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,160
When Daddy and Uncle Liu cook,

175
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,260
there's a lot of smoke

176
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,990
that's not good for your skin.

177
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,270
Let's go.

178
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:08,850
Thank you.

179
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,110
Oh.

180
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,680
What is this?

181
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,030
This is interesting, too.

182
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,590
What a beautiful car!

183
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,220
This is so pretty.

184
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,440
Miss Song, why didn't you wait for Mian to finish before you looked?

185
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,110
What should we do?

186
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,380
Daddy will cry.

187
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,400
Don't cry.

188
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,210
I'll buy you a better one, okay?

189
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,320
This was made by my mom before.

190
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,510
We can't buy it now.

191
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,500
Could you go get the broom

192
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,910
and clean this up?

193
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,270
Why?

194
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,610
Why?

195
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,640
Why should you,

196
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,670
as an adult,

197
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,300
say "Why" with an old face in front of a kid?

198
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,070
What are you talking about? I'm not old.

199
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,930
Tangyuan always calls me Sister.

200
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,710
He calls others Auntie.

201
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,750
It means I'm younger than all of you.

202
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,220
So you are a junior here.

203
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,070
Be good.

204
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,660
Go.

205
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,620
Go.

206
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,580
Go.

207
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,240
Sister?

208
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,430
Auntie?

209
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,250
Junior?

210
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,240
So, am I the one who's junior to Yunkai now?

211
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,890
You cunning and deceitful woman.

212
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,430
This must be

213
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,790
very important to you.

214
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,750
It's my fault.

215
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,350
I didn't protect it well.

216
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,220
Although the toy is broken,

217
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,350
your mom's love for you won't break.

218
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,470
So many people love you.

219
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,430
Don't be sad anymore.

220
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,470
When I see you sad,

221
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,860
I feel sad too.

222
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,490
Can you tell me how to make you happy?

223
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,720
Mian, don’t be sad.

224
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,540
Daddy bought a lot.

225
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,130
There are 500 more.

226
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,790
I pretended to be sad because I didn't want

227
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,570
Miss Song to bully you.

228
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,330
I wasn't honest.

229
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,490
Will you still like me in the future?

230
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,750
Thank you.

231
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,850
I think when designing baby toys,

232
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,740
the first thing to consider should be the user experience

233
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,540
of the babies, who are the users.

234
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,790
Many hanging toys on the market

235
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,830
are designed in an upright posture.

236
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,770
But for babies lying in bed,

237
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,620
all they see are animal bottoms

238
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,350
that look pretty much the same.

239
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,770
So this time, I designed them in an inverted posture.

240
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,950
So this design

241
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,100
was approved at the conference and put into production.

242
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,660
That was the first time I had a topic selected

243
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,720
from my design draft at the Dreams Chasing Toy meeting.

244
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,630
Did Lu Yunkai

245
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,020
hoard so many?

246
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,640
Be gentle.

247
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,040
Junior.

248
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,670
Alright, Miss Song is done.

249
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,770
Let's play hide-and-seek.

250
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,780
Mian and I will hide first.

251
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,870
Miss Song, close your eyes.

252
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,240
Come to us when you count to ten.

253
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,230
One, two, three.

254
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,230
I'm coming out.

255
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,670
Hush.

256
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
We were playing hide-and-seek.

257
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,660
He got up at 5 a.m.

258
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,910
He kept saying that he needed to wait for you.

259
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,290
Now he's tired from all the fuss.

260
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,060
Why didn't you cover him with a small blanket?

261
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,240
Sleeping like this is prone to catching a cold.

262
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,870
The sunlight is particularly good today.

263
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,130
The nanny took the quilt out to sunbathe.

264
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,450
He has his favorite little blanket.

265
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,250
It probably got left in the study

266
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,790
when he was staying with me yesterday.

267
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,790
I'll go get it now.

268
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,050
Wait.

269
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,870
Should I go?

270
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,270
You should keep an eye on the pot.

271
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,760
Oh, I almost forgot.

272
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,300
It's the first room on the left upstairs.

273
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,420
Thank you.

274
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,990
This is a good opportunity.

275
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,650
I'll take a look to see if there are any patents for the toy factory.

276
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,270
He installed a camera.

277
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,040
So he was waiting for me to do something.

278
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,920
It's already past the time limit.

279
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,280
Come out.

280
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,030
I give up.

281
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,990
Excuse me.

282
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,710
Is anyone there?

283
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,300
Is anyone there?

284
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,260
It's time for dinner.

285
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,240
Let's eat first.

286
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,800
When Tangyuan wakes up,

287
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,260
we'll cut the cake for him.

288
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,660
I heard Director Helsin's first move

289
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,370
was quite bold.

290
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,680
You promised to invite "Rimu Tuyuan"

291
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,599
to give the manufacturers a free trial broadcast.

292
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,329
The date seems not too far away.

293
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,680
Is there any progress?

294
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,210
I hope you won't get so worked up.

295
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,410
Didn't expect I'd be so well-known.

296
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,180
Don't worry. I'll work hard.

297
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,040
Isn't it 8:30 tomorrow night?

298
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,400
There's still time.

299
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,530
Indeed.

300
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,359
Today's only

301
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,000
Saturday.

302
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,670
There's still a bit more than a day left.

303
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,620
Such large fonts, huh?

304
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,450
The last time I saw this

305
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,600
was on my great-grandmother's phone.

306
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,960
You're so young...

307
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,460
I'm really looking forward

308
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,520
to tomorrow night's live broadcast.

309
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,030
I'll definitely go to support you at Wuxin.

310
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,620
It's delicious.

311
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,730
I can't wait to see you embarrass yourself live.

312
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,270
It's almost time for the live stream.

313
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,510
Why isn't she here yet?

314
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,040
I don't believe she can invite "Rimu Tuyuan."

315
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm here as promised to cheer you on.

316
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,090
Do your best.

317
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,650
But it feels like I can't cheer you up as quickly

318
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,900
as you can deflate yourself.

319
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,470
Shush.

320
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,780
What are you doing?

321
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,540
It's 7:50.

322
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,520
I have to go.

323
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,270
Talk to you later.

324
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,710
Be good.

325
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,850
Evil woman.

326
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,770
Wow, she's going live by herself?

327
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,920
Yeah.

328
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,350
Hello, babies!

329
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,190
Today, we're going to make

330
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,090
two new styles of plush flowers.

331
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,120
Some fans messaged me

332
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,370
saying their grandmas go out to set up stalls

333
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,470
but don't know what new styles to make.

334
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,990
So today, we'll replicate

335
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,510
the classic patterns from the Jiasheng Group.

336
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,840
Madam Tuyuan is online.

337
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,000
Really?

338
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,430
How did this happen?

339
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,410
Isn't she just a newly appointed executive?

340
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,180
Right.

341
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,490
I can't believe it.

342
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,400
How could this evil woman...

343
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,920
How could she be Rimu Tuyuan?

344
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,260
So this is Jiasheng Group's logo.

345
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,910
Okay, it's done.

346
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,090
That's it for today's livestream.

347
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,850
See you next time. Good night.

348
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,280
Today's live stream

349
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,400
is very successful.

350
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,070
Thank you, everyone.

351
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,550
When you leave work later,

352
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,030
remember to clock out on time.

353
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,590
HR will distribute benefits to everyone

354
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,770
and add them to your salaries.

355
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,660
Thank you, Boss.

356
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,920
Mr. Lu, I'm leaving too.

357
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,370
Is there something you need from me?

358
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,780
I have nothing to say to you.

359
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,250
The first time we met,

360
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,380
I told you

361
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,990
my hands were pretty.

362
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,250
Are you not crazy?

363
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,600
It's only been a few days since she was appointed as PR director.

364
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,240
And now she's directly promoted to vice president

365
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,390
and head of operations.

366
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,490
You said that

367
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,160
a company like Wuxin couldn't handle

368
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,220
the Jiasheng case.

369
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,660
But she did it.

370
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,850
Apart from her work ability,

371
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,050
some of her details

372
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,840
really resemble Mian.

373
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
You know why I founded Wuxin.

374
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
It was to find her.

375
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,120
The relationship between her and Mike

376
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
is still unclear.

377
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,320
What are you imagining?

378
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,000
All right.

379
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,700
Calm down, come on.

380
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,820
Tch.

381
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,850
It's time to work.

382
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,350
Good morning.

383
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,120
Wenting.

384
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,790
I had hoped you would be

385
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,470
promoted to head of marketing this year.

386
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,650
Now, whether you get promoted or not,

387
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,310
you're still under her thumb.

388
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,930
What are you aiming for?

389
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,310
Are you okay with that?

390
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,470
It's Tingwen.

391
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,480
Jiang Tingwen.

392
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,160
You always call me wrong.

393
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,840
But

394
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,440
Mr. Lu must have his own reason.

395
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,470
After all, he's Mr. Lu.

396
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,040
What reasons could he possibly have?

397
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,090
She gets promoted two levels out of nowhere.

398
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Could they not have any connection?

399
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,450
Do you believe it?

400
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,520
Pang.

401
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,520
Come in.

402
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:54,690
Mr. Lu.

403
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,580
What's wrong?

404
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,460
Ask Ms. Lin, head of HR,

405
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,760
to arrange a team-building activity as soon as possible.

406
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,190
Is it to integrate the new VP

407
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,500
with everyone?

408
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,360
Okay, got it.

409
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,190
No problem.

410
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,850
I'll arrange it right away.

411
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,070
Come in.

412
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,840
Vice President,

413
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,440
this is the team-building plan for this weekend.

414
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,700
If there's no problem,

415
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,530
I'll send out the notification this afternoon.

416
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,340
Team-building this weekend?

417
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,940
Doesn't that mean I can't sleep in again?

418
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,290
No way.

419
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,150
Are there still people who don't know team-building is just a waste of time?

420
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,010
The team can't be built like this.

421
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,540
With the budget,

422
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,980
why don't they just give me the money?

423
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,980
Then I'll be more motivated to work.

424
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,920
Ms. Lin never allows leave for team building every time.

425
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,860
I already promised to take my son to the water park this weekend.

426
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,660
This weekend?

427
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,340
What team building?

428
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,590
Isn't that statutory rest time?

429
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,230
If we must do team-building,

430
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,900
let's choose a workday.

431
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,550
Oh, right.

432
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,750
Don't arrange those

433
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,700
so-called "character-building" activities that involve sweating and hardship,

434
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,940
or those activities

435
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,150
where we have to play games with the unfamilar opposite sex.

436
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,010
Just eating and sleeping is fine.

437
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,710
Who is it?

438
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,980
Who is eavesdropping on my thoughts?

439
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,180
She understands us, the proletarians, so well.

440
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,460
She stood up for us like this.

441
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,320
I love her.

442
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,970
Vice President.

443
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,150
You just came.

444
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,950
You may not be familiar with the situation.

445
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,910
This has never happened in our company.

446
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,220
I believe this has never happened in the industry.

447
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,970
Team building is the employee benefit.

448
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,780
How can it delay normal work?

449
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,490
Is working overtime on weekends a benefit?

450
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,430
If you are willing,

451
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,360
I can arrange it for you every week.

452
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,570
That's my opinion on team-building.

453
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,480
If there's nothing else, let's leave it at that.

454
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,650
Your suggestion is very considerate.

455
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,710
But I'm afraid it'll be difficult to execute it.

456
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,070
But I'll try my best

457
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,640
to provide feedback to Mr. Lu.

458
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Then I'll announce the final results

459
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,100
in the company group chat.

460
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,310
Team-building on workdays?

461
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,280
Dream on.

462
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,590
So you can't decide.

463
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,430
I thought you were asking for my opinion

464
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,770
because you had decision-making authority.

465
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,330
Alright then.

466
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,860
Just pass these opinions on

467
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,060
to Mr. Lu.

468
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,940
Assistant Pang.

469
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,240
Have you ever heard of something like this?

470
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,460
She's only been here for a few days.

471
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,010
Team-building on workdays?

472
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,820
Have you ever seen a company do team-building on workdays?

473
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,020
-We never...
-Pang.

474
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,230
What's going on?

475
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,440
Hey, Mr. Lu.

476
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,440
Ms. Lin.

477
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,560
Don't be angry.

478
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,080
Well,

479
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,810
I'll tell Mr. Lu about this.

480
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,230
Go back to work for now.

481
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,790
Make sure to talk to Mr. Lu about this.

482
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,520
Don't worry.

483
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,710
Don't be angry.

484
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,510
Did she say that?

485
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,540
Absolutely.

486
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,260
Is Ms. Lin always this bossy?

487
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,080
Ah?

488
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,070
That's good then.

489
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,600
-You got the point wrong.
-With her speech...

490
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,620
She's already

491
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,940
achieved familiarity and harmony within the team,

492
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,100
hasn't she?

493
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,580
Tell the Administrative Personnel Department

494
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,830
that everything should be done

495
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,360
according to what she said.

496
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,400
Oh, I see.

497
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,980
Did Mr. Lu really say that?

498
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,420
His attitude was clear.

499
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,030
Ms. Lin, let me give you some advice.

500
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,110
Avoid her from now on.

501
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,070
Assistant Pang. Thank you for reminding me.

502
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
There's no one here.

503
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,560
Good chance.

504
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,970
Jiang Fei and Lu Yunkai are cousins.

505
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,470
So, keep an eye on Jiang Fei for me.

506
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,040
It's not in the photo bank.

507
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,080
Would there be a copy of the patent certificate in the scanned documents?

508
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,620
What are you doing?
