[Episode 13]

4
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,630
Mr. Jiang.

5
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,650
Please.

6
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,470
I believe you can tell it too.

7
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,110
I've been

8
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,470
delegating my power recently.

9
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,990
I want to leave my family

10
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,650
and establish my own design brand

11
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,620
like Lu Yunkai did.

12
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,229
So I started to collaborate with him long ago.

13
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,960
I asked him to expand his design business at Wuxin

14
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,950
and increase the number of design workshops for fashion brands.

15
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,340
The business I asked him to develop

16
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,140
is getting more and more mature.

17
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,830
So,

18
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,410
I'm planning

19
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,250
to leave Dreams Chasing Toy.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,440
I see.

21
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,640
No wonder Mian complained to me a lot.

22
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,800
She said that to her surprise, Wuxin, a big video platform,

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,860
started to develop design business.

24
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,730
I wanted to do those things

25
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,670
because

26
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,290
I felt freer when I was alone.

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,720
But now,

28
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,110
I'm doing those things

29
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,380
because I don't want the person I love to join that family.

30
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,000
Now I have someone I want to protect.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,940
So

32
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,610
I can now understand why Lu Yunkai did those things.

33
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,030
So,

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,530
you know the person I want to protect, right?

35
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,350
Mr. Jiang.

36
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,870
What did you just say?

37
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,329
I didn't hear you clearly.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,230
Well.

39
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,100
Nothing.

40
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,930
Young people nowadays like freedom.

41
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,550
Being born in a rich family like yours

42
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,680
is a mixed blessing.

43
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,090
Others want to be a member of a rich family.

44
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,220
But you just want to leave your family.

45
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,430
Dreams Chasing Toy has always been

46
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,170
the largest toy manufacturer in our province.

47
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,570
It monopolized the market for a long time.

48
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,190
You have the courage to make it stop monopolizing the market.

49
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,790
I really admire you for that.

50
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,690
You've been in contact with

51
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,000
several designers with great potential at the company recently.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,260
Are you planning to let them work for you at the new company?

53
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,430
If so, please take me to the company too.

54
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,940
You may rest assured.

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,660
I may forget to take someone else to the new company.

56
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
I'll never forget to take you there.

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,480
I should tell Mian about this right now.

58
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,610
Lu Yunkai.

59
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,079
You were in hospital for one day and you got discharged from the hospital.

60
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,079
You pretended to be so ill that you had to stay in an ICU.

61
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,420
I must do serious harm to Wuxin.

62
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,490
Where's Mr. Lu?

63
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,750
Vice President.

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,589
Mr. Lu

65
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,520
has been asked to be questioned by the authorities.

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,920
Because of

67
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,550
today's punishment notice?

68
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,090
Our company was criticized by the authorities.

69
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,620
Wuxin has now been

70
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,430
put on the blacklist of non-compliant platforms.

71
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,280
Right now, the image of company

72
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
has been damaged.

73
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,020
Let the PR Department do something to improve our company's image.

74
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,250
We need to do a full self-check on our platform.

75
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,720
Yes.

76
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,470
This has never happened

77
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,150
to our company.

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,180
How come a group of new KOLs suddenly joined our platform

79
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,710
and began to deliver inappropriate content?

80
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,540
And then our platform was reported to the authorities.

81
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,200
Everything happened so fast.

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,480
It's not like anything that has ever happened before.

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,030
In the past, users reported the inappropriate content to the platform.

84
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,090
And the cases will be handled by our internal reviewers.

85
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,110
So much inappropriate content showed on our platform.

86
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,250
And our internal review system didn't react to it.

87
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,510
It shows that our internal system has flaws.

88
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,790
We need to first find the employees who should be held accountable for this.

89
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,430
See if there're any enemies hidden at our company.

90
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,070
Yes.

91
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,090
Do you think

92
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,270
Original or some other rival company of ours

93
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,720
did it?

94
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,310
Recently, the data of our platform have been good.

95
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,310
Those from other companies got envious so they did it?

96
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,870
This is a big incident.

97
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,820
Our rival companies will also be investigated at once.

98
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,680
I don't think they dared to make this happen so blatantly.

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,330
Ms. Zhou.

100
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,310
Actually,

101
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,500
even if they did it,

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,290
they must have done it secretly

103
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,690
and no one can find out who did it exactly.

104
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,390
Forget about that.

105
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,620
Investigate those IP addresses.

106
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,900
If you find any clues,

107
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,870
let me know first.

108
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,430
Got it.

109
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,320
I'm going to pick up Mr. Lu.

110
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,380
You go back to work.

111
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
See you, Ms. Zhou.

112
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,330
Vice President

113
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,340
can also be a good leader for me.

114
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,330
They do look good together.

115
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,030
Boss.

116
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,230
You should be finishing your design drafts at home.

117
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,160
Why are you here?

118
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,270
I brought my draft for you

119
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,310
and hope you can see it and give me some advice.

120
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,160
On my way here

121
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,150
I got this.

122
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,230
[Termination Agreement]

123
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,970
Jiasheng Group will terminate the contract with us?

124
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,470
But the collaboration between us and them has always been good.

125
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,390
And I remember

126
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,570
two days ago, they said they would

127
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,030
extend the contract with us for the second half of this year.

128
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,630
Why did they suddenly want to terminate the contract with us?

129
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,450
I asked those in the department who have been communicating with those from Jiasheng Group.

130
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,450
It can be said that

131
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,860
this termination letter came without any signs.

132
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,390
Bad things keep happening.

133
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,630
Someone is making trouble for us.

134
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,880
Ask the Administrative Department to book a plane ticket for me.

135
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,010
I'm going to Jiasheng Group tomorrow.

136
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,710
It seems the long trip has made you tired.

137
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,510
You came here

138
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,970
once you got off the plane?

139
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:09,920
It seems

140
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,140
you're very anxious.

141
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,600
You terminated the contract without telling us a reason.

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,110
Of course I'm very anxious.

143
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,630
But I should thank you

144
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,900
for seeing me here.

145
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,540
It's my personal choice to see you here.

146
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,610
It has nothing to do with the company's attitude.

147
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,670
I'll be frank then.

148
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,020
Is it possible

149
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,840
to get your company not to terminate the contract with us?

150
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,110
Terminating the contract with your company

151
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,909
is a decision made by my company.

152
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,490
I

153
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,750
cannot change anything.

154
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,650
Even you can do nothing about it.

155
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,550
Now I'm more curious

156
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,960
who is so powerful and important

157
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,710
that they can persuade the president

158
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,990
of Jiasheng Group

159
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,909
to make things difficult for a nobody like me

160
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,510
just to get a small order.

161
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,430
Thank you for coming here.

162
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,730
You brought so much luggage with you.

163
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,880
I'm afraid

164
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,350
that you don't need to stay here for long

165
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,840
and that you'll have to go back without getting anything done.

166
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,040
It's not my luggage.

167
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,950
In the suitcase are some gifts I brought you.

168
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,830
Gifts for me?

169
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,600
You were satisfied with my work last time,

170
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,160
so I brought you a new set of New Year wood-block print.

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
There are also two clay tigers

172
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,530
which are made of the clay from Wanquangou in Shaanxi.

173
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,050
I know your hometown is far away.

174
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,580
You can put them on the table

175
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,200
and they'll remind you of your hometown.

176
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,140
I feel sorry for you.

177
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,510
Let me

178
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,320
tell you the truth.

179
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,280
Mr. Song

180
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,320
called my father-in-law.

181
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,870
We can't

182
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,220
refuse him.

183
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,880
He asked us

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,720
to let Original

185
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,950
do the post-production publicity work

186
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,650
for us.

187
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,010
Song Bingzhu?

188
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,200
He was smiling at me

189
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,560
when he saw me last time.

190
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,430
Why would he do those things behind my back?

191
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,710
Is he a two-faced man?

192
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,670
The toy factory we investigated last time

193
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,370
was built by Song Bingzhu.

194
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,350
The ownership of the factory was given to a company owned by him.

195
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,150
We just found this information.

196
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,100
Interesting.

197
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,260
[Songshi Group]

198
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,120
Please.

199
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,310
Is the guest a friend of Christine's?

200
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,070
Yes.

201
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,990
Otherwise, I wouldn't have allowed him to meet you.

202
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,440
Why did he come?

203
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,030
He said he wanted to discuss future collaborations with you.

204
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,780
But he didn't tell me the details.

205
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,980
He just said he wanted to meet you first.

206
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,030
Okay.

207
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,290
Please.

208
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,800
Nice to meet you.

209
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,990
Nice to meet you too.

210
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,830
Welcome.

211
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,160
Please have a seat.

212
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,650
Since you're

213
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,870
Christine's friend,

214
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,150
let's

215
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,230
cut to the chase.

216
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,750
Recently,

217
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,550
I've been preparing

218
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,670
for a show under the theme Jurassic Period and Geometry.

219
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,730
Our chief designer

220
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,140
accidentally found a picture of this toy.

221
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,950
We think this toy is aligned with the theme.

222
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,750
So we want to make an ornament according to the toy.

223
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,270
It took us a long time

224
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,850
to find out that a subsidiary of Songshi Group

225
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,080
once sold this toy.

226
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,850
I wonder if you can

227
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,280
provide us with a small batch of these toys.

228
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,020
Actually,

229
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,270
Songshi Group

230
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,080
developed toy business

231
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,730
many years ago.

232
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,030
But the group stopped doing that long ago.

233
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,830
The toy business was never an important business unit for the group.

234
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,680
It's been so many years.

235
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,250
I'm sorry we can't help you with that.

236
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,310
That's too bad.

237
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,130
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,630
Bye.

239
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,840
How come

240
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,910
someone mentioned that toy?

241
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,440
I guess it was just a coincidence.

242
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,240
The news online was all deleted.

243
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,930
If we search on the Internet now,

244
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,260
we won't find anything.

245
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,220
You know I don't want anyone to mention

246
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,850
the toy business Songshi Group did in the past.

247
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,110
Hello.

248
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,640
Is this the meeting room?

249
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,950
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,770
I left my phone here.

251
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,340
I found it.

252
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,280
The news online was all deleted.

253
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,880
If we search on the Internet now,

254
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,210
we won't find anything.

255
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,310
You know I don't want anyone to mention

256
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,170
the toy business that Songshi Group did in the past.

257
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,800
We were right. He really did that.

258
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,110
My father's patent toys that suddenly disappeared

259
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,290
were indeed

260
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,790
sold by the Songshi Group.

261
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
They even got two companies to do it.

262
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,730
By doing so, they managed to hide everything from others.

263
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,760
Song Bingzhu knows everything.

264
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,220
No wonder he's been making trouble for Wuxin.

265
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,410
I was so smart

266
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,390
that I managed to discover his secrets so fast.

267
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,610
Sister, you should give me a reward for that.

268
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,490
Don't twist your waist

269
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,780
while you're talking.

270
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
It's already dark.

271
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,590
Why are you wearing sunglasses in the room?

272
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,250
You don't look like a good guy.

273
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,710
This is a stereotype.

274
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,950
I'm not like you.

275
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm very famous.

276
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,080
I wear sunglasses to have more privacy.

277
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,880
Is there anything wrong with it?

278
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,270
Stop wasting your time quarreling with me.

279
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,100
Continue to finish your design drafts. Be quick.

280
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,050
Are you really going to

281
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,300
only exhibit your old designs at the exhibition

282
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,540
for the next quarter?

283
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,750
Old designs?

284
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,170
Enough.

285
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,290
Enough, you two.

286
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,390
Stop it.

287
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,350
Sister.

288
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,590
You're going to organize an exhibition for Xin.

289
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,710
Your beloved Mr. Chi wants it too.

290
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,800
Do you have enough designs?

291
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,820
Of course he doesn't.

292
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,350
He has only several designs.

293
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,370
I'm too stupid.

294
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,090
I only show up in public every day

295
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,710
and do things for Sister.

296
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,790
I was so busy

297
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,870
that I didn't have time to finish design drafts.

298
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,010
Sister, if you dislike me now,

299
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,470
I'll stay away from you from now on.

300
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,310
It's okay.

301
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,630
Don't be sad.

302
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,790
You'll have many of your own designs in the future.

303
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,320
By then, I'll organize an exhibition for you.

304
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,670
How is your work in preparing the designs for the next season?

305
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,910
Although you made me

306
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,370
do all the work,

307
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,140
and I had to prepare all the new designs for the next season,

308
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,940
I've never complained about it.

309
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,670
It's all done.

310
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,490
I ensured that all the work was being properly done in the studio,

311
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,820
before I came to see you.

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We've also done a lot of work.

313
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,470
All right.

314
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,110
You, stop

315
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,050
talking.

316
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,590
Hello.

317
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,170
Mian.

318
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,360
I heard you had a business trip today.

319
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,990
Are you back?

320
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,330
Yes.

321
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,340
I'm back.

322
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,550
Sister.

323
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,310
Who are you talking to?

324
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,300
Have you finished your work?

325
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,150
Yes.

326
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,230
I've finished my work.

327
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,390
I'm going home now.

328
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,820
You should go home too.

329
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,470
Okay.

330
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,840
Sister.

331
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,950
It's so late.

332
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,740
How could he ask you to go home alone?

333
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,870
If I were your boyfriend,

334
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,650
I would come and pick you up.

335
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,290
Being Sister's boyfriend

336
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,990
is such a great pleasure.

337
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,670
If I were Sister's boyfriend,

338
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,270
I would definitely cherish Sister

339
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,200
because Sister is such a good girl.

340
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,150
Where are you?

341
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,350
I'll come and pick you up right away.

342
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,210
I'm at home.

343
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,430
Okay.

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,660
Sister.

345
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,240
Which room will you let me sleep in?

346
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,330
I want you to live in a hotel.

347
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,310
What?

348
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,350
No.

349
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,040
For one thing,

350
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,910
you have to avoid contact with us

351
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,150
so that people won't suspect you.

352
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,910
For another thing...

353
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,510
For another thing, you'll make it more difficult for me to finish my design drafts.

354
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,390
No.

355
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,080
I can't believe it.

356
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,170
I will throw all of you to a lonely island.

357
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,950
Sister...

358
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,079
You must have been out for too long.

359
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,730
That's why you don't know what's happening between Boss and him.

360
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,680
I got to know everything from their conversation on the phone just now.

361
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,080
I know what is happening.

362
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,030
She refused him. He chased her.

363
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,710
She got caught by him.

364
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,120
The same old story.

365
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,640
Give it to me.

366
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,750
Tong Wan.

367
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,390
Tong Wan.

368
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,470
I saw you from afar just now.

369
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,190
You look amazing.

370
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,660
Why are you so beautiful?

371
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,380
It's mainly because

372
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,250
I got an expensive hyaluronic acid injection last weekend.

373
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,040
You're prettier than me and you spent more money making yourself prettier than me.

374
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,310
I'll do it too.

375
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,120
I'll get an expensive hyaluronic acid injection this weekend.

376
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,410
You don't have to.

377
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,330
Because I'm too young for it?

378
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,470
Because your salary isn't high enough.

379
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,260
You'd better save the money and use it to buy your favorite food.

380
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,720
Tell me.

381
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,280
What's the matter?

382
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,910
Well.

383
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,190
I just want to tell you

384
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,100
you're so beautiful.

385
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,110
Three.

386
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,910
Two.

387
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,020
I do need you to do me a favor.

388
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,630
I just found that

389
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,350
in the document I had submitted to Ms. Jiang this morning,

390
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,090
there was a wrong figure.

391
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,910
Tong Wan.

392
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,860
Can you get that document

393
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,450
back for me?

394
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,720
He's been at the company all day.

395
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,120
He should be checking those documents now.

396
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,990
My dear friend.

397
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,540
My dear, dear friend.

398
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,690
No one can help me

399
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,570
but you now.

400
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,910
Under what illusion

401
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,470
do you think I can help you?

402
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,550
Others may not be able to help me.

403
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,420
But as long as you show up in his office,

404
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,220
Mr. Jiang will turn a blind eye to it.

405
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,620
Mr. Jiang is always strict.

406
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,870
I don't think he'll make an exception for me.

407
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,150
You're wrong.

408
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,890
Tong Wan, to be honest,

409
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,240
I think Mr. Jiang

410
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,830
doesn't like

411
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,030
anyone in this world.

412
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,550
He always has a cold expression on his face

413
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,880
when he is looking at us.

414
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
But when he is looking at you,

415
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,000
he's like this.

416
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,600
You must be special to Mr. Jiang.

417
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:37,710
Well.

418
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,880
I'll give it a try.

419
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,630
Please.

420
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,470
Thank you so much.

421
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,190
There's a wrong figure on this document.

422
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,390
Who took charge of it?

423
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,410
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

424
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,010
I didn't notice the mistake.

425
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,630
Did I put too much pressure on you?

426
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,310
Was the work too much for you?

427
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,060
I can get you an assistant.

428
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,630
If I need anything,

429
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,790
I'll tell you.

430
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,850
It seems

431
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,000
he treated me differently.

432
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,160
Hello, Boss.

433
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,470
I'm sorry, Boss.

434
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,150
Miss Tong.

435
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,290
I think you know very well

436
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,040
that the salary I give you is higher than the salary offered by any other company.

437
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,550
It is a very generous offer.

438
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,080
I give you such a high salary

439
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,410
because I think you deserve it.

440
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,740
But this time you were so unprofessional.

441
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,420
I think I should reconsider my decision to offer you such a high salary.

442
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,320
Boss, I promise

443
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,470
I will never

444
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,600
make the same mistake again.

445
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,000
Not just the same mistake.

446
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,070
I hope you'll not make

447
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,750
any mistakes in the future.

448
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,850
I don't know when it started.

449
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,730
But he's

450
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,120
different now.

451
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,350
Tong Wan.

452
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,630
Mr. Jiang.

453
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,930
What can I do for you?

454
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,890
I have a business dinner tonight.

455
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,810
Go with me.

456
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,630
You've just got the invitation?

457
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,290
Let me collect the information of the people who will attend the dinner.

458
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,140
Wait.

459
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,490
I saw this by chance.

460
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,870
I think it'll look good on you.

461
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,390
It'll match your black dress.

462
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:18,890
This...

463
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,810
This is so valuable.

464
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,530
Compared with jewelry, I think people are more valuable.

465
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,460
Besides,

466
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,300
I want you to wear it.

467
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,050
Well,

468
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,100
thank you.

469
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,340
Okay.

470
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,560
You had some difficulties doing your work?

471
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,720
Why are we at the karaoke bar?

472
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,550
I have a business party tonight.

473
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,600
So I took you here.

474
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,450
Maybe we can find something unexpected.

475
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,610
Mr. Lu, why are you always having fun?

476
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,470
Wuxin is your company, not mine.

477
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,880
But I work harder than you.

478
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,010
Not just my company.

479
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,740
My company is your company.

480
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,380
Remember?

481
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,630
You go in first.

482
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,350
Hello?

483
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,010
Oh.

484
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,390
Okay.

485
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,500
Well,

486
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,130
let's talk later.

487
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:43,930
Okay.

488
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,390
Mr. Lu, I finally see you.

489
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,010
I didn't see you last time.

490
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,440
Mr. Lu, long time no see.

491
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,340
I'm in a new movie.

492
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,840
Let's watch it together.

493
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,860
When will you have the time?

494
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,990
Mr. Lu, why are you avoiding me?

495
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,100
When will you have the time?

496
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,030
I want to ask you out some other day.

497
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,210
We know each other so well.

498
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,240
Mr. Lu, when will you have the time?

499
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,350
Mr. Lu.

500
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,990
How about we...

501
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,280
What are you talking about?

502
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,040
Why are you sitting between us?

503
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,970
Because there is no any other seat.

504
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,580
Aren't there seats over there?

505
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,440
You can sit over there if you like.

506
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,750
What's wrong with you?

507
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,360
I'm talking to Mr. Lu.

508
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,250
I started to talk to him first. I'm not finished.

509
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,650
You mean we have to take turns to talk to him?

510
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,750
You won't understand.

511
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,230
Go away.

512
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,310
I'm drinking with Mr. Lu. Leave us alone.

513
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,060
Oh.

514
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,300
So you are drinking together.

515
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,260
Well.

516
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,850
Let me propose a toast to you on behalf of Lu.

517
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,650
Don't drink on an empty stomach.

518
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,830
Well.

519
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,120
If she proposes a toast to me,

520
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,590
I have to drink.

521
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,710
I'm sorry.

522
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,760
She doesn't want to me drink too much.

523
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,070
If I drink too much,

524
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,820
she won't let me sleep with her.

525
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,240
Director Li, you know what I mean, right?

526
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,400
You...

527
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,120
You...

528
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,080
She's your girlfriend.

529
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,550
Well, not really.

530
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,470
We have a son.

531
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,550
All right.

532
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,720
She's gone.

533
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,390
We were lovey-dovey when she was here.

534
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,110
Now she's gone and you don't want us to be intimate again.

535
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,480
Mian, you are so cruel.

536
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,730
If I were cruel, I wouldn't have come to save you.

537
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,360
You are quite popular with women.

538
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,650
When I was not with you,

539
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,470
you were surrounded by so many beautiful girls.

540
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,240
I can imagine that during those years when I wasn't with you,

541
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,100
you must have dated a lot of women.

542
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,950
During the years when you weren't with me,

543
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,550
I never dated a single woman.

544
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,110
If I had to come to cocktail party like this,

545
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,280
I would take more than three men with me to protect me.

546
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,940
I let them drink and drive for me.

547
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,230
And I also let them stop those girls from going near me.

548
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,790
Really?

549
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,630
Of course.

550
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,440
You can search the local news if you don't believe me.

551
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,860
Because of this,

552
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,860
everyone said

553
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,530
I was gay.

554
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,790
Take the kiss as my apology

555
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,120
for what I said earlier.

556
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,230
After we go home,

557
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,950
I want you to make it up to me.

558
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,620
Let's go.

559
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,240
What are you doing?

560
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,560
Look over there.

561
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,180
They are over there.

562
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,600
So

563
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,740
you're not here to have fun.

564
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,900
You knew Mr. Song would come here today?

565
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,290
Yes.

566
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,370
My friend owns this place.

567
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,530
Many senior executives in the industry

568
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,730
come here for a party.

569
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,980
Mr. Song booked a seat here today.

570
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,640
So I came to see if I would be lucky to see him here.

571
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,020
Alright. Be good.

572
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,750
Do you have other plans?

573
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,920
I want to get closer to them.

574
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,170
When Mr. Song comes here to have a party,

575
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,400
he would let his assistant stand at the door.

576
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,990
It's impossible

577
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,830
to eavesdrop on them.

578
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,230
Are you okay, sir?

579
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,820
Do you need me to take you to the restroom?
