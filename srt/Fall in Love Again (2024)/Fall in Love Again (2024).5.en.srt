00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:08,950
Oh no.

5
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,930
I didn't even know that I was investigated thoroughly.

6
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,750
Lu Yunkai has started to suspect your identity.

7
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,910
He's going to use your sample

8
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,550
to do a paternity test

9
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,010
between you and Tangyuan.

10
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,620
That's what my current situation is like.

11
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,080
This is a huge loss for you.

12
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,229
It's quite hard to trick Lu Yunkai.

13
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,490
What should we do now?

14
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,280
Now the indication of the clue is a bit too obvious.

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,789
Only by taking the initiative

16
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,920
can we have a chance.

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,270
He just wants my blood sample, doesn't he?

18
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,330
I'll give it to him.

19
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,600
What about you?

20
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,830
Do you have any clues?

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,030
Did you see his personal mobile phone?

22
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,509
Yes.

23
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,210
You told me when he changed his mobile phone,

24
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,759
he had the habit of backing up the old information,

25
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,390
so I checked the content very carefully.

26
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,040
His photo albums, messages, emails,

27
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,710
and WeChat records in recent years

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,790
have all been scanned through code software.

29
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,720
There is no valuable information.

For the live stream event that will be held at the end of the Cultural Festival,

31
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,540
I've made two revised proposals again.

32
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,800
Let me show them to you.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Is it serious?

It's easy to hurt your fingers.

36
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,500
Let me check your finger.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,060
I'll go check my finger

38
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,660
and treat the wound.

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,600
Please read the proposals first.

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,060
Let's discuss them later.

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,380
Xin, prepare a Type-B blood sample.

42
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,920
When the test proves that

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,380
there is no kinship between Tangyuan and me,

44
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,270
I think his suspicion of me will be cleared.

45
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,920
The material of that workbench won't pollute the blood.

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,050
He'll think that the blood sample can be used on the test.

47
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,400
The person whom Jiang Fei asked to get the blood sample has already gone there.

48
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,320
That person came into

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,930
Lu Yunkai's office and then left.

50
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,790
I saw him carrying a professional storage box.

51
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,750
I think he was the man who came to collect the sample for the test.

52
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,150
You can rest assured now.

53
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,320

We haven't seen each other for just a period of time, and I didn't expect that

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,470
your rank would be one level higher again.

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,530
Congratulations.

After the Love Enjoying Funds held the charity dinner,

63
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,900
they also planned a series of events.

Next month, the event, whose theme is "Caring for Deaf and Dumb People",

65

Why haven't you responded yet?

69
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,310
As the person in charge of the event, you shouldn't be so arrogant.

If you really don't have any good ideas,

71
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,390
you can ask your subordinates for some advice.

The charity dinner you mentioned

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,890
was the one

76
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,270
where some little fans

77
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,330
took photos of my manuscript, right?

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,110
As you know,

79
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,270
I'm a busy woman, and I haven't had time

80
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,910
to plan the subsequent activities.

81
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,710
But as for you,

82
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,990
you came here personally because of this trivial matter.

83
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,960
How idle you are.

84
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,550
Many people

85
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,790
want to cooperate with the Love Enjoying Funds.

86
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,530
If Yunkai

87
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,460
had not wanted to develop the design section,

88
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,070
and I had not specially helped him get the chance,

89
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,870
Wuxin wouldn't even have had the right to get the invitation letter.

90
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,590
Since you're in charge of the outward service of the entire line,

91
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,670
you had better not become a hindrance to him.

92
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,220
How can such a valuable opportunity

93
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,100

Couldn't you wait until I talked back to her before you interrupted?

101
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,230
Because of you, I had one less chance to talk.

102
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,430

186
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,990
have a drink?

187
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,510
He...

188
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
must have had a drink.

189
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,140
It's fine now.

190
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,990
There is no danger now.

191
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Mian.

192
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,750
Do you know how hard it has been for me

193
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,120
to take care of our child alone all these years?

194
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,130
I've been looking for you everywhere,

195
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,470
and I've suffered a lot.

196
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,330
Besides, many other people

197
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,210
suddenly appeared in front of me.

198
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,110
But I behaved very well every time.

199
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,910
I didn't...

200
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,710
I didn't like them at all.

201
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,070
I'm sorry, Mian.

202
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,350
I know it was all my fault.

203
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,010
However,

204
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,990
why didn't you come to me after you came back?

205
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,670
You can beat me or scold me.

206
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,730
I have a lot to tell you.

207
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
You promised me that

208
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,830
we would raise our child together, didn't you?

209
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,710
You're just a liar.

210
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,070
You're just a big liar.

211
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,040
-Can you get off me first?
-No!

212
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,210
I won't do that!

213
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,110
Get off me!

214
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,970
I won't do that!

215
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,630
Is he

216
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,670
trying to act like a cute boy?

217
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,800
A well-behaved and pitiful

218
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,810
single father like this

219
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,700
isn't consistent with his image.

220
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,430
Now you know why he hardly has a drink, don't you?

221
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,070
Because he'll become like this after he has a drink.

222
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,390
Then he'll forget everything the next day.

223
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:05,910
Well,

224
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,810
what should we do with him now?

225
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,950
What should we do?

226
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,070
After he shouts for a while, he'll be quiet.

227
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,190
After he gets quiet,

228
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,590
let's throw him outside.

229
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,910
He looked like a gentleman before he had a drink,

230
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,590
but he's such a crying baby after having a drink.

231
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,150
Wait a moment.

232
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:18,560
Hmm.

233
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,670
Mian, I'm sorry.

234
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,040
Mian.

235
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,720
How come you're saying it so sincerely?

236
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,230
Did I misunderstand you?

237
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,180
But you were also the one

238
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,880
who hid the truth from me,

239
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,300
lied to me and hurt me.

240
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,840
Mian.

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,930
Just sleep here.

242
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,770
It's quite comfortable.

243
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,480
I'll get going then.

244
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,070
Okay.

245
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,110
Be careful.

246
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:04,740
Okay.

247
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,620
I will continue to keep an eye on Jiang Fei.

248
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,650
Mian.

249
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
That's not right.

250
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,840
Today, he specially came to me after he got drunk.

251
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,160
He was even so sure that I was Zhou Mian.

252
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,470
According to the blood sample he sent to the test center previously,

253
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,670
the conclusion shouldn't be like this.

254
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,440
Could it be that the blood sample he sent wasn't that one?

255
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,940
Then what did he send to the test center?

256
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll get going then.

257
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,300
Her hair...

258
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,480
What a good chance.

259
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,210
My soil!

260
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,230
I specially bought the soil from Wanquangou in Shaanxi

261
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,940
to use it to make clay figurines.

262
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,740
Why are you...

263
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,460
What is this?

264
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,700
Do you feel bored?

265
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,300
We're going to graduate soon.

266
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,320
When we get together again,

267
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,730
maybe not all the people can attend the gathering.

268
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,190
Therefore, the club invited everyone to go camping together.

269
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,530
Should I not have asked you to come?

270
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,770
It's okay to have asked me to come.

271
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,330
Didn't we agree that

272
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,360
I would go fishing with you?

273
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,470
Look.

274
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,750
I got a fish!

275
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,710
Am I good?

276
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,850
-Yes.
-Amazing!

277
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,470
Your eyes are amazing.

278
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,580
It's such a big fish.

279
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,180
Ordinary people wouldn't be able to notice it.

280
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,510
I think you're amazing.

281
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,950
At least, you're

282
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,780
the first one who got a fish here.

283
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,400
In order to reward you,

284
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,240
I'll give you

285
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,370
a pretty little stone.

286
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,040
Okay?

287
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,870
After graduation,

288
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,130
let's get married.

289
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,720
I was naive at that time.

290
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,460
As I thought that the man in front of me

291
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,790
was an ideal boyfriend,

292
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,980
I always put myself in a very low position.

293
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,310
As a result, in our relationship,

294
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,840
I had been dominated by him.

295
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,890
He never took me to see his family.

296
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,610
He never told me about his story, either.

297
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,690
But at that time,

298
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,870
I was in love with him for several hundred days,

299
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,740
and I already wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.

300
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,680
At the wedding,

301
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,580
when I found that

302
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,220
I didn't know this person well,

303
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,620
I suddenly realized that

304
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,080
maybe he didn't love me.

305
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,760
I was the one who had been staring at him affectionately.

306
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
I ignored his concealment and deception,

307
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,610
and I didn't notice

308
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,410
his ulterior motive at all.

309
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,530
My eyes.

310
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,170
It's so late.

311
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,270
[Pang]

312
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,160
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,420
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,030
However,

315
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,950
compared with mine,

316
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,750
your injury

317
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,920
is nothing, isn't it?

318
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,390
Hmm?

319
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,540
Look at you now.

320
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,650
I can't tell

321
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,400
which one is the real you.

322
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,050
You married me

323
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,300
in order to make your family angry, didn't you?

324
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,160
Our family's toy factory was also

325
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,120
pulled down violently by the men arranged by you.

326
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,280
Just get out.

327
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,460
Who let you in?

328
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,260
Get out!

329
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,990
Get out now!

330
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,340
What are you doing? Get out now!

331
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,710
Get out!

332
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,590
Help!

333
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,790
Help?

334
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,620
You're even screaming for help?

335
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,990
Wow.

336
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,340
As soon as I entered the house,

337
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,340
I saw that the living room was a mess,

338
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,490
so I came upstairs to check on you.

339
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,210
I didn't expect that...

340
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,120
Stop joking.

341
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,380
He was drunk and came to me.

342
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,300
He has been making a scene for the whole night.

343
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,280
Someone finally came to take away this annoying guy.

344
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,390
Hello, sir.

345
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,080
Do you know this gentleman?

346
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,270
I'm here for him.

347
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,070
That's great.

348
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,480
This gentleman mentioned his home address

349
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,400
in the car just now,

350
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,200
and then he fell asleep.

351
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,230
After we arrived, we knocked on the door, but no one opened the door.

352
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,950
We thought we had come to the wrong place.

353
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,510
It's okay.

354
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,770
Just entrust him to me.

355
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,840
Hey, hello.

356
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,440
Could you please tell me

357
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,920
who asked you to send him back home?

358
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,750
I'm sorry,

359
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,470
but we can't disclose our users' information.

360
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,520
The lady who placed the order

361
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,790
asked us to keep it a secret.

362
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,340
What?

363
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,390
A lady?

364
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,560
Thank you.

365
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,510
You're welcome.

366
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,230
For those toy patents of the Heshan Toy Factory

367
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,960
which you sent me,

368
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,000
I've checked them.

369
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,150
There was indeed a company which manufactured

370
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,350
a batch of similar products after the accident.

371
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,740
But then it stopped making these products for an unknown reason.

372
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,540
This is the factory I mentioned.

373
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,160
It shut down not long after it started making those products.

374
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,270
[Information of the Shuanghuan Toy Factory]

375
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,770
The investment company behind it

376
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,790
seems to have nothing to do with Lu Yunkai.

377
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,790
I still need to investigate the details about the corelation behind it.

378
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,000
The ultimate goal of the person who took the patents

379
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,270
must be possessing these patents.

380
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,930
Since they have copied the design and manufactured the products,

381
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,060
there must be some traces left by them.

382
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,350
You're amazing.

383
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,490
This is not your profession,

384
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,970
but you could still find so much information.

385
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,890
I'm flattered.

386
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,690
I hired someone to do it.

387
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,020
It cost me a lot of money.

388
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,870
You'll see it in the reimbursement report

389
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,130
at the end of the month.

390
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,890
Why are you in my house?

391
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,320
Why am I in your house?

392
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,870
Pang called me last night.

393
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,730
He said he couldn't get in touch with you,

394
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,990
so he asked me to come here to check on you.

395
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,320
Pang?

396
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,350
Last night...

397
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,020
I had a drink.

398
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,410
I can't remember what happened.

399
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,120
Speaking of yesterday,

400
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,180
it was quite funny.

401
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,670
Here you are.

402
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,140
By the way,

403
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,730
why did Pang want to contact me last night?

404
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,590
You're mentioned in the trending topic.

405
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,140
What?

406
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,640
You still made this mistake when people opposed such behavior.

407
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,370
Yesterday, several live streaming platforms

408
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,360
just announced a joint statement.

409
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,620
They advocated the new rules of civilization

410
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,160
and refused induced consumption.

411
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,960
Look at you.

412
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,480
What you did just became

413
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,940
the topic of their gossip.

414
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,220
A male boss

415
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,870
gave a large number of gifts to the female streamer who worked for him,

416
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,670
and even sent many love hearts in the comment zone.

417
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,450
Anyway, after this news was disclosed,

418
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,700
some people said that you set a bad example.

419
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,700
There were all kinds of harsh words.

420
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,200
The public opinion has also changed from

421
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,700
supporting the loving couple

422
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,250
to a bad impression now.

423
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,710
How did they know my account?

424
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,360
Oh, right.

425
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,240
During the Q&A section

426
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,510
in the Cultural Festival,

427
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,740
I once used this account.

428
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,580
Are you answering your own questions by yourself in front of me?

429
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,500
I think you should get sober at once.

430
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,950
The Marketing Department didn't get your instructions last night.

431
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,750
They could only try their best to maintain your image in a regular way

432
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,830
and control the comments.

433
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,070
After the news was widely spread, by this morning,

434
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,500
this matter has become quite serious.

435
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,570
Our opponent must have made a lot of efforts.

436
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,240
When Pang called me just now,

437
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,360
he almost cried as he was so anxious.

438
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,020
I transferred money to my wife

439
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,520
and gave her some gifts.

440
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,550
Why are they so concerned about that?

441
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,460
Yes.

442
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,900
You two are a perfect match.

443
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,630
Those evil people are not qualified to judge you.

444
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,220
Where did you get a wife?

445
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,390
The female streamer in yesterday's show was Helsin?

446
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,810
Yes.

447
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,680
You looked so concerned about it.

448
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,480
I thought you knew that already.

449
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,780
I was wondering why you got so drunk yesterday

450
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,570
as you hardly had a drink during these two years.

451
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,460
I told you

452
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,200
not to mistake her for Zhou Mian.

453
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,670
But you insisted on...

454
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,790
She is Zhou Mian.

455
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,890
The test report has come out.

456
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,260
She is my dear Mian.

457
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,940
She's really Zhou Mian?

458
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,410
Yeah.

459
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,010
Well...

460
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
During these several years, she...

461
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,300
Stop talking about that now.

462
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,500
Wash up at once.

463
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,520
There are still many things in the company which you need to handle.

464
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,320
I'm not going.

465
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,470
What?

466
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,350
You still have to go back to arrange the work, don't you?

467
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,790
No need to arrange the work.

468
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,190
Someone will arrange it for me.

469
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,370
Chief Editor Li, hello.

470
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,460
I'm really sorry.

471
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,650
Mr. Lu hasn't had any plans to be interviewed recently.

472
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,350
Boss.

473
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,100
If there are plans for that later,

474
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,050
-There have been new rules on the live streaming platform recently.
-we will inform you first by phone calls.

475
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,480
They forbid induced consumption.

476
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,670
But Mr. Lu gave you many gifts

477
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,870
in your live stream room.

478
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,530
Now the netizens all say that he's a bad example.

479
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,720
The Marketing Department hasn't received his instructions yet,

480
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,440
so we can only simply control the comments now.

481
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,550
That's about it.

482
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,980
When I came to the company this morning,

483
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,430
I found that everyone was busy dealing with this problem.

484
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,150
This is not okay.

485
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,510
We can't cover all the comments.

486
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,580
People are giving more and more bad comments on him.

487
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,260
The public opinions are quite unfriendly for us.

488
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,070
Contact the reputation marketing company we once cooperated with.

489
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,550
It's an urgent order

490
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,270
with additional amount.

491
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,830
Okay.

492
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,620
Well,

493
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,830
we also need the feedback online.

494
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,600
Check it again.

495
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,930
Then look at this again.

496
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,110
Pang said that

497
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,750
Mr. Lu hadn't given him any instructions yet.

498
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,910
In your opinion...

499
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,410
I need to make a call first.

500
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,860
Hi.

501
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,470
Mr. Li Hong.

502
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,000
Okay.

503
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,680
That's all for now.

504
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:53,620
Okay.

505
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,570
Everyone, put down your work first.

506
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,230
I'll rearrange the work.

507
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,860
Lu Wei, draft an announcement

508
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,230
and post it on Wuxin TV's social media account.

509
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,440
The content is roughly like...

510
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,030
Mr. Lu

511
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,120
has been helping with the original designers' career

512
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,350
continuously all these years.

513
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,990
Now he has implemented a maturer commercialization plan

514
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,790
by collaborating with famous brands to design products.

515
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,870
The streamer, Rimu Tuyuan, is the first case.

516
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,320
What Mr. Lu did last night

517
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,590
was just a warm-up for the collaboration.

518
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,830
It showed the sense of rituals for the launching of the commercial section.

519
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,430
In terms of the design cost, Wuxin won't get any commission.

520
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,030
All the income will be transferred to the personal designers' accounts.

521
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,960
We welcome more newcomers to join Wuxin's platform.

522
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:40,870
Okay.

523
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,840
Zhang Wei, design the logo for the commercial collaboration

524
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,520
of the supporting plan.

525
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,110
Just use that love heart emoji in the live stream room

526
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,190
and edit it simply.

527
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,350
Okay.

528
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,960
Besides, Rimu Tuyuan

529
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,030
will announce on her social media account that

530
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,270
all the rewards she received yesterday

531
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,850
have been donated to the old craftsmen in the mountain areas.

532
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,190
Make arrangements to repost the news through our official Weibo account.

533
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,520
This sounds too unreal.

534
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,530
It isn't the settlement period yet for calculating the rewards we received last night.

535
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,910
How did we withdraw the money?

536
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,630
How could it be fake if we really donated the money?

537
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,630
It doesn't matter whether it was prepaid or paid by us in advance.

538
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,150
We just need to let the public see that

539
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,620
the money which Mr. Lu has spent

540
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,970
is really used to help

541
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,870
the old craftsmanship that is not easy to inherit,

542
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,780
instead of a vague self-directed-and-acted show,

543
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,930
through which his money still stayed

544
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,120
on his own platform after he spent it.

545
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,370
Lu Wei, half an hour later,

546
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,410
the Tang suits sub-brand under the Jiasheng Group

547
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,370
will officially announce again its collaborative design product

548
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,190
with Rimu Tuyuan, the streamer of Wuxin TV.

549
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,550
You can make arrangements for that, too.

550
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:27,810
Okay.

551
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,830
Have you called them?

552
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,100
We haven't signed the contract with them yet.

553
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,270
What if something goes wrong again

554
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,150
after we make the official announcement?

555
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,230
Jia,

556
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,700
it'll be too late if we wait till we sign the contract with them.

557
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,270
We should make changes when the situation is urgent.

558
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,110
I'm just worried that the Jiasheng Group will break their promise of

559
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,820
launching collaborative products with an online streamer.

560
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,150
After all, the costumes industry belongs to the real economy.

561
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,750
Just mention that the designer will be Helsin.

562
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,390
They will be very happy.

563
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,960
What?

564
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,380
Let's talk about the gossip news later.

565
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,380
Okay, Boss. I'll complete the task.

566
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,830
Yi, finish the article as soon as possible.

567
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,010
When the article is published, it's required to post it on the first page

568
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,150
to make sure that the first and second tiers' media will repost the pictures.

569
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,590
After the news is widely spread,

570
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,430
we'll arrange a small group interview.

571
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,790
We can ask the Operations Director to talk in the interview

572
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,390
so as to crush those rumors.

573
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,140
Let me read the article first before the media publish it.

574
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,940
Okay, I'll finish the article as soon as possible.

575
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,470
Zhitao and Mei,

576
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,230
surf the Internet and select some netizens

577
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,600
who gave very bad comments.

578
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,080
Then compile a list of their user names

579
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,150
and user accounts in an Excel spreadsheet.

580
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,270
It's very sunny today.

581
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,160
Let's drag those stinky people who hide behind the computer out,

582
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,420
and put them under the sun.

583
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:27,990
Okay.

584
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,210
Alright.

585
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,200
You guys came here quite early, didn't you?

586
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,330
Don't be so nervous.

587
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,790
The longer the trending topic is hung there,

588
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,870
the better it is for us.

589
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,550
Who doesn't like free publicity?

590
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,850
Later, I'll ask Xin to buy some milk tea and snacks

591
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,890
for you all.

592
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,440
Just relax a bit, everyone.
