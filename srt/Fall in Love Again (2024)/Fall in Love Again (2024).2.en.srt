[Episode 2]

4
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,050
Why hasn't he opened the door yet?

5
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,570
Yunkai.

6
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,670
What are you doing?

7
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,729
What took you so long to open the door?

8
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,750
Is Tangyuan not here?

9
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,390
I bought his favorite picture books to see him.

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,630
If you came to see Tangyuan today,

11
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,140
I guess you'll have to come next time.

12
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,400
Liu sent him to school.

13
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,060
I knew he was not here.

14
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,670
I specially came at this hour

15
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,550
to create a private world for us.

16
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,790
How unfortunate.

17
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,190
Then, let's...

18
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,420
Sorry, I have to go to the company today.

19
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,080
Yunkai, you don't have to work so hard.

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,169
It's Sunday today.

21
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,560
If I don't work hard

22
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,040
and run the company well,

23
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,980
I'll have to go back to inherit a huge family business.

24
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,350
Okay.

25
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,530
I'll send the book to Tangyuan's room

26
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,880
and use the bathroom.

27
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,110
It doesn't matter to you, right?

28
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,300
So this is Yunkai's room.

29
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,230
I've come to their house so many times.

30
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,090
It's the first time I came in here.

31
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,550
Why did Tangyuan hide this

32
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,230
when he was playing with toys?

33
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,950
The hair is so dirty. Throw it away.

34
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,100
What are you doing?

35
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,340
I...

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,350
Why are you in my room?

37
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,230
I just passed by the door

38
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,470
and saw Tangyuan's toys were spread all over the floor,

39
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,950
so I thought I could help pick them up.

40
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,500
Get out!

41
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,290
Don't throw it.

42
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,020
Don't hurt them.

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,280
Why?

44
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,850
I want to keep them as a souvenir.

45
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,920
Tong Wan said

46
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,530
once people start working,

47
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,060
they'll start losing hair.

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,440
I think it's indeed true for me lately,

49
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,020
so I want to cherish every single hair

50
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,770
and be good friends with them.

51
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:50,950
Good friends?

52
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,430
Look.

53
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,750
This is my good friend Jennifer.

54
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,330
You cast her away so casually just now,

55
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,450
which caused great harm

56
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,850
to her vulnerable heart.

57
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,650
But now that you said it was your good friend,

58
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,620
why did it leave you so easily?

59
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
It's not loyal at all.

60
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,730
I found it on the bed.

61
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,910
Maybe it's because last night we...

62
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,270
I'll be careful later

63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,260
so that I won't hurt them.

64
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
Later?

65
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm sorry, Jennifer.

66
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,810
[Welcome]

67
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,360
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Lu.

68
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm used to arriving early.

69
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I took the liberty and ordered a cup of hazelnut latte for you.

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,660
I don't know if you like it.

71
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,390
I'm used to drinking iced Americano.

72
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,320
I already ordered it when I came in.

73
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,650
Hello, your iced Americano.

74
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,190
Thank you.

75
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,540
Looks like I'll have two drinks.

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,890
Thank you for your jacket.

77
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,930
You saved me in time. My gratitude…

78
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,810
I didn't expect

79
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,400
that my jacket could be so helpful.

80
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,210
Mr. Lu, have you ever thought about

81
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,180
how to repay my favor?

82
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,990
How do you want me to repay you?

83
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,659
Do you want me to be at your service?

84
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,010
Or...

85
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,890
Not really.

86
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,510
I just hope

87
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,850
we each can get what we need

88
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,910
and create a win-win situation.

89
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,490
I'm all ears.

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,040
I heard Wuxin is competing with several other live-streaming platforms

91
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,980
for a marketing case

92
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,060
of an old handcraft company.

93
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,160
And you haven't made any progress.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,680
Why?

95
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,090
Are you suddenly so concerned about my company?

96
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,660
I just came back.

97
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,300
I want to find a powerful company to rely on.

98
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,890
So I want to recommend myself

99
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,940
and ask for a job from you, Mr. Lu.

100
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,780
I know Wuxin is strict in hiring people.

101
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,640
If I can push ahead with this case,

102
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,360
can I be a PR director or something like that

103
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,780
in your company?

104
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,750
Why would a famous designer like you

105
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,010
want to work in a live-streaming media company

106
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,440
like Wuxin?

107
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,680
Actually, after I came back,

108
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,670
I've contacted several design companies.

109
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,790
None of them is a good opportunity for me.

110
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,560
Wuxin has a firm foothold in the live-streaming industry.

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,000
And you also have plans to set foot in other industries.

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,660
Mr. Lu, should we join forces?

113
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,070
Since you said so,

114
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,150
if I hesitate more,

115
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,080
it'll make me look narrow-minded.

116
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,430
If you want to try it, of course you're welcome to.

117
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,870
I'll send you the details later.

118
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,790
Let's see how many aces you have in the hole.

119
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,030
I'll try to have at least two aces.

120
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,890
If you've changed the temperature of the air conditioner,

121
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,299
remember to change it back before the boss gets in.

122
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:43,950
Okay.

123
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,880
You're here.

124
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,120
Is it for me?

125
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,450
Just in time. I need to freshen up.

126
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
Not for me?

127
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,880
You know I don't like lattes.

128
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,240
I just met Helsin.

129
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,620
I ordered it for her.

130
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,390
I told you.

131
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,500
Don't mix her up with Zhou Mian

132
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,700
just because she looks like her.

133
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,990
She's not afraid of bitterness like Zhou Mian.

134
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,470
Zhou Mian had to add milk and sugar.

135
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,240
Your apple polishing was all in vain, wasn't it?

136
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,030
So, what did you two talk about?

137
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,550
She said she wanted to work at Wuxin.

138
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,250
You agreed?

139
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,790
Yes,

140
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,830
but not completely.

141
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,390
Are you talking in riddles?

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,730
She mentioned Jiasheng Group's attitude first.

143
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,070
She said she wanted to help Wuxin achieve the cooperation

144
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,990
as the condition for her to enter Wuxin.

145
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,850
Jiasheng Group does want to keep pace with the times

146
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,830
and change their marketing strategy.

147
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,510
But that old Mr. Li they sent for investigation

148
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,460
is stubborn and old-fashioned.

149
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,590
He doesn't approve of the new industry of live-streaming.

150
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,320
It seems he won't budge an inch.

151
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,390
It's indeed difficult for Wuxin

152
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,200
to get this deal done.

153
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,620
She's really bold.

154
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,470
I don't think there's much hope, either.

155
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,510
So I told her

156
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,350
as long as she can change

157
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,160
Mr Li's attitude towards the live-streaming industry,

158
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,350
I'll consider it as she passes.

159
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,430
Are you crazy?

160
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,340
You not only obey her

161
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,500
but also lower the difficulty for her.

162
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,390
Let me see if you're possessed.

163
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,630
Enough.

164
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,840
You've been sad for so long. Isn't it long enough?

165
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,590
It's just a relationship.

166
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,230
Look at yourself now.

167
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
You know nothing.

168
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,930
Do you know what love is?

169
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,070
Do you know what love tastes like?

170
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,070
You're right. Indeed, I don't know.

171
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,900
So I prepared a gift for you.

172
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,470
Tong Wan, come in.

173
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,890
It's everyone's responsibility to guard the male virtue.

174
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,530
I like it.

175
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,680
There happens to be a place for it in my bedroom.

176
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,240
Thanks.

177
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm being sarcastic,

178
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,840
not complimenting you.

179
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,370
Wait for me here.

180
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,520
I'm going upstairs.

181
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,040
Beauty in blue.

182
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,390
You dropped your earphone case.

183
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,600
No need. I've earned it back.

184
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,830
Thank you.

185
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,000
That person is so pretentious.

186
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,620
Ji Yaoqing, CEO of Yuanzhen Tech.

187
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,990
The reason why she's here

188
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,840
is probably the same as ours.

189
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,190
Is she

190
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,890
in the material I received?

191
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,130
I think I saw her.

192
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,320
But she doesn't look happy today.

193
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,520
She doesn't look as good as in the photo.

194
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,810
I guess she was turned down again.

195
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,480
After all, the mood of girls

196
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,950
is either shown on their face

197
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,670
or in their Moments.

198
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,080
Boss, why are you laughing?

199
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,710
Our opponent failed,

200
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,910
which means our chances are higher.

201
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,330
It's fine if you think so.

202
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,000
But it's more likely that the potential partner is tough to deal with.

203
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,620
So it'll be the same for us…

204
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,400
You'd better stop talking.

205
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,510
I'll go up first.

206
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,570
It must be him.

207
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,900
Wait a moment in the lobby.

208
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,210
Mr. Li's assistant will go down later.

209
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,800
Even a moral man is afraid of pestering girls.

210
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,330
You know what I mean, right?

211
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,210
Oh my.

212
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,950
Are you okay?

213
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,540
I think I hurt my tendons.

214
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,070
Can you get me some ice?

215
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,330
Okay, wait for me.

216
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,020
You're so nice.

217
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,050
I'll be back soon. Don't move.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,460
I'm afraid it'll be hard for you to come back.

219
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,350
What's wrong?

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,710
Jiang.

221
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,900
It's not Jiang, it's H.

222
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,080
You are?

223
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,270
Hello.

224
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,240
I'm Helsin.

225
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,710
I came to talk with you about our cooperation

226
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,020
on behalf of Wuxin TV.

227
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,050
You're also from a live-streaming company?

228
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,910
You barge in

229
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,200
without any appointment or invitation.

230
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,590
That's a first.

231
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,360
How rude.

232
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,160
I wanted to hand over an appointment letter,

233
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,690
but you wouldn't look at it.

234
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,150
Speaking of rudeness,

235
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,180
we are the same.

236
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,700
Jiang.

237
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,310
See the guest out.

238
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,950
A friendly reminder.

239
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,910
Jiang may not be back for a while.

240
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,770
Do you understand now?

241
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,510
Yes.

242
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,920
So, go straight from here to the end,

243
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,140
then turn left to the elevator.

244
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,480
Then, go to the basement level one.

245
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,360
Then, move forward.

246
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,310
Then, turn left.

247
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,270
Turn right.

248
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,980
Forget it.

249
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,110
I'll take you there.

250
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,230
It'd cause you so much trouble.

251
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,240
Thank you.

252
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,710
You're so nice.

253
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,470
Why are people all praising me today?

254
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,930
It's kinda embarrassing.

255
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,410
Since you're not leaving,

256
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,350
I'll leave.

257
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,590
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,340
In order to prevent this from happening,

259
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,570
I hid your shoes

260
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,020
before I came in.

261
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,830
Everyone

262
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,160
has their scope of things they can accept.

263
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,710
They're used to stuff inside the scope,

264
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,710
while they don't accept anything outside of it.

265
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,890
It's kind of negotiable when it comes to the things on the boundary.

266
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,490
Boss,

267
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,590
about the streamers whose contracts with other platforms are expired

268
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,700
and with whom our Department of Commerce plans to negotiate,

269
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,560
Yuanzhen Tech released a piece of news today

270
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,470
that they have reached a cooperative intention

271
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,660
with many of them.

272
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,110
The promotional poster is out.

273
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,110
They even asked everybody in the WeChat groups to share it this afternoon.

274
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,920
I saw a lot on my Moments just now.

275
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,670
[Helsin: Today should be a perfect to go on an expedition]

276
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,670
[Take the initiative]

277
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,319
I'm not going back to the company.

278
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,089
Take me home.

279
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,650
I need to get a prop.

280
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,810
Tangyuan, can you go out with me?

281
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,090
I don't feel well.

282
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
I can't take you out to play.

283
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,390
What's wrong with you, Tangyuan?

284
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,000
Well…

285
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,090
Even if I take you to see Auntie Mian, you won't go, either?

286
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,860
I can go.

287
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,350
Didn't you just say you're not feeling well?

288
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,100
I'll be fine when I see Mian.

289
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,970
There are no difficult tasks,

290
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,630
but only brave Tangyuan.

291
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,930
Let's go.

292
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,310
Boss.

293
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,030
Did it work?

294
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,460
I think it worked,

295
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,230
but it also seemed it did not.

296
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,090
What did Mr. Li say?

297
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,700
He kicked me out.

298
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,960
Your definition of success is so weird.

299
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
Forget it.

300
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,610
Go back to get some sleep.

301
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,410
Wait for me here.

302
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,410
I'll drive the car to the front door.

303
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Tell her how you're feeling unwell.

304
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,190
Auntie Mian, how are you feeling unwell?

305
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,520
Didn't you say you were having a stomachache

306
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,120
and you could only get better after seeing her?

307
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,300
Why did you ask her

308
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,390
whether she was well when you saw her?

309
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,700
Why are you here?

310
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,280
I saw your post on Moments.

311
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,860
I think you should be here to challenge Mr. Li.

312
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,610
I happened to be nearby.

313
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,670
So, I came here to try my luck.

314
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,740
I didn't expect to be so lucky.

315
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,250
Tangyuan, didn't you have something to say?

316
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,210
Oh, right.

317
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,670
This is for you.

318
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,410
[Dear Mian, I'd like to invite you to come to my birthday party. Can you come?]

319
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,410
Wow.

320
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,440
It's your birthday.

321
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,770
Congratulations.

322
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,760
It's young Mr. Lu's birthday.

323
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,960
I'll dress up to the nines to attend it.

324
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,620
Okay?

325
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,310
Yeah!

326
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,880
But I'm not Mian.

327
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,200
Since Tangyuan likes you so much,

328
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,420
you must like kids, too.

329
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,770
I don't.

330
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,720
Because we have too many kids in my family.

331
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,590
But everyone is a reflector of the emotions they receive.

332
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,850
Tangyuan likes me and is friendly to me.

333
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,540
Of course I like him back.

334
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,840
Hello?

335
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,920
I went to your father's place and heard him nagging again.

336
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,800
You should go home to see him when you're free.

337
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Isn't Tangyuan's birthday coming?

338
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,250
You should take the chance to go back home.

339
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,470
I've invited Helsin to come to my place

340
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,470
to celebrate Tangyuan's birthday.

341
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,780
You invited her to your place directly?

342
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,110
You're inviting trouble into your house.

343
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,600
I just want to observe her.

344
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,680
It's more convenient this way.

345
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,580
What's wrong?

346
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,680
Are you mad at me?

347
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,120
I received a few photos today.

348
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,790
I haven't had time to tell you this yet.

349
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,190
I'll send them to you now.

350
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,410
Helsin is really not simple.

351
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,810
She seems to have a good personal relationship with that person.

352
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,130
Which person?

353
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,360
The one who wants to replace you.

354
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,790
Mr. Li is willing to see us?

355
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,640
Yes.

356
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,990
Mr. Li made an appointment to visit you.

357
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,100
He also asked for business information.

358
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,300
He suddenly changed.

359
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,130
Do you know why?

360
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,010
No.

361
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,500
Investigate it.

362
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,070
Yes.

363
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,310
I think I ordered it right this time.

364
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,900
Why do you want to have coffee with me, Mr. Lu? What's up?

365
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,700
Jiasheng Group has informed me.

366
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,140
Would Mr. Li like to

367
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,280
know more about the live-streaming industry?

368
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,300
Then, does it mean I've succeeded?

369
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:24,570
Yes.

370
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,230
Then I guess I'll have a job

371
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,220
and be honored to be a laborer soon.

372
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
It's my pleasure.

373
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,200
I'm looking forward to working with you.

374
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,390
Anyway, I'd like to tell you first.

375
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,730
The HR Department is going through the process.

376
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,700
The official admission notice

377
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,370
will be sent to your email box soon.

378
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,480
Got it, Boss.

379
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,590
If you're free later,

380
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,840
let me take you to the company and show you around.

381
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,480
Boss is asking for me. Of course I'm free.

382
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,510
Everyone, stop for a moment.

383
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,340
This is Helsin,

384
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,470
who just joined our Marketing Department.

385
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,670
She will be in charge of our company's PR from now on.

386
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,480
Okay, Ms. Lin.

387
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,320
Please cooperate with

388
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,570
Director Helsin.

389
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,030
Okay, Boss.

390
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,400
In the team meeting later,

391
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,120
you can let them introduce themselves one by one

392
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,050
so that you can get to know them all.

393
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,680
Their relationship is not simple.

394
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,550
Yeah.

395
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,870
This is a temporary office for you.

396
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,960
Whatever you need,

397
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,660
you can ask the Administrative Department.

398
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,570
I've already informed them in advance.

399
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,750
You can hire an assistant.

400
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,110
You can ask HR to recruit someone according to your requirements

401
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,640
or if you have someone in mind, it's okay, too.

402
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,770
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

403
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,110
When should I start working?

404
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,850
Today.

405
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,880
There's no need for such haste, is there?

406
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,790
To be honest,

407
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,920
Mr. Li is coming to the company today.

408
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,380
He specifically asked you

409
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,410
to receive him.

410
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,270
What did Mr. Li do these days?

411
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,150
Did he contact any company closely?

412
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,180
Not really closely,

413
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,320
but he moves about frequently.

414
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,030
In these two days,

415
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,940
he made appointments with almost all the top-notch

416
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,060
live-streaming platforms

417
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,890
He went to Yuanzhen Tech this morning.

418
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,750
Ji Yaoqing sent him out in person.

419
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,870
By the look of her expression, she looks pretty again.

420
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,530
Enough. Be serious.

421
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,850
Yuanzhen has been successful in many cases

422
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,880
working with hand manufacturing companies.

423
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,540
They have advantages and confidence.

424
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,160
I couldn't get too close then,

425
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,830
so I didn't hear what they said.

426
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,020
But both of them looked contented.

427
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,630
Contented?

428
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,060
Director, the guests are here.

429
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,980
What's wrong?

430
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,390
I'll talk to you later.

431
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,780
Have some water.

432
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,950
Why haven't you started

433
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,350
to introduce your company's business yet?

434
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,690
Because there's no need.

435
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,170
Regular business and special business

436
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,670
are shown in the slides

437
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,820
we sent to Jiasheng.

438
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,190
As for the customized business,

439
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,520
we need to confirm the cooperation before we can talk about it in detail.

440
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,700
So, in a word,

441
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,890
I have nothing to say

442
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,660
about the business.

443
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,380
You've visited

444
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,260
all the live-streaming platforms.

445
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,290
You should be the one who proposes the conditions, not me.

446
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,740
You have a streamer who specializes in the field of craftmanship:

447
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,550
Rimu Tuyuan.

448
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,880
If you're sure Rimu Tuyuan is there,

449
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,560
you can come up with a proposal.

450
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,240
I'll highly recommend it to the group.

451
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,000
No problem.

452
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,110
No problem at all.

453
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,550
Well,

454
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,150
Rimu Tuyuan never takes any business activity.

455
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,370
She draws her monthly gratuities every month

456
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,480
and gives them to some old craftsmanship workshops regularly.

457
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,450
Our company doesn't have her valid contact information.

458
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,880
We can't get in touch with her.

459
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,840
You agreed too quickly.

460
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,270
You'd better talk to them again.

461
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,260
It's a bit difficult,

462
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,460
but I'll try my best.

463
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,010
Boss,

464
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,770
some urgent documents are sent here.

465
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,310
Okay, I'll finish reading them before I get off work.

466
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,930
Boss, the property management has informed us

467
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,910
that the routine circuit inspection is held today.

468
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,060
Go back early.

469
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,970
If there's nothing else,

470
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,640
you can go home.

471
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,920
You go home early, too.

472
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,760
Okay.

473
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,600
Mian.

474
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,120
Mian.

475
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,530
Lu Yunkai, you're finally here.

476
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,020
Look at the time.

477
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,840
I know you're afraid of the dark.

478
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,700
Of course I'll come to pick you up.

479
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,640
I was too absorbed when I drew.

480
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,120
Everyone was gone before I realized it.

481
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,500
I was so scared.

482
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,600
Don't be afraid.

483
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,420
There are still many lights on.

484
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,370
It's such a big space, and it's so quiet here.

485
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,830
And only one-third of the lights are on.

486
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,960
It's late…

487
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,590
All right.

488
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,510
If you work overtime again,

489
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,430
I'll accompany you.

490
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:58,940
Okay?

491
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,680
You don't have time.

492
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,260
I forgot

493
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,220
about the circuit repair tonight.

494
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,240
If she's Zhou Mian,

495
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,500
she must be afraid of the dark.

496
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,180
Have you heard of it?

497
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,530
The CBD area

498
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,340
used to be a mass grave in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

499
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,640
Every night at midnight,

500
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,750
there would be sobbing and whimpering.

501
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,830
Even until now,

502
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,020
from time to time…

503
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:56,830
Ah!

504
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,370
Mr. Lu, I didn't expect

505
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,520
that you would believe such nonsense.

506
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,250
How could it

507
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,020
be possible?

508
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,710
Hey.

509
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,050
It's improper for a man and a woman to take each other's arms in a way that's too familiar.

510
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,510
Hello, Captain. I'm almost done patrolling.

511
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,680
Make a summary of the factory's situation.

512
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,550
We must emphasize it in the team meeting on Monday.

513
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,160
Okay.

514
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,640
I'll sort it out and send it to your email as soon as possible.

515
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,190
Stop the car in front as usual.

516
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,690
Okay, I'll wait for you in the car.

517
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Tong Wan,

518
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,430
why don't we change our code name?

519
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,170
You meowed downstairs.

520
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,190
I think my parents knew about it.

521
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,450
They could always catch me watching TV.

522
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,980
Do do so so la la so.

523
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,630
Fa fa mi mi re re do.

524
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,180
[See you at the same place]

525
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
What the heck?

526
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,440
[A whale falls ten miles; a thought makes a mountain]
