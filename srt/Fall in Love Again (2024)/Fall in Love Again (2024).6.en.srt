00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,910
I can finally see you again after I've waited for so long, Mian.

5
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,480
Why did you sneak out of the kindergarten alone?

6
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,570
I went to look for my mother.

7
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,880
Fei said that my mother sent flowers to the flower shop every day.

8
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,220
I miss her.

9
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,789
Nonsense.

10
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,340
It's true.

11
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,500
When Fei came to our home last time, he saw her photo,

12
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,110
and he said that she looked familiar.

13
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,310
He saw her many times when he passed by the flower shop.

14
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,340
That woman can't be your mother.

15
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,570
If it were her,

16
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,470
she would have come home first after she came back.

17
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,080
How would she go to the flower shop?

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,150
Don't sneak out of the kindergarten again.

19
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,710

20
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,509
Yes.

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,100
Look at his outfit.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,270
Is he a new idol who has just made his debut?

29
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,490
Really?

30
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,260
I've paid so much attention to the entertainment circle inside our country.

31
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,829
How come I have no impression of him?

32
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,880
Whatever.

33
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,070

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,230
Originally,

49
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,970
I wanted to tell you that

50
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,440
you would be fully in charge of that matter.

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,370
But just now, I saw that you had arranged everything.

52
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,020
Did Mr. Lu ask you to come here?

53
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,530
Yes.

54

You and Mr. Lu really have a tacit understanding.

55
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,630
When I came here just now,

56
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,279
I happened to hear you talking about the arrangements for work.

57
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,610
I didn't expect that your supporting plan for new designers

58
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,110
would be that good.

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
Actually, when Mr. Lu first made this plan,

60
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,670
he didn't have any high aspirations.

61
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,600
He did it purely because of his girlfriend.

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,930
He said it was too hard to be a new designer.

63
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,190
He did it in order to make his girlfriend happy.

When he first answered the phone,

96
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,430
his voice obviously sounded deep and low.

97
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,410
Why did he talk with a smile later?

106
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,390
Humph.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,659

just for a woman,

112
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,190
I wouldn't need to water the plants here.

113

It has been ruined like this.

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,520
You don't need to water this plant anymore indeed.

115

How should I explain it to Mian?

119
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,310
Is there something wrong with the direction of my investigation?

120
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,070
It can't be.

121
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,700
Which part is wrong?

122
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,840
Does he really have nothing to do with this thing?

123
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,550
What's wrong with the water?

124
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,520
Oh no.

125
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,130
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang.

Why are you different now?

131
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,900
No. Is that just your illusion?

132

Some company representatives whom I once worked with

144
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,750
sent the flowers to the company

145
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,440
because I refused to tell them my home address.

146
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,300
I'm sorry. I'll handle them well.

147

149
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,790
What?

150
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,520
To my lifetime beloved woman, Tong Wan.

From your admirer, Cheng Chi.

152
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,640
I remember this person.

153
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,830
He's the legal representative of the Tengyue Group.

Don't choose him.

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,240
He's not as rich as me.

156
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,190
Mr. Jiang,

157
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,520
in this city, there are indeed

158
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,190
not many young elites who are richer and more outstanding

159
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,200
than you.

160
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,340
And you've misunderstood it.

161
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,110
I don't mean to resign.

162
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,050
Here's your water.

163
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,130
I need to go back to work

164
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,260
so as to create wealth for our company.

165
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,640
Why is it so hot?

166
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,500
Why are you here?

167
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,920
Didn't you ask me to get the dumplings?

168
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,120
I was so busy that I forgot about it.

169
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,700
Let's go.

170
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,390
There is stuffing like celery, leeks, and three delicacies.

171
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,860
To cook the dumplings, remember that

172
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,630
you can only put them into the pot when the water is boiling.

173
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,510
Otherwise,

174
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,090
the dumplings will be broken.

175
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,750
You once taught me about that.

176
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,320
Today is New Year's Eve.

177
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,550
In China, people are supposed to eat dumplings.

178
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,030
But I don't know how to make dumplings.

179
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,610
I could only buy some frozen dumplings

180
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,470
in a nearby Chinese supermarket.

181
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,230
Alright.

182
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,360
Maybe you don't want to eat them with me.

183
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,600
You've been here for so many days,

184
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,660
but you haven't even said a word to me.

185
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,000
I can see that you're badly hurt.

186
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,200
Not only physically.

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,160
Although it sounds a bit coercive to say this,

188
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,700
I still want to wish you a happy New Year's Eve.

189
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,160
Put the dumplings into the pot when the water is boiling.

190
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,780
Otherwise, they'll get broken easily.

191
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,990
Happy New Year's Eve.

192
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,090
I've always had a good memory.

193
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,950
Yes.

194
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,530
You have a good memory.

195
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,110
Mian,

196
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,970
how is your revenge plan going

197
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,640
after your high-profile return?

198
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
You seem to look

199
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,150
a little tired.

200
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,350
The plan is going well.

201
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,700
But...

202
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,410
But what?

203
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,030
Well...

204
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,350
Nothing.

205
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,030
Remember to put them in the refrigerator after you go back.

206
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,800
Mian.

207
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,820
Don't forget what I told you.

208
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,630
We are allies.

209
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,180
Whenever it is,

210
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,890
you can always rely on me.

211
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,840
Right.

212
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,930
Friendship is the most valuable wealth for human beings.

213
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,000
That sentence

214
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,520
sounds like a famous quote.

215
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,390
I made it up.

216
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,010
It's quite persuasive, isn't it?

217
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,860
Yes.

218
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,860
Even I

219
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,830
was almost tricked by you.

220
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
After you came back here,

221
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,980
you seem happier instead.

222
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,630
As for the special event launched by the Love Enjoying Funds,

223
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,260
I've read your proposals.

224
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,930
Personally speaking, I recommend mime.

225
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,780
Mime?

226
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,510
If we do a project that is without sounds at this time,

227
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,900
we won't get any attention, will we?

228
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,230
It'll be such a big loss.

229
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,270
Although in a noisy environment,

230
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,320
mime is not quite attractive to those who

231
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,050
have normal sensory functions,

232
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,910
our targeted group this time is deaf and dumb children.

233
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,070
Deaf and dumb people are sensitive to other senses by nature.

234
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,140
Moreover, in terms of art, deaf and dumb people

235
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,180
have an incomparable gift.

236
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,390
Therefore, I think it's a good breakthrough to perform mime.

237
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,570
Moreover, at the scene,

238
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,470
it may become a bright spot.

239
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,880
But I've heard that

240
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,010
other companies will use these themes, such as music, flowers,

241
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,970
Wonderful Unicon,

242
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,600
small playgrounds and so on.

243
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,870
Some of them will even invite young artists to their activities.

244
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,750
It's easy to take photos

245
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,890
and write the publicity articles.

246
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,690
Don't take the event as a show.

247
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,120
If you think about the publicity effect at the first step,

248
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,770
the protagonist is already in the wrong position.

249
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,850
No matter how hard you try, it won't be good.

250
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,990
I personally like the name of this event very much.

251
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,410
It's called "Neverland".

252
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,810
It was also the place where Peter Pan lived.

253
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,190
On that island,

254
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,430
everyone could grow up carefreely.

255
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,520
The initiators of this event chose this name.

256
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,350
It means that they also hope that these children

257
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,140
can stay innocent

258
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,320
and pure forever.

259
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,670
Personally speaking, I also think that

260
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,790
by choosing an art form,

261
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,320
its influence will last longer

262
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,750
than temporary freshness.

263
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,530
Therefore, we hope to plant a seed in the bottoms

264
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,340
of these children's hearts

265
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,320
so that they can understand this vast world

266
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,120
and learn about all kinds of art.

267
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,270
Anything will be fine.

268
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,030
As for the form of the content,

269
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,740
we need to make it different from the other organizers'.

270
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,360
Tingwen, I think your story

271
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,530
about a young hero is very good.

272
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,380
No matter what kind of kids they are,

273
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,070
and whether they're healthy or not,

274
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,470
I think it'll be better if everyone can have

275
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,000
more great aspirations and noble ambitions.

276
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,480
But you just can't use Wuxin's chance

277
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,750
of developing design business as a test item

278
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,190
just due to your own decision, right?

279
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,150
Well, Meng,

280
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,450
since the Vice President has said so,

281
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,750
there won't be any problems.

282
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,750
Yes, if we work hard on it, there won't be any problems.

283
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,420
Since we've decided on the direction,

284
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,470
shall we report it first?

285
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,430
This event will be jointly organized by Baifei from France.

286
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,510
Many companies which will join the event have reported their themes.

287
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,390
There's no need to rush. It's good to report it later.

288
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,660
I think there's still a lot of time before the deadline.

289
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,590
Let's make the plan more detailed.

290
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,760
As for the actors of the mime, we should choose the top ones

291
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,000
and the most suitable ones.

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,780
You guys can check the details again.

293
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,710
Got it. We'll discuss the details internally later.

294
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,890
Ms. Cheng.

295
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,890
Are you here for a meeting?

296
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,840
Yes.

297
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,470
But I don't think your meeting room is here.

298
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,490
Well, I...

299
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,280
I've finished the meeting.

300
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,510
I just wanted to have a cup of coffee to refresh myself.

301
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,570
Someone told me that it was over here.

302
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,650
But I think I went the wrong way.

303
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,990
I couldn't find it after walking around here.

304
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,270
You didn't go the wrong way.

305
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,600
The pantry is upstairs.

306
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Go upstairs and walk straight. Then you'll get there.

307
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,500
Okay.

308
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,620
Thank you.

309
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,540
If there's nothing else, I have to go.

310
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,620
What a selfish woman.

311
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,550
I'll make you pay the price.

312
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,840
Even till now, I still can't believe that

313
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,170
she's really Zhou Mian.

314
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,950
Didn't you tell me

315
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,220
to believe in science?

316
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,800
Can this DNA report be fake?

317
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,790
Hmm...

318
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,600
Since it was not easy for me to finally find her,

319
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,190
what do you think I should do to...

320
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:40,550
Hmm?

321
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,780
Forget it.

322
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,270
I'll figure out a way myself.

323
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,730
Are you looking down on me?

324
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,550
Of course not.

325
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,710
I just thought of

326
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,260
the fact that you seldom communicate with women.

327
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,500
By asking you this question,

328
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,520
I've gone too far.

329
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,079
Ms. Cheng.

330
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,150
Have you finished drinking coffee?

331
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,630
Why are you so flustered?

332
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,240
I...

333
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:24,829
I...

334
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,230
I get scared easily.

335
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,230
A cockroach passed by my feet just now. I was so scared.

336
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,020
This encounter is a good chance to extend an invitation.

337
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,530
It's dinner time now.

338
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,020
May I have the honor

339
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,450
to have a meal with you?

340
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,510
The food of this restaurant

341
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,710
was quite delicious.

342
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,880
Yes.

343
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,520
My colleague specially recommended it to me.

344
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,530
Are you used to the food after you came back to China?

345
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,360
Yes.

346
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,190
I'm used to it.

347
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,460
You're not in a hurry to go back to the company?

348
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,990
These several toys are quite interesting.

349
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,320
It's a coincidence that

350
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,300
her birthday is coming soon.

351
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,550
Your friend's birthday?

352
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,950
You should choose a gift carefully indeed.

353
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,740
She's a toy designer of Dreams Chasing.

354
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,910
She's a very talented.

355
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,280
Her design draft was approved when she first displayed it at the meeting.

356
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,740
She was once my best friend.

357
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,540
What is this?

358
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,490
Why... Why did you bring it back?

359
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,450
It's my application for suspension of schooling.

360
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,760
I'm asking why you applied for suspension of schooling.

361
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,490
My dad broke his leg last month.

362
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,230
All my family's income has been cut.

363
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,370
I can't go to school.

364
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,870
Are you stupid?

365
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,950
I've already overheard that

366
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,590
your parents will send your younger brother abroad.

367
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,390
They've found you a man for a blind date in the village.

368
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,250
Even the betrothal gifts are ready.

369
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,180
Your future will be sacrificed after you go back, won't you?

370
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,460
What can I do?

371
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,350
Half of the junior year has passed.

372
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,180
In less than a year,

373
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,910
we can go out for an internship.

374
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,210
How can you apply for suspension of schooling at this time?

375
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,530
You got scholarship every year.

376
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,830
You basically did a part-time job during all your extracurricular time.

377
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,870
During these years in college,

378
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,820
how much money have you ever asked your family to give you?

379
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,550
I don't care.

380
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,240
You can't leave anyway.

381
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,820
You said that

382
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,220
we would become elites of the toy design industry

383
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,480
and get rich together.

384
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,460
That's just the bluff of an arrogant young girl.

385
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,100
Take this.

386
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,500
I don't need much money anyway.

387
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,020
These are the national scholarships

388
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,350
and the school scholarships I've got in the past two years.

389
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,630
By that time, transfer the money to your parents,

390
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,630
and tell them you're not going back.

391
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,510
I've asked my dad about it.

392
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,990
There are still quotas for scholarships in our department.

393
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,250
Go apply for it at once.

394
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,040
[Zhou Mian, Designer]

395
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,680
[Cheng Shan, Designer]

396
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,280
We've finally got hired by this company.

397
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,040
I feel so proud.

398
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,480
Let's stand with arms akimbo for a while.

399
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,610
Next, it'll be the show time for us to realize our dreams.

400
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,990
But she abandoned me.

401
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,750
Do you think I should hate her?

402
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

403
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,760
Is there a misunderstanding?

404
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,990
I remember you said that

405
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,970
I look a bit like

406
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,190
an old friend of yours.

407
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,570
You look amiable and friendly,

408
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,430
so I couldn't help talking with you for a bit longer.

409
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,250
Please come in.

410
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,460
I have a presumptuous request.

411
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,980
Since you're here,

412
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,600
just tell me your request.

413
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,450
I promised Tangyuan that I would take him to participate in

414
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,370
the parent-child activity on this weekend,

415
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,050
but I have to go on a business trip urgently.

416
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,620
So...

417
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,580
You're here to find a replacement.

418
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,390
Mian, please.

419
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,790
Mian, please.

420
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,900
Mian, please.

421
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,110
Mian.

422
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,860
What can I do since he has said that?

423
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,150
Just send me a message about the time and location.

424
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,020
But Mr. Lu,

425
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,030
you'll have to pay me double overtime cost.

426
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,740
Okay.

427
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,830
What is he up to this time?

428
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,480
Well... The business trip was cancelled suddenly.

429
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,550
So I rushed here.

430
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,960
Hey, Tangyuan, run slowly. Be careful.

431
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,690
I have to go uphill and downhill.

432
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,550
I shouldn't have worn high heels.

433
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,710
You thought we were acting in an idol drama?

434
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,780
I'm not like those female leads in idol dramas,

435
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,310
who would easily fall down.

436
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,350
No wonder he kept talking about coming out on the weekend.

437
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,860
It turns out that he has an appointment with his friends.

438
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,030
Don't use your hand.

439
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,520
Oh.

440
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,360
This is a rove beetle. It's poisonous.

441
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,960
If you hit it with your hand, it will release toxins

442
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,300
and cause inflammation,

443
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,830
so you can only blow it away.

444
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,690
Since I'm not poisonous,

445
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,280
can I keep you by my side?

446
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,830
Mr. Lu, did you mistake me for someone else?

447
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,900
Happy birthday, Mian.

448
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,840
He specially prepared a cake for my birthday.

449
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,300
He's so sure that I'm Mian.

450
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,780
How did he recognize me?

451
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,430
I wonder whether the person, who has made a mistake,

452
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,330
will be forgiven.

453
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,270
Vice President, I'm leaving first. Bye.

454
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:52,980
Okay.

455
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:55,910
Wait.

456
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,990
I'll go with you.

457
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,540
That's so childish.

458
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,950
Since that woman appeared,

459
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,710
how long have you not come to see me?

460
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,580
You want to hear my excuses?

461
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,170
Yes.

462
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,270
I didn't spend all my time with her, did I?

463
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,000
At most,

464
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,970
now we just have the same interests

465
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,730
and work hard together.

466
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,190
You looked disgusting when you mentioned her.

467
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,120
Alright. Stop being jealous.

468
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,300
I came to see you

469
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,980
in order to discuss something serious with you.

470
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,090
What serious matter is it?

471
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,150
Help me analyze it.

472
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,570
Why has Mian refused to admit that she's my wife?

473
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,010
Why is she unwilling to come back to me?

474
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,360
Even if it weren't for my sake,

475
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,990
wouldn't she miss her son?

476
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,930
The door is over there. You can get out by yourself.

477
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,010
Don't be like this.

478
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,190
I hid my identity

479
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,590
and background

480
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,750
when I was with her.

481
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,030
On our wedding day,

482
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,970
I didn't invite my parents.

483
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,660
I hired two actors to pretend to be my parents.

484
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,350
In the name of protecting her,

485
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,260
I made all the decisions for her,

486
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,080
which made her lose all the sense of security.

487
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,250
On our wedding day,

488
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,070
I didn't arrive on time.

489
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,580
To be precise, in fact,

490
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,740
she didn't see me at all after she waited till the end.

491
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,600
I just want to splash water on you.

492
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,480
Since you've analyzed it so clearly by yourself,

493
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,880
why did you come to see me?

494
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,050
Let me tell you, if I were Zhou Mian,

495
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,020
I would just ignore you.

496
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,840
I would hire a killer to kill you.

497
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,220
I know that

498
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,050
some damages have been caused.

499
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,360
But I really want to make up for my mistake.

500
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,720
-Because I really love Mian.
-I'm not listening to it.

501
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,830
I'm not listening to it. Dogs will die if they eat chocolate.

502
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,240
Dogs will die if they eat chocolate.

503
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,100
You'd better tell Zhou Mian about these things.

504
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Dogs will die if they eat chocolate.

505
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,700
Mr. Jiang.

506
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,270
An important partner manufacturer

507
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,060
is in a hurry to ask about the details.

508
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,490
But Ms. Tong went to the factory, and I can't get in touch with her now.

509
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,540
Do you think we should deal with it after she comes back?

510
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,920
No need to wait for her. Let me handle it.

511
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
You'll handle it?

512
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,390
Are there any problems?

513
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,460
N--No.

514
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,430
Get out if there are no problems.

515
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,620
Ask me if you have any questions.

516
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,650
Don't look at me strangely like that.

517
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,860
Did something happen between you and Tong Wan?

518
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,670
What could have happened between Tong Wan and me?

519
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,440
Nothing happened between Tong Wan and me.

520
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,520
Then why didn't you order your Lady Labourer to do the work?

521
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,690
I was just being considerate towards my staff.

522
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,180
I see.

523
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,090
Then let me ask you.

524
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,020
Last time,

525
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,590
why did you ask her to collect samples in the suburbs alone

526
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,560
when it was quite foggy before dawn?

527
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,570
And why did you

528
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,500
ask her to go on a business trip urgently

529
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,770
when she didn't sleep for a night?

530
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,760
Just because the designer submitted the draft a day later?

531
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,220
That's what she should do.

532
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,140
So?

533
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,410
Why don't you let her do that now?

534
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,550
Are you okay?

535
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,370
Your analysis is quite right.

536
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,360
My impression of her is different from

537
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,800
what it used to be indeed.

538
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,380
But I don't know

539
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,710
whether it's due to an emotional reason

540
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,850
or the fact that she is just

541
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,680
a useful employee for me,

542
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,230
and I'm afraid of losing her.

543
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,360
I didn't expect that

544
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,840
a precisian like you would also fall in love with a woman.

545
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,460
Now,

546
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,950
there's only a 50% chance.

547
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,200
Hey, 50%.

548
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,990
It's already very high.

549
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,560
With 50% profit,

550
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,040
it is enough to make capitalists take risks.

551
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,010
Am I right?

552
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,110
Capitalist Jiang.

553
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,060
But now I don't know

554
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,860
what her opinion is.

555
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,550
You can ask me

556
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,140
for advice about this more often.

557
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,670
After all, we are buddies.

558
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,290
Yeah.

559
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,160
Buddy.

560
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,980
Hey, buddy.

561
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,490
What's wrong?

562
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,240
It seems that something wrong happened.

563
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,680
They all went to the meeting room.

564
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,580
They asked me to tell you to go there.
