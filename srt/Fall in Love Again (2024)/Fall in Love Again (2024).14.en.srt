[Fall in Love Again]

00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,100
[Episode 14]

4
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,830
Alright. Be good.

5
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,550
Do you have any other plans?

6
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,710
I want to get closer to them.

7
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,880
Mr. Song usually asks his assistant to guard the door

8
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,280
when he comes here.

9
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,070
If we want to go over and eavesdrop,

10
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,600
it may not be practical.

11
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,940
Are you okay, sir?

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,150
Do you need me to take you to the bathroom?

13
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,810
Hey.

14
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,280
Wrong delivery.

15
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,229
We didn't order any finger food or snacks.

16
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,830
You're regulars.

17
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,970
Mr. Zhang asked me to deliver them.

18
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,200
By the way, Mr. Song,

19
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,860
I remembered something.

20
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,550
Previously,

21
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,930
the user list of Wuxin

22
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,670
won't be leaked, right?

23
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,960
I heard that

24
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,270
they've started investigations.

25
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,620
IP addresses registered overseas,

26
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,280
non-verified phone numbers,

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,260
no one can do anything with these.

28
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,680
Mr. Lu, you're here.

29
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,150
How can I help you?

30
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,390
I need to find someone here.

31
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,120
It's urgent.

32
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,590
Mr. Song has been focusing on the design industry.

33
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,320
Why are you suddenly competing with your junior?

34
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,230
I was just helping out.

35
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,740
By the way,

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,800
don't slack off in the new fashion competition.

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,210
We still have to make something new

38
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,920
and surprise people.

39
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,500
You subsidiaries need to be on your toes.

40
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,740
Of course.

41
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,760
You don't have to tell us.

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,190
Every year, there's a fresh crop of newcomers

43
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,190
eager to join the fray,

44
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,520
one wave after another.

45
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,440
Why do you keep moving forward?

46
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,470
You've been in here for a long time, right?

47
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,530
What are you doing?

48
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,200
Thank you for taking care of the business.

49
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,920
This is a fruit plate from Mr. Zhang.

50
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,160
Please enjoy.

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,620
Why are you still here?

52
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,710
Nancy, stop dawdling.

53
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,240
There are other guests waiting.

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,140
Go.

55
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,670
Enjoy.

56
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,270
Enjoy.

57
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,470
You scared me.

58
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,840
I thought I got caught.

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,510
And that cart of food...

60
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,910
I paid the bill. Let's go.

61
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,870
We're leaving just like that?

62
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,750
You're not going back to the room just now?

63
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,150
There are so many beauties waiting for you.

64
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,860
You're not giving them a chance?

65
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,260
My family is very strict.

66
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,750
You've heard everything you needed to hear.

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,010
Why aren't we leaving?

68
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,909
Let's go.

69
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:46,960
Let's go.

70
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,659
I need to get changed.

71
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,780
[Xin]

72
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,630
Get ready to work.

73
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,070
Yes.

74
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,350
Just order me around.

75
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,030
I like to listen to you.

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,290
Well,

77
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,210
help me find some good lawyers first.

78
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,230
Of course.

79
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,910
The best of the best in the industry.

80
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,700
And then?

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,100
If you don't go in now, when will you go in?

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,760
If you go in now,

83
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,090
right now,

84
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,270
it'll pay for itself, once and for all.

85
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,020
Mr. Lu, we'll get the evidence as soon as possible.

86
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,670
Once there's any news,

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,000
the law firm will inform you immediately.

88
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,909
Okay.

89
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,560
I'll get going then.

90
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,750
You're so fast.

91
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,159
Come here, give me a reward.

92
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,390
We're in the office.

93
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,890
Oh.

94
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,710
I believe

95
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,590
we will have enough evidence soon.

96
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,390
What about the media?

97
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,870
No rush.

98
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,700
By the way,

99
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,140
it's the weekend,

100
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,470
let's have lunch first.

101
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
We can get some new information too.

102
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,830
What secrets did you hear that night?

103
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,160
You haven't told me yet.

104
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,090
This way.

105
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,390
This meal is not that simple, is it?

106
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,590
Do you see that they are waiting for someone?

107
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,740
Thank you.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,330
I heard Mr. Song say that

109
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,650
he has an appointment here today.

110
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,670
How did you know

111
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,070
the time

112
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,490
and the seat then?

113
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,930
I checked with his assistant's name.

114
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,760
And he has an event this afternoon

115
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,070
and a dinner party tonight,

116
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,770
so he can only come in the afternoon.

117
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,830
My wife is so smart.

118
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,390
I don't need to worry then.

119
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,520
I'll focus on dining with this beauty.

120
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,850
Serve the dishes as usual.

121
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,010
I have other appointments later.

122
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,410
I can't stay long.

123
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,100
Don't order too much.

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Looks like it's not the first time they've met.

125
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,420
Thank you for before, Mr. Song.

126
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,170
It's nothing.

127
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,830
But Lu Yunkai still hasn't returned to the Lu family.

128
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,360
Are you not even close to being on top?

129
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,720
If it weren’t for Mai’s sake,

130
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,110
I wouldn’t have continued to work with you.

131
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,170
The agreement was that

132
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,150
you'd get control of the Lu estate

133
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,440
and direct some of the business over.

134
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,340
When Lu Yunkai fades off fully,

135
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,190
there'll be no other choice for the Lu family

136
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,870
besides me.

137
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,220
Are you okay?

138
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,400
I just have some feelings.

139
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,910
I can't believe someone who doesn't interact with me

140
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,990
would be so malicious

141
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,480
because of family inheritance.

142
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,150
Don't worry about me.

143
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,500
The disappointment on your face

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,830
really can't be hidden.

145
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
Mike

146
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,190
really...

147
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,250
I didn't expect that

148
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,610
Song Bingzhu, with a reputation for excellence

149
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,320
and who's highly respected,

150
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,880
is so different in public and private.

151
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,460
His fake mask has been on for too long.

152
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,919
I need to loosen it for him.

153
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,830
Plus, he

154
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,840
damaged Wuxin's reputation.

155
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,530
I have to settle the score with him.

156
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,630
Tangyuan is in the hospital.

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,090
What?

158
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,310
What's wrong with him?

159
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,040
They said he ate something bad. He's on a drip now.

160
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,200
Let's go.

161
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's go.

162
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,530
Good boy.

163
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
It's almost done.

164
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,560
Dad, Mom.

165
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,290
Tangyuan.

166
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,910
Are you okay?

167
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,630
Does it hurt?

168
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,750
No.

169
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:12,910
Liu,

170
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,350
take me to the doctor to find out what's going on.

171
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,350
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

172
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,000
It's definitely

173
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,910
an accident

174
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,110
and there's no human factor, is there?

175
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,240
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

176
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,650
I've understood the situation.

177
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,990
It's because he ate

178
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,250
street snacks that his classmates brought to school.

179
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,780
There's no one suspicious.

180
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,680
For this period,

181
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,540
keep an eye on him together with Mr. Liu.

182
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,070
Thank you, Chief Editor Li.

183
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,990
You're welcome. We can help each other.

184
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,420
Okay.

185
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,470
Dad.

186
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,510
-It’s not what you think.
-It’s okay.

187
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,320
Rest.

188
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
You must be tired after wearing high heels all day.

189
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,910
Like father, like son.

190
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,790
You both said the same thing.

191
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,230
He kept asking to switch places with me,

192
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,910
got off the bed himself and sat on the stool.

193
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,310
I didn't want to agree,

194
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,310
but then I got a call.

195
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,800
I thought I could make the call in peace, so...

196
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,870
Don't say that.

197
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,630
You should rest more.

198
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,950
Boys

199
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,760
are not that delicate.

200
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,510
Yes.

201
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,670
Tangyuan,

202
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,040
well done.

203
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,480
You have to take care of your mom for Dad.

204
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm proud of you.

205
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,500
This hospital

206
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,110
was where

207
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,410
I gave birth back then, right?

208
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,540
Yes.

209
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,650
After that,

210
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,640
whenever Tangyuan got sick

211
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,260
or uncomfortable,

212
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,390
we'd bring him here.

213
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,020
Mian.

214
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,940
Stop thinking about it.

215
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,870
The kid's nickname

216
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,370
is not that urgent.

217
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,910
But I want to call his name the moment he's born.

218
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,140
I have no inspiration.

219
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,890
I asked you to ask the people next door

220
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,060
how they named their kids.

221
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,680
Did you go?

222
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,700
I...

223
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,150
It's all my fault.

224
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,870
I know you're not good at socializing,

225
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,430
but I still made you do that.

226
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,480
I...

227
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,510
went.

228
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,560
I asked.

229
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,390
Things like

230
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,630
tangyuan, dumplings, buns and wantons are popular.

231
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,350
So people love flour-based food.

232
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,850
What's the most popular one?

233
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,190
Tangyuan.

234
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,160
There were 5.

235
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,750
Let's call him Tangyuan then.

236
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,230
White and plump balls cooked in a pot.

237
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,480
Everyone will be safe and healthy.

238
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,750
Okay.

239
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,690
Whatever you want.

240
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,270
Madam, you're good.

241
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,450
[Song Bingzhu Meets Beautiful Streamer Nan Jiang]

242
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,450
[Song Bingzhu is hospitalized]

243
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,710
I didn't expect

244
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,600
this old man to be in such a bad mental state.

245
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,350
He went straight to the hospital.

246
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,820
Hit the snake at its 7-inch spot.

247
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,850
You hit him right where it hurts.

248
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,740
Mr. Song

249
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,320
always cared a lot about his reputation.

250
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,290
A few years ago, he wanted to develop some other industries

251
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,350
to compete with me.

252
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,760
But all because of face

253
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,670
and reputation,

254
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,550
he gave up.

255
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,780
I hope he's tough

256
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,910
and hangs on.

257
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,990
I'm not done yet.

258
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,750
While I won't hurt others maliciously like him,

259
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,950
I won't let him off

260
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,110
for any of the evil things he's done.

261
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,590
Okay.

262
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,470
His event today

263
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,200
went well at the beginning.

264
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,170
But as soon as it was over,

265
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,650
he was surrounded by a group of reporters

266
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,160
who asked him

267
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,830
why he was holding a hot 20-something

268
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,190
female streamer.

269
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,150
The reporters' questions were really sharp.

270
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,610
He was so angry that he passed out on the spot.

271
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,620
Was that the phone call

272
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,130
you were making on the bed?

273
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,990
I wanted to give an exclusive

274
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,110
and do a favor.

275
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,480
Who asked Song's to promote their event so much

276
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,670
and draw so much attention?

277
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,020
Once the news is exposed, it will be all over the place.

278
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,260
Mr. Jiang.

279
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,700
You’ll feel better after taking the hangover medicine.

280
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,070
Mr. Meng and the rest are too much.

281
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,000
Why did they make you drink so much?

282
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,470
They are not as handsome as me,

283
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,310
and aren't as rich as me.

284
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,980
It's only human

285
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,740
to want some revenge.

286
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,150
According to you,

287
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,690
an outstanding person like you

288
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,430
deserves to suffer, then.

289
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,350
We should give them a chance

290
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,180
to feel more at peace.

291
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,240
Luckily, I'm not that outstanding.

292
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,700
Otherwise, I would be the one getting drunk.

293
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,770
They wouldn't dare.

294
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,280
Why not?

295
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,030
Because I'm here.

296
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,200
-Why is it that if you're here...
-Because everyone can see that

297
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,570
I'm protecting you.

298
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,900
You can't even protect yourself.

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
So beautiful.

300
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,290
It's from you, of course it's beautiful.

301
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,590
I'm not talking about the necklace.

302
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,480
If there's nothing else,

303
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,940
I'll leave now.

304
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,120
Tong Wan.

305
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,480
Actually, I...

306
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,480
I actually...

307
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,230
I...

308
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,050
I actually...

309
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,900
What is this?

310
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,380
Great.

311
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,099
Wuxin isn't even firmly established yet,

312
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,760
yet they dare to challenge me.

313
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,050
I guess the slap I gave them before wasn't loud enough.

314
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,300
Young people don't learn their lesson.

315
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
We've found the source of the information.

316
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,770
This Zhou Mian is interesting.

317
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,890
She chose today to expose the news about me today.

318
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,310
My life's reputation

319
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,970
will not be ruined by her.

320
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,190
She better be careful in the future.

321
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,750
It's not really related to her.

322
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,210
It's all Lu Yunkai's idea.

323
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,200
That kid doesn't know what he's doing and he's got his head up his ass.

324
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,260
I'm not gonna let him get away with it.

325
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,200
As for Zhou Mian,

326
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,750
don't be in a hurry to take action.

327
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,150
I'll talk to her first.

328
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,760
After all, we were together for so many years.

329
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,750
All women are soft-hearted.

330
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,090
Her stance may not be that strong.

331
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,680
Sooner or later, she'll see his real colors.

332
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,610
I don't have much patience to wait.

333
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,840
It'll be quick.

334
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,430
I'll definitely be able to convince her.

335
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,690
When we were abroad for so many years,

336
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,890
we never even fought.

337
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,100
Now, we're fighting so intensely once we came back

338
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,160
and we're falling apart completely.

339
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,350
She'll always be the unattainable one,

340
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,110
shining brightly.

341
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,180
[Mike]

342
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,100
Hello?

343
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,470
Sister.

344
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,630
I want to see you.

345
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,990
I have something to tell you.

346
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,630
Did you drink?

347
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,550
Where are you?

348
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,500
Can I drive to you now?

349
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,540
Why are you driving after drinking?

350
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,870
It's okay.

351
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,860
I'll take it from here.

352
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,650
I'll go upstairs then.

353
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,110
Okay.

354
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,430
Sister.

355
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,440
Sister!

356
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,430
What else could it be?

357
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,620
Newbies are aplenty and they're not worth much.

358
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,900
Instead of spending years

359
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,390
to cultivate someone

360
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,590
who could jump ship

361
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,670
at any time,

362
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,280
it's obviously more convenient to poach someone as-is.

363
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,300
Besides,

364
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,850
those old designers

365
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,570
have strong commercial value.

366
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,910
They just have to put some stuff together

367
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,530
use new designers' designs,

368
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,190
and they can cash out.

369
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,120
Song's is not stupid.

370
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,120
What should we choose?

371
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,860
It's so clear.

372
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,860
Forum on shocking news about Song Bingzhu.

373
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,770
There's a huge public outrage.

374
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,400
Since the law firm announced that they're collecting evidence,

375
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,030
many victims

376
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,250
who had chosen to remain silent

377
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,310
have come forward,

378
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,040
including some who are pretty famous.

379
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,470
Today, famous designer Huang Jiada

380
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,590
spoke publicly about it during her livestream.

381
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,670
She used to work for Song's.

382
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,870
Not only was he exploited,

383
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,000
but the signature of the designs were also changed.

384
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,600
He rolled his eyes and said,

385
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,550
I knew

386
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,140
this day would come.

387
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,630
God is watching.

388
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,870
I didn't expect that

389
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,170
it would be so huge.

390
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,840
By the way,

391
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,200
have you arranged for the lawyers

392
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,290
to contact those who came forward?

393
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,200
After all, there's a limit to what they can do.

394
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,870
Of course.

395
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,600
You don't trust me with this stuff?

396
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,130
Song's

397
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,350
had maintained a good corporate image.

398
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,980
Every donation they make

399
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,560
is publicly announced.

400
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,240
And that's exactly why,

401
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,790
when something negative happens,

402
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,880
the netizens who were cheated

403
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,470
are so angry.

404
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,540
But what I'm curious about is,

405
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,110
when we were at the KTV,

406
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,160
you just heard a few lines about

407
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,050
harvesting new talent and releasing new stuff.

408
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,070
How did you know

409
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,110
they did this to newbies?

410
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,750
I didn't guess it.

411
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,540
It’s just that creator,

412
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,000
when they hear these words,

413
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,330
would think about that.

414
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,710
As expected,

415
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,390
Song Bingzhu is hypocritical and fake.

416
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,630
There's a huge difference between his public and private faces.

417
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,910
Under his leadership,

418
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,430
Song's often stole ideas,

419
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,700
exploited the newbies

420
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,920
and still launched new products happily every year.

421
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,400
The weak can't

422
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,940
go up against a big group.

423
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,310
Some yield under both favors and coercion.

424
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,190
Some people like Huang Jiada

425
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,250
get so angry they quit.

426
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,860
The few who could resist were

427
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,910
also silenced by Song's team of publicists and lawyers.

428
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,240
Those who tried to speak

429
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,160
were powerless to gain attention

430
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,630
and were unable to influence the situation.

431
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,160
Every year, new graduates

432
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,350
recruited by Song's

433
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,470
felt happy

434
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,640
and closer to their dream,

435
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,590
not knowing it's just a vicious cycle.

436
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,430
Yes.

437
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,320
Don't worry.

438
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,420
Attorney depositions will be publicized every step of the way.

439
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,550
Long-time villians

440
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,800
have to pay the price.

441
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,950
I just received the news that

442
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,930
Song Bingzhu's condition worsened again

443
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,660
because of what came out today.

444
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,830
I wonder

445
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,660
if he's trying to get sympathy

446
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,720
or if he really can't hold on anymore.

447
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,410
I have an idea

448
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,760
to resolve this problem.

449
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,680
I'll send him some supplements

450
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,210
so that he can recover soon.

451
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,840
I think you'd better not upset him.

452
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,080
After the incident at Heshan Toy Factory,

453
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,720
he tried to produce a few toys

454
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,100
that they were forced to stop production on.

455
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,670
They were almost identical

456
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,110
to my father's designs.

457
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,800
I went to check on him a while ago.

458
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,230
I found that he was obviously hiding the truth.

459
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,180
This time,

460
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,950
I must peel back every layer

461
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,510
and expose him completely.

462
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,090
Vice President.

463
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,010
Excuse me.

464
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,990
I have some work to ask you about.

465
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,630
Go ahead.

466
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,630
What Song's did to new designers

467
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,310
caused public outrage online.

468
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,910
Some netizens are comparing it

469
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,510
with Wuxin's efforts to support

470
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,430
original designers.

471
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,430
The comparison has helped us attract fans

472
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,310
and it's really helped

473
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,710
to improve our image.

474
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,630
Do you think we should

475
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,870
actively promote

476
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,530
this kind of comments?

477
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,270
Don't make such comparisons.

478
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,690
We can't be noble

479
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,160
if we rise on someone's bad reputation.

480
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,060
In Song's battle with morality and law,

481
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,840
let's not fan the flames.

482
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,270
Let's just be ourselves.

483
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,990
We'll leave more opportunities

484
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,320
to those designers who have been wronged.

485
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,200
Okay.

486
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,700
She seems

487
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,410
different from before.

488
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,160
She became very confident.

489
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,280
Every movement

490
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,220
is full of her own charisma.

491
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,720
Since you came,

492
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,710
Wuxin has indeed changed.

493
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,810
Thank you.

494
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,950
It's good to have you.

495
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,930
Pay me more.

496
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,070
Money is nothing.

497
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,870
I'm enough, right?

498
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,350
You're optional,

499
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,440
but my pay is not.

500
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,430
I'm so cute. How can you not want me?

501
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,570
Congratulations.

502
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,740
On an industry website,

503
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,640
I saw that your Pure Love series

504
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,730
won a design award.

505
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,360
Using Bewick's swans as a core element

506
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,490
to represent one true love.

507
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,290
It's indeed very dazzling.

508
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,510
Madam, your coffee.

509
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,110
Thank you.

510
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,030
I came back with work this time.

511
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,120
The company wants to launch a fashion line

512
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,280
for young women in the China market.

513
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,190
It’s a great opportunity

514
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,030
for Wuxin, since you guys

515
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,460
want to create your own brand.

516
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,180
Generally, for a project of this magnitude,

517
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,060
the choice partner in China

518
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,330
would be Song's.

519
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,230
This is also part of the reason

520
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,630
the company sent me back.

521
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,710
But

522
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,130
I can get it for Wuxin.

523
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,310
No.

524
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,750
I don't understand.

525
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,110
I was already really surprised that

526
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,700
you came to me as soon as you came back.

527
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,030
Why give away what's good for your family?

528
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,430
Naturally, there are conditions.
