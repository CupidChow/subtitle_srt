[Episode 21]

4
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,270
Let's go mourn my parents

5
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,130
after we get the flowers.

6
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,670
Okay.

7
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,380
Lu is going to visit your parents again?

8
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,169
The flowers are ready according to previous standards.

9
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,390
I'm going to get them for you.

10
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,830
Okay.

11
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,590
Your friend came with you today?

12
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,620
My lover.

13
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,110
Girl, you are so lucky.

14
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,280
He's a great man.

15
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,890
Lu is very filial.

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,510
I've been running the shop for so many years.

17
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,750
Few customers would frequently

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,660
buy flowers

19
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,079
to mourn their parents like him.

20
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,260
Also, he's good-looking

21
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,620
and polite.

22
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,870
Although he had a marriage before,

23
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,000
he knows how to take care of people.

24
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,670
It's his first marriage with me.

25
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,670
You often go there to buy flowers?

26
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,200
And you told him you buy them for your parents?

27
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,250
But over the past two years,

28
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,170
we...

29
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,320
You know the answer.

30
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,240
Of course I visit them on behalf of you.

31
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,490
I know.

32
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,710
In your opinion,

33
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,800
I didn't attend our wedding on the sea.

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
But in my opinion,

35
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,350
you are my family.

36
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,310
You're the most important part of my life.

37
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,410
This will never change.

38
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,190
Considering what you just said,

39
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,120
it makes me look petty, doesn't it?

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,670
Of course not.

41
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,150
You are so benevolent

42
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,610
and generous.

43
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,870
You are like a goddess.

44
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,630
Mr. Lu is so smooth-tongued.

45
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,710
Well, how should I put it?

46
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,990
Actually,

47
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,810
I didn't go there to mourn them frequently.

48
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,310
I just missed you so much that I was about to go crazy.

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,170
So I went there to get rid of weeds and plant flowers.

50
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,990
So over the years,

51
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,329
there was no weed there.

52
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,960
Flowers are blooming all the time.

53
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,750
You're really nice.

54
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,520
After we visit our parents,

55
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,570
shouldn't we also make up for the wedding ceremony?

56
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,950
I've booked a few wedding gowns.

57
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,350
They told me we can go there to try them on.

58
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,350
Okay.

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,750
Let's go tonight.

60
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,570
Why are you in such a hurry?

61
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,490
I plan

62
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,070
to put

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,490
a big

64
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,560
diamond necklace here.

65
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,770
But

66
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,320
this dress is already very elaborate.

67
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,250
Don't you think it would be too exaggerated

68
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,850
if I wear a diamond necklace?

69
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,110
I think

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,840
we should go with pearls.

71
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,080
Pearls are fine too.

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,480
Then I want you to wear

73
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,840
a pearl necklace

74
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,040
that's big enough to wrap around your neck three times.

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,580
In this way, you'll look beautiful

76
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,670
and it can cover it.

77
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,260
Cover?

78
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,250
Cover what?

79
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Why don't I just wear a scarf?

80
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,560
My wife is so beautiful.

81
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,659
Of course I want to show off to the whole world.

82
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,950
But I don't want them to see your beauty.

83
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,330
I'm worried they'll compete with me.

84
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,350
First,

85
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,340
there won't be so many people

86
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,890
having the mood to compete with you.

87
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,650
Besides,

88
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,250
you can't have your cake and eat it.

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,100
All right.

90
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,159
I'm going to try on the next one.

91
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,160
Mian, do you need my help?

92
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,950
No.

93
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,210
Can you hurry up?

94
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,900
I want to see how you look in it.

95
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,650
Done. I'm coming out.

96
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,350
Do I not look pretty in it?

97
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,490
I'm going to try on another one.

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you doing?

99
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,060
You're so beautiful. Of course I'm enjoying your beauty.

100
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,670
You look great in it.

101
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,670
Why do you want to try on another one?

102
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,990
I have good taste.

103
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,850
But I still think

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,190
the hemline is too big.

105
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,710
Not at all.

106
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,580
I can use a piece of chocolate

107
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,620
to ask Tangyuan to help you lift it.

108
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,909
A friendly reminder:

109
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,159
it's illegal to hire a child laborer.

110
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,060
In my territory,

111
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,200
who dares to go against me

112
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,470
except you?

113
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,980
I'm going to try on another dress.

114
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,350
I think this one is very good.

115
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,790
It's simple and elegant.

116
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,060
It's ordinary.

117
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,910
You don't like it?

118
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,670
It's not that I don't like it.

119
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,240
It has nothing to do with the dress.

120
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,890
The point is you are pretty.

121
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,490
I think this one is quite good.

122
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,590
If

123
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,980
the venue we choose is not very big,

124
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,990
the hemlines of the previous dresses would be too long.

125
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,690
The venue?

126
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,440
I think the auditorium of St. Regis Hotel is good.

127
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,830
The wedding anniversary ceremony of Princess Kessier

128
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,910
was held there.

129
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,740
Don't you think that place is too big?

130
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,960
It's not big.

131
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,330
We can ask someone to decorate it.

132
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,110
Yunkai,

133
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,310
I think there is a huge disagreement on the wedding

134
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,780
between us.

135
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,030
I want

136
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,270
everything to be simple.

137
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,420
Mian,

138
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,540
this is our wedding.

139
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,830
I know.

140
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,950
It's enough

141
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,940
to have you and me at our wedding.

142
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,740
There is no need to make it grand.

143
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,550
But you're going to marry me.

144
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,150
Of course

145
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,900
I'll hold a grand wedding for you.

146
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,830
I want to tell the whole world

147
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,490
that you're going to marry me.

148
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,030
But it seems that's not what you expect.

149
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,150
I don't like to be high-profile.

150
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,600
Aren't you the same?

151
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,090
This is different.

152
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,270
All right.

153
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,610
We'll talk about this later.

154
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,070
Wait for me to get changed.

155
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,950
Lu Yunkai.

156
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,910
Miss Zhou, Mr. Lu went out just now.

157
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,080
I think he is waiting for you outside.

158
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,490
Thank you.

159
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,010
What are you doing?

160
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,650
I'm looking at the clouds.

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,910
It's so dark. There are no clouds.

162
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,360
Actually, I'm not looking at the clouds.

163
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm angry.

164
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,350
I shouldn't have laughed at you.

166
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,430
Let's go eat something delicious.

167
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,170
Then let's hold our wedding

168
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,450
at St. Regis Hotel.

169
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,380
Having a simple wedding

170
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,560
doesn't mean we don't attach importance to love.

171
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,020
It's really unnecessary.

172
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,270
I know you want to give me the best things.

173
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,350
But I think as long as we are together,

174
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,210
it's enough to prove the loyalty of our love, right?

175
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,030
Then let's hold our wedding at St. Regis Hotel.

176
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,570
You just won't give in, right?

177
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,230
Fine.

178
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,370
Let's talk when you calm down.

179
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,240
Why don't you get in?

180
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,180
No.

181
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,470
How long have you been walking? Aren't you tired?

182
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,070
I'm tired.

183
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,630
I want to tire myself out and make you worried.

184
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,990
My good brother, let's have a discussion.

185
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,740
No.

186
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,230
Unless you promise me

187
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,900
we'll have our wedding at St. Regis Hotel.

188
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,070
Otherwise, there's no room for discussion.

189
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,800
Why don't you

190
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,890
find a landmark building

191
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,500
and display the news of our marriage on it over and over again every day?

192
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,670
This proposal

193
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,370
is surprisingly good.

194
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,270
Get in the car now.

195
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,450
Or I'll get angry.

196
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,910
Are you... really angry?

197
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,570
I wanted to do that just now

198
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,270
because I wanted to make it up to you.

199
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,550
Because I think I owe you considering what happened before.

200
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,480
Think about the previous wedding.

201
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,240
There weren't many guests.

202
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,150
Even I didn't show up.

203
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,810
I made you feel lonely.

204
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,790
Sometimes, I always thought

205
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,710
at that time,

206
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,600
if you felt lonely

207
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,950
and

208
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,790
if you would blame me.

209
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,450
Now God finally

210
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,720
gave me a second chance.

211
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,710
I have to...

212
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,920
What did you do just now?

213
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,350
Can I feel it again?

214
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,510
Okay.

215
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,510
I promise you.

216
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,750
I won't disagree

217
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,930
with anything you say in this life.

218
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,710
If I had known it's so easy to convince you,

219
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,110
I wouldn't have said so much to you just now.

220
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,170
It's okay.

221
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,270
If you don't want to have a wedding this year,

222
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,830
we can have a grand wedding

223
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,420
when you want to next year.

224
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,930
You fool.

225
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
How have you been?

226
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,540
I didn't expect

227
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,070
that the only person who came to visit me

228
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,640
is you.

229
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,520
I don't know why.

230
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,710
You made so many mistakes.

231
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,000
Sometimes I still felt sorry for you.

232
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,100
You felt sorry for me?

233
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,550
I almost killed you,

234
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,430
but you said you felt sorry for me?

235
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,430
Zhou Mian,

236
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,030
you are a bad woman.

237
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,830
Stop pretending to be innocent.

238
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,750
You hate me so much in your heart, don't you?

239
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,620
Everyone hates me.

240
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,390
No one can see my efforts.

241
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,310
No one likes me.

242
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,010
I like you.

243
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,390
Believe it or not.

244
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,310
Behave well in there.

245
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,630
Try your best to reduce your sentence.

246
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,090
After you are released...

247
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,750
I definitely won't go to you after I'm released.

248
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,360
Okay.

249
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,940
Then don't come to me.

250
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,870
Live well.

251
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,930
Don't live for anyone anymore.

252
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,050
It's not worth it.

253
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,660
Okay.

254
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,430
Focus on driving.

255
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,130
Don't get distracted.

256
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,710
I think you have something on your mind.

257
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,750
Are you planning to escape?

258
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,050
How did you know?

259
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,500
An ugly daughter-in-law has to meet her parents-in-law sooner or later.

260
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,430
And you're as beautiful as a fairy.

261
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,880
I don't know what you are worried about.

262
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,960
Actually,

263
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,200
I've always wanted to meet them.

264
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,620
But when I'm really going to meet them,

265
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,490
I feel nervous.

266
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,710
After all, this is my first time being a daughter-in-law.

267
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,300
This is also my first time taking my wife to see my parents.

268
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,230
It's a first to both of us.

269
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,200
Don't worry.

270
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,910
Do you think

271
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,740
your parents will like me?

272
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,550
Will you break up with me

273
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,950
because they don't like you?

274
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,430
No.

275
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,819
That's it.

276
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,089
Is there a rule that we can't get married

277
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,910
just because they don't like you?

278
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,980
There is no such rule.

279
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,870
That's it.

280
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,240
I didn't take you to meet them before.

281
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,110
It was not because I didn't want to.

282
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,910
It was because

283
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,090
I couldn't protect you back then.

284
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,270
I was worried they would make things difficult for you

285
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,470
and make you wronged.

286
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,360
But it's different now.

287
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,150
Mian,

288
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,420
I know you are

289
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,470
conventional in terms of marriage.

290
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,530
You think we must meet parents before getting married.

291
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,190
But what I want you to know is

292
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,270
you,

293
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,270
I,

294
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,870
and Tangyuan

295
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,710
can already

296
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,990
form a complete family.

297
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,230
Okay.

298
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,130
I'd like to see

299
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,470
what kind of brilliant parents

300
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,870
can teach their son to be such a good man.

301
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,680
Maybe you will be disappointed

302
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,550
when you see them.

303
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,450
They are actually

304
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,350
the rich people you hate the most.

305
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,070
They are cold and arrogant.

306
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,910
I purely

307
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,680
relied on myself to become who I am now.

308
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,230
Young Master, you're back.

309
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,250
Ms. Wang, long time no see.

310
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,670
Mr. Lu and Mrs. Lu have been waiting for you.

311
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,020
I'm going to tell them

312
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,260
you've arrived.

313
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,480
Look.

314
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,870
This is the style of rich people.

315
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,280
Their son hasn't been back for so long.

316
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,950
But they didn't even come out to welcome me.

317
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,950
They are waiting for Ms. Wang to tell them.

318
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,810
I don't think my house is this big.

319
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,880
Can't you hear me opening the door?

320
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,590
Sir, Madam,

321
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,070
they have arrived.

322
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:32,870
Dad.

323
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,390
Mom.

324
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,400
I brought Mian back.

325
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,600
Okay.

326
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,840
What's the big deal?

327
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,500
You even want us to welcome you at the door.

328
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,920
Over the past six years,

329
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,760
I haven't come back many times.

330
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,160
Based on the frequency,

331
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,890
I think it's kind of a big deal.

332
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,360
Hello, Uncle, Aunt.

333
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,070
I'm Zhou Mian.

334
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,200
Nice to meet you.

335
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,870
I know.

336
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,260
Yunkai told us in advance.

337
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,620
Unfortunately, Tangyuan has classes today.

338
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:10,830
Sit.

339
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,000
Mian came back this time

340
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,720
because she wants to visit you

341
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,020
before the wedding.

342
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,230
You didn't tell us anything back then.

343
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,470
You planned a wedding just because you wanted to get married.

344
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,160
You didn't come back just because you said so.

345
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,200
This time, it's like this again.

346
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,830
You actually want to piss me off, right?

347
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,490
If I had told you back then,

348
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,070
I think we would have been separated by you long ago.

349
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,730
You even locked me in the house

350
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,990
and wouldn't let me out

351
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,050
before my wedding.

352
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,630
I don't think

353
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,070
you have ever wanted

354
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,430
to let me choose my own wife.

355
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,110
And Dad,

356
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,540
you are so energetic.

357
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm sure you will live a long life.

358
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,280
We're doing this for your own good.

359
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,780
A girl we are familiar with and who has a good family background

360
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,240
is always the best choice.

361
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,790
Those little girls outside

362
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,270
are scheming.

363
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,870
Who knows why she wants to be with you?

364
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,600
Since I was little,

365
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,860
I have needed your approval

366
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,630
for everything,

367
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,030
from dressing, eating, to making friends.

368
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,430
All the plans for my future were made by you.

369
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,510
You chose my career

370
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,790
and my friends.

371
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,940
You even want

372
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,200
to choose a wife for me.

373
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,810
But your biggest problem is

374
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,540
you don't know your son at all.

375
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,070
I would never

376
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,790
be your puppet.

377
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,150
Sorry.

378
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,370
Because

379
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,450
I haven't been called a little girl for a long time.

380
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,220
That's why I got carried away.

381
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,380
I live a carefree life.

382
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,350
There are many people pursuing me.

383
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,960
I run a designers' studio.

384
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,000
My partners are top brands.

385
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,760
Although I don't have

386
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,510
as much money as the Lu family,

387
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,690
with my income,

388
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,280
I don't need to covet any rich family.

389
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,480
And I won't make myself wronged

390
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,590
to serve parents-in-law for money.

391
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,590
So, Uncle, Aunt,

392
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,030
don't worry.

393
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,080
Yunkai doesn't plan to inherit the family business.

394
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,740
I won't think about it either.

395
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,300
I remember

396
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,590
when I first met Yunkai,

397
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,230
there was no such problem.

398
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,080
I still remember the first time we met.

399
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,530
There shouldn't be too many.

400
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,870
After all, we just sorted them out a few days ago.

401
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,840
We have to hurry.

402
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,920
Seniors will come to get them soon.

403
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,590
Excuse me.

404
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,950
So you dropped your ID card in it

405
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,870
when you donated clothes?

406
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,440
Yes.

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,860
Let me help you.

408
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,030
Okay.

409
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,910
But be careful.

410
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,830
It's a bit sharp

411
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,550
at the entrance.

412
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,990
Your arm might get stuck.

413
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,160
Why are you back?

414
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,130
What's your name?

415
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,360
Let me treat you to a meal.

416
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,400
My name is Zhou Mian.

417
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,660
-Well,
-Auntie,

418
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,680
two portions

419
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,830
of vegetarian noodles.

420
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,160
Okay.

421
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,410
Is it not enough?

422
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,560
Give me one large portion.

423
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,950
Thank you.

424
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
What do you think?

425
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,950
Is it good?

426
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,850
Just a large portion of vegetarian noodles?

427
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,170
He could afford anything

428
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,650
with the money we gave him each month.

429
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,030
Why was he so stingy

430
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,580
in school?

431
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,910
Yes.

432
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,230
He was famous

433
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,160
for being stingy in our school.

434
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,000
Later, when we were in a relationship,

435
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,460
he and I used one meal card.

436
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,390
So actually,

437
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,510
when I first met him

438
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,950
and started to have a relationship with him,

439
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,410
I didn't know he came from such a rich family.

440
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,950
At that time,

441
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,590
I thought

442
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,050
he was just a poor student.

443
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,350
I often shared information on part-time jobs with him.

444
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,590
In fact, he is very stubborn.

445
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,730
Once he's determined,

446
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,550
he won't regret it.

447
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,610
So he didn't spend a penny

448
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,010
of the money you gave him.

449
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,060
Because he thought

450
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,990
he could do well on his own.

451
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,930
He is ambitious.

452
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,030
A glass greenhouse is not suitable for him.

453
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,900
When is the wedding?

454
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,430
At the end of the month.

455
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,550
Why are you in such a hurry?

456
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,750
I don't think so.

457
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,660
The wedding should have been held

458
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,070
six years ago.

459
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,430
Six years ago?

460
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,550
The road to happiness is strewn with setbacks.

461
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,510
After what we've been through in the past six years,

462
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,170
we are more certain about each other's feelings

463
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,630
and love.

464
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,090
Where will the wedding take place?

465
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,150
I heard

466
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,860
St. Regis Hotel is good.

467
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,790
The wedding is at the end of the month.

468
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,190
There is not much time left.

469
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,620
But I can make a call

470
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,840
and help you jump the queue.

471
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,490
Is this father and son?

472
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,290
We plan

473
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,110
to have our wedding in a small church.

474
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,000
We want an outdoor wedding.

475
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,830
We don't want to invite too many people.

476
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,440
Forget it.

477
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,200
Do whatever you want.

478
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,910
What an embarrassment.

479
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,270
You,

480
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,150
come with me.

481
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,590
Mom.

482
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,780
Eat.

483
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,070
Here.

484
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,580
Come here.

485
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,230
Wear it for your wedding.

486
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,070
You don't want a grand wedding,

487
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,800
but we can't make it too shabby.

488
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,220
You're not satisfied?

489
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,720
There's a set of big diamonds,

490
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,990
which suit you young people better.

491
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,830
Inheritance is indeed mysterious.

492
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,620
Why are you so nervous?

493
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,970
Look at you.

494
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,660
All these years,

495
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,590
you've been doing trivial things outside.

496
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,990
It's fine because you were young back then.

497
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,190
Now that you're going to get married,

498
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,190
you should do something serious.

499
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,350
You should come back to take over the family business.

500
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,430
Trivial things?

501
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,350
Do you need me to show you

502
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,120
Wuxin's financial statement?

503
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,780
What kind of attitude is this?

504
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,360
No matter how well your company is developing,

505
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,640
should we just give our family business

506
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,840
to someone else?

507
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,150
Your grandfather loved you the most when you were little.

508
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,250
Even though he knows you are so reckless,

509
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,510
he still wants you to take over the group.

510
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,270
But look at you.

511
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,130
Do you want to let him down?

512
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,860
It's been so many years.

513
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,440
Haven't you been totally disappointed in me?

514
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,370
Our family business is...

515
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,010
This is...

516
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,310
This is the wedding gift from Uncle.

517
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,230
He didn't put it in the safe.

518
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,970
He put it on the table.

519
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,060
It means he was ready to wish us a happy marriage.

520
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,520
This is the tree.

521
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,850
I planted it with Jiang Fei

522
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,950
when I was in elementary school.

523
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,270
I hoped

524
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,180
both of us could thrive.

525
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,080
You two

526
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,670
have grown well.

527
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,790
Why don't you

528
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,990
plant one for Tangyuan after going back?

529
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,510
Mian,

530
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,710
thank you so much.

531
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,550
For what?

532
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,710
Whenever I'm here,

533
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,390
it's difficult for me to control my emotions.

534
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,350
When I see them,

535
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,590
I would recall the pain I've experienced.

536
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,860
But I think I understand their reasons.

537
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,830
But...

538
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,490
You still can't just let it go?

539
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,930
But sometimes I would think

540
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,330
if it weren't for what I've been through,

541
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,520
I wouldn't have become who I am now,

542
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,410
and maybe I couldn't have met you.

543
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,910
If I could have a happy childhood

544
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,690
but couldn't meet you,

545
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,020
-I...
-I'd rather you have a happy childhood,

546
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,370
be a carefree young boy,

547
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,790
and always be safe and lucky.

548
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,630
It doesn't matter even if you couldn't meet me.

549
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,630
If I couldn't meet you,

550
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,760
I wouldn't be lucky.

551
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,190
I really should show them

552
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,590
what kind of person Mr. Lu is in private.

553
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,430
I'm like this only in front of you.

554
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,590
Do you want other people to know?

555
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm broad-minded.

556
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,580
This...

557
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,670
Gosh, let's go.

558
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,170
Since you've met my parents,

559
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,710
the final process has been completed.

560
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,270
Well,

561
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,750
should we get married?
