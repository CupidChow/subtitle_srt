Mr. Song is looking for you.

Grandpa, I'm here.

Are you feeling better today?

Look what you've done.

10
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,420
You've disgraced our Song family.

If I were you,

12
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:21,860
I would have killed myself.

Don't call me Grandpa.

I, Song Bingzhu, have been wise all my life.

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,079

and ask me if it hurts

138
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,010

139
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,910
If many dumplings are broken in the pot,

140

It was the first time I knew

142
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,500
how being cared for felt like.

143
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,400
I was too stubborn.

144
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,040
I threw away the warmth which is

145
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,100

148
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,910

to see your hand recover.

150
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,870
I don't believe in Buddha,

151
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,900
but I ate vegetarian dumplings for a year.

152
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,180

153
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,020

154
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,510

155
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,960
none of those was fake.

156
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,090
You always thank me for saving you,

157
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,430
but the truth is the opposite.

158

It's just that

159
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,770

the only happy thing

163
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,840
in my unfortunate life

164
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,300
is that I've met you.

How did you conjure a bouquet?

187
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,230
Is it from someone else again?

189

00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,070
I'm so smart.

194
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,640
So what if I booked a bouquet in advance?

195
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,310
You're speculating a broad-minded person with your own petty mind.

196
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,620
Fine.

197
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,310
I was careless saying that.

198
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,630
I just didn't know a business celebration

199
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,780
would use roses.

200
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,950
Of course not.

201
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,760
It's because it's for you.

202
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,339
In the future,

203
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,990
you can go far, far away.

204
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,560
You don't have to be that little kid

205
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,560
who always took the string and looked back at the kite.

206
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,910
Ms. Zhou.

207
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,160
What's wrong?

208
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,840
Should I leave this team?

209
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,910
Have a seat.

210
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,350
Why did you say that?

211
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,070
Everyone is working overtime,

212
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,600
but I leave early every night.

213
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,570
I think

214
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,990
women's wear is the most important line

215
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,510
of our company.

216
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,450
But I'll work less and less time in the future.

217
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,030
I have to take two to three months maternity leave.

218
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,390
In this case,

219
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,910
previously,

220
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,950
when I worked for Baifei…

221
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,700
I sincerely congratulate you.

222
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,730
Ah?

223
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,690
Since you joined Wuxin,

224
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,550
you've done an excellent job.

225
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,300
Whether in the market

226
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,860
or inside our company,

227
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,000
you are an excellent employee.

228
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,940
You also have a happy family.

229
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,950
Two happy events happen at the same time.

230
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,700
Of course I should congratulate you.

231
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,540
Happy events?

232
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,560
Yes.

233
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,190
Because I'm pregnant,

234
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,500
my former company said

235
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
I couldn't focus on the new product.

236
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,090
I wanted to participate in the internal fashion meeting.

237
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,480
They didn't even look at my design.

238
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,670
So, later, when Miss Song wanted to put her name on my work,

239
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,150
I thought it was nothing.

240
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,570
It was useless in my place anyway.

241
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,490
I couldn't put it to use during the pregnancy,

242
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,690
the maternity leave,

243
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,780
and when I'm nurturing the baby.

244
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,800
After two or three years,

245
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,710
the design will be outdated.

246
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,990
So, it's a good thing?

247
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,130
When I cried secretly,

248
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,840
I just felt sorry that I wasn't a man.

249
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,050
In fact, many excellent men

250
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,960
also pursue such balance:

251
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,960
they have to take care of their pregnant wife,

252
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,470
feed the baby in the middle of the night,

253
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,960
and keep their kids company when they grow up.

254
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,020
All these things take a lot of energy.

255
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,990
This has nothing to do with whether you're a man or a woman.

256
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,190
A responsible person

257
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,500
can do everything well,

258
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,300
just like you.

259
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,470
Well,

260
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,910
I'm going to work now.

261
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,860
I leave early at night,

262
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,290
so I should be more efficient during the day.

263
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,740
Okay.

264
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,520
Hello, Mr. Lu.

265
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,470
David from Baifei

266
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,460
is waiting for us in the reception room.

267
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:45,990
Let's go.

268
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,350
Okay.

269
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,900
Let's meet him.

270
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,630
Your company has gone through internal changes.

271
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,530
The staff has been adjusted for so long.

272
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,790
We've been waiting patiently all along.

273
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,570
We didn't reach an agreement

274
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,880
with other brands that asked us to cooperate.

275
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,530
That's because Wuxin believes

276
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,610
sincere cooperation

277
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,070
first requires respect and understanding.

278
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,770
However, the price you proposed today

279
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,320
is a bit unreasonable.

280
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,170
This is our company's decision after much consideration.

281
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,770
After all, your company has limited experience and maturity.

282
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,570
This is the first time that you

283
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,170
have collaborated with a top-notch international brand.

284
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,730
It'll be a great help

285
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,240
for you to elevate your position in the industry and the value of your company.

286
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,100
You might as well make some compromises on the price

287
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,140
so that we can work together happily.

288
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,970
Then let's call it a day for today's meeting.

289
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,060
Mr. David, please tell your company

290
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,270
our opinions.

291
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,890
I look forward to our next meeting.

292
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,770
Okay.

293
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,920
Why do I feel like

294
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,380
you seemed certain to win?

295
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,400
Let's go.

296
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,560
Home.

297
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,210
No way.

298
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,110
It's broad daylight.

299
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,120
Didn't I perform well last night?

300
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,380
I'll get my car now.

301
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,640
What are you thinking?

302
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,980
I mean

303
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,700
let's go home and get changed.

304
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,950
Mr. David has a private dinner.

305
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,330
I asked Xin to get us two invitations.

306
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,430
I'll teach him a lesson later.

307
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,000
Let's go.

308
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,630
That's it?

309
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,750
Go.

310
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,840
By the way, you did a great job last night.

311
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,480
Long time no see.

312
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,020
Are you still busy with your new overseas project?

313
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,940
Ms. Ji, I'm leaving.

314
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,630
How is it going?

315
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,650
Everything is going well now.

316
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,450
We'll keep following up, Mr. Lu.

317
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,580
Is the intelligentization considered ideal?

318
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,710
Yes, it is.

319
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,410
I'll be right back.

320
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,800
Are you going back?

321
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,790
No. I'll be right back.

322
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,230
Okay.

323
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,970
Long time no see,

324
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,560
Ms. Ji.

325
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,170
What?

326
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,040
You're not making wedding clothes for others anymore?

327
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,580
I'm making clothes for myself now.

328
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,380
Did you start your own business?

329
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,950
Anyway,

330
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,380
we've been friends once.

331
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,240
You can come to me anytime if you need investment.

332
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,580
Not for now.

333
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,360
You have to listen to others

334
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,870
if you receive money from them.

335
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,730
The more you receive, the more you have to obey them.

336
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,670
I'll take my time and do it myself.

337
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,390
Okay.

338
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,490
I wish you a successful start-up.

339
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,180
Which big shot came?

340
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,010
To what do I owe the honor of your presence?

341
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,820
You're an honored guest that we can't even ask to see.

342
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,150
Will a designer studio like Kingdom,

343
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,590
which normally only cooperates with

344
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,120
top international brands,

345
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,770
consider working with domestic brands?

346
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,200
Mr. Hua Chi, this is my business card.

347
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,130
I hope we can work together one day.

348
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,480
-That's Hua Chi.
-Look.

349
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,180
What is Mr. Hua doing?

350
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,530
Seriously?

351
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,040
Mr. Hua Chi is wiping her skirt.

352
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,550
I'm just the brand director of the studio.

353
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,950
Let me introduce

354
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,860
the boss of Studio Kingdom,

355
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,030
a top International doll designer,

356
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Cotton Chou.

357
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,370
Mr. Lu.

358
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,630
I look forward to working with you.

359
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,640
What did he say?

360
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,910
When we met during the day, they demanded a lower price.

361
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,980
Now, even if we

362
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,360
doubled the price,

363
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,140
they'd also want to sign it.

364
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Give me your hand.

365
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,230
Did you drink?

366
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,230
No.

367
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,440
Why do you smell like alcohol?

368
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,990
Maybe it's from someone else.

369
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,900
Smell it if you don't believe me.

370
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,700
Okay, I got it.

371
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,540
Let go of me!

372
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,650
No.

373
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,400
Why are you blushing?

374
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,900
I blush every time I see you.

375
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,620
I can even feel the impact of their PDA from here.

376
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,060
Can you feel it?

377
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,830
Tell me.

378
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,750
Is it too late for me

379
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,670
to ask for her investment?

380
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,140
I didn't expect that one day I'd leave the company

381
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,400
feeling so happy.

382
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,880
That's because

383
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,710
we have our own company now.

384
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,090
Now we got rid of Lu's background

385
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,650
and pressure from many aspects,

386
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,110
we're working for ourselves.

387
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,750
Has your family agreed?

388
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,580
Who can stop me if I want to leave?

389
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,920
It's all because Lu Yunkai

390
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,180
is a good trailblazer.

391
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,540
Mr. Jiang is the one who's holding good cards.

392
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,010
He left the company with a new elite team.

393
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,320
What?

394
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,820
Shall I leave you here?

395
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,010
Don't worry.

396
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,830
I don't want to leave you.

397
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,260
They chose to go with you.

398
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,460
Their reason must be the same as mine.

399
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,660
They're also captivated by your charm.

400
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,870
We've finally moved everything.

401
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,470
My car is parked on the G2 level, too.

402
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,070
How about

403
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,530
putting it in my car?

404
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:13,950
Okay.

405
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,940
I forgot the flowers you gave me.

406
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,550
Move it over first. I'll be right back.

407
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,170
I think

408
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,260
I've forgotten something.

409
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,830
He's so meticulous about tidiness.

410
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,290
He won't be able to stand it

411
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,310
if he sees the mess in my car.

412
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,010
Luckily, I made it in time.

413
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,790
I don't think he's seen it.

414
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,630
You're back.

415
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,700
The trunk is full.

416
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,400
Put it in the front seat.

417
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,590
Wait.

418
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,010
-So neat.
-Looks like I'll be marrying

419
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
a violent wife.

420
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,570
What did you just say?

421
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:43,840
I said

422
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,460
I helped you tidy up a bit.

423
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,830
I found an amazing advantage in you.

424
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,590
What?

425
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,540
Housekeeping.

426
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,760
We've been so busy coming out from Dreams Chasing Toy

427
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,550
that we didn't have any quality time.

428
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,790
Why don't we

429
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,510
go on a date today?

430
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,590
Sure.

431
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,750
Where do you want to go?

432
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,150
Wherever you want.

433
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,310
I'll listen to you.

434
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,120
So, is this

435
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,710
where we are dating?

436
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,010
The masseurs here are very skilled.

437
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,330
And you can choose foot basins freely.

438
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,290
Isn't it user-friendly?

439
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,280
Pick one.

440
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,810
I can take it.

441
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,990
You can press harder.

442
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,630
What about you, sir?

443
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,870
Harder?

444
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,190
I...

445
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,080
Okay, harder.

446
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,100
Okay.

447
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,420
Is this level of strength okay?

448
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,830
You can press harder.

449
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,660
The same goes for me.

450
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,570
This area reflects your kidney's situation.

451
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,650
It might hurt.

452
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,960
How is it?

453
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,990
I don't feel anything.

454
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,960
No?

455
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,050
I'll press harder.

456
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,000
Is it okay?

457
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,510
Sir, can you stand it?

458
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,200
Wait for me.

459
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,780
I'll be right back.

460
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,710
Are you carrying something?

461
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,750
Surprise!

462
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,550
Is it gold?

463
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,270
No.

464
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,830
It's copper.

465
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,840
Don't you think this is

466
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,240
homophonic with your name?

467
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,270
Copper bowl, is it?

468
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,260
Yes.

469
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,270
You're not happy?

470
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,870
Isn't this romantic enough?

471
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,430
My nickname has been "Copper Bowl" since I was a kid.

472
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,410
The word I hate the most is "Copper Bowl."

473
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:13,810
You...

474
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,370
don't have to do this.

475
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,630
Just give me jewelry

476
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,150
like before.
