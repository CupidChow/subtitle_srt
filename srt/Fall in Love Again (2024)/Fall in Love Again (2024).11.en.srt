[Episode 11]

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
This is a group photo leaked

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,750
from the French design industry, featuring Helsin.

6
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,470
Take a look.

7
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,410
I believe everyone can see

8
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,210
that this is completely not you.

9
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,310
So why did you impersonate someone else

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,090
to seek a high-level position in Wuxin?

11
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,330
Helsin is now

12
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,110
one of the most famous gown designers in the country.

13
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,170
Does this also mean

14
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,260
that you are crazily exploiting the dividends of her fame?

15
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,550
Does this also

16
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,350
constitute illegal behavior?

17
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,870
Answers

18
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,090
should be given to questions.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,990
I never expected that while I'm not in the public arena,

20
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,590
the public arena has a nomination award for me.

21
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,750
Hello, everyone.

22
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,960
I'm Helsin.

23
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,720
I hope this reporter

24
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,680
will stop printing my ugly photos.

25
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,610
It would make me a bit sad to see them.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,610
All this time,

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,240
I have always been a person with a weak character

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,900
and very poor at socializing.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
So,

30
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,990
even if there are many of my works that everyone knows,

31
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,340
I hardly take part in any activities

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
or interviews.

33
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,820
So

34
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,110
it's rare to find my information online.

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,250
When I couldn't refuse the invitation

36
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,360
to the Love Enjoying Charity Gala,

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,120
my social phobia relapsed.

38
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,230
I privately asked my friend, Mian,

39
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,970
to attend the party for me.

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,180
She was just trying to help me.

41
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,790
She didn't pretend to be me.

42
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,170
Besides,

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,310
Mr. Lu knew her real name from the beginning.

44
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,630
She joined Wuxin

45
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,670
because of

46
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,370
her outstanding work ability.

47
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,770
It has nothing to do with the name of Helsin.

48
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,920
In other words,

49
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,910
there is no deception or fraud.

50
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,760
Mr. Lu is here today.

51
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,170
You can verify it with him.

52
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,250
Yes.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,630
It's even more impossible for her to bully the juniors.

54
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,490
Mian helped me regain confidence

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
and accompanied me from obscurity to where I am today.

56
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,140
She trusts

57
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,530
her subordinates

58
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,190
and gives full authority to them.

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,390
She advocates harmony in the live stream room.

60
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,920
She would stop every fight.

61
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,970
Whenever there was a charity event,

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,770
she would do her best.

63
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,990
Last time when the Neverland event ended,

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,430
she not only supervised the distribution of artificial earsnails,

65
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,420
she also asked Wuxin to start from itself

66
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,180
to provide more jobs

67
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,400
for the disabled.

68
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,340
Now some friends have successfully joined them.

69
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,920
I've never met anyone better than her.

70
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,140
I understand the reporter's intention

71
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,570
to dig up news,

72
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
but some questions

73
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,350
should still be approached objectively.

74
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,680
Since Mr. Lu is here,

75
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,020
please come on stage and say something.

76
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,940
Yes, say something, Mr. Lu.

77
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,750
I think my attitude has explained everything.

78
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,910
What's your relationship now?

79
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,810
Mr. Lu, are you officially announcing your relationship?

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,510
I think my attitude...

81
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,560
Why is he here?

82
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,110
Has explained everything.

83
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,980
I went to visit her.

84
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,750
I accidentally heard

85
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,670
someone wanted to expose her identity

86
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,200
as Helsin in public.

87
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,550
Don't forget to bring me along

88
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,280
when you expose her for identity fraud later.

89
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,750
Just say she bullies juniors backstage.

90
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,160
Don't worry. If this news gets out,

91
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,480
you'll be famous.

92
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,530
Leave it to me.

93
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,040
After Mian finishes her show,

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,960
it will be the press interview session.

95
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,090
Time is running out.

96
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,800
You can think about what to say first.

97
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,870
You knew

98
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,260
she was not the real Helsin.

99
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,350
So it's more convincing

100
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,670
to have the real person present.

101
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
I suspected something was amiss for a while,

102
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,980
so I sent someone overseas to confirm and investigate.

103
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,830
The information only came back last month.

104
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,430
But by then,

105
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,390
Mian's identity had already been confirmed.

106
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,030
So, it didn't matter anymore.

107
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,360
And I didn't bring it up.

108
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,150
So he knew about it.

109
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,290
I didn't see it at all.

110
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,080
He didn't reveal anything.

111
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,490
This man is so scary.

112
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,270
Tonight,

113
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,990
I...

114
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,850
Let me ask you a few questions.

115
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,390
You just need to answer "yes"

116
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,159
or "no".

117
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,409
Okay.

118
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,500
Have all the things

119
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,280
you've done these days

120
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,740
been sincere?

121
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,450
Of course.

122
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,920
Have you ever taken over the family factory

123
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,890
or company?

124
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,090
Whether it was six years ago or now,

125
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,100
I've always wanted to leave that family.

126
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,500
So how could I possibly take over anything?

127
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,620
Before and after the incident at Heshan Toy Factory,

128
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,220
you were not involved at all?

129
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,530
The disappearance of my father's patent certificates

130
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,390
has nothing to do with you, right?

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,980
Why are you asking me this?

132
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,910
Answer me first.

133
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,020
No, absolutely not.

134
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,780
Even if I had explained the misunderstanding from back then,

135
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,290
you still refused to accept me.

136
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,420
Was that the reason?

137
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,040
I've never been involved in these things.

138
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,370
I know nothing about it.

139
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,540
But if you are willing,

140
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,200
I can help you investigate.

141
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,530
Is what you said just now

142
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,909
true?

143
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,159
If there's even a hint of falsehood,

144
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,420
-I will...
-All right.

145
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,210
What are you doing?

146
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,760
We're on a date.

147
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,650
Not a suicide pact, right?

148
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,280
My wife just accepted me.

149
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,070
How could I contemplate suicide at a time like this?

150
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,309
I'm just overjoyed.

151
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,720
Look, my wife is crying.

152
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,350
Take care.

153
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,250
Okay.

154
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,820
I've been dealing with the patrol officer all by myself.

155
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,920
It's fine if you don't help,

156
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
but you're laughing.

157
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,980
You seem to handle him well.

158
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,820
What's wrong?

159
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,280
I'm dying.

160
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,060
Is my kissing technique so good

161
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,320
that it's making you feel like you're on cloud nine?

162
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,250
You almost suffocated me to death.

163
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,730
Take a deep breath then.

164
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,840
Daddy, you're back.

165
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh?

166
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,980
Mian.

167
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,680
You are dreaming.

168
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,900
Let's go back and sleep.

169
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,540
Are my parents back?

170
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,830
Mr. Lu.

171
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,010
Have you gained weight as a middle-aged man?

172
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,210
How is that possible?

173
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,230
I missed you so much that I couldn't eat or drink.

174
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,510
I yearned for you until I became haggard.

175
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,880
How could I gain weight?

176
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,400
What a smooth tongue.

177
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,520
Why don't you taste it to see

178
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,480
if my tongue is smooth?

179
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,250
Mian.

180
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,270
I miss you so much.

181
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,230
I miss you too.

182
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,770
But

183
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,220
every time you saw me,

184
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,440
you were so cold to me.

185
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,390
My heart was hurt.

186
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,520
I've always been afraid

187
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,840
of what my life

188
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,950
would be like

189
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,850
if I never saw you again.

190
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,100
If I hadn't accidentally found out about the toy factory

191
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,540
and didn't want my father to have any regrets in his life,

192
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,780
I might never have had the courage to come back.

193
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,810
Only recently have I been able to confirm that,

194
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,890
despite those misunderstandings,

195
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,200
you are such a faithful person.

196
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,610
How did

197
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,660
your hand heal?

198
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,470
I just practiced slowly.

199
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,740
You don't have to

200
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,310
pretend to be so indifferent in front of me.

201
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,320
Actually,

202
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,630
it started with learning how to sculpt clay tigers

203
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,500
from an old master in Chinatown.

204
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,720
Gradually,

205
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,190
I got into traditional handicrafts.

206
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,720
It's both a way to cultivate myself

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,250
and keep my fingers nimble.

208
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,110
Isn't it good to have both gains and losses?

209
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm just frustrated

210
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,600
that I couldn't be by your side

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,600
every time you needed me.

212
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,450
We still have plenty of time in the future

213
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,180
to create beautiful memories.

214
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,120
Who was the one rushing just now?

215
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,230
Mr. Lu, are you just pretending to be tough

216
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,880
when your skills are actually rusty?

217
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,060
Later,

218
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,990
I'll show you

219
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,830
how good I am.

220
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,910
Mian.

221
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,340

[Every man is responsible for keeping men's virtue]

223
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,130
Daddy, why are you making breakfast today?

224
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,210
The flowers are so beautiful.

225
00:13:59,170 --> 00:13:59,490
Hey.

226
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,460
This is not for you.

227
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,980
Then why did you make them so beautiful?

228
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,580
To coax a girl.

229
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,890
I have good news for you today.

230
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,090
What is it?

231
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,060
I'll tell you later.

232
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,980
Daddy, I had a dream last night,

233
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,360
where you broke the vase

234
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,750
and Mian was here.

235
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,180
Mian, you really came.

236
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,990
So I wasn't dreaming.

237
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,820
Let's eat.

238
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,920
I dreamed of you and Daddy hugging.

239
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,330
It wasn't a dream, was it?

240
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,000
It was too cold yesterday.

241
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,340
So Mian and I hugged to warm ourselves up.

242
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,080
Daddy, what was the good news you mentioned earlier?

243
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,710
The good news is

244
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,090
that Mommy is going to live with us.

245
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,280
Mommy!

246
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,560
I told you Mian is my Mommy.

247
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,630
Yes.

248
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,810
Mian, we three

249
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,240
will never be separated.

250
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,750
Yeah!

251
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,850
But

252
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,750
I never took care of you

253
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,830
nor have I been by your side.

254
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,680
Sweetheart,

255
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,030
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,980
I'm not blaming you.

257
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,710
I knew you would come back.

258
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,170
Daddy said Mommy loves me too.

259
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,470
And you must have a special reason

260
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,700
for not being able to come back temporarily.

261
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll never leave you again, okay?

262
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,160
All right!

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,480
Pinky promise!

265
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,490
Ah.

[Understanding Women]

267
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,520
This book is so thin.

268
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,990
It should be useless.

269
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,280
Even so, I want to read it too.

270
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,040
What's wrong?

271
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,609
What's the problem?

272
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,690
Is it about Miss Tong?

273
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,750
Why do you

274
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,190
look so radiant?

275
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,480
Nothing.

276
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,030
I'm just an average old man

277
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,180
who got some nourishment.

278
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,830
Hey.

279
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,830
I heard that

280
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,980
your design projects

281
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,720
are going well.

282

Don't worry.

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,040
I'll warm the nest for you.

284
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,330
Just jump over.

285
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,920
Are you leaving?

286
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,120
Hasn't Ji Yaoqing come to see you again?

287
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,050
I guess he won't come to me again.

288
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,630
She wanted me to publicly expose your impersonation of Helsin.

289
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,050
Now that she's been embarrassed,

290
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,910
she'll have to lay low for a while.

291
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,510
Well,

292
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,460
how are things with your parents?

293
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,800
What are you doing?

294
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,530
A million fans are waiting to see it.

295
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,590
What are you doing?

296
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,220
Do you think

297
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,790
it's a good idea to show this to others?

298
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,620
You know nothing.

299
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,930
This kind of content boosts followers quickly.

300
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,460
You know?

301
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,950
Many minor streamers have already become popular.

302
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,280
Your dad and I will definitely become popular too.

303
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,370
Pick up the phone.

304
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,250
Leave her alone.

305
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,180
Let's continue.

306
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,850
Ji Yaoqing actually thinks

307
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,250
threatening me with them will really work.

308
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,860
I wish she would hurry up and deal with them.

309
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,940
Nowadays, anyone with a smartphone

310
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,890
can produce video content.

311
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,040
But some people refuse to share ordinary life

312
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,840
and just want to seek attention.

313
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,180
Moreover, their video content is vulgar.

314
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,120
The platform won't promote it.

315
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,400
Don't worry.

316
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,310
The policy is tightening.

317
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,770
Someone will control it.

318
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,720
That's why I never told them

319
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,430
what I've achieved abroad.

320
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,480
They won't be proud of me.

321
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,630
They would just see me

322
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,320
as material to fulfill their dreams of fame.

323
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,520
I, Hua Chi,

324
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,510
and our colleagues

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,130
are all proud of you.

326
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,160
Before, they promoted Helsin extensively,

327
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,680
hoping to expose

328
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,960
the impersonation one day

329
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,430
and maximize the negative impact.

330
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,540
But now, their plan backfired.

331
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,280
Instead, they've helped us.

332
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,070
What do you mean?

333
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,960
We enjoyed the benefits they provide.

334
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,150
I'll organize a design exhibition for you

335
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,950
while riding on the popularity.

336
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,150
You've always wanted to develop in China, right?

337
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,950
This is the best chance to cut in.

338
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,510
Really?

339
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,370
I've asked Hua Chi to arrange it.

340
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,550
Sis.

341
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,940
This is a new product specially prepared for you.

342
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,430
Try it.

343
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,430
What's wrong?

344
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,710
Why that expression?

345
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,670
I thought

346
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,900
I'd be the one

347
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,540
asking questions first.

348
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,270
Why can't we be frank with each other?

349
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,310
I thought

350
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,510
you had an idea.

351
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
It was you, right?

352
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,720
It was you who exposed the incident of me

353
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,120
using Helsin's identity

354
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,410
and arranged for journalists

355
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,580
to publicly challenge me at the event.

356
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:38,850
Am I right?

357
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,540
Why did you say that?

358
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,990
Because I saw you.

359
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,390
Even if you hid in the crowd

360
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,090
and lurked in the shadows,

361
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,950
I still saw you, clear as day.

362
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,790
And the photo the journalist had

363
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,340
was quite interesting.

364
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,980
I remember it was from that year

365
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,250
when Xin was at the Paris Fashion Week,

366
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,800
and I took it for her.

367
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,530
After developing it,

368
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,730
I placed it in my room.

369
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,680
Except for you,

370
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,970
no one could get their hands on it.

371
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,760
So,

372
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,470
are you here to accuse me?

373
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,670
Is it because I didn't listen to you

374
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,870
and left Wuxin?

375
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,920
First, you extensively published articles

376
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,320
to boost the exposure of the name "Helsin,"

377
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,770
leaving a deep impression

378
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,500
on the public and online users.

379
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,070
Then, you publicly exposed my identity

380
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,870
at a large-scale press conference,

381
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,530
sparking extensive discussion and attention.

382
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,840
This way,

383
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,620
you could force me out of Wuxin

384
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,590
due to damage to my reputation

385
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,390
while severely harming the company's image.

386
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,290
But what I'm more curious about

387
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,420
is your relationship with Ji Yaoqing.

388
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,010
Previously, Ji Yaoqing found Xin twice.

389
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,050
I thought it was a coincidence.

390
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,570
However, the timing of both of you

391
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,050
trying to expose my impersonation

392
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,380
is just too consistent.

393
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,130
Ji Yaoqing came to poach me first,

394
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,430
and then you came to persuade me to accept the job offer.

395
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,890
It's impossible for everything to align so perfectly, right?

396
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,230
You saved me.

397
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,120
When I was struggling the most,

398
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,570
you were by my side.

399
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,220
You were my only solace and support

400
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,650
in a foreign land.

401
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,100
Sometimes I think

402
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,320
that we are more than just friends.

403
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,590
Many blood relatives

404
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,760
may not even be able to be like us.

405
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,550
So I don't blame you this time.

406
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,040
I remember you told me

407
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,950
that we are allies in the victims' alliance

408
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,230
against Lu Yunkai.

409
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,600
So if you see me getting back together with him,

410
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,900
you will feel uneasy or resentful.

411
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,650
I can understand.

412
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,990
But I wonder

413
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,700
if there might be some misunderstandings

414
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,110
between you and Yunkai,

415
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,750
like there were between him and me.

416
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,920
If you are willing,

417
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,570
I can try to help you with that...

418
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,230
Zhou Mian.

419
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,470
Alright.

420
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,430
Take your time to think about it.

421
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,710
If you're willing,

422
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,700
I'll be waiting for you anytime.

423
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,960
Zhou Mian.

424
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:23,990
Sis.

425
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,110
You two

426
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,670
get back together?

427
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,700
Yes.

428
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,630
I checked his work schedule

429
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,950
as you suggested.

430
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,630
Go.

431
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,920
Teach him a lesson.

432
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:56,770
Okay.

433
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,240
I think

434
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm alone again.

435
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,350
Mike.

436
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,500
Mike.

437
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,190
Come out and play.

438
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,350
Auntie,

439
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,640
can I ask Mike

440
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,550
to play football with us downstairs?

441
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,920
He needs to study.

442
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,910
Don't come to him again.

443
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,180
Okay.

444
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,370
Alright.

445
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,740
Here.

446
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,340
Mike.

447
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,390
What's the use of fussing over a minor injury?

448
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,190
You'll miss the next tutoring session.

449
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,390
You're so weak just from having a fever.

450
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,310
How are you going to achieve anything in the future?

451
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,400
Grandpa.

452
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,670
Young man.

453
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,430
I'm Mike.

454
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,650
The donation ceremony is over.

455
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,780
Mr. Lu is going back.

456
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,510
Grandpa.

457
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,200
I'm Mike.

458
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,890
Lu Yunkai, right?

459
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,890
You don't

460
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,840
look so good.

461
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,710
Let's see

462
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,010
whose hands

463
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,440
the Lu family's business will end up in.

464
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,330
I'm sorry.

465
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,040
I'm not interested.

466
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,050
Suit yourself.

467
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,550
Lu Shangnian.

468
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,580
Don't speak so harshly.

469
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,290
How many honors has Mike received?

470
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,660
How many accomplishments has Mike achieved?

471
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,890
Isn't he stronger than that son of yours?

472
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,900
They have the same inheritance.

473
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,170
What do you mean Mike doesn't stand a chance against him?

474
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,330
Let me tell you.

475
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,750
I'll definitely have the last laugh.

476
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,820
Still sitting there?

477
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,740
Can't you have some dignity?

478
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,780
Step on that little brat

479
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,510
and give me some satisfaction.

480
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,150
Useless!

481
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,720
You're back.

482
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,560
The dumplings are ready.

483
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,450
Let's eat.
