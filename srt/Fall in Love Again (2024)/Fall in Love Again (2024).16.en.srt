[Episode 16]

4
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,480
So look at my Chinese knot.

5
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,670
Look at this part.

6
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,070
Yours is too outdated.

7
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,660
Outdated?

8
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,160
Yes.

9
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,510
Yours is so ugly.

10
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,590
You are ugly.

11
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,150
Look at the last version.

12
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,150
The last version I modified for you is so good.

13
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,870
You can continue this...

14
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,100
This is a Chinese knot.

15
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,280
The concept of Chinese heart.

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,170
What's the most popular now?

17
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,030
Youths with Chinese traditional style.

18
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,750
Do you understand?

19
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,270
Yes.

20
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,430
Chinese knot is good.

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,320
But do you know

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,720
what the domestic and foreign trends are now?

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,350
Am I an international top designer

24
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,310
or are you an international top designer?

25
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,259
Why am I not?

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,320
Were you made arrogant just because they held an exhibition for you?

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,850
Yeah.

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,400
Gosh.

29
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,229
You really...

30
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,990
Now...

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,990
Now you...

32
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:54,729
Let me tell you.

33
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,130
Stop arguing.

34
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,220
I made you some ginseng soup.

35
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,550
Drink it while it's hot.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
There are many snacks.

37
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,470
Eat more.

38
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,020
Tong Wan.

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,700
The red dates, wolfberries,

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,230
and longans you brought us last time haven't been finished yet.

41
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,110
Why don't you stop sending them?

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,510
How could one possibly complain about having too many good things?

43
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,990
Just eat as much as you can.

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,320
I'll go easy on you.

45
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,630
Do you think this hat

46
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,740
matches this kind of clothes?

47
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,470
No.

48
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,670
Of course. Right.

49
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,430
But think about it.

50
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,270
Are we making a clothing line now?

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,770
What do you think?

52
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,020
Analyze it. Bro.

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,260
This clothing line is about haute couture, right?

54
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,230
But this is the ready-to-wear line.

55
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,820
Do you think they are the same?

56
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,890
Isn't ready-to-wear clothing just the line for mass-market fashion?

57
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,800
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,770
Are these two...

59
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,790
Didn't you say

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,790
you can't stay up late for health care?

61
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,030
You don't care about health care anymore?

62
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,590
Have you

63
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,590
been staying up late for a long time?

64
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,970
But

65
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,340
look at the amount of my hair.

66
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,850
Losing any hair makes me a sinner.

67
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,150
It won't be too late today.

68
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,100
I don't think we'll stay up late.

69
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,650
Look.

70
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,890
These

71
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,920
snacks,

72
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,770
blankets,

73
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,850
coffee,

74
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,350
and the massager

75
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,420
you brought

76
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,510
are enough.

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,500
So you should go back to sleep.

78
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,010
I don't think so.

79
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,950
Lu Yunkai came to Jiang Fei.

80
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,120
Jiang Fei came to me.

81
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,690
The employer paid me a lot

82
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,860
to take care of you.

83
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,770
What have you done wrong?

84
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,590
You've already scored 12 points out of 10.

85
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,150
Go.

86
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,430
Go.

87
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,470
Hurry up.

88
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,810
You should go to bed early too.

89
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,880
I'm almost done.

90
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,310
I'm going to bed.

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,110
The boss is still here.

92
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,240
Why are you leaving?

93
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,640
You are so troublesome.

94
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,990
Look at her.

95
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,470
Sis.

96
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,690
I've redesigned

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
the landscape-style heels.

98
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,779
What do you think?

99
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,000
[I'm at the door. Do you want to watch fireworks?]

100
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,610
Is it okay?

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,909
Not bad.

102
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,400
Scan it

103
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,030
and sync it to the group chat.

104
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,700
Okay.

105
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,130
I'm at the door.

106
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,680
Do you want to watch the fireworks?

107
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,190
Fireworks are not allowed in the urban area.

108
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,790
I know.

109
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,000
That's why I brought the Fairy Stick.

110
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,510
To show you some brightness.

111
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,510
It's been soaked in seawater too heavily.

112
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,630
There aren't many photos

113
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,290
salvaged from that old phone.

114
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,750
I had to run through several repair shops

115
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
to retrieve them.

116
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,290
It's okay.

117
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,050
Just being able to see Tangyuan is enough.

118
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,670
Wasn't it said

119
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,890
that there would be fireworks under the Eiffel Tower at ten?

120
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,610
Why haven't they started yet?

121
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,400
That's how the French are.

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,980
Sometimes they're not that precise.

123
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,980
They are relaxed and comfortable.

124
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,440
Just wait a little longer.

125
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:56,670
Sis.

126
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,010
Do you really like fireworks?

127
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,670
Not really.

128
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,420
I just feel a bit stifled.

129
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,980
I just want to see something bright.

130
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,080
Then let me show you some first.

131
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,030
Sis.

132
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,470
Last time at the café,

133
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,280
you said we would keep in touch.

134
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,740
Are you too busy recently?

135
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,790
At that time, I didn't know

136
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,190
what your relationship with Lu Yunkai was.

137
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,060
I even naively thought

138
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,150
that maybe there was some misunderstanding

139
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,270
between you two.

140
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,510
Maybe you can resolve the misunderstanding

141
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,770
through my mediation.

142
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,190
But I didn't know

143
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,020
you had done

144
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,500
so many things on your own.

145
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,030
You used the incident at the toy factory

146
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,030
to keep me away from him all this time.

147
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,550
But then I thought about it.

148
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,310
It was you who told me

149
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,740
that the land belonged to his family and kept hinting that there were

150
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,400
suspicious people involved.

151
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,250
In order to achieve your goal,

152
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,190
you used Original

153
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,710
and then cooperated with Song Bingzhu.

154
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,080
Your alliance is quite extensive.

155
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,730
Sis.

156
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,700
You know?

157
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,470
I know.

158
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,390
I know a lot about you.

159
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,240
Sometimes, just by making a few associations,

160
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,040
I can uncover even more details.

161
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,340
For example,

162
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,710
when I first arrived in France,

163
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,510
you cut off the network in my room

164
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,350
to prevent me from contacting the outside world.

165
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,030
Naturally, I couldn't find those messages from Lu Yunkai

166
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,070
seeking me out.

167
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,730
As the days went by,

168
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,180
my hatred towards him grew deeper.

169
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,340
Then, at the Chinese Style Ceremony,

170
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,400
I got into an argument with Nan Jiang.

171
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,590
Reporters immediately received the news

172
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,190
and criticized me in public.

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
She's Original's popular streamer

174
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,650
and someone close to Mr. Song.

175
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,110
Your tactics are really cunning.

176
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,710
Sis.

177
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,150
Have you ever trusted me?

178
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,030
Before I got

179
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,360
the exact information,

180
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,270
I had never suspected you.

181
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,790
I trusted you so much,

182
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,930
but you treated me like a fool.

183
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,160
Sometimes I even think

184
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,590
I can't deny you

185
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,010
because of your mistake.

186
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,550
After all, we've got along with each other for so long.

187
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,150
You must have true feelings.

188
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,460
But now,

189
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,880
I have to measure you again.

190
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,500
Your hand is bleeding.

191
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,410
You can't use alcohol.

192
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,140
There's an open wound.

193
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,790
It will be irritated.

194
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,710
It's okay.

195
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,510
I'll go get some alcohol spray.

196
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,030
No.

197
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,860
There's an open wound.

198
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,060
It will be irritated.

199
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,710
This time,

200
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,650
don't let me down again.

201
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,120
How dare you question me?

202
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,030
When I started the company,

203
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,550
you were still in your mother's womb.

204
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,280
You have no right to tell me what to do with Song's.

205
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,950
Grandpa.

206
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,660
That's not what I meant.

207
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,710
Then what do you mean?

208
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,270
Didn't several of the loudmouths

209
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,350
get shut down by PR?

210
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,580
But more people are popping up every day.

211
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,240
What are you murmuring about?

212
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,540
If it weren't for

213
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,460
everyone watching me closely lately,

214
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,090
do you think the public opinion about Wuxin would look nice?

215
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,510
Once this storm blows over,

216
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,470
I'll sue each of them for defamation.

217
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,270
Grandpa, don't you understand?

218
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,470
It's already difficult

219
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,530
for this matter to pass at this stage.

220
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,030
You always say such pessimistic things.

221
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,760
Why don't you go back to France and live your life?

222
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,220
If you're capable, you should straighten out this mess.

223
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,150
Grandpa, don't be angry.

224
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,510
The doctor said

225
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,120
it's bad for your health.

226
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,910
Enough.

227
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,710
You can leave.

228
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,630
Any news?

229
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,480
Zhou Mian

230
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,430
told me about Wuxin's design concept

231
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,890
for this livestream show.

232
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,310
They're going to focus on Chinese porcelain.

233
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,240
Did she tell you?

234
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,350
Yes.

235
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,800
Women are soft-hearted.

236
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,580
She and Lu Yunkai

237
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,990
aren't as inseparable as we think.

238
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,590
Since you're protecting her,

239
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,150
I will

240
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,070
let it go.

241
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,500
Wuxin has been busy

242
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,990
preparing for this livestream show.

243
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,590
They've put all their manpower and energy into it.

244
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,250
Why don't we get ahead of them?

245
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,950
Let's follow their theme

246
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,610
and leave them with no way out.

247
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,880
What do you mean?

248
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,500
You want to snatch Wuxin's design concept?

249
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,710
Just let the media launch it.

250
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,480
You don't need to worry about it.

251
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,860
Can you wake up?

252
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,050
Original could have been fine on her own.

253
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,080
But you keep competing with Wuxin.

254
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,790
It not only involves others

255
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,250
but also drains yourself.

256
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,580
In the past two years, we collaborated with Song's

257
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,280
and claimed to be a comprehensive business company.

258
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,940
In reality,

259
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,000
we just picked up design tasks that others didn't want,

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,490
doing work without any technical value.

261
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,890
It neither creates value

262
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,350
nor enhances achievements.

263
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,230
Can you stop being used by others?

264
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,690
This is not

265
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,310
a proper business cooperation.

266
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,550
Do as I say.

267
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,590
We live to chase the light.

268
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,710
If you always stay behind others,

269
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,350
it means

270
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,750
you'll forever be in their shadow

271
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,080
and never surpass them.

272
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,750
Do as I say.

273
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,340
Get lost if you can't.

274
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,260
Okay.

275
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,630
Our fate ends here.

276
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,920
October 11th, 14:27.

277
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,450
I,

278
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,940
Ji Yaoqing,

279
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,380
resign from the position of CEO of Original.

280
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,120
The first batch of samples has been completed.

281
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,190
If you have time,

282
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,790
you can join me to take a look.

283
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,350
Sure.

284
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,310
Mr. Lu.

285
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,720
Here is the news

286
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,910
from major media outlets this morning.

287
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,790
Take a look.

288
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,630
Song's unexpectedly announced the design theme ahead of time,

289
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,760
and it's porcelain.

290
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,910
The two images they provided

291
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,420
are exactly the same as the cultural relics

292
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,500
we referenced.

293
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,470
I've uploaded it.

294
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,550
Sis.

295
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,210
I have an emoji pack that I've been collecting for a long time.

296
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,340
Do you want to take a look?

297
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,680
[Don't come near men. You'll be miserable.]

298
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,910
Go to sleep.

299
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,120
By the way,

300
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,200
did you shred the documents I asked you to shred?

301
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,240
I was too busy.

302
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,400
They're still on the shredder.

303
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,460
Do you want me to shred them now?

304
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,030
No.

305
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,680
Just give them to me.

306
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,980
Overall,

307
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,170
while porcelain

308
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
is indeed a good choice,

309
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,100
But for young women who are

310
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,810
at their twenties and thirties,

311
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,680
clothing designs should still prioritize practicality

312
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,720
and the ability to showcase personality.

313
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,910
And regarding the porcelain theme,

314
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,150
I feel that using

315
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,330
simple prints

316
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,020
and fixed color palettes

317
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,270
in the form of cutting corners

318
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,550
will greatly

319
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,930
compromise the design.

320
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,920
And the elements

321
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,320
of the shapes are too exaggerated.

322
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,030
So,

323
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,850
I've decided to revert to the original plan.

324
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,150
Vice President, you just mentioned wanting to ensure a design

325
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,720
that is

326
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,150
both grounded in reality

327
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,670
and full of design sense

328
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,710
through partial heavy work.

329
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,910
Do we have specific techniques in mind?

330
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,940
We'll use Hangzhou embroidery.

331
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,880
Hangzhou embroidery developed to its peak during the Southern Song Dynasty,

332
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,300
also known as Song embroidery.

333
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,869
It combines the strengths

334
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,960
of four major embroidery styles in

335
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,510
Suzhou, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guangdong.

336
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,670
Whether it's the refined embroidery techniques

337
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,359
such as even stitch,

338
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,760
interlocking stitch, and running stitch

339
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,000
or the court embroidery

340
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,349
represented by gold-plated embroidery, gold, and silver thread embroidery,

341
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,990
it is recognized as a challenging art form

342
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,190
in the global fashion industry.

343
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,930
It balances understatement and luxury,

344
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,589
while also having rich cultural connotations.

345
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,800
Here.

346
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,560
Let me offer our esteemed guest

347
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,780
a drink.

348
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,630
Why do you call me an esteemed guest?

349
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,750
Recently, I visited my grandparents' house

350
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,430
and found

351
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,760
my uncle and aunt there.

352
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,550
They were quite emotional.

353
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,510
You should

354
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,000
go back when you have time.

355
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,410
You're the one who rushed out of the house.

356
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,240
Why did you ask me to go back?

357
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,470
That makes no sense.

358
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,730
Let's discuss it later.

359
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,930
If Mian is willing,

360
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,110
I'll take her back.

361
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,750
It's up to you.

362
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,150
What?

363
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,990
Have you been making efforts to help me

364
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,790
break away from the Lu's lately?

365
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,440
I heard

366
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,590
there have been some difficulties.

367
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,590
What did you hear?

368
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,790
Well, it's said

369
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,030
that Wuxin originally planned to do a porcelain theme,

370
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,510
but then clashed with Song's

371
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,980
Now, with the competition approaching,

372
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,090
all plans

373
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,050
are facing difficulties.

374
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,290
Speaking of which,

375
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,170
this is the smoke bomb I threw.

376
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,590
How did you fall for it?

377
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,090
But this is good.

378
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,920
It'll look better this way.

379
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,150
So you have the winning hand, right?

380
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,880
At first,

381
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,470
if it was a fair competition, there would still be some suspense.

382
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,030
Now,

383
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,880
since they are on the wrong path,

384
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,720
they have no chance of winning.

385
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,720
Mian just designed a trap.

386
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,480
They fell into it voluntarily.

387
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,390
Song's

388
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,450
hastily switched to a porcelain theme.

389
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,040
Actually,

390
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,770
they've dug themselves a hole.

391
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,490
They are the ones who need to change designs.

392
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,350
Even if they rush to finish,

393
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,070
the quality

394
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,600
will probably be mediocre at best.

395
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,190
You really should look in the mirror

396
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,030
and see your ugly face

397
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,970
when you praise Zhou Mian.

398
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,710
You should thank her.

399
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,060
Once the collaboration with Baifei is settled,

400
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,660
you can confidently switch over

401
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,320
and independently handle the design business.

402
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,710
Whose message is that?

403
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,770
You look so gentle.

404
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,250
Speak of the devil.

405
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,510
I have something urgent.

406
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,190
I have to go.

407
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,430
What is it?

408
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,900
I saw only an emoji on it.

409
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,430
What emoji?

410
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm leaving.

411
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,590
Show me.

412
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,730
Mr. Jiang. The meeting...

413
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:09,990
Mr. Jiang.

414
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,550
Clean it up yourself

415
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,070
and go.

416
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,720
Mr. Jiang.

417
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,010
It's time for the meeting.

418
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,510
Okay.

419
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,030
Just now...

420
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,620
Don't get me wrong.

421
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,070
I mean

422
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,430
we are chopsticks brothers.

423
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,440
What do you mean?

424
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,060
The chopsticks

425
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,580
are straight.

426
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,940
I didn't misunderstand anything.

427
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,320
Good.

428
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,730
There are some rumors in the company.

429
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,530
As long as you don't get me wrong.

430
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,360
What’s wrong, Mian?

431
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,600
I rushed here

432
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,560
as soon as I received your message.

433
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,900
The embroidery artisans I previously hired

434
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,020
got sick

435
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,140
because of the flu.

436
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,220
I didn't ask them to keep working.

437
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,670
They should prioritize their treatment.

438
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,350
Later,

439
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,390
I found

440
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,390
a manufacturer specializing in robotic arm weaving.

441
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,250
They could achieve both vertical

442
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,430
and wrap-around stitching techniques.

443
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,080
Their robotic arms' sensitivity

444
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,990
could easily handle our tasks.

445
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,340
However,

446
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,110
the business director, Wang Gang,

447
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,270
unexpectedly demanded

448
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,830
a very high commission.

449
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:37,950
When he heard

450
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,160
that our work was sporadic,

451
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,510
he didn't even want to deal with us anymore.

452
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,110
Later,

453
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,360
I tried to contact their boss,

454
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,150
but he was too engrossed

455
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,510
in technology research

456
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,480
and couldn't be reached.

457
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,920
Finally, I understood

458
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,230
why this technically advanced company

459
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,190
couldn't thrive.

460
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,760
It’s okay, Mian.

461
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,990
I'll give him a gift on behalf of you.

462
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,120
It won't work.

463
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,640
I told them before

464
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,290
I could introduce them to the top brands.

465
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,010
But they were indifferent.

466
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,190
There are no deals that can't be made,

467
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,320
only insufficient bargaining chips.

468
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,750
I'll give him

469
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,430
an offer he can't refuse.

470
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,280
Tong Wan?

471
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:53,470
Be together!

472
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,760
What are you doing during working hours?

473
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,700
Watching a marriage proposal.

474
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,960
Someone is proposing.

475
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,000
Go back!

476
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,010
Stop looking. Let's go.

477
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,370
Let's go.

478
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,250
Why do you propose at the entrance of my company?

479
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:11,670
Who is this?

480
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,330
Director Zhang of Daming Technology.

481
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,590
Why is he in my company?

482
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,060
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

483
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,660
I’ll deal with it right away.

484
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,430
Mr. Jiang.

485
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,380
I'm...

486
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,040
Daming Technology, right?

487
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,750
Yes.

488
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,950
Zhang Bin.

489
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,440
We met before.

490
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,910
I don't remember.

491
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,870
If you are so rude to my people again,

492
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,800
I'll talk to your boss personally.

493
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,940
My people?

494
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,600
Mr. Jiang, don’t be angry.

495
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,090
Shut up!

496
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,720
What are you looking at? Go to work.

497
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,110
What

498
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,800
did Mr. Jiang mean just now?

499
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,450
Aren't you single?

500
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,170
Whether I'm single or not

501
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,630
has nothing to do with you.

502
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,110
You've seriously affected my work.

503
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,070
Please leave.

504
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,750
Or I'll call the security.

505
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,470
Mr. Jiang,

506
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,270
you've sprayed too much water.

507
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,070
What's your relationship with Zhang Bin?

508
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,950
We met once.

509
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,190
Once?

510
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,610
Just once, and he's proposing to you?

511
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,870
The people in this world come in all shapes and sizes,

512
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,200
and I've been greatly affected by him too.

513
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,230
Let me tell you.

514
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,180
He is the kind of man who is fickle in love,

515
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,040
falling for every woman he meets.

516
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,920
You better keep your eyes open.

517
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,680
Don't worry.

518
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,340
I'm not interested in him.

519
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,610
I've noticed you've had quite a few admirers lately.

520
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,420
Do you know why you attract so many unworthy admirers?

521
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,620
Please enlighten me.

522
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,430
Because you haven't had an outstanding,

523
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,280
serious,

524
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,740
successful admirer

525
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,730
to outshine those unworthy ones.

526
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,870
You're right.

527
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,710
Well,

528
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,110
I'm going to post a matrimonial ad

529
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,600
in the company's executive group chat right now.

530
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,200
Come back.

531
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,470
How can you use

532
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,470
the company's resources like this?

533
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,190
I mean,

534
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,300
why do you have to look far and wide?

535
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,980
Are you referring...

536
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,310
To Feng from the secretary's office?

537
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,550
He's 1.85 meters tall and graduated from a prestigious school.

538
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,580
He's really likable.

539
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,300
Get out.

540
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,290
Okay.
