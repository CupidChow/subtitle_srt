[Fall in Love Again]

00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,430
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,510
I know you're big

5
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,190
in the video platform circles.

6
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,250
But it doesn't match our line of work.

7
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,710
And don't expect me to do you any favors.

8
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,930
When that female vice president of yours

9
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,900
came to me,

10
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,039
I already told her that.

11
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,470
I just came to visit.

12
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,780
My apologies.

13
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,310
You're very straightforward.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
But I really can't

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,229
take this order.

16
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,140
It's not enough

17
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,840
demand yet.

18
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,320
All the orders we've been discussing recently are big ones.

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,650
For small ones, let's talk about it later.

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,490
When the time comes,

21
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,820
I'll arrange it for you.

22
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,070
Your boss,

23
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,360
Jiang Hezhi,

24
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,990
is a very upright and filial person.

25
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,990
He always listens

26
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,150
to his father.

27
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,450
His father Jiang Fengyan,

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,910
when he was young,

29
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,329
was wrongly convicted by officials who took bribes

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,490
and was imprisoned.

31
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,750
Although he was soon acquitted,

32
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,630
what he hates the most

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,010
is corrupt bribe-takers.

34
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,730
What are you trying to say?

35
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,190
Nothing.

36
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,870
I just installed some cameras

37
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,540
in this room

38
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,829
to record the evidence of you taking bribery.

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,030
If you don't mind,

40
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,350
I'll show them what you've done.

41
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,150
You...

42
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,150
You!

43
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,560
Bah!

44
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,310
How was it?

45
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,340
That Wang Gang looks a bit aggressive.

46
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,110
Be careful.

47
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,350
This fried chicken is a good bargain.

48
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,829
Yes.

49
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,910
It's delicious too.

50
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,770
It smells good.

51
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,820
I wonder who invented

52
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,870
the durian flavor and garlic flavor.

53
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,110
What a genius!

54
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,240
It's truly great.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
How many times have I told you

56
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,240
that you can't eat fried chicken at night?

57
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,950
Just a little.

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,280
A little.

59
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,230
A little?

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,750
Tell me.

61
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,560
What good can come from eating fried chicken?

62
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,649
Eating fried chicken

63
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,310
will grow

64
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,190
smiles.

65
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,390
Excuse me.

66
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,340
Where did you buy the chicken?

67
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,830
If you walk to the intersection ahead,

68
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,090
you'll see a long line.

69
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,470
That's the restaurant selling fried chicken.

70
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,880
How about we take you there?

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,650
No, thanks.

72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,590
Brother,

73
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,170
can I add you on WeChat?

74
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,909
Sorry.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,010
It's okay.

76
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,470
Hello?

77
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,110
I...

78
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,310
may need some relationship advice.

79
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,120
Can you come over later?

80
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,150
No.

81
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,850
I'm in a hurry to get home.

82
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,850
Lu Yunkai, you...

83
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,830
You're amazing.

84
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,670
You got it done in one go.

85
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,330
Did you

86
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,010
give a more tempting offer than I did?

87
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,070
No.

88
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Wang Gang

89
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,460
is all about personal gain.

90
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,220
If you're trying to introduce a big client to him,

91
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,550
he's gonna be a pain in the ass to deal with,

92
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,130
because In the end, it's just going to help the company.

93
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,990
He can't get any benefits from it,

94
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,030
so naturally, he's not gonna be very excited about it.

95
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,400
In that case,

96
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,670
you spent a lot.

97
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,230
No.

98
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,390
Let's get down to business.

99
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,840
When are they going to deliver the goods?

100
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,660
They said, as long as we

101
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,090
send the fabric

102
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,910
and

103
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,560
clear illustrations over,

104
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,960
they'll work on it as soon as possible.

105
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,880
Because our order is small,

106
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,550
the production line probably only needs to be open

107
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,350
for 1 or 2 days.

108
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,250
There's plenty of time left for cutting afterward.

109
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,350
I heard Song's say

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,310
they're going to buy tickets on the day of the livestream.

111
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,830
Do you think...

112
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,040
Don't worry.

113
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,760
I've arranged for the data team

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,190
to do real-time data surveillance on the day.

115
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,310
If there's anything fishy,

116
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,170
they will submit it to the regulators immediately.

117
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,320
If they dare to do anything,

118
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,990
they won't get off easily.

119
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,390
Finally, I can get a good night's sleep.

120
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,630
Turn off the lights.

121
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,280
Can I have a love reward?

122
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,080
I've been too tired these days.

123
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,310
It's okay.

124
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,540
Hey, I already said...

125
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,390
Is it over?

126
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,820
Are you done resting?

127
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,800
If you are,

128
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,460
let's move on to the next part.

129
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,010
Next part?

130
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,470
Ah.

131
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,230
What's wrong?

132
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,230
Tong Wan.

133
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,810
Can you not arrange such activities next time?

134
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,970
I'm all bruised up.

135
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,950
Youngster,

136
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,950
you are too weak.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,130
It'll get better if you exercise more.

138
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,240
Oh.

139
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,400
Yes.

140
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,390
I'm weak.

141
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,470
See you tomorrow, Auntie.

142
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,230
See you tomorrow.

143
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,510
Bye bye.

144
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,630
By the way,

145
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,040
I heard from Yunkai that

146
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,830
Jiang Fei seems to have...

147
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,120
What?

148
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,010
What? What do you think?

149
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,630
It's not clear.

150
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,440
Is going in a positive or negative direction?

151
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
Thank goodness.

152
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,680
He finally got through to you.

153
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,830
Although I'm not used to you like this,

154
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,630
but

155
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,580
I heard

156
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,370
Jiang Fei seems to be an awkward person too.

157
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,530
He doesn’t really get close to women.

158
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,560
You two make

159
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,190
a great couple then.

160
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,350
You're quite compatible.

161
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,830
Really?

162
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,960
I thought you didn't like him.

163
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,630
So what if I don't like him?

164
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,510
Even if I don't like him,

165
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,750
you can do what your heart tells you to.

166
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,720
As long as it doesn't affect our relationship.

167
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,310
Based on your personality,

168
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,630
will you be taking action right away

169
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,360
since you've already decided?

170
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,370
I think

171
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,290
his birthday is coming up soon.

172
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,350
Tong Wan's love

173
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,820
is different from the repeated entanglements between Lu Yunkai and me.

174
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,000
The time they spent together

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,260
is the best testimony to their feelings.

176
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,930
Day after day,

177
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,200
finding someone to be by your side,

178
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,770
finding a heart that resonates with yours, in harmony.

179
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,790
Tong Wan.

180
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,450
Why are you still here?

181
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,750
How can I run away

182
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,440
when my boss is still here?

183
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,500
I told you

184
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,960
you don't have to work overtime with me.

185
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,240
Are you worried about the overtime fee

186
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,640
or are you worried about me being tired?

187
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
What do you think?

188
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,260
Not many young men are richer than you in this city.

189
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,710
I'm guessing

190
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,320
it's the latter.

191
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,070
You're worried I'll be too tired.

192
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,130
No need to thank me.

193
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,070
I heard that, in order to save money,

194
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,010
when there are license plate restrictions,

195
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,670
you hitch rides home.

196
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,080
It's not safe.

197
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,990
So,

198
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,090
will you drive me home then?

199
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,000
It's not on the way.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,320
I meant to say that

201
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,680
you can take a taxi.

202
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,340
You...

203
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,010
Want me to send you home?

204
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,430
Tong Wan.

205
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,910
Happy birthday.

206
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,360
How do you know it's my birthday?

207
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,710
Is there anything wrong

208
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,030
with the information on your records?

209
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,110
I've only celebrated my birthday once.

210
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,850
It was when I was 15.

211
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,750
I won the grand prize in the piano competition.

212
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,220
My mother was very happy.

213
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,930
She bought me a cake

214
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,520
and said I was her pride and joy.

215
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,440
I didn't know you can play the piano.

216
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,980
I don't like playing piano.

217
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,440
I don't like music either.

218
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,960
Because these things are full of emotions.

219
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,800
And emotions are the enemies of rationality.

220
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,390
But my mother likes them.

221
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,810
In order to please her,

222
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,930
I practiced like crazy every day.

223
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,810
It worked at first.

224
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,210
She praised me every time I won an award.

225
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,370
But then it stopped working.

226
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,630
She would just feel worse

227
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,940
and act crazier

228
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,350
because my success

229
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,150
reinforced her failure.

230
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,070
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,750
I didn't know all that.

232
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,240
I'll take care of it right away.

233
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,060
Tong Wan.

234
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,790
Can you tell me

235
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,110
how you used to celebrate your birthday?

236
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,180
I...

237
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,910
would buy cakes,

238
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,240
have parties,

239
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,770
receive gifts,

240
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,130
and have a big meal.

241
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,510
We have the cake.

242
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,190
The two of us

243
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,210
count as a small party too.

244
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,910
Now,

245
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,200
we're just missing the gifts.

246
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,910
Luckily,

247
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,030
I came prepared.

248
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,120
Tong Wan.

249
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,590
Can I choose a gift that I like?

250
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,100
Thank you for the gift.

251
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,760
I really like it.

252
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,600
You...

253
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,130
You're so good at this.

254
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,710
I have a reasonable suspicion

255
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,430
that you're guilty of workplace harassment.

256
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,440
So,

257
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,390
you only have one choice.

258
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,390
Date me.

259
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,110
So,

260
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,320
the gifts are buy one, get one free?

261
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,940
God is so kind to me.

262
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,100
This must be the best birthday

263
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,270
of my life.

264
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,020
We finally finished our work

265
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,310
and it's the weekend too.

266
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,540
We have some free time.

267
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,770
It's perfect for physical activity.

268
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,090
It's almost the weekend.

269
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,580
I haven't been with Tangyuan for a long time.

270
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,670
The three of us

271
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,990
can spend time together.

272
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,380
When Liu brings him back,

273
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,580
let's play video games

274
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,600
and watch cartoons tonight, okay?

275
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,280
This isn't the physical activity

276
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,290
I was referring to.

277
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,330
Liu, where's Tangyuan?

278
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,450
Miss Song picked him up for a play date.

279
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,190
[Haibin Park]

280
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,690
It's about time you realized.

281
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,589
Hurry up.

282
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,150
Hurry up.

283
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,830
Tangyuan!

284
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,880
He's fine.

285
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,430
He's just sleepy from eating too much.

286
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,850
That's how it feels to worry about your family.

287
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,580
Perhaps you understand it now.

288
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,930
Are you doing this

289
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,760
because the lawyers

290
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,450
released new evidence today?

291
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,500
I remember, during that event competition,

292
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,700
I could feel your love for your grandpa,

293
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,680
and respect and adoration.

294
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,630
But think about it

295
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,030
as a designer.

296
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,970
This kind of stealing,

297
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,210
plucking elements

298
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,240
and plagiarism,

299
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,630
is it a bit much?

300
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,210
I'm not here to hear this.

301
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,550
I don't care.

302
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,860
I only know that my grandpa has a weak heart.

303
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,950
The reputation that he's been building all his life

304
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,210
has been ruined by you.

305
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,330
When he saw the news today,

306
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,660
he was so angry that he almost fainted.

307
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,560
If you're criticizing me for that,

308
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,940
that's just not right.

309
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,740
Because I didn't slander him

310
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,720
nor provoke him.

311
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,780
I just want him to be responsible

312
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,640
for what he did.

313
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Actually, this kind of case is hard to win.

314
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,700
Determining plagiarism and borrowing legally

315
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,470
is always particularly difficult

316
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,240
because of the fear of wrongly convicting an innocent person,

317
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,300
so they often let people off the hook.

318
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,060
Mr. Song knew this very well.

319
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
That's why he did more and more of it.

320
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,910
It's not that I don't want to let him go,

321
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,830
but when he took these shortcuts,

322
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,460
he already started digging his own grave.

323
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,050
You're always so good at blathering.

324
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,420
My grandpa was already in poor health.

325
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,830
And now because of

326
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,350
your actions,

327
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,610
he's lying in the ward.

328
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,160
He's just an old man.

329
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,950
Grandpa worked hard for Song's all his life.

330
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,210
I'm just trying to make it easier for him.

331
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,590
You don't need to morally blackmail me.

332
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,320
The live runway show with Song's is coming up.

333
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,360
I wonder how confident you are.

334
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,950
Song's doesn’t really need this order.

335
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,810
But for

336
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,300
Wuxin, that just started a new design business,

337
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,500
it's very important.

338
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,930
If you stop now,

339
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,570
I can still help you.

340
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,530
You're violating professional ethics,

341
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,130
you know?

342
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,230
What kind of attitude is that?

343
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,030
My attitude is I'm not accepting your conditions.

344
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,410
I'll get what I want

345
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,510
by myself.

346
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,330
I didn't eat any unhealthy tidbits.

347
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,180
Really?

348
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,950
Yes.

349
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,630
Let me see.

350
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,260
Do you know your mistake now?

351
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,950
-Yes.
-Yes.

352
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,310
What did you do wrong?

353
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,310
I shouldn't have let Dad

354
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,680
get close to some sisters and aunties.

355
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,790
Take Miss Song for example.

356
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,490
They hang out lots

357
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,880
and seem close.

358
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,300
She said I was going to see Dad today

359
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,660
so I agreed.

360
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,940
I made Mian worry.

361
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,250
I shouldn't have.

362
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,340
If Dad keeps doing this,

363
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,090
I will definitely criticize him.

364
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,670
Mian.

365
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,750
Mian.

366
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,630
It's Dad's turn.

367
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,930
What did you do wrong?

368
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,840
Dad didn't do anything wrong.

369
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,050
Dad was afraid you'd be lonely

370
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,880
if you stood alone

371
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,010
so he stood with you.

372
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,670
Tangyuan.

373
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,280
Next time, besides Mom and Dad

374
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,270
and Mr. and Mrs. Liu,

375
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,730
no one else can pick you up,

376
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,850
do you hear me?

377
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,710
You made my wife worried.

378
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,800
The kid is watching.

379
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,220
He can't see.

380
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,920
You have to work harder.

381
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,750
Now,

382
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,950
work is clearly more attractive

383
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,930
than I am.

384
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,040
Ms. Zhou.

385
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,760
Here's the file from the other company.

386
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,420
See if there're any problems.

387
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,760
It's fine.

388
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,760
Let's move it forward.

389
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,430
Okay.

390
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,750
Why are you staring at me

391
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,160
and not saying anything?

392
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,840
I'm sighing silently.

393
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,320
I didn't expect that

394
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,880
being a freeloader could be so blissful.

395
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,690
You keep an eye on everything

396
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,420
and manage everything yourself.

397
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,500
Aren't you tired?

398
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,750
It's the first shot.

399
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,310
It should be more precise

400
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,830
to prevent any mistakes.

401
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,330
So I'm more assured if I'm overseeing it personally.

402
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,220
All I can do

403
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,080
is cheer for you.

404
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,880
You're too modest, Mr. Lu.

405
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,630
Before, for the issue that I was so busy over

406
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,630
and still couldn't solve,

407
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,560
you resolved it with one sentence.

408
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,030
It's in my nature

409
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,580
to do things for Mian.

410
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,020
I must do my best.

411
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,110
Where did you learn this cringey line from?

412
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,700
Oh, also,

413
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,710
the model agent will be here soon.

414
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,450
I'm going to re-check the comp cards

415
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,030
that were screened previously.

416
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,300
Now that it's finalized,

417
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,830
we can finally cast people.

418
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,240
You must be busy too.

419
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,890
Why don't you get to work?

420
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,190
Go.

421
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,500
Didn't you go to work?

422
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,580
What I'm doing now

423
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,240
is what I'm busy with.

424
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,480
Is it that interesting?

425
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,400
I didn't expect that

426
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,110
Mr. Lu likes to see pretty girls too.

427
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,030
No.

428
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,270
Then why did you lean over?

429
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,960
It's a misunderstanding.

430
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,620
I'm a very virtuous man, okay?

431
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,740
Usually when a brand invites me to a show,

432
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,070
if they give me a V-neck,

433
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,940
I always wear thermal underwear underneath.

434
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,030
And I only watch the autumn and winter shows.

435
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,710
I don't even attend the spring and summer releases.

436
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,170
It was just a coincidence.

437
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,950
Well,

438
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,060
are you wearing thermal underwear today?

439
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,920
Let me see.

440
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,870
Hey.

441
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,730
I'll send you there.

442
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,490
You take care of it.

443
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,530
I won't attend it.

444
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:23,920
Come.

445
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,110
It's work.

446
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,850
Don't get so wound up about male virtues.

447
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,620
What's wrong?

448
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,830
You looked like you were thinking about something

449
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,560
when reviewing the comp cards.

450
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,760
I'm thinking, the models we chose this time

451
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,160
are the best candidates,

452
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,310
but

453
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
it feels like something is missing.

454
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,600
For now,

455
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,320
there's no way

456
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,840
that we'll have better choices of models.

457
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,230
As you said,

458
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,920
this is already the best choice in the industry.

459
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,240
Boss.

460
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,510
Several of the agencies

461
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,090
said the promised models

462
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,530
can't come anymore.

463
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,100
They're refusing to make the appointment,

464
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,720
or found some models

465
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,020
who are a lot worse than the previous ones

466
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,180
to come for interviews.

467
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,780
One agency politely said that it's difficult,

468
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,300
but they couldn't go against Song's.

469
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,570
It's obvious who did it.

470
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,190
She really spent a lot

471
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,990
to make things difficult for us.

472
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,570
How many models are still available?

473
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,030
Hello, it's our big opening sale.

474
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,370
Please take a look.

475
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,780
Sir, 20% off storewide. Take a look.

476
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,780
Take a look, we sell everything.

477
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,200
Sir, please have a look. It's our big opening sale.

478
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,120
Actually, there're still mature models.

479
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,020
I've already arranged to re-screen the younger models

480
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,810
for the right style and qualities.

481
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,500
I'm also contacting big overseas models.

482
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,080
Although it's a bit of a rush,

483
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,160
we'll find a way.

484
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,080
I'll do my best.

485
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,230
We've always

486
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,080
been honest

487
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,430
and upright in our dealings.

488
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,270
I hope Song's

489
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,000
won't make any more trouble.

490
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,170
Don't worry.

491
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,070
Be flexible.

492
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,090
Pretty girl, take a look. 20% off storewide.

493
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,440
Our shop is right ahead on the left.

494
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,390
What's wrong?

495
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,620
You're not worried about the models anymore?

496
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,220
Worried?

497
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,380
Worrying is never something I should do.

498
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,550
I've already found a model.
