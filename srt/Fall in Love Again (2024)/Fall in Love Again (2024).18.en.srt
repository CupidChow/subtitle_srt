[Episode 18]

4
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,760
Our shop is right ahead on the left.

5
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,670
What's wrong?

6
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,950
You're not worried about the models anymore?

7
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,539
Worried?

8
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,710
Worrying is never something I should do.

9
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,240
I've already found a model.

10
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,450
Be careful. Don't ruin it.

11
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,500
That's it.

12
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,180
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

13
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,750
Ms. Zhou.

14
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,410
Make it heavier here.

15
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,460
Ms. Zhou.

16
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,410
Please take a look. We have revised this project.

17
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,670
Is there anything else we need to change?

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,190
The final assessment of this project

19
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,750
needs to be modified

20
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,230
according to the influence of the designer.

21
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,680
Sure, go ahead.

22
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,390
Okay.

23
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,820
Ms. Zhou.

24
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,340
Are the clothes ready?

25
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,140
Yes.

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,600
Remember to keep them properly.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,480
Don't forget to take the accessories too.

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,670
Oh, we've already unloaded the clothes and props.

29
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,400
The shoes should be here soon.

30
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,070
Okay, you go ahead and get busy.

31
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,730
Okay, Ms. Zhou.

32
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,570
Everyone,

33
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,579
get to work.

34
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,350
Sir, are you okay?

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,120
How do you drive?

36
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,290
Did I hit you?

37
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,740
Be careful next time.

38
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,910
Sister, you're here.

39
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,550
You bought new shoes?

40
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,079
Sister, don't they look familiar?

41
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,960
This is...

42
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,960
Our collaboration with Feng Di last year.

43
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,890
It was launched in China this year.

44
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,250
I saw it when I passed by

45
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,950
the designer store downstairs.

46
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,950
What do you think?

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,180
It's nice.

48
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,670
It's so cool.

49
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,760
I left a pair for you too.

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,950
I'll bring them to you when I'm at the lounge.

51
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,520
Okay.

52
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,800
Ms. Zhou.

53
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,450
Something went wrong with the shoe delivery car.

54
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,580
The driver called and said the tire was punctured.

55
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,730
It will take at least half a day

56
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,670
to get it fixed.

57
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,180
But we only have

58
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,910
a couple of spare heels left backstage.

59
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,280
Where is it? Is it far?

60
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,860
If it's not, ask someone to get it.

61
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,940
It's some distance away.

62
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,800
Given the current rush hour conditions,

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,550
a trip there and back

64
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,350
wouldn't be in time for the show.

65
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,970
The show is about to start.

66
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,650
What should we do without shoes?

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,480
Coming up next is Wuxin's

68
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,010
Tang and Song Dynasty-themed showcase.

69
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,640
For those of you in front of the screen,

70
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,040
you can start voting now.

71
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,360
Next, our 3 judges will vote.

72
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,890
Before that, judges,

73
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,060
do you have any questions?

74
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,990
I like Chinese culture very much.

75
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,890
I know Tang and Song

76
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,310
are both prosperous dynasties.

77
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,970
What design concepts

78
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,370
were created by combining the two?

79
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,669
The Tang Dynasty was open-minded and had diverse beauty standards.

80
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,250
They encouraged

81
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,510
full-bodied beauty.

82
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,159
In an age where

83
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,409
body dissatisfaction is a common refrain,

84
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,010
and where narrow aesthetics are a constraint,

85
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,490
using the past as a mirror is a kind and firm reminder

86
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,280
to modern women.

87
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,270
The Song Dynasty came after Tang,

88
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,800
bringing new innovations.

89
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,290
In the Song Dynasty, more women

90
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,400
could love freely,

91
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,040
have the right to file for divorce,

92
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,180
could work in business,

93
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,630
and could inherit family property.

94
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,830
They were free-spirited,

95
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,950
had more choices,

96
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,750
and among all the feudal dynasties,

97
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,880
that was when women had the most power.

98
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,300
The clothes combine Song embroidery

99
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,790
and Tang Dynasty elements

100
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,270
to take into account the female consciousness of both dynasties

101
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,400
and to witness the awakening of

102
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
inner strength in all women.

103
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,830
This is in line with Baifei's

104
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,660
light fashion, which advocates

105
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,970
for free-spirited consciousness.

106
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,830
it's a perfect match.

107
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,390
Thank you.

108
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,450
I've always found

109
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,950
Chinese culture fascinating.

110
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,440
After listening to you,

111
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,310
I've gained new insights again.

112
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,680
Although Wuxin's designs

113
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,090
have good intentions,

114
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,730
but I have to say,

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,300
the level of completeness of the styling

116
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,270
is much worse than Song's

117
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,360
presented works.

118
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,850
The overall fashionability

119
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,380
was destroyed by sneakers.

120
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,500
In the industry's big and small shows,

121
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,330
there's no such thing as

122
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,390
pairing sneakers with high fashion.

123
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,060
This makes us wonder if

124
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,630
Wuxin's design business

125
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,240
isn't mature enough yet.

126
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,830
Indeed.

127
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,200
Besides high heels,

128
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,550
we also chose to pair the clothes with sneakers.

129
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,810
But it's the opposite.

130
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,350
Choosing the right sneakers

131
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,110
for the right clothes,

132
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,130
that's where the ingenuity of this line lies.

133
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,030
What should we do without shoes?

134
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,890
Sister, why are you looking at me?

135
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,960
I need you to use my card

136
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,830
and buy more designers' shoes.

137
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,770
I'm happy to serve you.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
The fashion king, Mukal,

139
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,630
used his ability to be unique

140
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,860
in the fashion industry

141
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,320
to make ready-to-wear and haute couture collections

142
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
for several international brands.

143
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,940
They've been very popular.

144
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,510
Although he is old,

145
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,180
he is bolder than many

146
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,230
excellent young designers

147
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,670
and can sense early opportunities even better.

148
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,830
For example, 10 years ago,

149
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,880
he was the first to notice the rise of street style

150
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,090
and used sneakers in couture,

151
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,180
breaking people's stereotypes of haute couture.

152
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,920
For the public,

153
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,750
the clothes on stage are to look at,

154
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,950
not for wearing.

155
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,120
Fashion tends to

156
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,430
focus on more impactful visual effects

157
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,760
and lack practicality.

158
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,340
But Mukal combined trendiness

159
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,830
and wearability perfectly

160
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,710
so that fashion can be reborn.

161
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,240
Maybe, that's why

162
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,110
he is called the fashion king.

163
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,820
Some designers think that clothes

164
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,350
should be unique,

165
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,260
but they neglected one thing.

166
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,280
Clothes are meant to be worn by people.

167
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,870
Only when people can wear them comfortably,

168
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,500
is the mission of the clothes fulfilled.

169
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,800
In this design,

170
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,560
Wuxin pays homage to our predecessors,

171
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,160
and also balanced comfort and design

172
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,970
in everyday women's clothing.

173
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,110
In my opinion,

174
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,830
the "light" in light fashion

175
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,520
is an adverb of degree

176
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,250
and a reference to the age of the target group.

177
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,670
Modern women at this age

178
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,460
have more

179
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,120
diverse and avant-garde interpretations of clothing.

180
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,290
Our work is designed

181
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,200
not to restrict them

182
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,420
and to encourage them to make choices

183
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,390
and be themselves,

184
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,530
whether that's cute, casual,

185
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,090
cool or matured,

186
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,750
they can all wear the clothes they like,

187
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,150
free from the whims of other people

188
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,670
and be beautiful women.

189
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,710
Now, 2 judges on the panel have chosen Wuxin.

190
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,620
How will the viewers of the livestream

191
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,660
choose?

192
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,680
Congratulations to Wuxin

193
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,400
for winning by a huge margin

194
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,610
of 72%.

195
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,810
Congratulations.

196
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,720
It's been a trending topic for the past 2 days.

197
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,340
It's not just the women suffering from body dissatisfaction that are resonating with it.

198
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,410
Many confident and independent young girls

199
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,870
are also very supportive.

200
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,000
Baifei is really weird.

201
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,120
The votes from the professional judges and online viewers

202
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,180
were a no-brainer.

203
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,220
And yet, I haven't been approached about a contract.

204
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,280
No work talk in the house!

205
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,700
Okay.

206
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,190
Come, let Dad hug you.

207
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,240
Mian, hug.

208
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,160
Let's go upstairs.

209
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,740
Can you stop talking?

210
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,400
Ms. Song,

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,490
I really can't do it.

212
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,760
Ms. Song,

213
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,210
you have a visitor.

214
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,390
What a rare guest.

215
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,460
What brings you here?

216
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,840
As your future partner,

217
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm here to ask about

218
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,600
the progress of the collaboration with Baifei.

219
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,740
After all, it's been a while

220
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,190
since the runway competition.

221
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,320
It's my duty

222
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,290
to come visit.

223
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,170
I can't say we'll be working together.

224
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,050
The company is considering the fact that Rimu Tuyuan

225
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,450
is a phenomenal streamer

226
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,270
with lots of personal fans

227
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,540
who might've flooded the livestream

228
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,340
and messed up the voting result.

229
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,480
Only after a second investigation

230
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,340
will we consider collaborating.

231
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,510
The company's considerations,

232
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,880
I'll respect them, of course.

233
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,830
But how long will this investigation take?

234
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,360
There's a fashion industry summit coming up.

235
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,590
My award-winning works will be on display at the conference.

236
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,910
So, I've been busy lately.

237
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,440
Please wait for the notice.

238
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,600
Or...

239
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,590
Actually, you do know

240
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,450
when the investigation will end.

241
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,110
After all, it's an industry summit.

242
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,730
You can join us if you have time.

243
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,150
Sorry.

244
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,620
You may not be able to get in at all.

245
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,770
As far as I know,

246
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,300
only the real Helsin

247
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,900
got the invitation.

248
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,070
Unfortunately,

249
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,270
I have something to do. I won't keep you.

250
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,740
Are you

251
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,840
really happy like this?

252
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,030
Of course I am.

253
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,960
I can make things difficult for you.

254
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,290
Why wouldn't I be happy?

255
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,120
Your acting

256
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,460
is still

257
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,580
as bad as ever.

258
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,560
Whether I'm happy or not, what do you care?

259
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,710
M-M-Ms. Song.

260
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,670
I said no.

261
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,000
Can you guys stop talking about this?

262
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,060
How much more do you want?

263
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,470
I'll transfer it.

264
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,030
It's not because of the money, Ms. Song,

265
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,430
but my health.

266
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,590
That's why I think...

267
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,250
Jiang Ning.

268
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This is not the time for you to beg me.

269
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,190
The industry summit is about to begin.

270
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,650
Don't make trouble at this critical moment.

271
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,370
What do you want me to do?

272
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,510
You want me to die?

273
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,720
But I'm really not in a good state.

274
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,680
I can't draw it.

275
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,020
Then why don't you go and think of something?

276
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,750
Why are you standing here talking nonsense to me?

277
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,050
Useless.

278
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,220
Sister.

279
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,830
Here.

280
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,950
Sister, it's hard on you.

281
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,250
Do you usually do

282
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
all the running around by yourself?

283
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,350
Sister, you're working so hard.

284
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,810
Why didn't Brother come to drive you around?

285
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,340
You're such a great girl.

286
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,130
How can anyone bear to let you suffer?

287
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,070
Luckily, I came to pick you up today.

288
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,450
He's a CEO,

289
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,660
not a driver.

290
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,610
It's such an honor to be able to drive you around.

291
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,010
I can't even begin to say how much I envy him.

292
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,880
I'm begging you.

293
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,900
By the way,

294
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,340
look up someone for me.

295
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,790
Someone close to Song Ruozhao

296
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,850
called Jiang Ning.

297
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,580
Sister, don't worry.

298
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,510
Since you asked,

299
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,310
I will do everything I can

300
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,500
and find out every little thing about her.

301
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,460
Let's go.

302
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,800
Yunkai, are you looking for me?

303
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,740
Yes.

304
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,960
What for?

305
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,530
I hope

306
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,750
what's between us

307
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,470
stays between us.

308
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,090
Don't take it out on others.

309
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,640
What do you mean?

310
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,610
Zhou Mian has been really wrapped up in work

311
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,650
for this case.

312
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,820
I hope

313
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,250
won't make things difficult for her

314
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,320
because of our personal relationship.

315
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,970
Lu Yunkai.

316
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,650
Do you think I'm giving her a hard time

317
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,660
because of you?

318
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,110
Because she's in charge of the design this time,

319
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,970
that's why I'm holding off on signing the contract?

320
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,860
You're so confident.

321
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,070
What do you think you are?

322
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,680
You did that to my grandpa

323
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,320
and you dare say that with a straight face.

324
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,500
Mian.

325
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,840
Mian.

326
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,710
Mian.

327
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,970
Mian.

328
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,950
You have no idea

329
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,990
how much it hurts

330
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,830
when someone points their nose at you

331
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,760
and asks you what you think you are.

332
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,960
You are a good thing.

333
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,670
Good stuff.

334
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,550
Our Yunkai is hot stuff.

335
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,020
In my heart,

336
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,810
you are the best person.

337
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,840
Thank you for the comfort, Mrs. Lu.

338
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,720
I will believe

339
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,190
everything you said.

340
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,730
Okay.

341
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,760
Alright.

342
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,930
The show is over.

343
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,810
Let's get down to business.

344
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,160
Why did you go to see her?

345
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,720
Actually, I went to see you.

346
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,670
There've been updates to

347
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,280
the Song's fiasco again.

348
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,080
Song Bingzhu's condition worsened due to this.

349
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,280
Didn't she look for you twice before?

350
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,570
She got more and more out of line.

351
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,190
If she finds out about

352
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,760
Song Bingzhu's condition,

353
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,430
I'm afraid she'll be too emotional.

354
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,500
I vaguely remember,

355
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,440
when she was young,

356
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,390
she hurt some small animals

357
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,050
because of intense emotions.

358
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,220
You went alone

359
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,370
without telling me.

360
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,770
I was worried about you

361
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,280
so I rushed over.

362
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,620
Luckily, you're fine.

363
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,970
So,

364
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,710
I went to check on her

365
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,720
and came back after.

366
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,760
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

367
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,720
By the way,

368
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,030
you said

369
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,330
Song Ruozhao was acting strange today.

370
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,030
Yes.

371
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,600
Both her and her assistant were weird.

372
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,640
But I've already asked someone

373
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,850
to investigate this matter.

374
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,410
Okay.

375
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,550
This is?

376
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,570
Didn't you ask Xin

377
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,440
to find related videos

378
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,530
before and after the toy factory accident

379
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,930
to get clues from the details of the videos?

380
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,390
So I asked the programmers in the program department

381
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,720
to create an automated screening program

382
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,750
to search all the videos online.

383
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,460
The program will search based on

384
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,030
keywords in the title,

385
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,090
upload location and time,

386
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,970
and other factors

387
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,630
to do a comprehensive search.

388
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,560
It's been tweaked many times.

389
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,060
This current version

390
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,520
has no problems with the underlying logic and efficiency.

391
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,790
Because of the volume of work,

392
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,780
it's like finding a needle in a haystack,

393
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,440
so there's been little progress in this matter.

394
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,250
This is a lot more convenient.

395
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,200
I've been thinking lately.

396
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,610
If my parents were still alive

397
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,810
and I could have you all at the same time,

398
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,760
I would be so happy.

399
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,560
Let me tell you.

400
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,550
Before my dad got into trouble,

401
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,820
he was quite unlucky.

402
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,790
First, he was reported

403
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,420
for stealing students' works

404
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,950
and put them under his name.

405
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,030
Before they could investigate,

406
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,740
due to controversy

407
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,670
and public pressure,

408
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,890
he left a job that he had worked for half his life.

409
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,680
He was quite a proud man

410
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,550
who aged a lot suddenly.

411
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,390
Later, he thought

412
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,550
he and my mom

413
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,960
could just run the toy factory at home

414
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
and nothing else,

415
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,660
but then there was the forced eviction,

416
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,440
a fire broke out on the circuit

417
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,980
and the accident occurred.

418
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,510
Although Jiang Fei said

419
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,590
they didn't demolish it by force,

420
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,050
the man at the gate said

421
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,620
he saw a group of people visiting the factory.

422
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,460
The truth

423
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,930
is still unclear.

424
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,780
Song Bingzhu,

425
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,740
what role he plays,

426
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,670
we still don't know.

427
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,190
I'm so unfilial.

428
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,230
Because of my hand injury,

429
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,860
I thought

430
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,230
I might never be able to make toys again,

431
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,430
so for a long time,

432
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,170
I didn't want to hear anything about the toy factory

433
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,760
and I pushed them away.

434
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,630
Then, because we were preparing for the wedding,

435
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,100
I got back on my feet again.

436
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,660
It's okay. It's all over.

437
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,870
Mr. Jiang!

438
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,380
Mr. Jiang.

439
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,950
Please help me.

440
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,730
Who are you?

441
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,180
This is the information of our company.

442
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,110
Help me, Mr. Jiang.

443
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,600
What are you doing?

444
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,070
I beg you.

445
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,670
Security.

446
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,380
Mr. Jiang.

447
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,360
You must help me.

448
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,220
No! Let go of me!

449
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,700
Mr. Jiang, help me! Mr. Jiang!

450
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,720
You have to help me,

451
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,340
Mr. Jiang!

452
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,380
Let me go.

453
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,400
It's okay, I'll do it.

454
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,230
Let me.

455
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,310
Let me.

456
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
I'll do it.

457
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,750
You don't have to do this.

458
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,950
Let me do it.

459
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,770
I won't let you do it again.

460
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,920
Am I interrupting?

461
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,450
Why are you coming in if you know that?

462
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,060
I'll go then.

463
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,840
Go.

464
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,350
If you have something to discuss,

465
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,450
I'll leave now.

466
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,470
How did you do it?

467
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,020
What do you mean?

468
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,970
I thought you were growing flowers.

469
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,320
They don't bloom at all.

470
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,830
Never mind that.

471
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,360
Why are they all so green?

472
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,410
You're the green one.

473
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,030
Your whole family is green.

474
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,010
You are also in my family.

475
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,490
I passed by

476
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,640
so I came up to say hi.

477
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,180
On Baifei's end,

478
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,460
Song Ruozhao keeps getting involved.

479
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,470
The collaboration keeps getting delayed.

480
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,000
There's no way to settle it.

481
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,950
No matter how hard she tries to make excuses,

482
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,180
it's only temporary.

483
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,170
As time goes by,

484
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,670
the French headquarters will put pressure on them.

485
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,470
Besides,

486
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,870
Wuxin's design team is famous enough.

487
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,960
Even if they want to sow discord,

488
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,790
it won't help, I think.

489
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,780
What?

490
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,350
Why is this folder on the flower rack?

491
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,230
Don't mention it.

492
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,870
Downstairs, there was

493
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,630
a young, failed entrepreneur.

494
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,670
[Resume]

495
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,880
He was making a racket

496
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,840
and insisted on handing this to me.

497
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,780
The security already stopped him

498
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,740
but he still shoved it to me.

499
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,810
Liu Zhiming.

500
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,640
Jiangbei Design University.
