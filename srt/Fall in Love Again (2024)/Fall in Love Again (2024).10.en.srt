[Episode 10]

4
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,710
Mian.

5
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,270
I finally managed to get a reservation

6
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,930
at your favorite restaurant.

7
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
He called her Mian.

8
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:15,950
Okay.

9
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,289
Just this once then. Never again.

10
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:18,900
Okay.

11
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,190
Yunkai?

12
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,720
Yunkai.

13
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,590
Yunkai!

14
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,150
Hi, Yunkai.

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,840
Tomorrow is my birthday.

16
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,789
Happy birthday.

17
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,240
Man.

18
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,710
You're being so perfunctory, I'm going to get mad.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,450
Unless...

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,040
You give me a bouquet of flowers as a gift,

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,300
then I'll forgive you.

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:26,900
Ruozhao.

23
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,890
Sorry.

24
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,710
Flowers are just plant corpses.

25
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,750
I don't see how they can be gifts.

26
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,040
I have a meeting.

27
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,970
I'm hanging up now.

28
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,480
Bye bye.

29
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,579
It's okay.

30
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,190
Yunkai.

31
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,960
He treats everyone like this.

32
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,130
He seems gentle and polite,

33
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,630
but is actually very cold.

34
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,330
Yes.

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,880
He wasn't just targeting me.

36
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,690
He's like this to everyone.

37
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,800
So it's not that he doesn't know how to gift flowers.

38
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,310
He just didn't want to gift me flowers.

39
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,600
He's not cold to everyone either.

40
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,990
He just gave his warm heart

41
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,530
all to Zhou Mian.

42
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,780
But Zhou Mian...

43
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,660
Helsin.

44
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,700
Is she really Zhou Mian?

45
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,100
What?

46
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,909
Is your company so desperate for employees?

47
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,840
You're even interested in a lowly assistant like me?

48
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,850
This doesn't match with

49
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,800
the information that I got.

50
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
But I'm surprised

51
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,780
you are willing

52
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,810
to settle for a lesser role.

53
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,170
Though I wonder

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,820
if your parents are willing.

55
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,570
I know

56
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,600
you haven't been lacking for money

57
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,590
so no matter how high a salary I offer,

58
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,950
I can't tempt you.

59
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,240
But your parents

60
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,550
signed a contract for a broadcast platform

61
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,150
that's owned by Original.

62
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,630
You'll see how much you can do

63
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,640
if you come over,

64
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,190
so you don't have to reject me in a hurry.

65
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,310
You can still think about it.

66
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,860
Original is always open for you.

67
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,220
Of course,

68
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,950
I'm looking forward to working with you

69
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,350
to amaze more people too.

70
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,400
Come in.

71
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,230
Mr. Jiang.

72
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Where is Tong Wan?

73
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,090
Tong Wan is on leave this afternoon.

74
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,220
She's on her way out.

75
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,020
I don't remember approving her leave.

76
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,840
Mr. Jiang.

77
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,970
Tong Wan saved up a lot of annual leave

78
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,260
and she's only applied for half a day off.

79
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,660
She just needs to tell HR.

80
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,440
She doesn't need your approval on the office automation system.

81
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,140
Where's she going?

82
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,080
I don't know.

83
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,760
But she seemed to be in a good mood.

84
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,420
She even changed her clothes.

85
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,260
Mr. Jiang?

86
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,470
Mr. Jiang.

87
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,620
Mr. Jiang.

88
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,159
Why are you here?

89
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,030
I...

90
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,600
was just passing by.

91
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,559
Passing by here?

92
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,890
We're 10 train stops from the office.

93
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,070
I have a reasonable suspicion that

94
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,670
you're trying to change your job and you're out for an interview.

95
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,010
As the CEO of the company,

96
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,540
I have the right to conduct an investigation.

97
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,070
Tong Wan,

98
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,020
calm down.

99
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,940
Anger causes insomnia, chest tightness,

100
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,070
hair loss, and a host of other problems.

101
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,460
With the current state of your hair,

102
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,630
you can't afford to lose a single hair.

103
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,450
Aren't you going to explain?

104
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,480
Explain what?

105
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,740
I took time off.

106
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,370
This is my private time now.

107
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,790
You...

108
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,950
Here!

109
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,030
Are you tired from class today?

110
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,390
No.

111
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,260
The coach praised me for my progress too.

112
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,230
Amazing.

113
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,010
Well,

114
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,110
let's have a family bucket meal later.

115
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,510
Okay.

116
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,430
Are you here to pick him up?

117
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,190
Yes.

118
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,220
Last time,

119
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,590
he called me crying

120
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,980
and didn't allow me to call the police.

121
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,180
So I signed him up for a taekwondo class.

122
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,850
That way, if he's in any danger,

123
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,180
he'll be able to escape.

124
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,680
So why are you so nice to him?

125
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,160
Because

126
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,630
I have the ability

127
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,620
to help him currently.

128
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,030
There's too much injustice in this world, I can't deal with it all.

129
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,190
But I saw it.

130
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,820
So I'll do what I can.

131
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,860
Mr. Jiang.

132
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Are you relieved now?

133
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,200
Well,

134
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,020
let's go then.

135
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,950
Okay.

136
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,280
I want to play over there too.

137
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,120
Go ahead.

138
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,470
He's not going to be moody and make things difficult for me, is he?

139
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,890
Let me try to pacify him first.

140
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,840
Mr. Jiang.

141
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,250
Have some chicken.

142
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,820
Yes.

143
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,640
Mr. Jiang.

144
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,310
Are you okay?

145
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,600
How about

146
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,250
I buy you a

147
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,050
gastrointestinal tablet?

148
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,950
I'm fine.

149
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,670
I'm just thinking about things.

150
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,610
Who would be able to eat so much while thinking?

151
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,880
Are you really okay?

152
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,950
I wish I had met you earlier.

153
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,090
This...

154
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,070
This isn't a confession, right?

155
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,950
My mother

156
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,550
is a dancer.

157
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,290
He's starting to introduce his family members.

158
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,690
She haemorrhaged when she gave birth to me.

159
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,570
The doctor said she had become very weak

160
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,790
and that she couldn't do strenuous exercises for the rest of her life,

161
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,630
including

162
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,640
dancing, her favorite.

163
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,410
She's beautiful.

164
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,140
I think she is the most beautiful mother in the world.

165
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,730
But I'm afraid of her.

166
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,580
Because she's always unpredictable.

167
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,200
A moment before, she might just be

168
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,520
holding me tightly,

169
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,530
and at the next moment, she would be

170
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,230
trying to strangle me.

171
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,510
Why did you run?

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,530
Why didn't you listen to me?

173
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,860
Why did you run?

174
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,680
Why didn't you listen to me?

175
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,700
-Why won’t you listen?
-Let go of me, Mom.

176
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,790
My father wasn't home most of the time.

177
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,390
No one told him about this.

178
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,810
Of course,

179
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,190
even if he knew about it,

180
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,510
he would only stand with Mom.

181
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,750
After all, he often said,

182
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,230
children,

183
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,810
spare the rod and spoil the child.

184
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,430
We were an affluent, upper class family.

185
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,360
But in reality, one's disposition

186
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,470
really has nothing to do with money.

187
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,410
How can one teach children just by hitting them.

188
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,850
My mother didn't hit me

189
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,740
to teach me.

190
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,430
She just

191
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,700
felt like

192
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,330
it wasn't worth it.

193
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,970
She couldn't help venting her anger.

194
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,600
When I was young,

195
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,430
if I had broken a frame

196
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,910
or hadn't organized my homework neatly,

197
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,980
any of them could have been a reason for her to explode.

198
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,790
For a long time,

199
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,040
I was extremely terrified.

200
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,860
I had to spend a lot of time every day

201
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,080
to check if my furniture

202
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,530
were clean and neat.

203
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,550
My OCD also began and worsened

204
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,630
without much time

205
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,060
in between.

206
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,160
But Mom doesn't care.

207
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,500
Well,

208
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,740
if it weren't for me,

209
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,130
she could still shine

210
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,310
brightly

211
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,390
on the stage.

212
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,750
Listen to me.

213
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,160
It's not your fault.

214
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,750
If she wants to blame someone,

215
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,410
she should blame your father.

216
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,680
If it weren't for your father,

217
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
she wouldn't have gotten pregnant.

218
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,150
So I said

219
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,100
I wish I had met you earlier.

220
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,000
You could've told her these things

221
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,530
and told me these things.

222
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,730
Then I would've had the courage to fight and run away.

223
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,180
I wasn't inherently at fault from birth.

224
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,970
I'm not someone's punching bag either.

225
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,430
I...

226
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,550
So do you know

227
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,910
why I always

228
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,140
I ask you to stop

229
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,690
when we pass by the suburbs?

230
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,510
Because...

231
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,690
I really had a chance to escape.

232
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,730
She wasn't always bad to me either.

233
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,020
When she was willing,

234
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,670
when she was nice to me, she would

235
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,360
take me to fly kites in the suburbs

236
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,680
and cook for me.

237
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,730
Once,

238
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,410
when flying a kite,

239
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,490
my kite line broke.

240
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,720
I ran

241
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,800
and ran.

242
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,490
I ran really far away to get it.

243
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,920
When I turned back,

244
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,630
I realized

245
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,050
-I could hardly see her.
-Jiang Fei!

246
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,320
That's when I almost wanted to keep running

247
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,820
and never look back.

248
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,100
Jiang Fei!

249
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,110
But I heard her screaming for me.

250
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,670
Then I...

251
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,270
I couldn't bear to leave.

252
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,260
I thought

253
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,740
she might keep being nice to me.

254
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,520
When I ran back,

255
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,290
she slapped me.

256
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,300
She said I was a dilly-dallying little bastard

257
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,060
and a loser.

258
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,010
You went back because you love her.

259
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,850
It's not wrong to love someone.

260
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,960
Tong Wan.

261
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,510
If...

262
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,380
If you had met me at that time,

263
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,870
would you have treated me the same way

264
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,670
as you're treating this kid now?

265
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,390
Of course.

266
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,890
Whether it's then or now,

267
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,550
I'll stand behind you.

268
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,630
Tong Wan.

269
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,590
Can I

270
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,710
hug you a little longer?

271
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,470
I can

272
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,010
pay you according to the overtime fee.

273
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,490
Oh...

274
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,180
Okay.

275
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,220
Well,

276
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,970
you don't have to pay for overtime.

277
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,270
Thank you.

278
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,410
Thank you.

279
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,690
I didn't know he had such a sad childhood.

280
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,070
Stop it.

281
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,620
Tong Wan.

282
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,970
Sympathy is the beginning of love.

283
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,410
Wake up!

284
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,790
Tong Wan.

285
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,720
I think

286
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,109
you are especially suited to be my

287
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,470
mother.

288
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,890
Unfortunately, my father is old.

289
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,250
Otherwise, I think...

290
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,210
Here I am, worried and

291
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,870
afraid of falling in love with him.

292
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,870
But he wants me to be his stepmother?

293
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,240
All women are so fickle.

294
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,340
Wan.

295
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,230
Our son

296
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,710
will be home soon.

297
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,120
When he comes,

298
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,340
I can introduce him to you.

299
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,350
Fei, you're back.

300
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,150
This

301
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,710
is your stepmother.

302
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,970
Since you're already married to my father,

303
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,770
don't mess with me anymore.

304
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,210
Am I messing with you?

305
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,980
If you hadn't seen me fall into the water that day,

306
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,710
and risked your life to save me,

307
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
you wouldn't be so sick.

308
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,000
That day,

309
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,480
wasn't it you who held onto me

310
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,300
in the water?

311
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,500
How am I the one messing with you?

312
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
You can't do this.

313
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,390
Why not?

314
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,740
Haven't you

315
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,050
Haven't you heard of stepmom smut?

316
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,670
Yes.

317
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,700
What the heck was that?

318
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,060
Don't keep looking for me.

319
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,970
I won't agree to it.

320
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,000
You didn't reject me outright either.

321
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,010
You eat too.

322
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,910
It's melting.

323
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,100
Actually, I quite admire you.

324
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,110
Yes.

325
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,590
From the contract,

326
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,740
you offered such a high price.

327
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,300
If it were someone else,

328
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,070
they would have accepted it.

329
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,440
But I won't.

330
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,230
With the talent of a manager,

331
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,990
the acumen of a designer,

332
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,720
and the ability to create hype.

333
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,240
You're really right up my alley.

334
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,580
In terms of creating hype,

335
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,860
you're not any worse.

336
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,460
Won't you think about it?

337
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,190
No.

338
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,710
That's it then.

339
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,260
Let's not waste time.

340
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,940
Have you seen the latest trending topics on Weibo?

341
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,800
There're lots of

342
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,060
streamers who have the same style as you.

343
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,960
Original spent a lot this time.

344
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,980
They did a lot of promotion overseas.

345
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,260
I think they've already gathered many fans in Southeast Asia.

346
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,190
The previous streamers were fine.

347
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,480
It's easy to copy superficially, but it's hard to replicate the essence.

348
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,410
They were mostly

349
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,910
just doing

350
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,910
unboxing

351
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,820
and they pretty much disappeared.

352
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,650
But recently,

353
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,580
this WindOverRiverCity

354
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,710
has really gained a lot of followers quickly

355
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,970
and many media outlets

356
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,500
are comparing her with you.

357
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,230
That's good.

358
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,630
More people

359
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,700
are paying attention to traditional craftsmanship.

360
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,830
We can win together.

361
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,370
I'm glad you think so.

362
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,940
I was worried

363
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,300
you'd be in a bad mood.

364
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,960
I'm finally off work. I'm so tired.

365
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,120
Anything else?

366
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:53,800
Yes.

367
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,910
Let's have dinner tonight.

368
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,390
My internet is down.

369
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,500
I have to do a livestream in office.

370
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,310
You go first.

371
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,820
Good evening, cuties.

372
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,590
Actually, I’ve already made the material

373
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,830
for this cut silk

374
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,710
a long time ago.

375
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,910
Today, I'll make two pieces,

376
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,640
a purse and a round fan.

377
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,070
After the livestream,

378
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,070
I'll pick two cuties to gift them to.

379
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,940
Cuties?

380
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,230
The cut silk made by this streamer is so ugly.

381
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,560
She can't compare to the Fengguo Jiangcheng girl.

382
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,810
Everyone, please go take a look at the real beauty.

383
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,070
She's not even as good as me.

384
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,980
Indeed.

385
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,290
I'm leaving. I'm going to see Fengguo Jiangcheng instead.

386
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,260
Why

387
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,550
are there suddenly so many

388
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,950
troublemaker accounts on the livestream?

389
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,100
I'll ask the backend to check.

390
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,180
Don't take it to heart.

391
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,240
It's just online comments.

392
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,440
Don't worry about it.

393
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,320
I'm a vet. Let me do it.

394
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,940
Where did these people come from?

395
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,070
You're all so sweet.

396
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,560
You must have wiped your mouth after going to the toilet.

397
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,980
Why are people watching those ugly hands darting around on camera?

398
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,900
Trash handiwork. That's all?

399
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,300
Wow, so arrogant.

400
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,180
I searched you on Baidu and didn't find anything.

401
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,930
I tried Sogou and I found it.

402
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,970
What am I sharing this earth with?

403
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,020
I feel like a few of you could start a mushroom farm in a cellar,

404
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,950
but it seems like you lack manners.

405
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,230
I'm confused.

406
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,470
Didn't these two just post a bunch of stupid comments in the livestream?

407
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,680
Why are only half of you guys scolding them?

408
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,740
Do the other half not have keyboards?

409
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,390
It seems like those troublemakers

410
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,650
were scolded and left.

411
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,610
It's hard to imagine.

412
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Some people's mouths are connected to their rectums.

413
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,020
I finally know

414
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,540
where you got that from.

415
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,730
All right.

416
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,180
Don't be affected by them.

417
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,040
Let's talk about something else.

418
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,030
How is this fan?

419
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,820
Let's talk.

420
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,710
I heard that Wifey is going to the Chinoiserie Ceremony.

421
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,380
Yes, the event will be livestreamed,

422
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,940
you're welcome to come watch.

423
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,340
Finally, I can see Wifey's beautiful face.

424
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Wifey?

425
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,930
Why do they all call you Wifey?

426
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,620
What's that sound?

427
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,290
Where did the wild man come from?

428
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,340
Wow, it's late. Seems like something exciting is about to happen.

429
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,850
Stop petting it.

430
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,900
It's turning bald.

431
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,840
What do you want from me?

432
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,470
Is this about a man

433
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,260
or did you prepare 5 hundred million?

434
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,100
I'm leaving.

435
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,300
I applied to the head office to return to China for so long

436
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,640
because I wanted to fight for my love,

437
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,870
but now I don't there's no point.

438
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,490
I'll go back to France.

439
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,110
Anyway,

440
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,020
there are more handsome guys there.

441
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,550
Why are you telling me this?

442
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,790
Nothing.

443
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,230
I just

444
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,290
don't want to owe you.

445
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,110
Here.

446
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,310
Well,

447
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,210
thank you.

448
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,840
When I return to the French headquarters,

449
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
I'll work hard on women's clothing.

450
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,270
I hope one day

451
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,200
I can make Grandpa proud.

452
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,640
I really liked

453
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,390
some of your previous designs.

454
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,010
Last year's Moonlight Dress,

455
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,350
the Bud Dress from early spring 2 years ago,

456
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,810
the Crinkled Tiered Skirt

457
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,710
and the early

458
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,210
wedding dress series.

459
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
Your works at Kingdom are all great.

460
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,700
I used to wish

461
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,150
I could be like you.

462
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,830
We can’t fight against fate.

463
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,130
I was no match for Zhou Mian,

464
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,330
and I'm still no match for you now.

465
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,320
You called me...

466
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,470
Yes.

467
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,810
I heard everything.

468
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,560
You're really lucky.

469
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,070
Luckily, you didn't die.

470
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,880
I probably...

471
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,680
probably won't have nightmares anymore.

472
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,800
I was so seasick at the time

473
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,030
and threw up all over the place

474
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,160
but I had to get onto your wedding boat.

475
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,790
I...

476
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,660
I just wanted to tell you

477
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,550
that you are too ordinary.

478
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,880
Those guests were fake.

479
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,470
You can't really marry into the Lu family.

480
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:22,880
I...

481
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,230
I really didn't expect

482
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,510
you'd hold onto the gunwale, disoriented

483
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,440
and fall headfirst into the waves and get swept away.

484
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,190
All right.

485
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,990
Let bygones be bygones.

486
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,010
Although those weren't my designs,

487
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,460
I will tell her for you.

488
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,390
She also told me that

489
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,590
she's seen your work.

490
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,810
You are a talented designer.

491
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,160
You...

492
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,750
You aren't...

493
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes.

494
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,250
Really?

495
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,350
She's really seen my work?

496
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,200
Anyway,

497
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm leaving,

498
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,340
so let me

499
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,570
tell you everything.

500
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,670
Back then,

501
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,170
it's your friend Cheng Shan who found me.

502
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,880
She said

503
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,570
we can each get what we need.

504
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,690
When you break up with Yunkai,

505
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,070
you'd go back and design toys with her.

506
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,540
I didn't have the invitation to board the boat.

507
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,670
She gave it to me too.

508
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,260
Yunkai knew his family wouldn't agree

509
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,350
so he planned the wedding behind his family's back.

510
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,480
I'm the one who told Yunkai's parents.

511
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,670
But now I understand

512
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,280
I was so wrong.

513
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,700
Yunkai must really like you.

514
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,670
When he looks at you,

515
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,560
it's like there's nothing else in his eyes.

516
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,180
Don't mess with her.

517
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,190
I just can't handle the fact that

518
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,720
you aren't here anymore.

519
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,970
The way he smiles at you

520
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,630
is different from the way he smiles at other people.

521
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,030
His smile to other people

522
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,890
looks gentle and reasonable,

523
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,630
but in fact,

524
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,590
it's full of falseness and impatience.

525
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,040
I've followed him around since I was a kid.

526
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,960
But he never looked back and waited for me.

527
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,430
He also never

528
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,840
smiled at me like that.

529
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,930
Have you thought about it?

530
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,930
Tomorrow's a great opportunity.

531
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,550
You're home?

532
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,720
So early.

533
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,560
I thought you'd get be gone till at least midnight.

534
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,030
You got off work earlier than me

535
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,230
and came back so late?

536
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,310
Where did you go?

537
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,390
Nowhere.

538
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,470
How was your talk with Song Ruozhao?

539
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,130
So 6 years ago,

540
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,080
it was her...

541
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,160
You reconciled with her so easily?

542
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,040
When I think about it,

543
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,960
there were problems

544
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,370
in our relationship.

545
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,640
He didn't treat me with equality and respect,

546
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,290
and I didn't tell him

547
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,310
my true thoughts.

548
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,220
That's why our wedding

549
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,480
ended in a sham.

550
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,010
Let's not talk about the past.

551
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,470
Just focus on the present.

552
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,510
The clothes for the Chinese Style Ceremony are here already, right?

553
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,770
Have you tried them on?

554
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:06,790
Not yet.

555
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,950
Hurry up.

556
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,210
Put them on and show me.

557
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,170
If there's anything that doesn't fit,

558
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,530
I can alter it for you.

559
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,150
I have to work overtime tomorrow.

560
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,340
I can't go with you.

561
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,770
If we check ahead of time,

562
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,030
I'll feel more at ease.

563
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,820
Let's go.

564
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,030
Thank you for today.

565
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,740
I have your number now.

566
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,570
I'll see you for afternoon tea next time.

567
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,500
Maybe next time.

568
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,390
There are so many people in this shabby room

569
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,430
and it's so small.

570
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:51,690
She

571
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,420
is a popular qipao streamer on Original.

572
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,480
Every day, she wears qipaos to take street shots.

573
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,820
The lighting is bad too.

574
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,850
Miss Nan Jiang,

575
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,190
your seat is here.

576
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,030
How can I do it with so many people around?

577
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,830
I can't use it.

578
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,970
I think this seat is good.

579
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,330
Miss Nan Jiang.

580
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,070
There are other people

581
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,210
using this seat now.

582
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,390
Please sit over there first,

583
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,020
and I'll change it for you later?

584
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,950
What do you mean?

585
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,550
Is this how you guys do work?

586
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,840
Let me change with you.

587
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,860
Thank you, Miss Rimu Tuyuan.

588
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,990
You're Miss Rimu Tuyuan?

589
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,020
I was just saying.

590
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,980
You don't have to change your seat.

591
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,460
What makeup are you doing?

592
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,260
Scram.

593
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,640
Sister, you really care for the younger generation.

594
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,570
You gave me your seat voluntarily.

595
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,210
It's embarrassing.

596
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,730
You're so popular these days.

597
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,030
When can we collaborate?

598
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,680
It's all traditional culture.

599
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,670
I'm sure it'll do great.

600
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,590
France is the capital of fashion.

601
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,340
I heard you used to live there.

602
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,310
I often go there too.

603
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,900
Maybe we bumped into each other there before.

604
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,560
Look.

605
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,630
This is the photo I took at the Arc de Triomphe.

606
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,930
It's so majestic

607
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,640
and so stylish.

608
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,570
The nearby roads are all surrounding it.

609
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,820
Is it magnificent?

610
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,030
What's so special about

611
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,160
a 20 to 30 meter arch?

612
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
What era is it now?

613
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,150
You still think the grass is greener overseas?

614
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,750
I won't disturb you anymore.

615
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,310
I need to get ready.

616
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,350
Makeup artist!

617
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Miss Rimu Tuyuan.

618
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,060
Please come on stage from here later.

619
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,150
This is your first public appearance.

620
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,110
You came to attend the Chinese Style Ceremony.

621
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,230
May I ask,

622
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,110
what traditional Chinese elements do you feel you embody?

623
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,110
Don't the words "Rimu Tuyuan"

624
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,950
embody enough

625
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,960
traditional Chinese elements?

626
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,240
Gal, if you ask me that,

627
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,550
I'll be hurt.

628
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,590
Then, is you bullying your junior backstage

629
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,740
consistent with the traditional Chinese spirit?

630
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,070
I...

631
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,590
If you're going to refute that,

632
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,800
then how can we trust you

633
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,770
when you've lied to the public

634
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,100
and hid from the public?

635
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,230
This is a group photo that's  been circulating

636
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,710
in the French design industry, with Helsin in it.

637
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,550
Take a look.

638
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,420
I believe everyone can see

639
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,260
that you are not the same person.

640
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,230
So why did you use her identity

641
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,900
to a top position at Wuxin?

642
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,360
Helsin is now almost

643
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,020
the most recognizable dress designer in China.

644
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,210
Does that mean

645
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,250
you're exploiting her fame for personal gain?

646
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,400
Are you also

647
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,520
violating the law?
