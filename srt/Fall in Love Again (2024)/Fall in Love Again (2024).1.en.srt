[Yunkai]

00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,590
What's going on?

7
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,180
Why hasn't the groom's boat set off yet?

8
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,729
It's getting dark.

9
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,320
What do you mean you can't get in touch with the groom?

10
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,680
He's been preparing for the wedding for so long.

11
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,210
Could it be that he escaped?

12
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,130
Can you stand other people up at your own wedding nowadays?

13
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,630
Hi.

14
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,829
Miss Song.

15
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,110
I can't bear to see you keep waiting.

16
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,780
That's why I'm here to tell you

17
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,090
that Yun Kai won't come.

18
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,390
How could that be possible?

19
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,870
Looks like you really don't know him well at all.

20
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,350
He even hired actors to pretend to be his relatives at the wedding.

21
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,410
Miss Zhou, you don't have to cling to it anymore, do you?

22
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,550
Actors?

23
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,120
You saw it yourself yesterday.

24
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,810
A family like Yunkai's would never accept you as an in-law.

25
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,850
Yesterday...

26
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,710
Family?

27
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,910
I asked the wedding planner

28
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,110
to change the wedding dress to this one.

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,940
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

30
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,380
After giving birth, my girth increased so much.

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,600
I don't know if it'll fit me.

32
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,000
I've asked the Department of Attire

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,260
to expedite the change of the dress according to your size.

34
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,670
Okay.

35
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,150
I have something urgent to do.

36
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,010
I need to go out.

37
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,190
Where are you going?

38
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,320
Don't wait for me.

39
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,280
You stay at home.

40
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,310
Eat well and sleep early.

I found a phone.

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,790
Do you know the owner?

44
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,250
The phone you found belongs to my boyfriend.

45
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,340
Okay.

46
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,140

Go to the third floor to get it.

Okay.

Yunkai said he wanted to marry you.

71
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,560
He was just rebelling against his family.

72
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,000
Otherwise,

73
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,260
why didn't he tell you anything?

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,240
Why did you lie to me?

He even hired actors to pretend to be his relatives at the wedding.

77
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,500
Miss Zhou, you don't have to cling to it anymore, do you?

78
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,080
It's impossible that Yunkai would marry you.

79
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,390
The Lu family won't let you

80
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,520

If I'm late, so be it.

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,340
do you want to go to the gallery together later?

101
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,630
I'm sorry.

You reappear now.

107
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,750
You disappeared so fast when we were taking a photo just now.

108
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,150
You're the one who's gone too far.

109
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,150
-You don't drink with other people.
-Yunkai, you're here.

110
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,270
Nor didn't you take a good photo with them.

111
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,430
Do you really think you're a pacemaker of Male Virtuousness?

112
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,890
Were you taking photos?

113
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,790
What does this have to do with Male Virtuousness?

114
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,120
Men are supposed to cherish their purity.

115
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,210
Forget it. It's meaningless to talk to you about this.

116
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,990
Yunkai, are you free tomorrow night?

117
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,840
She looks so much like her.

118
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,270
It's been six years.

119
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,150
Yunkai still has such a big reaction towards someone

120
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,870
who looks like Zhou Mian.

121
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,590
Is that her?

122
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,410
I thought

123
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,190
you found another substitute for me.

124
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,920
You've found a lot these years.

125
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,270
This time I didn't do it.

126
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,990
Look. Is that the legendary Moonlight Dress?

127
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,530
I've only seen this dress in the promotional photos.

128
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,060
It's so beautiful in real life.

129
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,660
Yes, it's so well-designed.

130
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,590
Now I announce

131
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,350
the Charity Auction of Loving Little Ears by Love Enjoying Funds

132
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,950
begins now.

133
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,600
The first auction item is

134
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,610
the manuscript for the Moonlight Dress

135
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,040
by the independent designer, Miss Helsin.

136
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,810
The manuscript shows

137
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,350
the limited Moon Dress

138
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,440
she created together with the brand Tina.

139
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,030
This is definitely a design work

140
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,250
that's both popular and highly praised.

141
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,210
Why is there a spider?

142
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:40,860
Take it off.

143
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,070
Take it off me.

144
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,900
Thank you.

145
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,710
Sorry.

146
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,680
Let me give you a new one.

147
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,930
You were helping me out of kindness.

148
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,020
It's not your fault.

149
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,620
Besides,

150
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,510
you can't buy this dress everywhere.

151
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,630
There's only a little stain.

152
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,090
I'll figure it out myself.

153
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,940
It's an honor for a dress

154
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,840
that it can find an owner who adores it.

155
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,350
Tell me your address.

156
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,020
I'll ask someone to send it to you later.

157
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,150
How will you send it?

158
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,030
This is a limited edition

159
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,940
that is hard to find in the market, even if you have money.

160
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,380
It's extremely hard to get.

161
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,710
You really should've thought twice

162
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,100
before you talked.

163
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,340
It's not good to expose your ignorance frequently.

164
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,610
The design of this Helsin dress

165
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,250
was recommended to Tina

166
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,820
by Studio Kingdom.

167
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,550
This kind of recognition by the industry

168
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,370
should be attached to great importance

169
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,290
and cherished.

170
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,870
Hello, Miss.

171
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,110
I'm also a designer.

172
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,130
In my view, all works

173
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,870
should serve their users.

174
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,750
You shouldn't put the dresses in front of the wearers.

175
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,350
Nor should you deify a work.

176
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,220
In your view?

177
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,230
Maybe that is the difference

178
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,790
between ordinary people and master designers.

179
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,160
I advise you to respect

180
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,110
a designer as great as Helsin.

181
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,740
Don't say those disrespectful words anymore.

182
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,610
Even me,

183
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,560
whenever I have a chance to see her works,

184
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
I'll try my best to buy

185
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,720
and treasure them.

186
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,660
I see.

187
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,710
It's such an honor.

188
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,200
Our donor of tonight,

189
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,800
the independent designer Helsin,

190
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,790
is standing right beside

191
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,720
the guest wearing the impressive Moonlight Dress.

192
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,940
Miss Song,

193
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,570
thank you for loving my works.

194
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,800
But now,

195
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,390
it's time for you to fulfill your promise, isn't it?

196
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,690
The starting price is 60,000 yuan.

197
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,170
You can start bidding now.

198
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,280
100,000 yuan.

199
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,050
Please carry him to Ms. Liu at the door.

200
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,730
Thank you.

201
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,410
150,000.

202
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,810
200,000.

203
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,910
250,000.

204
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,200
380,000.

205
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,080
Congratulations, Miss Song.

206
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,300
You've got this meaningful work

207
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,400
at 380,000 yuan.

208
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,260
At the same time,

209
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,400
she'll contribute to the charity.

210
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,110
Miss Song,

211
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,330
thank you so much.

212
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,410
You're such a good person.

213
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,580
[Helsin, a mysterious designer who never shows herself in public]

214
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,260
Let's welcome Miss Song to the stage for a photo.

215
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:10,990
I didn't expect

216
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,810
the organizer of this event was so capable

217
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,720
that they have been able to invite

218
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,250
the top fashion designer, Helsin.

219
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,720
Is Yunkai trying to speak up for me?

220
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,370
It's hard to find your videos or photos online, Miss Helsin.

221
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,710
It's an honor

222
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,720
to meet you in person here.

223
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
May I have the honor

224
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,490
to witness your professionalism?

225
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,290
Judging from your expression and tone,

226
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,200
it seems that you suspect I'm an imposter.

227
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,040
The voice

228
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,300
is not like hers.

229
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,050
Of course not.

230
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,200
Why don't you comment on

231
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,490
the dresses

232
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,340
of these ladies.

233
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,030
This fine gauze evening gown with sophisticated techniques

234
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,829
is from a brand of haute couture.

235
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,250
Diamond Planet series, to be specific.

236
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,920
I remember you studied design before.

237
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,460
You should design your own wedding dress.

238
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,510
That way, you won't be torn.

239
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,880
I learned to design toys.

240
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,430
The difference in the professions is so huge that it's like they're mountains apart.

241
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,830
How can I know how to design a wedding dress?

242
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,010
Sir,

243
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,640
I can see that you're attending to every detail.

244
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,010
Are you the organizer of the event?

245
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,420
No, I'm not.

246
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,010
Bad woman.

247
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,340
So annoying.

248
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,690
It's pretty cute.

249
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,630
Take it. Look. Does she look like Mom?

250
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,420
Mom.

251
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,790
You're very cute.

252
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,090
However,

253
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,850
you can't call everyone Mom.

254
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,380
But you are my mom.

255
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,720
Have you forgotten me

256
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,320
since you haven't seen me for too long?

257
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,800
I'm Tangyuan.

258
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,250
I'm six and a half years old.

259
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,770
Oh no.

260
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,310
Mom, wait a minute.

261
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,390
I'll pick this up before hugging you.

262
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,340
I'm sorry, Tangyuan.

263
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,810
I can't recognize you now.

264
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,030
The patient's hand nerves are badly injured.

265
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,830
Even if she recovers well later,

266
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,700
it'll be hard for her to make

267
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,920
intricate movements such as drawing lines and pictures.

268
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,630
Zhou Mian loved her child so much.

269
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,210
If she were still alive,

270
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,290
how could she not act abnormally at all

271
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,880
when she saw Tangyuan?

272
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,270
It's time to let it go.

273
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,020
It should have ended

274
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,420
when the accident happened at sea six years ago.

275
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,740
What are you talking about?

276
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,280
How could it end?

277
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,050
My wife

278
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,570
is waiting for me to pick her up.

279
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,510
He searched large areas of the ocean without stopping.

280
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,710
It's like he's crazy.

281
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,160
I'll say.

282
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,220
These are the deep-sea waters.

283
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,590
How can you find a living person after so many days?

284
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,620
The body

285
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,490
might have been eaten by sharks long ago.

286
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,080
That's right.

287
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,730
No.

288
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,690
No.

289
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,670
Why can't you let it go?

290
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,800
Zhou Mian's hand was injured.

291
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,540
Could she pick up the beads so nimbly?

292
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,160
Didn't you already feel her out?

293
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,800
Shut up.

294
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,920
If you are really interested in

295
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,820
that woman,

296
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,660
I can help you talk to her.

297
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,350
No matter how much money it costs,

298
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,460
I will definitely get her...

299
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,660
I said shut up.

300
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,360
I think I'll need your identity for a while.

301
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,060
Go ahead, Boss.

302
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,470
See you in a few days.

303
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,310
I know

304
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,930
they are not the same person,

305
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,490
but they are so alike.

306
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,770
Help me investigate this designer, Helsin.

307
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,700
Also,

308
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,320
keep an eye on Tong Wan.

309
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,490
If she's really Zhou Mian,

310
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,580
when she comes back,

311
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,540
she'll definitely get in touch with Tong Wan.

312
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,040
Oh no.

313
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,570
I'm going bald.

How cruel you are to leave me!

The hard-working worker today

319
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,210
also loses hair for capitalists.

320
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,880
I hope I can get my hair back by working hard for my health.

321
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,680
Miss Tong, another batch of flowers arrived.

322
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,950
Please sign here.

323
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,640

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,280
Miss Tong, these flowers…

327
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,200
As usual,

328
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,280
sell them for me. Let's split the earnings.

329
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,960
Okay, Miss Tong. Goodbye.

330
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,270
Thank you for taking care of Tangyuan for me.

331
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,290
Let me see you off.

332
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,440
Thank you.

333
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,950
Are you sure it's this way?

334
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,990
Normally,

335
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,910
we should have reached the door.

336
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,910
Maybe… Could it be…

337
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,170
that you don't know the way?

338
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,530
It is this way.

339
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,320
I remember

340
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,140
we can get out of here.

341
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,890
Hello.

342
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,910
Excuse me.

343
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,030
Are you okay?

344
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,630
There's no way out ahead.

345
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,560
The front door is on the other side.

346
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,770
Are you okay?

347
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,110
I'm fine.

348
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,350
Go back to the hotel and get changed.

349
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,730
Don't see me off.

350
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,050
I made you go the wrong way.

351
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,750
How could I

352
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,130
let you go back alone?

353
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,480
It's okay.

354
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,500
Hello.

355
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
Come back now.

356
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,180
I can't control your precious son.

357
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
If you don't show up, I'll collapse.

358
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,930
You'd better go back and take care of your kid.

359
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,240
Go through this path, and the hotel lobby is right ahead.

360
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,370
I can walk by myself.

361
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,250
Trust me.

362
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,770
You need it more than I do.

364
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,400
I'm finally myself again.

365
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,580
I walked the unnecessary long way just now.

366
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,690
You showed up in front of him right after you came back home.

367
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,690
Aren't you being too high-profile?

368
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,160
They are well informed.

369
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,850
If I don't seize the time,

370
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,570
it's easy to lose the initiative.

371

Don't worry.

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,520
I can't be too timid to show my face.

374
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,860
Sister, what's your next plan?

375
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,340
I plan

376
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,610
to join Wuxin.

377
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,040
You want to join Lu Yunkai's company?

378
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,060
Yes.

379
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,040
Mike, can you check to see

380
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,240
if they're having any difficulties recently?

381
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,480
I need an open sesame.

382
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,370
I understand why you need to get close to Lu Yunkai.

383
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,020
But he's your old love, after all.

384
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,630
If you two are close to each other for a long time,

385
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,320
you'll inevitably fall into those memories and be immersed in them.

386
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,410
I have to remind you

387
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,260
to keep a clear head all the time.

388
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,920
Don't forget why we came back.

389
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,430
Old love?

390
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,870
I don't think so.
