[Episode 15]

4
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,810
I can take it down for Wuxin.

5
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,830
Well.

6
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,390
I don't understand.

7
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,940
You came to me as soon as you came back,

8
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,310
which has already surprised me.

9
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,840
Why are you pushing your own family's good fortune onto others?

10
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,050
There are conditions.

11
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,770
Why are you here?

12
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,240
I'm waiting for you.

13
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,350
I wanted to have lunch with you.

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,090
But I heard you had an appointment.

15
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,789
What's wrong?

16
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,930
Did something happen?

17
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,180
I just met Song Ruozhao.

18
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,910
What is this?

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,680
This is

20
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,380
the yuzu-flavored cream puff

21
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,380
prepared by Pang.

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,270
I was afraid you hadn't eaten.

23
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,800
So I brought it here for you.

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,630
I was afraid you wouldn't eat it.

25
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,270
So

26
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,460
I prepared some protein for you

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,920
to replenish your energy.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,320
I just had a simple meal.

29
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,420
Besides,

30
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,670
I'm not a kid anymore.

31
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,530
I will take care of myself.

32
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,230
I know.

33
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,380
You can do anything.

34
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,710
But

35
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,470
I can't

36
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,660
help

37
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,510
caring about you

38
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,770
in terms of whether...

39
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,440
You keep yourself warm...

40
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,240
What's wrong?

41
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,020
Why did Song Ruozhao come

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,680
to see you?

43
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,430
She came to tell me

44
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,880
not to target Song Bingzhu.

45
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,870
After the reports about the late-night photos

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,430
and the condemnation of the imitation and blending of memes

47
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,550
came out,

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,950
my grandfather fell ill.

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,920
There was more news after that.

50
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,080
That's why his condition fluctuates.

51
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,040
He's 75 years old.

52
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,350
He values his dignity and reputation the most.

53
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,470
Damage to his reputation

54
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,000
would ruin his entire life.

55
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,920
You don't have to go this far

56
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,440
to make him lose his integrity, do you?

57
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,740
What do you want to do?

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,510
The scapegoat executive that the Song family exposed a couple of days ago

59
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,990
hasn't gained public approval.

60
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,829
Many witnesses can prove

61
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,070
Mr. Song was involved.

62
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,670
You don't need to worry about those.

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,450
As long as the legal team of Wuxin states

64
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,070
that everything is a misunderstanding,

65
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,930
the Song family

66
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,590
will handle the rest.

67
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,329
You underestimate

68
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,390
the public's commitment to justice.

69
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,910
It's no longer a time

70
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,329
when everything can be smoothed over with money.

71
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,530
I've told you, you don't need to worry about those things.

72
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,440
As long as you do as I say,

73
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,570
I can secure the domestic collaboration opportunity

74
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,810
with Baifei for you.

75
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,760
Your grandfather is such a strong-willed old man.

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
If he knew

77
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,610
you came to beg me for this,

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,380
he probably wouldn't look at you favorably, would he?

79
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,640
I just want to minimize the loss

80
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,930
and I hope Grandpa can get better

81
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,620
and be happier.

82
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,020
Was she referring to this domestic collaboration

83
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,750
with Baifei?

84
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,430
So this case

85
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,960
has officially started selecting partners?

86
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,130
Not yet.

87
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,320
This is just

88
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,540
a targeted invitation from Baifei

89
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,380
to us.

90
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,659
They are going to select

91
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,460
four design companies in China.

92
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,870
After the initial screening,

93
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,530
half of them

94
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,659
will compete in garment effect evaluation.

95
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,260
Then they will select the partnering company.

96
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
Although the team from Wuxin

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,430
is newly formed,

98
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,820
fortunately,

99
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,420
our core competence is high.

100
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,430
Besides,

101
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,110
this time they're focusing on the theme

102
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,380
of Chinese style.

103
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,710
Think about it.

104
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,810
Isn't this

105
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,040
our specialty?

106
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,550
So Wuxin

107
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,820
is definitely able to pass the initial screening.

108
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,590
China is indeed a big market.

109
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,550
Its international status and influence are excellent.

110
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,390
It seems that Baifei

111
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,870
is not only satisfied with operating luxury lines.

112
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,040
They chose Chinese-themed elements for the first round,

113
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,170
which is a very accommodating choice.

114
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,500
Boss.

115
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,790
We need you to confirm

116
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,960
the procedures for the group wedding.

117
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,350
A group wedding.

118
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,510
I think most companies

119
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,270
are against office romance.

120
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,190
I thought Wuxin was too.

121
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,890
If I'm an unstable upper beam myself,

122
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,410
how can I not allow the employees to light lamps?

123
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,970
Why do you always

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,080
mix up idioms?

125
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,110
Let me ask you.

126
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,720
Do you want to attend it with me?

127
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,210
Today,

128
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,750
I'm going back to our school's

129
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,730
design institute

130
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,330
to recruit some new employees.

131
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,070
I'm going to select talents.

132
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,180
I haven't been back to my alma mater for a long time.

133
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,790
But you have recruited so many talents for Wuxin.

134
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,730
You can never have too many talents.

135
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,710
The school recruitment is going well.

136
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,750
It's rare to go back to my alma mater.

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,430
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

138
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,330
We'll talk later.

139
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,510
Thank you.

140
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,680
You're welcome.

141
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
It's nothing.

142
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:38,630
How about

143
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,830
I give you a chance to repay me?

144
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,460
Go ahead.

145
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,050
Baifei wants to find a partner in China.

146
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
Do me a favor.

147
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,390
I want the Song family to win the bid.

148
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,659
Why is everyone

149
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,020
coming to negotiate with me these days?

150
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,310
Who else?

151
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,880
Song Ruozhao.

152
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,740
Do you know her?

153
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,310
Alright.

154
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,430
Tell me your conditions.

155
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,450
Wuxin and Original are both targeting

156
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,430
users in the lower-tier markets of the 12 western provinces.

157
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,310
I can stop the promotion for Original

158
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,510
and hand over

159
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,050
that market share.

160
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,070
You're so generous.

161
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,780
I used

162
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,799
to dislike electronic mechanical classes the most.

163
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,080
When it came to class,

164
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,860
I would secretly sneak off to the library

165
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,620
to take a nap.

166
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,750
Just tell me what you want to say.

167
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,870
If you don't continue reminiscing,

168
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,000
then I'll continue.

169
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,790
Can you accept what I said

170
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,310
when I came in just now?

171
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,990
You graduated from a well-known business school.

172
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,510
Many companies have given you offers.

173
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,110
But you turned them all down.

174
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,160
Step by step, you've developed Original from a small platform

175
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,090
to what it is now.

176
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,590
Your classmates admire you.

177
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,040
They said you were

178
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,880
an upright and talented person.

179
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,100
But I don't know why

180
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,870
someone like you

181
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,200
can make such a request.

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,310
I didn't expect you to be interested in me.

183
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,110
You even did a background check.

184
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,510
I know

185
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,310
negotiating with you

186
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,190
will definitely be a tug-of-war.

187
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,910
For example, you would ask me

188
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,740
why I'm helping the Song family.

189
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,530
But I didn't expect

190
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
you to really play by your own rules.

191
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,560
Then why are you helping the Song family?

192
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,040
To be precise,

193
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,470
I want to know more

194
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,230
that among Wuxin,

195
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,630
Song Bingzhu,

196
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,480
and Mike,

197
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
what kind of role you play.

198
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,550
Song Bingzhu and Mike have mutual interests

199
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,230
and don't want Wuxin to secure this deal.

200
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,990
I understand that.

201
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,850
But why are you getting involved?

202
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,990
Previously,

203
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,170
I noticed that Mike is particularly knowledgeable

204
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,080
about your whereabouts.

205
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,440
I was a little suspicious.

206
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,120
I thought you guys

207
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,190
just had some private exchanges of interests,

208
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,770
but I didn't expect

209
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,140
you to even...

210
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,450
Be employed by him.

211
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,570
I didn't expect

212
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,110
someone as arrogant as you

213
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,770
to be quite straightforward.

214
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,850
After all, you've found out

215
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,560
about my performance in school.

216
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,370
Next,

217
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,250
you'll find out the person who sponsored my study

218
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,380
has a surname of Mai.

219
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,740
She's Mike's mother.

220
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,150
As a response to her kindness,

221
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,360
assisting her son

222
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,750
is only natural.

223
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,390
I'm talented in both literary and martial arts.

224
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm just afraid that...

225
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,970
Don't come over.

226
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,390
Talented

227
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,740
in both literary

228
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,480
and

229
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,630
martial arts?

230
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,270
I think

231
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,280
we should leave.

232
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,060
Is everything checked?

233
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,910
Don't worry.

234
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,630
We're the best cleaners in the library.

235
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,160
Let's go.

236
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,560
Okay.

237
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,040
I know another door.

238
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,230
Oh no.

239
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,130
There's no other way.

240
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,320
I haven't tried it yet.

241
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,450
What do you mean,

242
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,650
there's no other way?

243
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,960
Open

244
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:06,840
sesa...

245
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,260
Me.

246
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,590
Now,

247
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,330
there's really no other way.

248
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,360
Hello?

249
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,490
Is this the Academic Affairs Office?

250
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,090
We're locked in the library.

251
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,620
Ever heard a saying?

252
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,830
What?

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,720
When you see a cockroach,

254
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,670
it means there are already 10,000.

255
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,440
Over there.

256
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,510
Don't be afraid.

257
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,780
Is anyone here?

258
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,230
You're acting weird.

259
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,680
Aren't you scared?

260
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,510
So I keep the hand I touched the cockroach with

261
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,310
away from you.

262
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,890
So you don't accept it?

263
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,640
You mean?

264
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,460
The conditions I just mentioned.

265
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,850
You know the answer.

266
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,760
Actually,

267
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,830
I didn't want to do this.

268
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,430
What

269
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,220
did you say?

270
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,260
Zhou Mian didn’t agree.

271
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,310
What?

272
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,340
So we can't persuade her even with such a large market?

273
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,260
Zhou Mian said

274
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,690
that Wuxin's user acquisition and promotion

275
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,990
are now under the responsibility of Lu Yunkai.

276
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,850
She trusts him.

277
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,230
Trust?

278
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,990
She trusts him.

279
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,480
Don't worry about it.

280
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
I'll handle this.

281
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,510
You trust him,

282
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,390
but not me.

283
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,050
It has little to do with her.

284
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,390
The ideas she's adopting are all from Lu Yunkai.

285
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,630
That guy doesn't understand the situation,

286
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,420
and he's too arrogant.

287
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,880
I won't let him off easily.

288
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,420
As for Zhou Mian,

289
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,800
don't rush to deal with her.

290
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,440
I'll talk to her.

291
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,900
I just want to defeat Lu Yunkai

292
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,060
while protecting you.

293
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,330
I sacrificed the market interests to protect you.

294
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,930
Apart from us,

295
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,650
the Song family is also entering the final round

296
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,510
of competition

297
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,820
for collaboration with Baifei.

298
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,750
Although the Song family has a lot of negative publicity now,

299
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,870
their experience in this field is extremely rich.

300
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,670
So we can't underestimate them.

301
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,510
In addition,

302
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,710
the format of this competition

303
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,750
is quite interesting.

304
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,470
The garments from both sides will be worn by models

305
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,500
for the runway show.

306
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,450
At the same time, there will be a live stream.

307
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,210
Online voting from netizens will also have some influence

308
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,340
on the final result.

309
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,580
There are three

310
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,200
professional judges.

311
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,550
Two of them are designers from the French headquarters

312
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,640
who are well-versed in Chinese traditional culture.

313
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,440
The other one

314
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,750
is Song Ruozhao, who is in charge of this collaboration.

315
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,270
Currently,

316
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,470
our promotional activities

317
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,670
have been rolled out.

318
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,030
The momentum is ideal.

319
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,390
After all, many people

320
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,180
have limited purchasing power for luxury product lines.

321
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,200
As for fast fashion lines,

322
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,600
they might try it.

323
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,870
I believe you all have a general understanding

324
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,330
of the general situation.

325
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,870
The main purpose of our meeting today

326
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,310
is to formulate design plans

327
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,970
and allocate specific tasks.

328
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,770
If the return on investment

329
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,300
results in only this level of effectiveness,

330
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,520
then it might as well not be done.

331
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,590
"Porcelain" and "China"

332
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,270
are the same word in English.

333
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,800
Long before Europe mastered the technology

334
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,910
of making porcelain

335
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,190
over a thousand years ago,

336
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,050
our ancestors

337
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,230
were already able to produce

338
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,869
quite exquisite porcelain.

339
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,069
So porcelain is undoubtedly

340
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,329
one of the best business cards for China.

341
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,010
There are traces to follow

342
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,569
in our designs in terms of color and patterns.

343
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,339
Designing the overall style

344
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,829
based on the shape of the vessels

345
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,030
will also be diverse.

346
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,890
For example, straight, waisted,

347
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,839
and tapered.

348
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,910
Let me see that.

349
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,780
Let's change the neckline to pleats

350
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,310
to avoid it being too stiff.

351
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,330
Here are some fruits for you.

352
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,790
You've been working hard.

353
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,510
Sis.

354
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,740
Didn't Mr. Lu know

355
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,190
that disturbing someone when they're having creative inspiration

356
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,830
would have

357
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,470
a very negative impact?

358
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,160
Let's go.

359
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,910
Let's go.

360
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,230
Yeah!

361
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,620
Is he crazy?

362
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,590
You...

363
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,650
You've already sent

364
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,410
late-night snacks twice and fruit once today.

365
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,740
You can't send any more.

366
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,510
Do you think

367
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,320
it would be too much

368
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,950
if I added embroidered shoes

369
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,730
to this lightweight outfit?

370
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,300
I've never made

371
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,160
such a cheap product line before,

372
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,930
so I'm not sure.

373
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,300
Just

374
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,460
speak more human-like.

375
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,910
Don't be discouraged.

376
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,350
Everyone's understanding of beauty

377
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,610
is highly subjective.

378
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,630
Your wedding dress series

379
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,870
is really beautiful.

380
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,370
I'm going to Di'nai for a meeting next week.

381
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,320
Come with me.

382
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,870
I...

383
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,300
I'm not going.

384
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,180
I can't.

385
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,740
I won't go.

386
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,700
You won't go for such a dreamlike opportunity?

387
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,790
If I call you a pig,

388
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,850
even the Animal Protection Association

389
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,980
would accuse me of insulting animals.

390
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,380
I swear

391
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,000
your work is very beautiful and unique.

392
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,350
Trust yourself.

393
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,590
You can't let your vulnerable aura

394
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,870
affect your luck.

395
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,290
Trust yourself once.

396
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,920
Your name will definitely

397
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,780
be among the renowned designers.

398
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,710
Beautiful?

399
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,220
Unique?

400
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,950
Am I going to be a designer?

401
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,270
Yes.

402
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,190
It's the landlord.

403
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,500
He asked me

404
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,590
where we bought the dumplings

405
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,930
we had a few days ago.

406
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,030
You should

407
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,630
speak more human-like.

408
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,680
Why are you laughing?

409
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,230
You feel good when someone scolds me?

410
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,590
I've been wanting to scold you for a long time.

411
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,390
I used to

412
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,430
always hold back

413
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,580
and miss out on so many opportunities.

414
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,680
You've been talking back to me every day for the past two years,

415
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,610
clearly you've scolded me enough.

416
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,840
I just want to scold you.

417
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,310
Is it good-looking?

418
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,230
Look at your design.

419
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,470
You've drawn on my hand.

420
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,650
Do you...

421
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,260
Do you

422
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,170
have a problem?

423
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,220
You're the one who has a problem.

424
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,780
What kind of design is this?

425
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,590
You two

426
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,430
better

427
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,830
have made great progress

428
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,400
rather than chatting here.

429
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,110
All right.

430
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,390
Thank you for your hard work.

431
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,310
Let's continue

432
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,790
tomorrow afternoon.

433
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,190
God!

434
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,380
Just go.

435
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,050
Thank you.

436
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,240
A CEO who is the most idle

437
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,110
and most romantically minded

438
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,990
fell in love with

439
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,450
the most workaholic wife.

440
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,740
So, I hope everyone

441
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,700
can speed up the schedule.

442
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:49,670
OK.

443
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,260
Thank you.

444
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,990
Why don't you sleep more on the weekend?

445
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,720
How can I sleep with a workaholic wife being here?

446
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
It's the weekend.

447
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,420
Our family should go out and play.

448
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,120
I have an appointment with the craftsmen later.

449
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,670
I need to video call to see the samples.

450
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,610
If there is any deviation,

451
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,140
I can adjust them promptly.

452
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,310
No way.

453
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,660
Are you serious?

454
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,110
Yes.

455
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,390
Alright, you may leave.

456
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,650
Don't disturb my work.

457
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,930
Daddy, why are you sitting here?

458
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,950
Mian.

459
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,470
Did you miss me?

460
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,190
I dreamed of you last night.

461
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,350
So it turns out you're not capable either.

462
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,550
That's not the case.

463
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,780
I think Mommy likes me more.

464
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,650
I think Mian likes me more.

465
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,910
Mommy carried me out.

466
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,800
What about you?

467
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,550
You two go talk somewhere else.

468
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,680
Stay away from here.

469
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,260
It's all your fault.

470
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,690
-It’s your fault.
-It’s all your fault.

471
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,650
It's all your fault.

472
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,780
It's all your fault.

473
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,500
It's all your fault.

474
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,880
You are...

475
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,630
I'm going back for a couple of days.

476
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,140
We won't disturb you anymore.

477
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,100
We won't disturb you anymore.

478
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,830
I'm just going back for a few days.

479
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,820
I'll come back as soon as the draft is finished.

480
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,490
I'm not complaining about you.

481
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,470
It's just that Xin and Hua Chi

482
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,230
running back

483
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,710
and forth is too disruptive.

484
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,790
The three of us can have meetings anytime when we're together.

485
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,720
This way, we can be more efficient.

486
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,460
Let me help you.

487
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,900
Sis.

488
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,850
Mr. Lu wouldn't fail to understand you, right?

489
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,470
I heard that

490
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,850
if two people can't support each other

491
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,740
and understand each other,

492
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,360
it'll be hard for them to be together forever.

493
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,580
I feel sorry for you.

494
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,380
Sis. You are

495
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,720
talented

496
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,790
and diligent.

497
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,030
But...
