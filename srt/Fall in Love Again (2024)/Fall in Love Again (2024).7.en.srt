[Episode 7]

4
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,750
Is everything okay?

5
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,190
Looks like something is wrong.

6
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,530
They're all in the meeting room now.

7
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,260
They asked me to tell you to go to the meeting room.

8
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,150
I've read the proposal.

9
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,060
It's good.

10
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,729
Have you submitted it?

11
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,950
I'm afraid

12
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,250
we can't submit it.

13
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,070
Why not?

14
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,920
We were going to submit the proposal today

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,510
but then in the all-member chat group

16
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,240
we saw that another company had submitted a similar proposal.

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,100
Which company?

18
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,640
It's Love Enjoying Funds's co-organizer of the event,

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,770
Baifei from France.

20
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,229
How similar is their proposal to ours?

21
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,290
They and we both planned to make a mime

22
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,410
which is a kind of western art.

23
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,150
Both their and our plots

24
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,550
are about young heroes risking their lives to save the world.

25
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,310
Although the stories are not identical

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,990
and the two proposals have different features,

27
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,010
it's meaningless to submit our proposal.

28
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,170
The organizer's request

29
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,490
is that we should try to plan diverse activities.

30
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,020
There can't be two mimes.

31
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,300
That's why they asked us to show them the idea of our proposal first.

32
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,560
So what we did for the proposal is in vain.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,670
We've begun to prepare the costumes, props, and other needed materials.

34
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,920
And we've also auditioned some actors.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,579
Now we have to stop all of that.

36
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,560
It's getting close to the deadline.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,940
We don't have time to think of another wonderful theme.

38
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,200
We don't have time to make a new proposal and implement it.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,630
It's such a strange coincidence that their proposal is so similar to ours.

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,829
Someone in our team must have told them about our proposal.

41
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,510
Mr. Lu, we must investigate this.

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,190
Otherwise, everyone will be angry.

43
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,310
If I find out who our opponent is,

44
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,630
I'll get them into trouble.

45
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,720
I won't investigate it.

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,830
Let's do our work and make a new proposal.

47
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,590
Why won't you investigate it?

48
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,050
It's obvious that someone got us into this trouble on purpose.

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,180
Vice President didn't let us tell the organizer the idea of our proposal first.

50
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,170
She insisted that we should finish the proposal first.

51
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,750
Now we got into this trouble.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,150
Did some bad guy steal our idea and let the organizer know it before we did?

53
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,610
Or was there someone who was trying to get us into trouble in the first place?

54
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,740
Now it's hard to say who should be held accountable for this.

55
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,340
Mr. Lu...

56
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,370

Thank you.

62
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,620
Mr. Jiang.

63
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,930
Mr. Jiang, what brings you here?

64
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,720
I was afraid you would have some trouble on the construction site alone.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,050
So I came to check on you.

66
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,420
Why is he saying something weird again?

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,880
Has he realized that I'm investigating him?

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
No, it can't be.

69
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,360
Mr. Jiang.

70
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,910
I always put the company's interests first.

71
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,070
The company is my home.

72
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,120
I will never cheat for my own benefit.

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,520
Okay.

74
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:32,920
Well.

75
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,280
Do you want to carry out an inspection yourself?

76
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
I heard there was a good French restaurant nearby.

77
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,000
How many of you will eat there?

78
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,659
And what time will you be there?

79
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,060
Is it a private dinner or a business dinner?

80
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,990
Just

81
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,300
two of us.

82
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,909
What?

83
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,430
Mr. Jiang.

84
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,670
I won't resign. You can rest assured.

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,100
I like working at Dreams Chasing Toy.

86
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
You're nice to me too.

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
Am I nice to you?

88
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,410
You are nice to me?

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,240
But for my task,

90
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,550
I would have left.

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,500
Fine, I'll put up with it for Mian.

92
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,750
Yes.

93
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,150
Here.

94
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
This way. It’s safer.

95
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,150
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

96
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,390
How was your tour of inspection on the construction site?

97
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,300
I plan to report everything to you

98
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,030
after I go back and sort out my notes.

99
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,590
I let you take charge of the project because I trust you.

100
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,450
Just do everything you need to do.

101
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,110
What does he mean?

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,620
He's so weird.

103
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,390
But his words made me feel good.

104
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,730
You naughty boy.

105
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,270
Why are you so disobedient?

106
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,600
Mom, stop.

107
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,120
I'll get you heavily punished today.

108
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,830
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang.

109
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,270
Why did you go there without my permission?

110
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,470
How dare you!

111
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,350
Mr. Jiang.

112
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,320
What’s wrong?

113
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,580
You're such a bad son!

114
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,070
I'm so angry.

115
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,790
Tell her to stop hitting the boy.

116
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,320
-Why is your palm so sweaty?
-Tell her to stop.

117
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,310
You're so naughty.

118
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,950
Why are you so disobedient?

119
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,530
Don't move!

120
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,790
Stand still. Don't move!

121
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,720
How dare you!

122
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,600
Stop!

123
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,370
Who are you? What are you doing?

124
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,700
Why are you hitting him?

125
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,550
He's my son. I can hit him anytime.

126
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,540
Stay out of this.

127
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,470
Otherwise, I'll hit you too.

128
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,360
It's not my business whether you hit your son or not.

129
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,370
But you hurt me.

130
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,240
I can call the police and ask them to arrest you.

131
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,340
I didn't hit you.

132
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,590
This injury is not serious at all. You'll call the police for that?

133
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,990
Aren't you afraid people will laugh at you?

134
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,430
Others might not care about it.

135
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,620
But I'm a narrow-minded person.

136
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,560
If someone hurts me, I'll get them punished.

137
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
I have much free time and I'm rich.

138
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,360
And I know a famous lawyer in China.

139
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,020
If I want to do it, I can call the police right now.

140
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,920
This is my name card.

141
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,200
I may sue you.

[Jiang Fei]

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,630
What do you want?

144
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,560
I just want you to stop hitting him.

145
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,090
Fine.

146
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,550
After you leave, I'll...

147
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,140
Does it hurt?

148
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,420
Why didn't you fight back?

149
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,390
Because she's my mom.

150
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,800
Just because she's your mom doesn't mean she can hit you.

151
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,020
You're an independent individual.

152
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,750
You're not inferior to anyone.

153
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,110
If I had been you, I would have resisted.

154
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,440
I would have been hit even harder if I had resisted.

155
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:44,030
You didn't fight back just now.

156
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,950
But she was still hitting you.

157
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,470
Right?

158
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,159
Instead of expecting others to be kind to you,

159
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,360
you should trust yourself and be tough.

160
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,710
Let's go.

161
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,880
Let's go.

162
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,710
How dare you tell on me?

163
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,340
Mr. Jiang.

164
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,220
Are you feeling better?

165
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,570
Why did you give her my name card just now?

166
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,430
That's a trick.

167
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,980
She would be more intimidated by the name card of a president than by that of a president's assistant.

168
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,580
Did you really plan to call the police?

169
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,550
Of course not.

170
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,660
I was bluffing.

171
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,570
It would be a criminal case if I got a minor injury.

172
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,330
My injury is not serious at all.

173
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,640
It cannot even be counted as a civil case.

174
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,820
Mr. Jiang.

175
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,670
Can you

176
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,170
let go of my hand?

177
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,510
Do you think

178
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,630
kids who succumb to violence

179
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,540
are useless?

180
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,860
Why are you asking me this question?

181
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,900
Didn't what you said to the boy

182
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,670
mean that one should rely on himself or herself instead of asking others for help?

183
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,050
If a kid has someone to rely on,

184
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,850
they won't have to be more mature than their peers.

185
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,910
You can rely on me from now on.

186
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,080
What did you say?

187
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,540
Nothing.

188
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,580
He is weird today.

189
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,200
To my surprise, he can be so cute.

190
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,430
Thank you.

191
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,640
Ms. Ji, nice to see you.

192
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,470
Why did you

193
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,770
want to see me today?

194
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,350
[Contract signing]

195
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,500
It's a little abrupt.

196
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,340
This is such a generous offer.

197
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,830
What do you think?

198
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,540
Do you want to join Original?

199
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,140
I didn't expect you to take such a direct method to poach me.

200
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,890
Because of the Neverland Event,

201
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,750
your team must have been extremely busy these days.

202
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,740
And you'll have to be careful not to offend them.

203
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,110
Why don't you just quit and join a new company?

204
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,710
Well.

205
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,710
It sounds good.

206
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,950
But you'll also benefit a lot

207
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,710
if I sign this contract.

208
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,570
It says that I need to leave Wuxin

209
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,330
and that KOLs on Rimu Tuyuan

210
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,470
have to terminate the contract with Wuxin

211
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,830
and join your platform.

212
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,490
Wuxin has just started a business project

213
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,260
for helping designers who make original designs.

214
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,260
You wanted to destroy it in this way?

215
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,180
If you join Original,

216
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,590
you'll be able to continue your collaboration.

217
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,120
Right?

218
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,330
That's different.

219
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,100
You're smart.

220
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't need to say too much.

221
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,430
If you're not satisfied with the salary,

222
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,230
you can ask us to raise the offer.

223
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,230
I'm done.

224
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,720
I have to go now.

225
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,270
Would you like to go with me?

226
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,470
I'll go after the music is finished.

227
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,770
This piece of jazz music

228
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,750
is actually not a good one.

229
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,600
The second bar is wrong.

230
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,950
Don't listen too long.

231
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,240
As usual, I brought you your favorite red wine steak.

232
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,360
Enjoy it.

233
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,350
Hello.

234
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,890
Hello.

235
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,810
What would you like to drink?

236
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,660
Sister.

237
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,250
You've caught a cold. Don't drink too much cold drink.

238
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,650
You're not as strong as me.

239
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,550
I'll just order two cups of hot drinks.

240
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,610
That's different.

241
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,340
You drank it?

242
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,240
Zhou Mian.

243
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,790
Dinner for you.

244
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,740
No, thanks.

245
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,160
Take it. You must take it.

246
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,620
Thank you.

247
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,000
Can I exchange my milk for your bread?

248
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,240
So you were nearby just now.

249
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,940
I heard someone was trying to poach Mr. Lu's employee.

250
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,120
So I had to come.

251
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,250
She just left.

252
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,960
And now you know about it.

253
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,420
What are your thoughts?

254
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,580
I think it's time for you to leave Wuxin.

255
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,880
Why?

256
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,150
If I recall correctly,

257
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,700
you came back

258
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,680
to let the bad guy

259
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,860
get the punishment he deserves,

260
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,260
right?

261
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,300
Well.

262
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,390
Looks like

263
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,910
only I remember it.

264
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,970
Don't talk to me like that.

265
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,050
I know

266
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,210
what I should do.

267
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,300
I'm just worried

268
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
that you're bewitched by Lu Yunkai.

269
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,740
Then let's discuss

270
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,230
why you think I should leave Wuxin.

271
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,240
It seems

272
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,690
that he values you

273
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,480
and cares about you,

274
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,130
and that you enjoy working at his company

275
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,410
and have helped him a lot,

276
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:05,810
right?

277
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,320
Well.

278
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,300
It seems so.

279
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,390
If you leave,

280
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,410
it will be a huge blow to his career

281
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,600
and you'll also hurt his feelings.

282
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,810
You should at least

283
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,700
make him as heartbroken as you were in the past.

284
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,820
Keep in touch.

285
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,130
You two seemed to be very close.

286
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,690
This is my personal matter, Mr. Lu.

287
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,890
I don't need to tell you about it, right?

288
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm sorry. If you don't want me to ask about it,

289
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,670
I'll never do it again.

290
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,310
So, Mr. Lu,

291
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,070
what brings you here?

292
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,630
I want to tell you

293
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,070
that you should follow your heart and make your own decision.

294
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,870
No matter what your decision is,

295
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,130
I'll be okay with it.

296
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,110
You heard my conversations with them?

297
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,550
I only heard your conversation with Ji Yaoqing.

298
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,140
I don’t know

299
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,180
what kind of person you think I am.

300
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,590
But I want to tell you

301
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,100
that no matter what your choice is,

302
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,170
and that whether you choose to stay or leave,

303
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,010
I just hope

304
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,810
you can be happy.

305
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,950
But if I leave,

306
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,430
it will cause some trouble for Wuxin.

307
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,190
You're okay with that?

308
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,020
Wuxin is a mature company.

309
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,820
It won't collapse just because one person leaves.

310
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,750
Though it may have little trouble,

311
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,710
I think I can handle it.

312
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,280
So you mean I'm not important?

313
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,550
I don't mean that.

314
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,520
Okay, Mr. Lu, I got it.

315
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,380
My lunch break is over.

316
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,730
If you don't have anything else that is important to tell me, I'll go back to work.

317
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
Why should I pay for

318
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,400
the drink that stupid guy ordered?

319
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,460
Mr. Lu.

320
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,130
Vice President is here.

321
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,160
Baifei from France has just entered the Chinese market

322
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,210
but their proposal is so similar to ours.

323
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,470
Besides Song Ruozhao,

324
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
I can't think of anyone else

325
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,350
who has something to do with Baifei.

326
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,680
I'll contact her later.

327
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,790
Give me her contact information.

328
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,660
Why are you suddenly so concerned?

329
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,060
Have you decided to stay?

330
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,600
It's my fault that I didn't let the organizer

331
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
know the idea of our previous proposal in time.

332
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,200
So,

333
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,480
I should be held accountable for this.

334
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,650
It's okay.

335
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,290
Let me handle it.

336
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,980
The deadline hasn't come yet.

337
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,329
But we're the only company

338
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,119
that hasn't submitted a proposal yet.

339
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,800
Why do you always stop me from contacting her?

340
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,470
Huh.

341
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,730
Are you afraid that I'll discover your secrets?

342
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,140
Yunkai won't come.

343
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,380
It's a wedding where actors are hired to pretend to be relatives.

344
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,700
Miss Zhou, I don't think you should have any hope for anything good about the wedding.

345
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,240
Yunkai promised to marry you

346
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,250
just because he wanted to do something against his family.

347
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,450
Otherwise, he wouldn't have hidden everything from you.

348
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,040
Mian.

349
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,450
Mian.

350
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,520
Don’t call me Mian.

351
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,790
I’m not Mian.

352
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,800
You are.

353
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,940
I got your hair and had its DNA tested.

354
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,680
Your DNA matched Tangyuan's.

355
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,350
I know

356
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,130
I did many things I shouldn't have done.

357
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,870
I understand

358
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,820
that you chose not to contact me after falling into the water.

359
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,810
I also understand that you didn't want to tell me who you were when you came back.

360
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,410
But I hope you won't say you're not her anymore.

361
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,430
We're working.

362
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,920
We shouldn't be talking about personal matters.

363
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,240
It's not that I don't want you to contact her.

364
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,170
I just don't want you to be unhappy.

365
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,030
Fine.

366
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,520
Well.

367
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,870
All other companies have submitted their proposals.

368
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,910
Since we're the last one to submit the proposal,

369
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,370
our proposal will be different from theirs.

370
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,640
Tell them we won't tell them our ideas first.

371
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,770
See you at the venue.

372
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,990
The proposal...

373
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm working on it.

374
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,670
There's something wrong with your theme of Wonderland.

375
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,400
You know?

376
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,760
Your idea is to hold a tea party for a few princesses.

377
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,670
It may attract some people at first.

378
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,980
But not many people will be interested in it.

379
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,710
Understand?

380
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,230
Many young people are more interested in

381
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,560
themes like games, heroes, or military wars.

382
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,670
Can't we be more creative?

383
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,550
I think your star theme has some problems.

384
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,470
Our time is limited.

385
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,510
We don't have time to make the dynamic effect possible.

386
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,300
Are you going to just hang the balls

387
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,470
there?

388
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,490
Are you going to get them to move with your hands?

389
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,190
Could you please reach a consensus

390
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,120
-before you let me draw?
-Tingwen, come to my office.

391
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,550
You want to see me?

392
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,310
Tingwen, have a seat.

393
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,630
I want to talk about

394
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,390
the Neverland Event.

395
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,630
Do you have any suggestions?

396
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,920
The day of the event is coming.

397
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,450
Everyone has been anxious about it recently.

398
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,960
Isn't it too complicated?

399
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,310
It's better to make it more complicated.

400
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,890
This kind of cultural performance

401
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,420
is called the Chinese mime.

402
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,060
Let's teach a lesson to the company

403
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,040
who stole our idea.

404
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,550
Who should take charge of the project?

405
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,920
We need to discuss it.

406
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,910
We're all in a discussion.

407
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,100
Only you were missing.

408
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,970
Sorry.

409
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,700
Wenting, what are you holding?

410
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,290
It's Tingwen.

411
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,420
How come you were in her office?

412
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,970
She's a despicable woman.

413
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,880
You'll get into trouble sooner or later if you don't stay away from her.

414
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,350
Although you can't get promoted,

415
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,310
you can work for another company or muddle along.

416
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,320
You don't have to work with her.

417
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
It'll be useless.

418
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,310
She will probably set a trap for you and you'll fall into it before you know it.

419
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,760
We were discussing the proposal for Neverland Event.

420
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,560
It's settled.

421
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,680
A new proposal?

422
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,140
Where is Song Ruozhao?

423
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,590
She is the co-organizer of this event.

424
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,970
She wants to laugh at me,

425
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,750
so she'll definitely come. But why...

426
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,340
She did come.

427
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,710
But she got carsick and seasick.

428
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,440
She had to hold on all the way.

429
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,190
But she couldn't make it when she arrived in the island.

430
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,930
She's resting in the lounge.

431
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
When I was passing by,

432
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,110
I saw her assistant telling her she had got a new message on her phone.

433
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,990
She lost her temper and said she was going to faint

434
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,420
and she was too sick to check her phone.

435
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
She asked her assistant to get lost.

436
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,310
That sounds like her.

437
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,680
I remember back then, on the wedding boat,

438
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,270
she also got sick and vomited.

439
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,200
Her face was pale and she was pretending she was okay.

440
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,410
You wanted to say something

441
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,240
after you answered the phone?

442
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,050
Those who are investigating that thing called.

443
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,650
Any news?

444
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,520
The land taken by that toy factory

445
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,920
is owned by Lu Yunkai.

446
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,370
But

447
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,150
he didn't really use it.

448
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,070
His name wasn't on the company's profile.

449
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,030
I asked the employees at different levels.

450
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,670
They said they never saw him.

451
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,920
So you mean...

452
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,310
I think he wasn't involved in it.

453
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,350
I think it was his family who forced those people to move and demolished those buildings.

454
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,950
It had nothing to do with him.

455
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,910
He's not on good terms with his family these years.

456
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,690
And he started his own business

457
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,740
from scratch.

458
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,720
But I'm surprised

459
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,340
that his family is that rich.

460
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,410
He doesn't look like one from that kind of family.

461
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,460
Why are you defending him?

462
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,690
There's no clear evidence that shows he did that.

463
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,360
Besides, that day when I peeked at his spare phone,

464
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,220
I found that his photo album was all taken by your photos

465
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,880
and he kept the chat records between him and you.

466
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,810
The more I looked, the more shocked I am.

467
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,630
After all, it's been so many years.

468
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,340
When you mentioned it before,

469
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,390
you always said you weren't good at dealing with a romantic relationship when you were young.

470
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,430
You said you gave your heart to him

471
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,010
but he only replied

472
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,040
with a smile.

473
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,420
You said your love was not equal and not passionate.

474
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,290
But it seems

475
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,270
he was having a hard time too.

476
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,830
He hasn't had a new relationship for so many years.

477
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,270
Looks like

478
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,700
he hasn't got over you.

479
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,510
Your feelings were hurt.

480
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,650
So when you're thinking about him,

481
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,060
you may not be rational.

482
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,880
Could there be

483
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,790
any misunderstandings?

484
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,100
He...

485
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,080
They said Mr. Lu had told them

486
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,250
that there would be a treasure hunting event.

487
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,310
They asked whether they could

488
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,440
take part in the treasure hunting event when everything is over?

489
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,600
Of course.

490
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,680
Let's do it together, okay?

491
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,530
Here.

492
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,310
Are they hungry?

493
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,850
How about

494
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,750
I take them to the restaurant after they get the gifts?

495
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,660
Miss.

496
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,150
Why aren't the stars shining?

497
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,830
Are they damaged like us?
