00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,670
What's wrong?

5
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,830
Why is there a folder on the rack?

6
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Well.

7
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,590
Today, a young failed entrepreneur

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,830

and insisted on

11
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,480
giving this to me.

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,180
The security guards were trying to stop him

13
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,180
but he still managed to give it to me.

00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,470

Let me keep it.

17
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,570
What?

18
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,710
Are you leaving now?

19
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,070
You come and go as you wish.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,160
Oh my god.

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,640
I can ship Mr. Lu and Mr. Jiang again.

22
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,759
Mr. Lu finally came to see Mr. Jiang again.

23
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,810
Hello.

24
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,160
Are you Mr. Liu Zhiming?

25
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,380
It's said you're finding investors.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,310
They two now see each other again.

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,920
It's so rare.

28
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,750
Hello.

29
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,430
Mian.

30
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,090
I've just found a guy

31
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,460
and I think I've got some clues.

32
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,180
Clues?

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,990
Yes.

34
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,870
I'll investigate

35
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,280
that toy factory incident right away.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,829
I'm not going.

37
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,810
Xin and I are going to the Designers' Summit.

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,670
We are ready to go.

39
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,190
Okay.

40
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,710
If you get any news,

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,170
tell me about it in time.

42
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,579
Bye.

43
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,430
Oh.

44
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,610
Here are the tickets and the documents you need.

45
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,780
Thank you.

46
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,710
We'll get going then.

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,510
Aren't you taking me with you?

48
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,390
Is it because you think I'll embarrass you?

49
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,620
There'll be occasions where you are needed.

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,880
By then, your presence

51
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,440
will be amazing.

52
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,150
Before it happens, you need to make a lot of preparations.

53
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,710
Bye.

54
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,650
Bye.

55
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,180
Mr. Lu.

Liu Zhiming is here.

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,720
Thank you.

58
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,470
Mr. Lu.

59
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,310
This is the profile of my company.

60
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,640
Please have a look at it.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,900
Well.

62
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,240
You called me

63
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,149
and told me that you would like to be our investor.

64
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,800
So let me give a brief introduction

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,279
to my company.

66
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,780
I've got some information about your company.

67
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,500
Let me tell you the information I got.

68
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,430
And you tell me

69
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,470
if it is correct.

70
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,620
Okay.

71
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,230
Mr. Liu.

72
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,770
You founded the company when you graduated from university.

73
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,500
You were one of the top students among your peers.

74
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,370
However, your business has experienced lots of ups and downs.

75
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,350
And in recent two years, your business has been in decline.

76
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,440
Last year,

77
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,490
your company made little profit.

78
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,659
You borrowed one million yuan at the end of last year

79
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,120
to give year-end bonuses to your employees.

80
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,480
This year, to continue to run your business,

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,010
you've taken out six loans.

82
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,580
You have even mortgaged your cars and houses.

83
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,860
But you still

84
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,080
don't have enough money to repay the loans and the increasing interest.

85
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,710
Mr. Lu, we do business. We sometimes make profits and we sometimes make losses.

86
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,830
It's normal.

87
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,470
But trust me.

88
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,800
Anxin Toys will rise again.

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,240
We've developed a few new toys recently.

90
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,340
There is a massive market potential for those toys.

91
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,510
Trust me.

92
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,240
I heard that…

93
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,840
I just heard that

94
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,970
your debt collectors are giving you a hard time.

95
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,710
They couldn't reach you

96
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,600
so they had to contact your mother.

97
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,790
Your mother has always supported you.

98
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,250
She even sold her house in your hometown to raise money.

99
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,670
One day, she was in a rush

100
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,380
and broke her leg.

101
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,960
No one is taking care of her now.

102
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,409
30% shares.

103
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,850
Six million yuan.

104
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,010
If you are not satisfied with anything,

105
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,100
we can discuss it.

106
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,310
No.

107
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm very satisfied.

108
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,980
I would like to help those who are in great difficulties.

109
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,820
By doing it, I always get serendipity.

110
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,520
As you said,

111
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,070
all businesses will experience ups and downs.

112
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,240
Businessmen sometimes make profits and sometimes make losses.

113
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,500
You have had many difficulties.

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
It's time for you to get lucky again.

115
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,230
Thank you.

116
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,490
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

117
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,230
I can pay off your debt for you

118
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,180
and give you a sum of money

119
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,130
to acquire your company

120
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,610
so that you'll just enjoy your life and won't have to work in the future.

121
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,610
What do you think?

122
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,480
What is your choice?

123
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,159
What?

124
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,450
This...

125
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,320
Mr. Lu,

126
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,650
I don't know why you're doing this.

127
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,540
It's said

128
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,470
that you were one of Mr. Zhou Heshan's favorite students.

129
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,610
Shall we go?

130
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,140
Yes.

131
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,500
The Master Louis's exhibition

132
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,230
is in the hall next to this hall.

133
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,690
Let's go and have a look.

134
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,500
I'm not going. You go first.

135
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,710
Anyway, it's rare for you to see your idol.

136
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,870
Okay, I'll go now.

137
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,409
There's no signal at all. What's wrong with this hall?

138
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,490
Can your phone be used here?

139
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,920
The neckline of the dress

140
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,390
is a wide V-shaped one.

141
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,890
It can help a woman who wears the dress

142
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,340
to hide her armpit fat.

143
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,450
This design is so good.

144
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,210
But last time,

145
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,909
when the model was wearing this dress,

146
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,480
the upper part of her boob tube

147
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,990
was loose.

148
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,190
So, when you're making ready-to-wear clothes of this design,

149
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,590
you need to find ways to solve that problem.

150
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,180
Hey.

151
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,920
You're the girl

152
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,120
who told everyone you were Helsin.

153
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,180
And you fooled so may people in China.

154
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,270
How can you still be pretending

155
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,070
that you know a lot about design?

156
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,590
Hello, everyone. You may not know her.

157
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,480
I met and talked to her

158
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,310
at the charity dinner of Love Enjoying Funds.

159
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,740
She claimed that

160
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,300
the Tina Moonlight Dress was designed by her.

161
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,790
In order to seduce a rich man,

162
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,050
she encouraged the man to disobey his parents.

163
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,660
Because of her, the man almost severed his relationship with his family.

164
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,230
She had no respect

165
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,120
for an elder aged over 70

166
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,920
and resorted to cyber violence.

167
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,030
So what does she do?

168
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,940
She's a so-called toy designer

169
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,160
who used to work

170
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,750
for a small toy factory.

171
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,520
And she hasn't designed anything herself by far.

172
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,160
She looks like an expert.

173
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,980
But in fact, she's ignorant.

174
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,790
As far as I know,

175
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,590
when you were a university student,

176
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,980
your family wasn't a well-off one.

177
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,440
It can be said that your family was very poor.

178
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,910
In your university years,

179
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,640
you lived on the financial aid.

180
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,930
Your teacher, Mr. Zhou

181
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,640
helped you a lot.

182
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,190
Yes.

183
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,650
For a long time,

184
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,350
he let you use his card

185
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,480
so that you could pay for meals in the Faculty Canteen.

186
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,250
Your family was so poor.

187
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,690
How come

188
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,090
when you graduated,

189
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,240
you had so much money

190
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,470
to establish a company?

191
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,160
It's all because that thing happened.

192
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,570
When you graduated,

193
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,290
you claimed that Mr. Zhou had plagiarized your toy design

194
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,690
when he was tutoring you.

195
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,630
You were furious.

196
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,540
You were sure he did that.

197
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,670
You reported the case to the university and let the media know it.

198
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,930
However, your teacher

199
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,010
never said anything bad to you in public.

200
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,740
Instead, he let the authorities investigate himself and the case.

201
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,100
Mr. Zhou was a top expert in his area.

202
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,670
He owned dozens of patents for utility models

203
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,390
and design patents.

204
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,030
So many people

205
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,810
wanted to collaborate with him.

206
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,410
How could it be possible

207
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,550
that he would plagiarize your design

208
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,750
which was immature and not ready to use.

209
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,080
He was a teacher for several decades and lots of people spoke highly of him.

210
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,870
Very few students disliked him

211
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,600
because they thought he was too strict.

212
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,380
However, after you reported him that year,

213
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,760
there were suddenly lots of malicious rumors about him.

214
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
Too many people accused him of doing wrong things.

215
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,250
Before the results of investigation came out,

216
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,780
the university had to make a decision under enormous pressure.

217
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,740
Wasn't it strange?

218
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,360
It's karma.

219
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:03,910
It's karma.

220
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,220
It's karma.

221
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,300
My company used to do well.

222
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,660
But now it is collapsing.

223
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,870
I made a fortune after I slandered him.

224
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,080
But now I'm broke.

225
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,570
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhou, don't do that.

226
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,790
Sit down.

227
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,950
You're young.

228
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,280
You should eat well

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,460
so that you can be energetic enough to study.

230
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,470
Unlike me,

231
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,670
I'm too old to eat much.

232
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,550
I'll do some work related to mechanics in the afternoon.

233
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,320
So annoying.

234
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,590
Mr. Zhou.

235
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,760
Let me help you with it this afternoon.

236
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,670
Okay.

237
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,870
Let's eat.

238
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,430
Okay.

239
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,070
Mr. Zhou.

240
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,600
Why are you giving me so much money?

241
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,030
These are all the bonuses for the project

242
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,660
right?

243
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,230
I'm old now.

244
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,610
I have enough money for food and clothes.

245
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,590
I don't need this money.

246
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,020
Mr. Zhou, I can't take it.

247
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,620
I didn't contribute much to the completion of this project.

248
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,430
Take it.

249
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,360
You are talented and diligent.

250
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,800
But you're still young.

251
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,020
You haven't started making much money yet.

252
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,650
Mr. Zhou.

253
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,690
I really can't take the money.

254
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,820
When you become successful,

255
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,790
don't forget me.

256
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,990
By then,

257
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,360
come visit me and buy me some good wine.

258
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,600
But

259
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,670
remember to come visit me secretly.

260
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,190
If my wife sees you give me wine,

261
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,310
she'll be angry.

262
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,160
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

263
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,860
Keep working hard.

264
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,650
I will.

265
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,740
I believe you'll have a bright future.

266
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,400
Keep going.

267
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,470
How much?

268
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,280
1.05 yuan. Just give me one yuan.

269
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,720
Okay.

270
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:22,830
Okay.

271
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,120
One yuan.

272
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,330
It's just a radish. You just need to pay one yuan.

273
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,200
Madam.

274
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,470
This eggplant is not so fresh.

275
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,930
-Can you give it to me?
-No.

276
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,120
You must buy it.

277
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,030
I feel deeply ashamed that

278
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,230
as a man who was educated for many years, I hurt my teacher.

279
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,970
I was such an ungrateful man.

280
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,900
Because of what I did, my beloved teacher died.

281
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,790
I feel so sorry.

282
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,030
I feel ashamed of myself.

283
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,330
Back then, you were too young and you felt inferior.

284
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,630
So others used you.

285
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,790
Now,

286
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,150
you've learned your lesson.

287
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,070
Shouldn't you

288
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,090
let the culprit

289
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,150
who plotted against your teacher

290
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,080
be punished?

291
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,320
I guess

292
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,410
the person who asked you to slander your teacher

293
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,740
was Song Bingzhu of Songshi Group, right?

294
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,320
No.

295
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,000
It was Mike who made me do it.

296
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,350
At the exhibition,

297
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,550
I'll only discuss the works and the designs with others.

298
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,380
Miss Song.

299
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,480
You cheated the Design Committee,

300
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,830
violate the professional ethics,

301
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,590
and steal others' works.

302
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,430
How will you explain all of those things?

303
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,890
You're talking nonsense.

304
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,120
Do you still claim

305
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,750
that the Pure Love series

306
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,490
was designed by you?

307
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,060
Of course.

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,580
If you keep messing around, I'll ask the security guards to come.

309
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,950
Come on, do it. Everything I just said is true.

310
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,880
If you think you did nothing wrong,

311
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,400
let me finish first.

312
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,890
What I want to say is

313
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,000
that the Pure Love series

314
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,000
wasn't designed by Miss Song.

315
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,090
Its real designer

316
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,470
is Miss Song's assistant, Jiang Ning.

317
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,110
Miss Song.

318
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,950
When you are finishing a design draft,

319
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,480
you always use marker pens.

320
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,010
Miss Song has a set of all-color marker pens.

321
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,590
She often posted the pictures of those pens

322
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,740
on her Instagram.

323
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,860
You can also tell that her previous design drafts

324
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,670
were all finished with marker pens.

325
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,150
But the design drafts of the Pure Love series are different.

326
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,880
After the series won the award,

327
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,430
she showed the design drafts when she was being interviewed by the media.

328
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,560
Those design drafts

329
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,400
were finished with sketch pens and color pencils

330
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,440
which are exactly the tools Jiang Ning likes to use

331
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,500
when she is finishing design drafts.

332
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,099
So what?

333
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,270
It's just a coincidence.

334
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,680
Am I not allowed to use different pens and pencils?

335
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,480
That's right.

336
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,510
You can also use those pens and pencils.

337
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,040
Boss.

338
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,680
Jiang Ning

339
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,740
graduated from a famous design university.

340
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,140
When she was 20 years old,

341
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,720
she was in love with her boyfriend,

342
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,180
so she designed a wedding dress for herself.

343
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,510
When the image of her design was posted on the university's online forum,

344
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,310
it attracted a lot of attention.

345
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,730
Before you published the Pure Love series,

346
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,440
all the posts of the design of that wedding dress

347
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,190
were deleted from the university's online forum.

348
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,310
But don't forget,

349
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,440
those posts can still be found.

350
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,680
I have an picture of one of those posts.

351
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,950
Please take a look.

352
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,720
Let's see whether Jiang Ning's design draft

353
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,450
of the wedding dress looks like

354
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
this dress.

355
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,900
Jiang Ning's series of the wedding dress

356
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,360
was named Bewick's Swans.

357
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,350
It's because Jiang Ning's boyfriend

358
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,310
proposed to her

359
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,100
in front of a group of Bewick’s swans.

360
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,860
Miss Song.

361
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,900
You've been single for years.

362
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,760
I don't think you also have that kind of experience.

363
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,870
Besides,

364
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,260
Miss Song,

365
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,790
you finished the design drafts with your right hand.

366
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,590
And Jiang Ning is a left-hander.

367
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,710
We can let an expert examine these drafts.

368
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,640
Then we'll know who finished them.

369
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,970
Your assistant, Miss Jiang Ning,

370
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,300
is a talented designer.

371
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,630
But she has no chance to let others know her talent.

372
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,290
You took away all her designs.

373
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,300
You

374
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,230
tried to win the attention of your family

375
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,800
by winning awards with works that didn't belong to you.

376
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,330
Miss Jiang Ning's brother was seriously ill.

377
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,610
When she didn't have the money to pay for her brother's surgery,

378
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,610
you gave her the money but forced her

379
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,470
to let you take the credit for the design

380
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,070
she was working on for years.

381
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,740
After this,

382
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,630
you realized stealing her designs could bring you huge benefits.

383
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,810
So when Jiang Ning said she wanted to quit,

384
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,740
you refused.

385
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,870
When she was pregnant,

386
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,940
you still let her make designs for you.

387
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,700
What you did

388
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,280
is so unacceptable.

389
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,710
Hello.

390
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,570
Are you really not going to fight back?

391
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,440
If you aren't, you'll let your 20-year-old self down.

392
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,310
How did you find out about it?

393
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,660
I've said what I had to say.

394
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,110
I believe you understand what I mean.

395
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,860
Truths will be revealed sooner or later.

396
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,690
But the talents of some great artists

397
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,200
may never be appreciated.

398
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,220
You thought you would be successful

399
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,950
because you were a top student.

400
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,810
You thought you would have a promising career

401
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,540
after you joined a big company.

402
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,040
You thought your life would be better

403
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,570
if you just hanged in there.

404
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,180
You thought wrong.

405
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,390
It's time you faced the reality.

406
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,450
I used to be so proud of myself.

407
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,290
I thought I would

408
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,920
have a bright future.

409
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,830
I never expected my life would be like this.

410
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,880
When our classmates were having a party,

411
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,410
everyone showed their own designs and works.

412
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,130
I used to be the top student in my class

413
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,290
but I've never been to those parties.

414
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,360
You should have chosen the right path.

415
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,760
But it's not too late now.

416
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,810
You can join Wuxin at any time.

417
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,700
I'll make you a designer at Wuxin.

418
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,220
Me?

419
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,730
Really?

420
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:53,990
Yes.

421
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,880
Can't you tell

422
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,850
I really appreciate your talent?

423
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,970
Give me your contact info.

424
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,820
[Zhou Mian]

425
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,460
Yes.

426
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,150
She did.

427
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,620
She stole my designs.

428
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,290
Miss Song.

429
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,650
Miss Song.

430
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,640
Miss Song, is it true?

431
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,390
Say something.

432
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,850
Say something, Miss Song.

433
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,730
Mike?

434
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,200
Yes.

435
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,730
I used to

436
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,780
work for Mike for a few years.

437
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,880
I see.

438
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,090
Mike hated the Lu family so much

439
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,500
that he cooperated with the Songshi Group.

440
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,020
And he wanted to take over

441
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,800
the design business

442
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,190
of Dreams Chasing Toy which dominated the city's market.

443
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,070
But he knew

444
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,190
little about toy design.

445
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,570
So he planned to get your teacher,

446
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,770
the top expert in toy design to help him.

447
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,800
He thought he could buy all his designs

448
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,390
and get the exclusive rights to use them.

449
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,830
But your teacher didn't agree.

450
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,060
So he then ruined his career and reputation.

451
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,010
He thought when your teacher was in a desperate situation,

452
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,380
your teacher would agree to sell all his patents to him.

453
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,780
But your teacher didn't.

454
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,670
After that,

455
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,570
your teacher started to run his own toy factory

456
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,730
and develop his toy design business.

457
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,660
He was so desperate that he asked a group of people

458
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,990
to pretend to be demolition crew and threaten your teacher.

459
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,140
Then he stole all your teacher's patent toy designs.

460
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,540
When he was running his toy business,

461
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,160
he even asked you,

462
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,190
one of Mr. Zhou's favorite students, to work with him.

463
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,080
He would do all the terrible things

464
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,770
just to get what he wanted.

465
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,870
I was in charge of those factories

466
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,020
which manufactured old-styled toys.

467
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,220
The Songshi Group invested a lot in his toy business.

468
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,810
One day, someone said online

469
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,390
that the toys manufactured by Mike's factories

470
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,160
were the same as those manufactured by a small factory in the past.

471
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,360
That netizen also posted a lot pictures comparing the toys.

472
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,830
The stock price of the Songshi Group was plummeting.

473
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,790
They had many problems to deal with.

474
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,050
They were worried that

475
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,820
the Songshi Group would be involved in a sandal of patent theft.

476
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,650
They were worried that if that happened,

477
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,210
their core business units would be negatively influenced.

478
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:49,820
So,

479
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,820
they closed the toy factories,

480
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,880
gave me some money,

481
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,810
and let me stop working for them.

482
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,300
Every night, when I go home and close my eyes,

483
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,780
I think of Mr. Zhou.

484
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,670
In my head, he was holding the food in the canteen

485
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,020
and he said to me,

486
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,150
"Zhiming,

487
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,200
why did you do those bad things?

488
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,950
Why

489
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,490
didn't you take a right path?"

490
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

491
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,180
Looks like you still have some conscience.

492
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,350
Mr. Lu.

493
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,470
Will you

494
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,330
keep the promise you just made?

495
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,030
Please take good care of my factory

496
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,970
and my mother.

497
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,080
Then I have nothing to worry about.

498
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,870
Mr. Lu.

499
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,380
The Technical Department tried to

500
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,100
repair these old videos.

501
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,020
Take a look.

502
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,440
There should be some clues in these videos.

503
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,030
It's time to get them punished.

504
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,920
They will all pay the price.

505
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,360
Miss Song.

506
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,560
Miss Song.

507
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,300
Mr. Song wants to see you.
