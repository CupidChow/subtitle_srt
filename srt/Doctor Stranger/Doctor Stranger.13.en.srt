1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,003
-Have you found it?
-I can't see, Chief.

3
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,847
Calm down.

4
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,840
-But, Chief...
-I said calm down!

5
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,644
Keum Bong-hyun...

6
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,541
Please let me in.

7
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,467
Why does everyone look like
you did something wrong?

8
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,660
You haven't done anything wrong.
So chin up.

9
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,098
The people who should be ashamed
are all up there.

10
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,032
Look.

11
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,783
You should be proud.

12
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,954
You're the only real doctors
in this hospital.

13
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,870
Your neck must be hurting.
Stop looking at them and let's start.

14
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,706
Please find the spot that's bleeding.

15
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:22,075
I can't find it. There's too much blood.

16
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:26,313
We're in the middle of surgery,
so we can't do a CT scan or an ultrasound.

17
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,685
Suction.

18
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:51,064
Bovie.

19
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,438
Forceps.

20
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:03,283
It seems like there is no
impossible surgery for Dr Park.

21
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,353
And what is the use of being great?
All of us are about to get fired.

22
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,499
-Vitals?
-Excellent.

23
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,658
There'snothing to worry about anymore.

24
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,327
Of course!

25
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:15,104
You have a great first assistant like me.

26
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,125
Right?

27
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,035
What are you doing?

28
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:24,480
Didn't I tell you to call the committee
and prepare for a lawsuit?

29
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,106
Yes, Mr Chairman.

30
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,080
I see why he wants the disciplinary
committee,

31
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,615
but what's the lawsuit about?

32
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:37,751
The surgery was all about exposing
the malpractice of this hospital!

33
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,254
So we must prepare for a lawsuit.

34
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,789
This is going to be tiring.

35
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,759
Can we talk to the internal medicine
department

36
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,538
and try to avoid the lawsuit?

37
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,406
How do you want me to convince them?

38
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:55,836
Have you ever seen a doctor
who easily admits his faults?

39
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,506
-Let me finish up.
-Thank you.

40
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,375
You did a great job.

41
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,245
You did a great job, sir.

42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,846
Han Jae-joon!

43
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:46,753
I was very clear when I warned you
it's over if you operate on that patient.

44
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,723
-I'm ready to face the consequences.
-A sincere apology?

45
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:58,131
Okay, let's see if the lawsuit
can be prevented with that.

46
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,582
Doctor?

47
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,353
Don't worry. The surgery went well.

48
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:21,555
Thank you, doctor!

49
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,729
I apologize on behalf of this hospital
for causing you so much trouble.

50
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,110
You have nothing to apologize for.

51
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,803
If anything, the doctors
in internal medicine should apologize.

52
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,174
Are you going to file a lawsuit?

53
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,410
I'm not sure.

54
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,649
Give me a call if you need anything.

55
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,166
We're all about to be fired.

56
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,836
Shouldn't we come up
with a plan of some sort?

57
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,329
Didn't you see lasers beaming out
of the Chairman's eyes?

58
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,264
A plan won't do anything.

59
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,069
Except for one person.

60
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,573
What are you waiting for
instead of moving the patient?

61
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,578
I'll be there soon.

62
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,349
Dr Keum!

63
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,755
What is this strange feeling
of loneliness and solitude?

64
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,638
-Are you worried that you'll be fired?
-No!

65
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:45,782
Then, what?

66
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:47,884
I'm Dr Han's first assistant,

67
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:51,211
and I haven't helped at all
in either surgery!

68
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,617
This is my first time seeing you
this angry.

69
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,522
Don't be too hard on yourself.

70
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:06,627
Children learn to be adults
by making mistakes.

71
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,563
Are you saying that I'm a child?

72
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:10,606
No, not at all.

73
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:17,571
I was just saying that you have
that stroke of pureness...

74
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:42,196
Stop treating me like a child!

75
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,168
Okay.

76
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:51,805
Then...

77
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:54,975
...from now on...

78
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:02,216
From now on... I'll treat you like a man.

79
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,221
Mom!

80
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,893
Your mom will be okay.

81
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,095
Thank you, doctor.

82
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:18,498
I'm a fake doctor.
Dr Oh here is the real one.

83
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,303
Right?

84
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:25,991
Yeah.

85
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,897
We'll let you know
when your mom wakes up.

86
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,978
-Be patient.
-Yes, doctor.

87
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:35,983
Did he say Dr Oh?

88
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,338
What are you looking at?

89
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,908
Did you call me Dr Oh?

90
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,509
Did I?

91
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,178
You said that to Jae-cheol just now!

92
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,380
I must have made a mistake.

93
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:08,415
It wasn't a mistake.

94
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,519
What is this about?

95
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,588
You told me to be more confident.

96
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,201
You said we're the only real doctors
in this hospital.

97
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,261
That's why you called me Dr Oh.
Am I wrong?

98
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,639
I didn't realize you were there, quack.

99
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,641
-Really?
-Of course.

100
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,235
Everyone looks the same in those masks!

101
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:30,070
You even talked to me!

102
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,905
That was after the surgery.

103
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,374
Do you really hate the fact
that you called me Dr Oh?

104
00:09:34,838 --> 00:09:36,577
Is it that important?

105
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:39,379
You're losing your hair because you care
too much about things like that!

106
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,716
You should be worried about your own hair.

107
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:44,518
It's not appropriate for a doctor!

108
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:47,096
-What's wrong with my hair?
-You should cut it.

109
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,547
Patients prefer doctors who look neat.
Not the ones with weird permed hair.

110
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,471
Stop talking nonsense
and go talk to your father.

111
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,463
About what?

112
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,067
Everyone will be fired
because we all operated on her.

113
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:05,038
Now I know that Dr Han
isn't that bad of a person.

114
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,842
I don't care about others,
but you should try to save him.

115
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:18,118
LEGAL COMPLAINT
Plaintiff: Park Cheol

116
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:24,324
I'm sorry, father.

117
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,969
The patient woke up.

118
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,730
-Okay.
-You were amazing today.

119
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,310
You know that, right?

120
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,379
Thanks.

121
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,714
Don't worry too much about the Chairman.

122
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,952
I'm going back to the States
once I leave here.

123
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,080
To the States?

124
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,557
But I don't want to go alone.

125
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:02,796
Come with me.

126
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,799
I'll find you a job at Harvard.

127
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,343
Thanks.

128
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,847
But you're not leaving this hospital.

129
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:21,882
I'm going to do everything
to convince my father.

130
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,452
Cheer up.

131
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,492
Why did you go into that surgery?

132
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:14,935
Let's talk about it later.

133
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,225
I said later.

134
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,410
-Hoon...
-Just go.

135
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,131
I want to be alone right now.

136
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,605
You hate the idea
of competing on patients.

137
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,492
So I thought if we get through this one,
we won't have to do it again!

138
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,876
-So...
-So?

139
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,812
Did you want me to ignore a patient
who could've died?

140
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,814
There were other doctors in the room!

141
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,218
The patient was dying.

142
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,253
And those doctors were asking for help.

143
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,655
How could I not do anything about it?

144
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,034
Please don't do this to me.

145
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,574
I really get confused
when you're like this to me.

146
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,915
When I saw you for the first time here,
I was very embarrassed.

147
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:40,153
I did so many bad things
while you were gone.

148
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,390
But I mustered up the courage.

149
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,694
Because I've found you.

150
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,464
Because my dream has returned.

151
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:57,070
I really thought I'd be able to go back
to the time when I gave you the bracelet.

152
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:03,677
But Jae-Hee...
how could you do this to me?

153
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:12,019
How can you tell me to ignore
a dying patient?

154
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,021
That little ass...

155
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,267
-Let go.
-Stop.

156
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:01,635
Get a grip.

157
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,644
Stop. Stop it!

158
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:21,052
Stop...

159
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:24,358
Please stop.

160
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,764
You can afford to wait for now.

161
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,035
You can wait for now.

162
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:56,156
Don't judge by yourself
whether my decision is right or wrong.

163
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,898
You want me to forgive them?

164
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,769
What you're concerned about
is a malpractice suit, right?

165
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,672
Malpractice suits are like a disease.

166
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:17,611
If you ignore it, it'll quickly spread
to the whole body and kill you.

167
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,847
It may kill Myung-woo.

168
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:24,384
So what if the family doesn't sue?

169
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,056
Her guardian already requested
her medical records.

170
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,792
That means they've begun
to prepare for lawsuit.

171
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:36,530
So will you forgive us all
if they don't sue?

172
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,400
Why are you doing this?
Is it for Han Jae-joon?

173
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,636
Of course.

174
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,905
You asked for more time
when I told you to get engaged.

175
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:46,139
Has something changed?

176
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,986
He's the only one for me.

177
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,813
If he leaves, I might have
to be alone for the rest of my life.

178
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:55,582
-Is that okay with you?
-That's a terrible thing to say.

179
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,253
So, Dad, please promise me.

180
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,356
If there's no malpractice suit,
you'll forgive us all.

181
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,769
Fine.

182
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,363
But there will be a lawsuit for sure.

183
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,267
What Han Jae-joon described
is impossible in this world.

184
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,702
I'll try to prove you wrong this time.

185
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:21,842
Thanks, Dad.

186
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:56,610
That's not a proper meal.

187
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,050
This is very delicious.

188
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,786
You should cook it right
to make it a proper meal.

189
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,021
What brings you here?

190
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,123
I have a favor to ask.

191
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:11,558
What favor?

192
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,231
He'll forgive us if there's no lawsuit?

193
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:19,600
Yeah, so please help me.

194
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,469
Why doesn't he just forgive us
without any conditions?

195
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,437
This is so petty.

196
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,772
But now Dr Han will have a chance.

197
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,508
You'll help me, right?

198
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:29,409
Forget it.

199
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,411
You'll get fired too
if you don't do anything.

200
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:32,980
If I get fired, I'll leave.

201
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:33,981
Don't you need money?

202
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,959
I can make money here.
If not, I'll figure out other ways.

203
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,162
Are you really going to be
uncooperative like that?

204
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:41,230
It was you who said Dr Han
isn't that bad after all!

205
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:45,959
And are you just going to let those
"real doctors" get fired?

206
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,661
You do have a point.

207
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,531
But why me?

208
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:53,534
All you need to say is yes!
You're talking too much now.

209
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,302
You're the one who needs me!
Stop yelling!

210
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:57,971
Fine, forget it. I'll do it myself.

211
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,340
Fine, I'll help.

212
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:04,545
Other people's livelihoods depend on this.
Can't you be more serious?

213
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:06,713
It's not like they'll die
from losing their jobs.

214
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:07,981
Hey, Park Hoon!

215
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:09,583
I'm sorry.

216
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,051
What do you want me to do?

217
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:14,121
We need to convince her family first.

218
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:18,192
You really are clueless, quack.
How can that be our first step?

219
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,150
Just do as I say. Okay?

220
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,465
Okay. Fine.

221
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,371
I'm sorry, doctor.

222
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:36,210
I can't forgive those who tried
to hide their mistakes.

223
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,911
Dad...

224
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,557
We can promise financial compensation
for the malpractice.

225
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,016
Money is important.

226
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:47,988
But I think it's more important to know
what went wrong during my wife's surgery.

227
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:53,093
And to receive a sincere apology
from them if they made a mistake.

228
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,239
They will never apologize.

229
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,598
Dr Park?

230
00:19:58,165 --> 00:19:59,233
Okay.

231
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,603
We'll try to go talk to them.

232
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:03,904
Apology?

233
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:05,448
What apology?

234
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:06,840
Who do you think you are?

235
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,742
She could have died if we hadn't operated!

236
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,187
Our treatment was sufficient.

237
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,714
You're the ones who exaggerated!

238
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,183
He can sue if he wants to.

239
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,853
We're not scared!

240
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:22,965
What do we do?

241
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,416
You really don't know?
If begging doesn't work, then we threaten.

242
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:26,702
Threaten?

243
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,405
A third year resident performed
the surgery.

244
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,231
I did hear about Dr Kim.

245
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:35,044
I called the branch hospital to verify,
but apparently he can't be reached.

246
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:38,405
-Then we must find him.
-How?

247
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,651
Do you have some money?

248
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,443
Money? For what?

249
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:45,979
To find Dr Kim.

250
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,883
How's your boss doing?

251
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:31,325
He's doing well. Thanks to you.

252
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:35,262
Thanks to you, he's very healthy
in prison.

253
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:38,841
Geez, I'm sorry to hear that.
I really didn't leak it to anyone.

254
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:39,967
It's fine.

255
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:45,372
My boss is gone for 10 years.
I'm the new boss in the meantime.

256
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:48,709
Congratulations.

257
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,310
That's not necessary.

258
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:51,712
Thanks a lot.

259
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:53,614
Where do you think you're going now?

260
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,689
-Here.
-Endorse them.

261
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:04,191
Right!

262
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,660
Of course, I must endorse them!

263
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:10,564
It was very difficult for my boys
to find this guy.

264
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:12,593
Guys, roll call!

265
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:13,765
-One!
-Two!

266
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:14,724
-Three!
-Four!

267
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:15,680
-Five!
-Six!

268
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:16,621
-Seven!
-Eight!

269
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:17,601
-Nine!
-Ten!

270
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:18,681
Eleven!

271
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:22,009
Quite a lot, don't you think?

272
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:23,544
They like to eat steak.

273
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,345
USD 100 per person.

274
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:28,048
You really have a good memory!

275
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,551
Let's feed them some steak.

276
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:32,753
Who's this woman?

277
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:35,822
Money keeps coming out of her purse!
Is she an ATM?

278
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,759
Is that enough now?

279
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,927
Give me 50 more cents.

280
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:40,928
Why?

281
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:44,339
I don't know.
But you asked me for it, too!

282
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,339
Great!

283
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:54,241
Good luck.

284
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,095
Shall we?

285
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:57,845
Thanks!

286
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,948
Give me a call if you need help again!

287
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,550
Can I help you?

288
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,285
I need to talk to you, sir.

289
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:10,390
I'm ticklish!

290
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:13,060
Do you think I'm that naive
to get my voice recorded?

291
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:15,195
A recording? What recording?

292
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:16,439
Don't play dumb.

293
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,940
You're here to record me

294
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,601
saying that it's my fault,
so you can use it during trial!

295
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,386
I don't know what you want
to talk about,

296
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:31,888
but we didn't do anything wrong.

297
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:32,955
You're right.

298
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,114
It's my dad's fault.

299
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:38,018
This happened while you were trying
to treat my mom.

300
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:41,154
So I don't think a lawsuit is necessary.

301
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:50,339
Since you're a doctor, I hope
you understand my father's position.

302
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,375
Is that so?

303
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:56,036
Go tell your dad
exactly what you just told me.

304
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,279
Professor!

305
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:08,115
Don't you think that's too much
for a little kid?

306
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:23,997
Where drums beat, laws are silent.

307
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,736
Let's do this amicably.
If you don't apologize...

308
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:30,704
Doctor!

309
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,817
Geez, you have nothing to gain
from this lawsuit.

310
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,703
You'll be beating your head
against a wall!

311
00:24:46,794 --> 00:24:48,956
This is how you are.

312
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:51,134
I don't want anything else.

313
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:56,797
If there really was a malpractice,
I want you to admit it and apologize.

314
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,999
That's all I want.

315
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,803
Once we apologize,
you'll record it and submit it to court!

316
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,573
Do you really think we're that naive?

317
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:10,141
Stop being ridiculous...

318
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:15,549
What is it?

319
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:24,157
If you're curious,
observe from that corner.

320
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,098
We apologize, sir!

321
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:40,741
There was a mistake when one
of our residents operated on your wife.

322
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:48,081
We sincerely apologize for not
disclosing this from the beginning.

323
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:53,187
We did something very shameful as doctors.

324
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:55,756
We're sorry.

325
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:02,763
Was it that difficult?

326
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:11,004
"I'm sorry. It's our fault!"

327
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,275
Is it that difficult to say it?

328
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:26,653
I'm going to sue everyone! I will!

329
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:32,292
Don't do it, Dad.

330
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,530
They tried to heal mom.

331
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:39,600
They'll also heal me.

332
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:45,405
They'll also heal you
when you get sick later.

333
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:18,739
Thanks.

334
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,242
Why don't you buy me dinner then?

335
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,135
Dae-sung!

336
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:28,047
I said you can't just take these!
Give it to me.

337
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,165
It's dirty.

338
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:46,233
It's fine.

339
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,001
Hey, son.

340
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:14,027
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, my son.

341
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:16,797
Is he your son?

342
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,978
You can't just wander off like this.
Please come with me.

343
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,639
We're near the psychiatric ward.

344
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:04,645
What's wrong?

345
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:07,548
I don't know.

346
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,820
Hey, Park Hoon.

347
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,491
Everything is over.

348
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,960
Everything...

349
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:24,407
After careful consideration,

350
00:29:24,498 --> 00:29:29,036
we decided that the hospital
to operate on my heart will be...

351
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,407
...Jae Il University Hospital.

352
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:38,779
What were the criteria for your decision?

353
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,208
When will the surgery happen?

354
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:43,083
Why was Myung-woo hospital
eliminated...?

355
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,603
Not only does Jae Il Hospital
have the best medical team...

356
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:07,007
...but their ethical practice
also earned them a high score.

357
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:10,244
Because all three hospitals

358
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:13,280
aren't that different
from each other objectively...

359
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:16,450
Jae Il Hospital was chosen in the end.

360
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:20,554
Jae Il University Hospital...

361
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:26,527
So what happens to us now?

362
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:28,662
Don't you know what happens?

363
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,164
Everything,
including the competition, is over.

364
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:36,145
We've been barking up the wrong tree.

365
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:37,571
Don't you think so, water bottle?

366
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,178
Why are you so happy
that our hospital was eliminated?

367
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,613
That's exactly why. You want some?

368
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:47,714
Sure.

369
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:49,950
You've been eating it!

370
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:55,255
Since Soo-hyun has asked me, too,
I'll let this incident slide.

371
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:57,266
Thank you, sir.

372
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,460
Then you're forgiving
all the other doctors, too, right?

373
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:01,595
Except one.

374
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:04,596
-Who?
-Park Hoon.

375
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:06,066
I can't forgive him.

376
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:08,569
He's the one who did the most
to prevent this lawsuit.

377
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,936
But why...

378
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,039
I said I can't!

379
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:22,616
It's been quite a ride for you, my master.

380
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:23,617
Yes.

381
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:26,820
Thank you for your hard work.

382
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:29,857
I hope you'll achieve
your dad's last wish.

383
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,197
Hey.

384
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:41,301
What happened to the USD 50,000
that I gave you before?

385
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:43,237
You won't be able to use them.

386
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:45,038
Why not?

387
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,312
I only have half.

388
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:58,371
Fine, I'll take care of this.
We can't use it anyway.

389
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:00,854
Thank you for your work.

390
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,447
I'm sorry.

391
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:48,969
You keep this.

392
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,546
Would you please throw this away?

393
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:26,849
CARDIOLOGY PARK HOON

394
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,941
Hey, quack.

395
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:33,090
If you keep up the good work,
you'll become a great doctor one day.

396
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,317
Take care.

397
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:46,193
Tell me if you want to stay.
I'll talk to my father again.

398
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:48,838
Forget about it.

399
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:51,465
Your father will never
be able to accept me.

400
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:52,575
Why not?

401
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:55,269
He's the one who accepted you
in the first place.

402
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:57,580
That's when he didn't know who I was.

403
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:59,144
What are you talking about?

404
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,343
There's something like that.
Anyway, take care.

405
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,982
Tell me what to do now.

406
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:45,919
Okay.

407
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:57,130
Dr Park!

408
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:01,602
Take it just in case.

409
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:04,872
DR. PARK HOON, CARDIOLOGY

410
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:55,455
Help me.

411
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:07,434
Thank you.

412
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,642
Are the blood test results ready
for Mr Kim in Room 25?

413
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,878
The doctor must order
the administration of the drug.

414
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:52,746
Just a minute.

415
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:03,357
Yes, this is station.

416
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:06,059
Hey, quack!

417
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,006
Everyone calls you a quack because
you can't even do simple procedures!

418
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:11,164
When will you wake up?

419
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:12,809
It hurts!

420
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,836
When will you wake up? When?

421
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:41,135
Hello?

422
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,312
Aren't you going to answer the phone?

423
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:52,758
The test result for Mr Kim
has been delayed because...

424
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:54,842
Dr Oh?

425
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:58,745
Are you crying?

426
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,714
Me?

427
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:04,518
Me?

428
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,989
-Did something happen?
-No.

429
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,291
Something must've gotten into my eye.

430
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:35,916
What's...

431
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:40,454
Just for a minute...

432
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:16,523
You should have some!
These are all very expensive here.

433
00:39:16,614 --> 00:39:17,891
Please tell me.

434
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:22,062
-Jae Il Hospital?
-So...

435
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:26,800
Myung-woo, Min Kook, and Jae Il...

436
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,636
I sent these names up
for the President's approval.

437
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,282
Since the President is very interested
in this matter,

438
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,142
I figured I'll let him
have his say on this.

439
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:42,616
But it just felt like he would reject
any hospital that I recommended.

440
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:47,087
I felt like he'd pick Min Kook or Jae Il
if I recommend Myung-woo.

441
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:51,265
So I picked Min Kook on purpose...

442
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:56,897
But the President went with Jae Il.

443
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,376
I'm not here to hear that kind of story.

444
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,735
Of course not.

445
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:11,478
What you want to hear... is in this.

446
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:20,087
Don't worry.
Our project will proceed as planned.

447
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:30,831
It's a nice place.

448
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,879
As you can see, I don't have much stuff.

449
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,751
The cup isn't important
as long as it tastes good.

450
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:04,565
This is the worst coffee I've ever tasted.

451
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:09,736
I tried my best to make this!
Don't be too cruel.

452
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:22,431
Is this rotten? I think it's gone bad.

453
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:26,053
Your coffee brewing skills
are nothing like your surgical skills.

454
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:29,790
I assume you aren't here to try my coffee.

455
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,225
What brings you here?

456
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,827
I have two questions to ask.

457
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:35,872
Two questions?

458
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:38,732
Why did you help my surgery?

459
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:44,271
Why did you do the surgery?

460
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:46,829
I guess it was for the patient.

461
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,612
Did we do it for the same reason?

462
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:53,514
I'm sorry.

463
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:57,317
If I just did it from the beginning,
it could have saved you a lot of trouble.

464
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:59,386
I heard from Dr Oh.

465
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:03,332
I owe you one. Thank you.

466
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:05,435
It's not like I did something huge.

467
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:08,595
Did you stop the lawsuit
because you were worried about me?

468
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,532
This is my second question.

469
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:13,796
Just a little bit.

470
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:15,912
That's unexpected.

471
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:19,006
It's also unexpected to me
that I was worried about you.

472
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,209
Why?

473
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:25,822
We haven't been on good terms.
Why were you worried about me?

474
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:28,391
You have interesting taste.

475
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:30,684
Do you really want to hear why?
It's embarrassing.

476
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:33,470
Yes.

477
00:42:34,788 --> 00:42:36,183
You know why.

478
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:39,726
I want to hear it from you.

479
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:50,003
It's because I think you're a good doctor.

480
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:51,817
Are you happy now?

481
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:04,384
Let's go drink. My treat.

482
00:43:10,002 --> 00:43:11,270
This is difficult.

483
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,893
Have you ever made curry before?

484
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:14,862
I don't like it much.

485
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:16,930
Then why are you making so much?

486
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:24,204
You're good at this, Dr Han!

487
00:43:32,095 --> 00:43:33,189
Aren't you going to eat it?

488
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,883
How far is Dr Park's office from here?

489
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:37,527
Why?

490
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:39,353
I think he likes curry.

491
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,222
It seems like
we'll have a lot of left over.

492
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,458
Should we call him?

493
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:47,136
Is that why you made so much?

494
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:48,328
No...

495
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:53,433
He just eats instant curry over rice.

496
00:43:57,938 --> 00:43:59,273
How do you know that?

497
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:03,761
It's okay, right?

498
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:41,248
So...

499
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:43,659
...after all we did
for the Prime Minister's surgery,

500
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,985
Myung-woo was eliminated!

501
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,522
I didn't know it would end like this.

502
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:50,858
But do you know how scared I was
when I lost the first round?

503
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,660
It felt like the sky turned yellow
all of a sudden!

504
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:55,796
I think you're speaking
more informally as we drink!

505
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:57,264
Am I?

506
00:44:58,298 --> 00:44:59,867
I'm very sorry.

507
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,301
That's okay.

508
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:03,670
You're a lot older than me anyway.

509
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:12,579
I've been curious.

510
00:45:13,313 --> 00:45:18,151
How did you get such fine surgical skills
at a young age in North Korea?

511
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:22,956
My father was a doctor, too.

512
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,725
Is he still there?

513
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:26,860
He passed away.

514
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:29,329
I'm sorry to hear that.

515
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:32,499
What about your mom?

516
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,468
Let's stop talking
about depressing things.

517
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,070
I need to pee.

518
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:39,273
I'll be back.

519
00:45:57,124 --> 00:46:01,395
QUACK

520
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:07,410
Hey, what took you so long
to pick up?

521
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:09,203
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

522
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:11,772
I made curry for dinner,
and there's too much left over.

523
00:46:11,863 --> 00:46:13,106
Come and clean up for me.

524
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:19,346
Are you angry?

525
00:46:22,216 --> 00:46:26,753
I was a bit sad after you left like that.

526
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:31,558
And I have something to tell you.
So can you please come?

527
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:33,794
Dr Park is in the restroom.

528
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:37,965
Jae-joon!

529
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:43,270
I'm drinking with Dr Park.

530
00:46:44,025 --> 00:46:45,539
I see.

531
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:48,542
Why are you looking for Dr Park?

532
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:50,043
Well...

533
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:55,482
...Dr Han has made curry, no, food.
But we have a lot left over.

534
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,327
I'll ask him and call you back.

535
00:46:58,418 --> 00:46:59,953
Okay, sure.

536
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,596
What happened?

537
00:47:08,297 --> 00:47:11,231
Jae-joon picked up the phone.
It seems like they're together.

538
00:47:11,322 --> 00:47:12,966
But why are you so taken aback?

539
00:47:13,057 --> 00:47:14,535
What are you talking about?

540
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:18,739
Then, tell Dr Han to come over also.

541
00:47:21,145 --> 00:47:22,302
Should I?

542
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:40,761
What do you think of Dr Oh?

543
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:45,666
Dr Oh...

544
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,212
At first, I thought she was just
a violent quack.

545
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:51,371
But she does work hard.

546
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:57,544
And it's cute to see
how she is turning into a real doctor.

547
00:48:00,647 --> 00:48:04,117
Sometimes I get reminded of Jae-hee
when I look at her.

548
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:08,555
Does Jae-hee look like Dr Oh?

549
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:14,628
No, I just wish that Jae-hee
was more like the quack.

550
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,354
As a doctor.

551
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:20,501
What do you think of Dr Oh as a woman?

552
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:28,141
Do you perhaps think that I like
the quack or something?

553
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,010
The opposite could be true.

554
00:48:32,379 --> 00:48:35,749
Are you worried that the quack
might like me?

555
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:40,554
I'm speechless.

556
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:53,233
This guy was worried
that I might like you.

557
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:56,703
You shouldn't have picked up
someone else's phone!

558
00:48:56,794 --> 00:48:58,881
It kept ringing, so I thought
it was an emergency.

559
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:01,208
Did you perhaps say that you like me?

560
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:02,809
Stop talking nonsense.

561
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,659
Let's stop talking about it. Eat up.

562
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,564
Hey quack.
Frankly, we aren't a good match.

563
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,997
I'm sorry to say this
in front of your boyfriend,

564
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:18,167
but I hate people who are mean!

565
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:20,894
Then there's violence and arrogance...

566
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:22,205
Too much for me.

567
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:24,264
Hey, who says I like you?

568
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:29,770
I felt bad for you getting fired,
but I guess I shouldn't have.

569
00:49:29,861 --> 00:49:31,038
Calm down.

570
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:32,940
Do you think I can calm down?

571
00:49:33,031 --> 00:49:35,859
I was worried that he wasn't eating well,
but now he's crossing the line!

572
00:49:37,878 --> 00:49:39,413
You're crossing the line now.

573
00:49:40,948 --> 00:49:42,950
-You should stop.
-How am I crossing the line?

574
00:49:51,024 --> 00:49:52,059
I'll go.

575
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:05,272
You took it too far.

576
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,407
She'll be fine.

577
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:11,408
You guys were okay with each other
at the hospital.

578
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:13,447
How did you know that I like curry?

579
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:17,618
I'm curious, too.
How did she find out that you like curry?

580
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:20,821
The quack did?

581
00:50:23,957 --> 00:50:25,325
Don't worry about it. Just eat.

582
00:50:37,822 --> 00:50:38,705
Are you okay?

583
00:50:39,606 --> 00:50:42,576
How could he be so rude
when I'm trying to be nice to him?

584
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,638
-Do you like him?
-What?

585
00:50:45,729 --> 00:50:47,881
It's not the first time that Dr Park
behaves like that.

586
00:50:47,972 --> 00:50:49,525
You could have just laughed it out.

587
00:50:49,616 --> 00:50:52,686
So are you saying that I'm overreacting?

588
00:50:53,921 --> 00:50:55,022
Calm down first.

589
00:50:57,024 --> 00:50:59,092
I got it. Please leave me alone.

590
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:03,130
Sure. Come back down when you feel better.

591
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:11,939
What a jerk!

592
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,531
I guess our paths won't cross again
in the future.

593
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:39,633
I guess so.

594
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:49,343
They're my parents.

595
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:56,416
Are your parents in the States?

596
00:51:57,017 --> 00:51:58,218
I guess you can say that.

597
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:01,831
It must be hard not being able
to see them often.

598
00:52:01,922 --> 00:52:03,257
My situation isn't too bad.

599
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:06,527
Dr Park's father passed away
in North Korea.

600
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,933
Is your mother still there?

601
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:16,937
You're asking
a lot of weird questions today.

602
00:52:17,337 --> 00:52:18,205
Am I?

603
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,676
If you don't mind, may I ask
for your father's name?

604
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:25,288
I'd like to know more about him.

605
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:28,549
There are only a handful
of skilled cardiac surgeons in the world.

606
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,828
Your father was clearly skilled
to produce someone like you.

607
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,353
I might have heard of him.

608
00:52:37,925 --> 00:52:39,126
His name is Park Cheol.

609
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:41,395
Are you happy now?

610
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:45,553
Who?

611
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:51,481
Hey, are you here?

612
00:52:51,572 --> 00:52:54,308
Am I your cab driver?
Why are you calling me to pick you up?

613
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:56,643
I'm sorry. I'll be right outside.

614
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:26,440
Why is Park Hoon's mother here?

615
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:28,675
We're going to have her meet
with Park Hoon soon.

616
00:53:32,813 --> 00:53:33,886
Why?

617
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:36,817
That's what Prime Minister ordered.

618
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,296
Why is he so curious
about my family history?

619
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:50,664
Family history?

620
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:52,614
Who is?

621
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:56,036
Never mind. Just drive.

622
00:54:19,826 --> 00:54:20,894
HAN JAE-JOON

623
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,374
How was your dad's marriage ceremony?

624
00:54:25,465 --> 00:54:26,640
Catastrophic.

625
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:29,543
My stepmother
is two years younger than me.

626
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:32,165
I need to ask for a favor.

627
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:33,640
What is it?

628
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:36,961
It's about Professor Park Cheol.

629
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:39,646
Didn't you say he went missing?

630
00:54:39,737 --> 00:54:41,915
Please find out whether he went
to North Korea.

631
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:43,116
North Korea?

632
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:46,086
It'll be quite expensive.

633
00:54:47,473 --> 00:54:48,898
I'll pay for it.

634
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:49,823
Pay for it?

635
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,394
Okay. I'll call you after researching.

636
00:55:14,054 --> 00:55:16,526
Are you still waiting
for Professor Park Cheol?

637
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:18,361
Is he still not here?

638
00:55:18,452 --> 00:55:20,296
You should go home now.

639
00:55:20,387 --> 00:55:23,056
The trial has been cancelled
due to his absence.

640
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:40,174
Open the door, professor! Please!

641
00:55:40,265 --> 00:55:44,107
You said you'll testify that my father
died from malpractice!

642
00:55:45,979 --> 00:55:47,214
You heard him too, Mom!

643
00:55:47,305 --> 00:55:48,882
He said he'll testify!

644
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:50,450
Sung-hoon! I...

645
00:55:54,788 --> 00:55:58,072
Mom! Wake up! Mom!

646
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:00,036
Mom!

647
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:02,171
Please help! Mom!

648
00:56:02,262 --> 00:56:04,331
Wake up!

649
00:56:05,026 --> 00:56:06,066
Please help!

650
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,471
Mom!

651
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:58,318
