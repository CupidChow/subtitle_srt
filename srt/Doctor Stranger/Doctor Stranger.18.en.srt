1
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:27,831
Hey, Water Bottle...

2
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,132
I told Ah-young's fiance to not
cancel the ceremony.

3
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:38,287
Please let my Ah-young
to live as others do.

4
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,507
Hey, Water Bottle!

5
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,608
Get out of here!

6
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:46,280
Please help me do the right thing
for her as her older brother this once...

7
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,595
What's going on?

8
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,700
Scalpel.

9
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,069
What are you doing, Dr Park?

10
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,201
Geez.

11
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,816
What do you want?

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,975
What do you think I want?

13
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:26,351
I lost.

14
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:37,068
What is going on?

15
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,735
Mr Prime Minister?

16
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,937
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,939
I'm asking you what is going on.

18
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,743
Game is set, sir.

19
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:54,982
Father...

20
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,772
What did you just say?

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,207
I said I lost.

22
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,546
Please say it again.

23
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,183
I said I lost. So put that scalpel down.

24
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,407
EPISODE 18

25
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,691
Thank you.

26
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:05,853
OPERATING SURGEON PARK HOON

27
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,854
OPERATING SURGEON HAN JAE-JOON

28
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,556
You know what you've just done, right?

29
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,898
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,329
Do you even mean that?

31
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,799
You know what
I had to be through to get here?

32
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,800
And now you've...

33
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,238
I'm Moon Hyung-wook.

34
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,541
I won't be finished like this.

35
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,578
Weeds don't get killed even
when they're stomped on.

36
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,181
And I'm a weed!

37
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,390
It was very much like you.
You know that, right?

38
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,455
I'm sorry, Hoon.

39
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,493
This is the only way to let you go.

40
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,856
The decision was very much like you.

41
00:05:57,204 --> 00:05:58,125
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,560
Don't be sorry.

43
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,861
I knew it was going to end up
like this all along.

44
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,768
What you said about doing the surgery
with me...

45
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,070
It was all just hypocrisy.

46
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:18,545
Jae-hee...

47
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,380
What did you do to my father?

48
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,018
I heard you transplanted
my father's kidney to me.

49
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,621
And that's how my father passed away.

50
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,357
How did you find out?

51
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,960
I heard it from Prime Minister Jang.

52
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,828
Apparently Cha Jin-soo told him.

53
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:40,801
Tell me what you did to my father.

54
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,106
I... I really had no other choice.

55
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,467
Please save her.

56
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,004
I don't care if I live.

57
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:25,012
But she needs to meet someone at all cost.

58
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,535
Please.

59
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,790
Please save her life.

60
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,162
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,263
Sorry?

62
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,298
For what?

63
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,533
For having killed my father?

64
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,803
Or for having saved me?

65
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,772
I had no other choice.

66
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,307
You had no other choice?

67
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,610
Why shouldn't you just left me to die?

68
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,845
Jae-hee...

69
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,713
Then I could've died in happiness.

70
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,149
I could've died only
with my pure love for you.

71
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,518
You did it to save me?

72
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,386
Was that really love?

73
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,523
Killing my father to save me?

74
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,425
That's not love.

75
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:16,172
That's...just your greed to save
the women you love.

76
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,700
And because of that greed, my father died.

77
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,270
And you've been hiding it from me so far.

78
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,040
Your love is a lie.

79
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,512
You're having a guilty feeling
after killing my father.

80
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,648
You're just trying to pay me back
for your wrongdoing.

81
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,317
Please stop, Jae-hee...

82
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,418
Isn't it funny?

83
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,690
You still pretended
like you're a true doctor.

84
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,761
Doing the surgery together
after winning the competition?

85
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,963
Then why didn't you operate today?

86
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,599
You promised me that
you won't send me in there alone.

87
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,271
Everything was hypocrisy.

88
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,540
-Jae-hee...
-Don't call me that name.

89
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,909
And don't ever appear
in front of me again.

90
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,712
I'll never forgive you.

91
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:51,925
So Han Jae-joon will operate?

92
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,294
What do you want?

93
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,796
That's fine.

94
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,932
Let's set a date for next week.

95
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,884
I'll tell my Chief of Staff
to make the time for it.

96
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,105
Then how about the hospital?

97
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,908
The Prime Minister's surgery will
be done at Myung-woo Hospital.

98
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,786
What's wrong?

99
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,305
She doesn't want me to even say
her name anymore.

100
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,746
She doesn't want me to appear
in front of her again.

101
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,349
And she won't ever forgive me.

102
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,088
I really wanted to save her.

103
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,792
And I was going to tell her
when the time comes.

104
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:02,129
No,

105
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,434
I couldn't tell her what I did.

106
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,604
I wouldn't have told her

107
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,173
if she hadn't found it out herself.

108
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,977
I don't deserve this.

109
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,020
Dad told me to never forget that
I'm a doctor.

110
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,662
I was never...

111
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:43,170
Never a doctor from the beginning.

112
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,237
Oh, Dr Han!

113
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,574
What brings you here?

114
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,910
I'm here to congratulate you
on your victory.

115
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,348
I didn't know that
you were that shameless.

116
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:02,983
Long and thin.

117
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,785
That's my life motto.

118
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:08,388
If I were not like this,
I would not have survived here!

119
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,124
Cut me some slack.

120
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,429
THE CHAIRMAN

121
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,310
Come in.

122
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,911
I'm sorry for taking too long.

123
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,213
Yes, it did take too long.

124
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,015
Anyway, you did a great job.

125
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,485
Take a seat.

126
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,458
When's the board meeting?

127
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,959
In 30 minutes, sir.

128
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,495
Come with me to the meeting.

129
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,064
To the board meeting?

130
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,667
I promised you to appoint you
as an acting chairman in my place.

131
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,771
I always distinguish the good ones
from the bad ones.

132
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,840
Then how about Dr Moon?

133
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,242
I'm sending him to the branch hospital.

134
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,380
I'll bring up some cardiac surgeons
from there to fill positions here.

135
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,983
How about Dr Park?

136
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,188
I told Sang-jin to look for
any possible reason to revoke his license.

137
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,322
If there's none,

138
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,891
I'll press the association
to revoke his license!

139
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,695
Is there any reason why
you hate him so much?

140
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:22,803
Of course there is.

141
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:28,769
His father dared to challenge me once.

142
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,296
His name was Park Cheol.

143
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:36,677
He threatened to ruin Myung-woo
by testifying for a malpractice suit.

144
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,615
If I didn't remove him back then,

145
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,951
Myung-woo wouldn't exist today!

146
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:59,399
The profit has fallen by 10 percent
compared to the same period last year.

147
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,335
This is a temporary decreased

148
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,703
caused by a decrease
in incoming patients.

149
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,305
What's going on with the approval
of the Jeju branch hospital?

150
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,541
We're negotiating
with the local government.

151
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,243
It'll be decided soon.

152
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,812
My father didn't go to North Korea
for fame.

153
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,881
To stop a war, no...

154
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:17,985
He went because he was deceived
by Oh Joon-gyu and Jang Seok-joo.

155
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:24,718
Dr Han?

156
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,296
What are you doing, Dr Han?

157
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,355
I beg your pardon?

158
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:33,967
Stand up and say a word.

159
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,470
About what?

160
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,775
This guy's mind is somewhere else!

161
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:46,046
I guess it's hard for him to believe
that he just got chosen to be

162
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,248
the youngest acting chairman
in this hospital's history!

163
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:55,789
You just got unanimously elected
to be the acting chairman.

164
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,424
Stand up!

165
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,390
If you had focused on your studies
instead of getting distracted,

166
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,960
this whole back-and-forth wouldn't
have happened!

167
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:36,163
-I'm sorry.
-That's not enough!

168
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,068
Ah-young...

169
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,353
What?

170
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,001
I won't tell you that I'll do my best
from now on.

171
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,805
I won't tell you that I'll be
a good brother from now on either.

172
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,640
But instead,

173
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:49,743
I promise to do the surgeries

174
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,746
that you have to get in the future.

175
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,382
Really?

176
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,630
Yes.

177
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,176
Thank you, Chi-gyu.

178
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:29,917
But you must keep your promise, okay?

179
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,433
HAN JAE-JOON

180
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,168
How may I help you?

181
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,273
Four of these, please.

182
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:56,310
-Four sets of B, please.
-Okay.

183
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,745
I'm sorry, Chief.

184
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,784
-What do you mean?
-For ignoring your judgment.

185
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,319
I'm terribly sorry.

186
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:07,621
It's fine, so cheer up.

187
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,390
It'd have been a hard decision for me too
if I were in your shoes.

188
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,061
Go take a seat.

189
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:20,467
Here's your order.

190
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,136
Do you keep in touch with Dr Park?

191
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:24,671
Is he not answering his phone?

192
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:28,609
If you see him,
please tell him to call me.

193
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,653
RESIGNATION LETTER

194
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,490
There's a position open
in a public health center.

195
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,791
So I'd like to take that position.

196
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,260
Once Dr Moon moves to
the branch hospital,

197
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,028
you'll be promoted.

198
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:51,673
Then, I'll always be
a worthless scum here.

199
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,436
This envelope has my resignation letter
and something else.

200
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:00,941
A statement that describes what
you and the Chairman ordered me to do.

201
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,143
Is this a threat?

202
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:06,880
It's a recommendation.

203
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:12,019
I recommend you not to turn into
a monster in this hellhole.

204
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,356
I have no desire to live as a stranger
in this hospital forever.

205
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,641
RESIGNATION LETTER

206
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,717
OH SANG-JIN

207
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,790
This is Han Jae-joon speaking.

208
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:52,359
Would you please come over
to the Chairman's office?

209
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,667
I thought Mr Chairman was looking for me.

210
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,405
This is an important document,
so I need your help.

211
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,341
He wants me to bring it,

212
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,177
but I have to get dinner
with board members.

213
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,127
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR HOSPITAL ENDOWMENT

214
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,242
Dr Han,

215
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,147
you can give the envelope to Lawyer Kim.

216
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,082
I see.

217
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,431
Sit down.

218
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:12,573
Why is Sang-jin not coming yet?

219
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,375
He sent Dr Han to bring this to me.

220
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,149
How stupid of him to ask
someone else to deliver this!

221
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,623
Call Sang-jin to come home now.

222
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:30,714
Yes, sir.

223
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,978
Why are you guys not talking?

224
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:57,184
Are we not?

225
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,020
I'm concerned that
he might be worn out from today.

226
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:04,858
Do you know that he just got elected
to be the acting chairman?

227
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:06,122
Yes.

228
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,228
Yes? That's it?

229
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:11,465
Congratulations, Jae-joon.

230
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:13,463
Thank you.

231
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:17,504
We're going to throw a party to celebrate.

232
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:19,373
-A party?
-Yes.

233
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:21,942
To celebrate Dr Han's winning

234
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:24,778
the competition and his new job
as acting chairman.

235
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,648
And we need to move forward
with your relationship, too.

236
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,650
What relationship?

237
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,186
Do you even need to ask?
Marriage, of course!

238
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:36,156
That's fine, right?

239
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:39,893
-Yes, Mr Chairman.
-Jae-joon...

240
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,002
I'm sorry I'm late, father.

241
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,675
How could you let Dr Han
to bring this important document?

242
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:59,680
I thought it'd be okay
since he's now the acting chairman...

243
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,015
Still, this is no ordinary document!

244
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:04,117
I'm sorry, father.

245
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,186
But Dr Han wouldn't...

246
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:07,254
Be quiet.

247
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,765
Don't worry about the marriage too much.

248
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,701
I'll take care of it.

249
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:22,936
I'm sorry.

250
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:27,074
No, I'm sorry.

251
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:31,945
And about Dr Park,

252
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,617
I was mistaken about him.

253
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,385
How so?

254
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,491
Just...

255
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,291
I came to realize that
he's someone who deserves you.

256
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,499
Let's just say that's my opinion of him.

257
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,877
-Dr Oh, Hi.
-Hi.

258
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:05,479
Why has Chief called us?

259
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:08,682
He wants to talk about the team
in regard to Dr Keum's wedding.

260
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:09,816
Where is Chief?

261
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,485
He's with the board members.

262
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:14,488
Has he really become chairman?

263
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,656
Just an acting one.

264
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,691
But almost the same.

265
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,593
That's great.

266
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,162
He finally has conquered this castle.

267
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:24,731
-This castle?
-Yes.

268
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,099
He sometimes joked

269
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,770
about how the knight seduced
the princess to win the castle.

270
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,339
But the knight ended up

271
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,308
falling in love with the princess

272
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:35,776
so he was agonizing over it.

273
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,412
The knight won't be able to win
the castle like that, right?

274
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:42,182
Then this princess confessed her feelings
to another knight and got rejected.

275
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,818
He says it was so hard to see her cry
from her rejection.

276
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,254
No, it's not his story.

277
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,002
At first I also thought
it's his own story.

278
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:49,990
But it can't be.

279
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:51,592
You two have been always close,

280
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,963
and it's not like you confessed
your love to some other knight!

281
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:58,732
I'll also make it clear to you how I feel.
So listen carefully.

282
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:03,370
From now on, please forgive me
for everything I do.

283
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:07,174
Did Dr Han ever talk about

284
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,512
why the knight wants
to conquer the castle?

285
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,413
No, never.

286
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:36,630
Please leave a voicemail...

287
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:39,033
Dr Park!

288
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:48,115
What do you mean by the Chief
is planning something?

289
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:50,384
I thought you would have known it.

290
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:53,620
He wants to be the boss of your hospital

291
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:55,756
after successfully finishing
the prime minister's surgery.

292
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,425
But he told me something weird.

293
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,260
Like what?

294
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:04,398
He asked me to forgive him
for whatever he does.

295
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:05,766
For whatever he does?

296
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:09,436
Yes. I don't feel comfortable about it.

297
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,106
How he went to North Korea.

298
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:16,410
I have never told you that.

299
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:22,583
I have a friend named Lee Seong-hoon,
whom I met at Harvard.

300
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:29,507
Why?

301
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,126
He's not planning something scary, right?

302
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,230
Do you know a guy named
Lee Seong-hoon among his friends?

303
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,065
I don't know. Who is it?

304
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:41,401
He's the son of the plaintiff
in the malpractice suit 20 years ago.

305
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:44,438
The same lawsuit that sent me
and my father to North Korea.

306
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:47,774
Could it be that Jae-joon is...?

307
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:55,916
He can't be, right?

308
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:10,964
Keep watching me carefully, father.

309
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:16,203
My first revenge will begin tomorrow.

310
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:51,705
Where's the Water Bottle?

311
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,574
I don't know. Why should I know?

312
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,942
He was on your team.

313
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,976
Don't you know?

314
00:27:56,777 --> 00:28:01,615
There's no such thing
as an eternal friend or an eternal enemy.

315
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,685
Mr Chairman!

316
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:11,940
You're like a weed!

317
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:24,271
This party is to celebrate

318
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:28,775
Myung-woo Hospital being chosen
to perform the Prime Minister's surgery.

319
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:33,347
Now, Dr Han Jae-joon,
who will be the surgeon for the operation

320
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:36,617
will say a few words.

321
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:51,565
First of all, I'd like to thank
Chairman Oh for hosting this party.

322
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,569
And I'd like to thank all the doctors

323
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:59,406
who helped me to be chosen
for the Prime Minister's surgery.

324
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:05,045
I hope all of you will be able
to enjoy this party

325
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:06,713
as this is a nice break from the hospital.

326
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,705
Thank you.

327
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:18,708
Chairman Oh will make
an important announcement after your meal,

328
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,861
so please remain in your seats.

329
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,269
Good to see you, Chairman!

330
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,204
Hello!

331
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,439
How have you been?

332
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:34,174
You look great!

333
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:36,343
I'm happy to see you very healthy.

334
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,384
Thank you.

335
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,645
Jae-joon,

336
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,149
I have something to ask you.

337
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,202
Don't worry.

338
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,780
He won't be able to announce
our marriage today.

339
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,056
Not that...

340
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,377
Why did you want to see me?

341
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:13,347
I want to apologize.

342
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:19,059
I was mistaken about your father.

343
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:21,989
Is that why you told me to come here?

344
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:27,261
At least with you,
I wanted to remain as your friend.

345
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,398
And I also have a favor to ask you.

346
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:32,698
No thank you.

347
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,169
I'm not in a position to do you favors.

348
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:37,905
It's about Dr Oh.

349
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:43,410
Soo-hyun truly likes you.

350
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,913
Then did she like you not truly?

351
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:52,119
Stop talking all this nonsense,
and don't hurt the quack anymore.

352
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,721
Otherwise, you'll get hurt
many times more.

353
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:57,124
I just don't want you to do anything
that you'll regret.

354
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,259
If you're hiding something,
tell her before it's too late.

355
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,395
If you've done something wrong,

356
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:03,463
ask for her forgiveness
as soon as possible.

357
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:08,936
I can neither tell her
what I'm about to do,

358
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,814
nor ask for her forgiveness.

359
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:13,307
You shouldn't do it then.

360
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,741
It already has begun.

361
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,507
-What is it?
-Mr Oh Sang-jin?

362
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:49,308
That's me.

363
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,113
You're under arrest
for embezzlement and bribery.

364
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:59,419
-Father...
-Where are you guys from?

365
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:01,522
Who do you think you're dealing with?

366
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:03,188
We'll tell you more at the station.

367
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,157
Which station?

368
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,726
How can you just arrest people like this?

369
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,261
Can't you see this arrest warrant?

370
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,029
-What are you waiting for?
-Yes, sir.

371
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:13,467
Father!

372
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:29,550
Did you do this?

373
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:32,019
It's only the beginning.

374
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:38,725
What's going to happen from now
on will hurt Soo-hyun irrevocably.

375
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:40,527
I hoped it wouldn't be you though...

376
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:43,030
You're Lee Seong-hoon.

377
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,168
Is this something
along the line of revenge?

378
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:51,371
If I were Lee Seong-hoon,
wouldn't it only be natural?

379
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:55,642
I lost my father and mother.

380
00:32:57,744 --> 00:33:02,516
And I spent 20 years
with their story in my heart.

381
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:06,720
I waited for my chance to get my revenge.

382
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,156
And it finally came.

383
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,309
So I must do it.

384
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:14,094
He's the father of the woman you love.

385
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:16,096
She's the woman loved by Han Jae-joon.

386
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:18,699
Not Lee Seong-hoon.

387
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:20,601
You're wrong.

388
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:26,581
Both Han Jae-joon and Lee Seong-hoon
loved Oh Soo-hyun.

389
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:28,675
Am I wrong?

390
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:40,287
Oh, what happened?

391
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,823
Apparently someone tipped
the Prosecutor's office.

392
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:44,558
Someone tipped them? Who did?

393
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:47,327
I couldn't find out
because it's confidential...

394
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:50,764
But one of their investigators
is my friend.

395
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:52,132
So who did it?

396
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,401
The name is Lee Seong-hoon.

397
00:33:57,337 --> 00:34:00,474
Have you ever heard of such name?

398
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,011
-Lee Seong-hoon?
-Yes.

399
00:34:24,598 --> 00:34:25,899
Are you that person?

400
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:28,735
Lee Seong-hoon...

401
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:31,438
Are you that person?

402
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,875
-Is that important?
-Tell me!

403
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:38,178
Listen carefully.

404
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:40,747
It's not important who I am.

405
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:44,585
What's important is correcting
the wrongdoing of 20 years ago.

406
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,486
And this is it?

407
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,455
Calling cops to put your revenge?

408
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:49,723
Do you still have no idea?

409
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:52,793
Lee Seong-hoon only wants one thing.

410
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,332
A sincere apology.

411
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:23,690
Who is...Lee Seong-hoon?

412
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:36,870
His father died at my hospital
20 years ago.

413
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:41,575
We were very close to getting
our medical school certification.

414
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:47,247
And we didn't want that death
to turn into a lawsuit.

415
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,119
Yes, if I hadn't stopped
that lawsuit at all cost...

416
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,521
Myung-woo would've been destroyed.

417
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,495
I've met Lee Seong-hoon.

418
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:07,443
I don't want you and him
to become more miserable.

419
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:08,502
Where is he?

420
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:11,538
Father, you should apologize to him.

421
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,840
Apologize?

422
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:14,041
You've seen it.

423
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:16,743
You can be forgiven
with a sincere apology.

424
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,045
I didn't do anything wrong.

425
00:36:18,912 --> 00:36:22,616
No, I did my duty to protect
my Myung-woo!

426
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,552
At this rate, something
might happen to you!

427
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,661
Tell him to do whatever he wants!

428
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:30,691
I won't go down that easily.

429
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:32,069
Father...

430
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,002
Get out.

431
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,309
PARK HOON

432
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,280
MISSED CALL: 9

433
00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:03,982
JANG SEOK-JOO

434
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,605
I guess this is necessary to have
people believe that this is my surgery.

435
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:14,401
I heard that
Oh Sang-jin has been arrested.

436
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,738
Dr Han Jae-joon did it.

437
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,175
What's his true identity?

438
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,244
His name is Lee Seong-hoon.

439
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:25,946
He's the son of the guy

440
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:28,015
who died at Myung-woo
because of malpractice 20 years ago.

441
00:37:30,884 --> 00:37:32,719
I'll take care of that problem.

442
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:35,756
All you need to do is to
focus on the surgery.

443
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:41,328
And about Park Hoon and his mother...

444
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:46,834
I decided to send them to
a safe place as promised.

445
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:51,271
Where?

446
00:38:01,515 --> 00:38:02,616
Are you ill, sir?

447
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:05,886
I'm from the Prime Minister's Office.

448
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:11,525
These are plane tickets to Switzerland
for you and your mother.

449
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:13,193
Along with some money.

450
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:15,362
Switzerland?

451
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:19,700
The Prime Minister says
you're free to go wherever from there.

452
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,136
Shall we go?

453
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,006
I need to see Jae-hee.

454
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:27,007
You can't.

455
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,075
We have no time.

456
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:33,138
Tell the Prime Minister that I'm not
going anywhere until I see Jae-hee.

457
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:47,194
Why have you been avoiding me?

458
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:49,429
Leave with your mother.

459
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,832
I understand why you're being like this.
However...

460
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:54,101
No, you don't understand.

461
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:56,670
Your father asked me to save you.

462
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:58,872
He said you must live...

463
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:00,774
That's a cowardly excuse!

464
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,043
I can't be with you anymore.

465
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,878
So please leave.

466
00:39:05,078 --> 00:39:06,280
That'll be the best.

467
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,016
I'll come back to get you

468
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,751
after bringing my mom to a safe place.

469
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,286
No, don't come back.

470
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:15,022
We're done.
We'll never see each other again.

471
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:18,468
I promised your father that
I'll do everything to protect you.

472
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,137
If you're doing this out of
guilty feelings for killing my father.

473
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:22,696
You don't need to anymore.

474
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:26,133
No, that's not why I'm doing this.

475
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,535
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

476
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:39,079
Please forget about me and my father.

477
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:42,916
Please forget us and have a good life.

478
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,335
PARK HOON

479
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,741
PARK HOON'S RECORD

480
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,349
Call the Prime Minister to come.

481
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,030
Yes, sir.

482
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:18,452
What could this be?

483
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,487
Probably nothing serious.

484
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:23,323
The fact that he tells me to come for
petty things makes me even madder.

485
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:28,662
Also, be sure to take care of
Park Hoon without any noise. Okay?

486
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,270
Yes, sir.

487
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,691
What are you doing?

488
00:41:31,024 --> 00:41:32,726
I'm just following orders, sir.

489
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,442
The surgery will be next Monday.

490
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:51,011
It'll be Dr Han Jae-joon, right?

491
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:52,522
Yes.

492
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:56,617
But about that doctor named Park Hoon.

493
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:58,208
Yes?

494
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:01,522
It was stupid for him to give up
on the surgery.

495
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,424
It seemed like he is as skilled
as Dr Han.

496
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:09,563
I wonder why he gave up
on such a great opportunity.

497
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,766
I guess he was just being stupid,

498
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,302
as you said.

499
00:42:17,504 --> 00:42:18,739
Being stupid...

500
00:42:43,497 --> 00:42:44,523
Yes.

501
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,836
Yes? Okay.

502
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:05,652
It's not because he's stupid
but he only cared about patients.

503
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:09,323
But Dr Han won the competition.

504
00:43:09,656 --> 00:43:15,028
Shouldn't a doctor care more about
patients' life than competitions?

505
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,831
Do you think so?

506
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,801
If you were a patient,

507
00:43:21,134 --> 00:43:25,806
you'll choose a doctor
like Park Hoon also.

508
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:40,954
It's me, Dr Park.

509
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:43,557
You little brat!

510
00:43:44,277 --> 00:43:46,393
You were going to kill us
from the beginning!

511
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:49,997
But you're still alive, aren't you?

512
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:58,138
The President wants you to be his surgeon.

513
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:03,710
Do you think I'll do as you say?

514
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:05,145
You have no other choice.

515
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,347
Because we have your mother.

516
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:36,443
Park Hoon will operate?

517
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:38,011
What do you mean?

518
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:41,048
It's the President's order.

519
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:42,583
It's his heart after all.

520
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,218
We can't do anything about it.

521
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:50,224
Park Hoon is still a doctor at Myung-woo.

522
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:53,961
Myung-woo will still reap the benefits
from the surgery.

523
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:57,831
I'll take care of Park Hoon
once the surgery is over.

524
00:44:58,332 --> 00:44:59,867
So hang tight until then.

525
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:06,106
This surgery must happen.

526
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:08,141
You understand, right?

527
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:09,860
I understand.

528
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:15,048
I took care of the business
with the prosecutors.

529
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:17,084
Your son will be released soon too.

530
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:18,913
Thank you.

531
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:23,423
I'll give a call to Dr Han myself.

532
00:45:29,663 --> 00:45:31,398
The surgeon has been switched?

533
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:33,967
Yes, I'm sorry.

534
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,103
It doesn't matter.

535
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,907
The Chairman's son will be released soon.

536
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:48,315
I'm warning you that
I can block whatever you do.

537
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:53,020
I'll give you a chance to revenge
once the surgery is over.

538
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:57,157
Just be patient until then. Okay?

539
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,533
It'll all be over in a week.

540
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:03,657
Hi, you finally came.

541
00:47:04,057 --> 00:47:05,058
Where's my mom?

542
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:07,995
We're taking good care of her.

543
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:09,897
So rest assured.

544
00:47:11,798 --> 00:47:15,702
She'll be okay
if you finish the surgery well.

545
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,871
I don't trust you anymore.

546
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:19,654
Is that true?

547
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,910
Then, how about this?

548
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:29,750
If you tell anyone about this,

549
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,783
your mom will be dead.

550
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:39,676
How's that?

551
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:52,906
The President picked me to be his surgeon.

552
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:55,542
How about your mom?

553
00:47:56,977 --> 00:47:58,212
She'll be fine.

554
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:02,950
As long as I'm his surgeon,
they have to take care of her well.

555
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:07,554
What are we going to do?

556
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:13,994
As I told you before,
do your best when the surgery day comes.

557
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:16,230
I'll take care of the rest.

558
00:48:16,296 --> 00:48:18,532
You might not have the time
to meet the President alone.

559
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:21,168
Jang Seok-joo's men will be there.

560
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:25,973
Cha Jin-soo trained me well
to take care of those men.

561
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,407
Take care of them?

562
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:31,311
Did you think I'm trained only
in anesthesiology?

563
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:33,556
Why...

564
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:34,546
That's right,

565
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,950
if I had known that you killed my father,

566
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:40,420
I wouldn't have agreed to get
such scary training.

567
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,958
Because I wouldn't have wanted to see you.

568
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:54,134
So what'll happen
when everything ends like you planned?

569
00:48:54,902 --> 00:48:55,924
I don't know.

570
00:48:56,637 --> 00:48:57,905
But one thing that's sure

571
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:02,042
is that I won't be with you.

572
00:49:17,758 --> 00:49:19,593
I don't want to hear about Lee Seong-hoon.
Get out of here!

573
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,694
Just listen.

574
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:29,803
He was adopted by an American family
after that lawsuit.

575
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:30,804
Get out!

576
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:32,706
He's only here to revenge you!

577
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,175
Why are you meeting him anyway?

578
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:37,077
You saw how Sang-jin got arrested!

579
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:38,412
It's been resolved!

580
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:41,248
Make a sincere apology.

581
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:43,517
Then he'll forgive you.

582
00:49:43,684 --> 00:49:44,785
An apology?

583
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:47,554
What an arrogant man he is!

584
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:49,289
I didn't do anything wrong!

585
00:49:49,356 --> 00:49:50,657
Of course you did.

586
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:52,960
His father died,

587
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:55,462
and his mom also died
because of the lawsuit.

588
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:57,064
He became an orphan because of you!

589
00:49:57,531 --> 00:49:59,933
So you must ask for his forgiveness!

590
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,301
Be quiet!

591
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:06,440
Do you really have no idea
what you did wrong?

592
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:08,442
I said I've done nothing wrong!

593
00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:16,550
How dare he challenge me?

594
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,152
Tell him to do whatever he wants!

595
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:23,557
I'll be invincible no matter what he does!

596
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:34,499
Jae-joon,

597
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:39,940
I know you used me.

598
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:41,808
And tricked me.

599
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:44,811
I can forget about them.

600
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,247
So please stop here, Jae-joon.

601
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:49,850
I'm sorry, Soo-hyun.

602
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:54,254
I haven't told anything to father.

603
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:58,192
I'll do everything to convince father...
So please...

604
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:00,794
Don't bother.

605
00:51:59,753 --> 00:52:02,756
I have a task for you.

606
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,191
Is it about Lee Seong-hoon?

607
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:05,668
Yes.

608
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,528
I just saw him.

609
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:10,264
Is that so?

610
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,567
What does he want?

611
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:15,769
How much money does he want?

612
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:17,437
He doesn't want money.

613
00:52:19,173 --> 00:52:23,544
He was something even when he was young.

614
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:25,212
Never forget!

615
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:28,115
My father is Lee Do-sun
and I'm Lee Sung-hoon.

616
00:52:28,182 --> 00:52:29,283
Remember me!

617
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,920
Remember the person who'll revenge you!

618
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,425
I didn't expect him to stab me
in my back after 20 years.

619
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:41,228
He'll stop if you admit your wrongdoings

620
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:43,530
and make a sincere apology.

621
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,898
An apology?

622
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,433
Admitting my wrongdoings?

623
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,203
How dare he!

624
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:53,407
I have nothing to apologize for,
and nothing to admit!

625
00:52:55,209 --> 00:53:00,013
Stopping that malpractice suit was
one of my proudest achievements!

626
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,689
If that malpractice suit had continued,

627
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:12,593
Myung-woo would've been dissolved.

628
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:15,863
You never thought that
you did something wrong?

629
00:53:16,063 --> 00:53:17,164
Never!

630
00:53:18,232 --> 00:53:21,668
I have protected Myung-woo.

631
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:24,338
And no one shall touch it!

632
00:53:24,404 --> 00:53:26,907
This may be the last chance
Lee Seong-hoon gave you...

633
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,375
What chance?

634
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:32,579
The last chance to apologize
and ask for forgiveness.

635
00:53:33,747 --> 00:53:37,417
The victims of malpractice only
want a sincere apology.

636
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:39,953
-Even the last time...
-Tell him to stop the nonsense!

637
00:53:44,324 --> 00:53:48,529
What if Lee Seong-hoon does
something very dangerous?

638
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:51,698
Tell him to try me.

639
00:53:52,132 --> 00:53:53,834
No matter what he does,

640
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:59,306
he'll never bring me down.

641
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:02,434
Do you really think so?

642
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,645
Sang-jin's arrest?

643
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,547
I blocked it!

644
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:10,884
But what's about to happen
cannot be blocked.

645
00:54:11,852 --> 00:54:15,556
You won't be able to open
the new branch hospital in Jeju.

646
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:21,828
Lee Seong-hoon already notified
the banks of our weak financial standing.

647
00:54:22,196 --> 00:54:24,231
We won't be able to get a loan anymore.

648
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:27,568
And they'll start coming
after you to get their money back.

649
00:54:28,735 --> 00:54:29,812
What?

650
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:33,907
And Lee Seong-hoon already
contacted the press.

651
00:54:34,408 --> 00:54:40,414
You already know that he found out
about the embezzlement and bribery.

652
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:44,084
And the hospital will have to pay

653
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:47,554
the fine five times the amount of
excess fees it levied on its patients.

654
00:54:47,721 --> 00:54:49,323
It'll be a substantial amount.

655
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,259
Lee Seong-hoon...

656
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:55,596
This little brat!

657
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:04,204
How dare he challenge me!

658
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:24,324
Find a way to stop him!

659
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:28,028
It's not over yet.

660
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:33,166
He's going to expose
Myung-woo's political connection

661
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:35,536
that helped it to get
medical school certification 20 years ago.

662
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:37,815
What?

663
00:55:38,372 --> 00:55:42,109
Prime Minister Jang's name
will top the list.

664
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:47,781
Bring Lee Seong-hoon to me right now.

665
00:55:48,081 --> 00:55:49,550
Immediately!

666
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,485
What's going on?

667
00:55:54,955 --> 00:55:57,724
Jae-joon...

668
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,094
He wrote down your name on

669
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:03,664
a notebook every day
for the last 20 years.

670
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:09,937
As the number of the notebooks increased,
as his chance was getting closer.

671
00:56:11,805 --> 00:56:13,040
He was getting more scared.

672
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:18,745
What if you were repenting for your sins?

673
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:20,948
What if you were regretful?

674
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:23,617
What if you admit your wrongdoings
and make a sincere apology?

675
00:56:24,618 --> 00:56:25,719
He was agonizing over it.

676
00:56:29,423 --> 00:56:31,124
"What should I do then?"

677
00:56:31,992 --> 00:56:33,560
"Should I forgive him?"

678
00:56:37,197 --> 00:56:40,634
"What's the meaning of my life so far
if I do forgive him?"

679
00:56:42,135 --> 00:56:43,604
He was very concerned.

680
00:56:47,274 --> 00:56:48,675
But everything has worked out.

681
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:52,579
What are you talking about?

682
00:56:53,313 --> 00:56:58,018
I'm very happy that nothing has changed.

683
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:03,123
No, I must thank you.

684
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:08,061
Aren't you by any chance...

685
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:10,311
Yes.

686
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:13,567
I'm Lee Seong-hoon

687
00:57:15,502 --> 00:57:17,037
from 20 years ago.

688
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:27,281
Thank you for not making
my life meaningless,

689
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:30,417
Chairman Oh.

690
00:57:32,419 --> 00:57:36,657
You little brat!

691
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:06,687
-Get the extra key!
-Yes.

692
00:58:10,757 --> 00:58:11,925
Father!

693
00:58:12,626 --> 00:58:13,760
Are you okay?

694
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:15,929
Jae-joon!

695
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,778
Father, are you okay?

696
00:58:32,613 --> 00:58:33,643
Jae-joon!
