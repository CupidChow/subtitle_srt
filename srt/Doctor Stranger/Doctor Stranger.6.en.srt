1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,802
Dr Oh, what brings you here at this hour?

3
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,412
Jae-hee...

4
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,109
Then, kill me first.

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,643
Do you think I can't?

6
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,003
Only death awaits
those who didn't complete their missions.

7
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:13,349
I am not afraid of death
that's given by my own country.

8
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,711
I'm only afraid that we won't be able
to complete the mission.

9
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,002
Let me meet him.

10
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,805
What are you going to do
when you meet him?

11
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,140
I'm Han Seung-hee.

12
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,700
That's right, Han Seung-hee!

13
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,069
The Han Seung-hee that I created!

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,071
But Park Hoon will see me as Song Jae-hee.

15
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,718
I'll remain Han Seung-hee until the prime
minister's surgery team is chosen.

16
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,244
After that, I'll live as Song Jae-hee.

17
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:53,213
Wasn't that our original plan?

18
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,886
Shoot me anytime if you don't believe me.

19
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,190
The choice is up to you,
Comrade Cha Jin-soo.

20
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,140
No, sir...

21
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:08,862
Never...

22
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:15,711
Then, how was Park Hoon
able to escape so easily?

23
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,106
I don't know...

24
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,007
I didn't let him...

25
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:30,083
No! You can't! Please!

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,620
What did he bribe you with for his escape?

27
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:35,088
There's no such thing!

28
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,558
Tell me the truth!

29
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,073
Tell me the truth, you ass!

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:50,037
Long live
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

31
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,073
Long live...

32
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,309
Tell me the truth!

33
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:02,749
Long live
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

34
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:26,373
Long live
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

35
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:30,511
Park Hoon!

36
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,549
Jae-hee...

37
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,546
You cut your hair.

38
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,516
Dr Oh?

39
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:12,853
It looks good on you.

40
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,624
Don't you recognize me?

41
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,694
Who is he?

42
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:24,198
It's me, Hoon.

43
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,635
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

44
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,973
Who's Jae-hee?

45
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:37,544
Dr Han, do you know someone
named Song Jae-hee?

46
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,946
Song Jae-hee?

47
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,714
Who's that?

48
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:46,353
This...

49
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,070
Don't you recognize this?

50
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:56,163
That's right. I gave the same thing to you
when we first met.

51
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,664
Why do you have it?

52
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:04,213
-What do you mean?
-I made it for Dr Oh's mother.

53
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,139
Why do you have it now?

54
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:10,253
This is the same one that I made you!

55
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,513
This is one of the few things she left
for Dr Oh!

56
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:22,823
Seriously, who is this man?

57
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,768
He's the doctor who operated on my mother.

58
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,833
He's a doctor?

59
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,841
Why does he have something
that belonged to your late mother?

60
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:32,966
Is this true?

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,877
I made this for you.

62
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,370
Please stop talking nonsense!

63
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,910
Jae-hee, what's the matter?

64
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:46,747
I'm so sorry, doctor.

65
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:53,086
I'm afraid I must get back to work.

66
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,443
Please go ahead.

67
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,109
Jae-hee!

68
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,268
EPISODE 6

69
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,103
You should go ahead.

70
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,250
Jae-hee!

71
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,351
Just wait!

72
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,443
Wait for what?

73
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:17,827
She said she isn't Jae-hee!

74
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,447
I promise that she's Jae-hee!

75
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,319
Song Jae-hee!

76
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,289
You've made the right choice.

77
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,601
It's for the mission.

78
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:35,062
I hope you never forget that.

79
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,764
Don't be so arrogant.

80
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:43,270
Get out of my way!

81
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,105
Calm down!

82
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,341
What are you going to do then?

83
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:49,443
I'm asking her why she's acting
like she doesn't know me!

84
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,878
That's because she doesn't know you!

85
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:53,222
-How could she not know me?
-That's because she's not Jae-hee.

86
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,299
She's not?

87
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,550
You saw her, too.

88
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,220
Hoon...

89
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:02,990
I'm not sure anymore.

90
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,392
But she says she's not her!

91
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,228
Don't be ridiculous.
I promise that she's Jae-hee.

92
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,097
Dr Park!

93
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,142
Let go!

94
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,801
I really can't sleep.

95
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,480
And my thigh is numb.

96
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,139
I'll give you some painkillers for now...

97
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,819
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you acting like you don't know me?

98
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,777
Excuse me.

99
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,879
We're in a hospital.

100
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,651
If there is something you need to tell me,
please wait outside.

101
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,395
Are you mad
because I didn't come back for you?

102
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,529
Please get out.

103
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,655
I looked for you.

104
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,291
I did everything that I could to find you.

105
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,661
I have to take care of my patients.
Please leave.

106
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,966
Fine, okay.

107
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:48,578
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

108
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,404
I get it! Please let go of me.

109
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:52,039
Can't you see that my patient is waiting?

110
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,173
Is that important right now?

111
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,688
Didn't you say that you were a doctor?

112
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,782
To a doctor, what's more important
than patients?

113
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:08,755
Can you really call yourself a doctor
with such a mind-set?

114
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:10,290
Jae-hee!

115
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,559
Dr Oh, please take care of him.

116
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:39,915
Let's go for now.

117
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:44,157
I'll call her and ask when she's free.
Okay?

118
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,759
He won't believe that Song Jae-hee
is dead now.

119
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,787
It was quite a scene
to see him going crazy.

120
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,623
Otherwise, we won't be able
to control him as planned.

121
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,502
Isn't it tomorrow that we go
to Myung-woo Hospital?

122
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:20,994
Park Hoon will follow.

123
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:22,972
Because that's where
Song Jae-hee is going.

124
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,731
But he was kicked out from there.

125
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:29,603
Oh Joon-gyu isn't someone
who changes his mind easily.

126
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,840
That's why we need someone
to influence him.

127
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,784
GOVERNMENT COMPLEX SEJONG

128
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,895
I think we need permission
from the president on this one.

129
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,198
Why do we need his permission
for the prime minister's own committee?

130
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,201
But the president is greatly interested
in this committee!

131
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,561
So we need permission
for everything that he's interested in?

132
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,741
I'm seeing the president tomorrow morning.

133
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,834
I'll ask his opinion then.

134
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,046
Next topic, please.

135
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,973
I'm concerned for your health.

136
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,341
Let's call it a day.

137
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,142
I'm fine.

138
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,312
We must finish our work first.

139
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,615
Thank you for your hard work.

140
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,250
Get home safely.

141
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,488
Why don't we have dinner together?

142
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,357
It's quite late.

143
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,359
I also need to wake up early
to stop by somewhere

144
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,536
before seeing the president.

145
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,504
We need to come up with a plan!

146
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,207
Your primary race was so long ago,
the prosecutors are absurd!

147
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,509
They are trying to break us.

148
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,236
He became the president thanks to you!
How could he dare attack you?

149
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,405
-Someone might be listening.
-So what?

150
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,149
You're so reckless...

151
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,820
Fifty-two congressmen
are depending on you.

152
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,046
And they're getting ignored altogether!

153
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:47,314
Geez...

154
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,584
Is this because we had
a very long meeting?

155
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:52,920
Let's go.

156
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:07,434
This is a government building.

157
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,903
But we still have
a lot of security issues.

158
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,215
It's been a while.

159
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:16,210
I don't think this kind of meeting
was in our original plan.

160
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,550
I need a favor.

161
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,990
Is it about Park Hoon?

162
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:32,960
Please go meet with Oh Joon-gyu.

163
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:37,431
Well, I don't think that's a good idea.

164
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,434
It's too risky for me
to be involved directly.

165
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,413
If the press finds out that
I met with Oh Joon-gyu,

166
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:47,140
Myung-woo will get disqualified
from the surgery team selection.

167
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,978
Our plan is over if Park Hoon
doesn't return to Myung-woo Hospital.

168
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,092
It's all up to you now.

169
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,906
Prime Minister,
the car is waiting for you.

170
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:00,587
Let's go.

171
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,341
He's always there to watch me.

172
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:23,143
Do you think I can make time?

173
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,480
I'll try my best.

174
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,313
Yes, sir.

175
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,408
He just left.

176
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,101
Prime Minister Jang just left Sejong City.

177
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:50,847
What time is he coming tomorrow?

178
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,206
Eleven in the morning, sir.

179
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,884
Wasn't it 10:00?

180
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,411
He's having a meeting with displaced
persons from the Korean War.

181
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,089
He's making me wait
because of something like that?

182
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,491
Tell him to come at 10:00.

183
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:02,783
Yes, sir.

184
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,960
Do you still think Dr Han is Jae-hee?

185
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,509
Pour me some more.

186
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,043
I don't think she's Jae-hee.

187
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,603
How can a quack like you know that?

188
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,005
You said Jae-hee smiles a lot.

189
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,408
I don't think Dr Han is the smiley type.

190
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,345
What do you know about her?

191
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,804
I searched for Dr Han's pictures...

192
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,621
...and it doesn't seem like
she smiles a lot.

193
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,059
How do I work this?

194
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:48,095
Press here.

195
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,204
Do you know her parents?

196
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:01,074
She has a picture with her parents here.

197
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:13,287
Please save my daughter.

198
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:21,215
They're not her parents, are they?

199
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:30,179
I guess this is a very recent one.

200
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,181
I'm very envious of this picture.

201
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,374
Her father looks nice.

202
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,644
What about your father?

203
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,154
He passed away.

204
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,023
What about your mother?

205
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:54,295
I want to forget everything
related to you.

206
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:55,705
Including both you and Hoon...

207
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,831
-Honey...
-I'm so sick of everything!

208
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,245
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

209
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,071
-How come?
-I just don't know.

210
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:12,118
Just pour me more.

211
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,450
Excuse me?

212
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:37,971
Hey, just forget about her.

213
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,374
Forget what?

214
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:46,713
You can't hold on to someone
who's in heaven forever.

215
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,316
I'm going to hold on to her until I die.

216
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,085
Do you like her that much?

217
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:54,922
Of course.

218
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,225
Well, I'm envious.

219
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,261
-Of what?
-Jae-hee.

220
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:07,835
She has someone always caring about her.

221
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,538
No matter what you're doing,
no matter where you are...

222
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,575
...you're always caring about her.

223
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:17,611
I'm very envious.

224
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,347
You have someone like that too, quack.

225
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:25,085
That guy, Dr Han, with the big nose...

226
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,522
I'm not sure.

227
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,469
Do you think Jae-joon
is thinking of me like you do?

228
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,930
Well, knowing his personality,
I'd be surprised if he is.

229
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:39,733
Is that so?

230
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,404
Anyway, let's toast.

231
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:48,408
For Jae-hee, who's in heaven.

232
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,545
Why is Jae-hee in heaven?

233
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,456
Why?

234
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,048
Jae-hee is alive.

235
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,784
She's alive!

236
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,526
Hi, Jae-joon.

237
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,027
Where are you?

238
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:15,896
My mom's house.

239
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,431
All by yourself?

240
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:18,908
Yes.

241
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,567
It's quite noisy there.

242
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,836
Are you with someone?

243
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,874
It's just sounds from the TV.

244
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,081
Hello?

245
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:39,386
I can come to you
if you don't want to be alone.

246
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,764
I'm okay, Jae-joon.

247
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,157
Are you really okay?

248
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,192
Yes.

249
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,528
I need to think about something.

250
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:55,078
Okay, then, you can take
a day off tomorrow.

251
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,185
Sure. Thank you.

252
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:40,013
Jae-hee...

253
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,588
I guess this is why people drink.

254
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,594
To see the people who they miss.

255
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,000
The person who I miss the most...
Jae-hee...

256
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:16,914
Jae-hee is sitting in front of me.

257
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,269
Thanks for coming, Dr Han.

258
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:38,772
He seems very drunk.

259
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,065
I asked you to come here,
so he can apologize.

260
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:43,553
But he ended up getting too drunk.

261
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,978
I don't need an apology from him.

262
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:46,880
But...

263
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,677
...what should we do about him?

264
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,664
Jae-hee...

265
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,272
Jae-hee...

266
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:18,045
He's out of his mind!

267
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,260
FATHER

268
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,132
Yes, I'm at mom's house.

269
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:41,935
I'm going to stay here tonight.

270
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:43,504
Come home tonight.

271
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:45,105
I'm sorry.

272
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:47,608
I'll call you tomorrow.

273
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:49,877
Soo-hyun!

274
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,201
You can stay in your mom's room.

275
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:18,205
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

276
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,807
This is technically your house.

277
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:24,244
But it seems like you two are very close.

278
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,380
Excuse me?

279
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:27,957
Isn't it true?

280
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:32,052
You've come this far to get drunk together
and take care of each other.

281
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,454
That's not the case.

282
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:41,061
The woman who Dr Park loves... is dead.

283
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:45,699
Really?

284
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:53,207
But his lover does really look like you.

285
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,578
That's why he's behaving like that.

286
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,513
I hope this clears some things up.

287
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:04,818
Now I'm curious about her, too.

288
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,888
I'll make some coffee.
Could you tell me more about her?

289
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:09,223
Why not?

290
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,074
You don't have to speak so formally.

291
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:17,930
Would that be okay?

292
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:23,637
My brother is here.

293
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:27,016
But because I haven't seen him in years,

294
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:30,511
I don't even know if he's alive or not.

295
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:33,689
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.

296
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,152
I heard North Korea might offer
another round of displaced family reunion.

297
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:46,269
Yes, I'll urge the president
to make it happen this time.

298
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,404
Please do so, Prime Minister.

299
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:49,363
Of course.

300
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,274
Let's eat!

301
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:57,070
You must eat a lot and stay healthy
to meet your family members soon!

302
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,741
Let's eat!

303
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,519
Thank you for the breakfast!

304
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,137
I'll escort him out.

305
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:32,548
Okay.

306
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:42,783
It's been a while, Prime Minister.

307
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,481
It's been a while.

308
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:56,305
Hasn't it been 20 years
since the last time I saw you in private?

309
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:57,831
I have a favor to ask you.

310
00:24:57,922 --> 00:25:00,143
You could have just called.

311
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,836
There are a lot of eyes and ears on me.

312
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:09,209
I don't have much time, so I'll be brief.

313
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,211
What is it?

314
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,847
It's about Dr Park Hoon...

315
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:22,656
Would you please give him one more chance?

316
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:53,268
Jae-hee...

317
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,255
Jae-hee!

318
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:05,799
Jae-hee...

319
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:11,505
Jae-hee!

320
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:15,108
What the hell?

321
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,886
Get out!

322
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:17,978
Okay!

323
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:19,246
I'll close the door!

324
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:26,753
Hey.

325
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,092
Are you okay?

326
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:34,461
Are you okay?

327
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:41,802
You tell me!

328
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:45,305
Why did you come into the bathroom
when I was in there?

329
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:46,507
Bathroom?

330
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:50,677
Did you see everything?

331
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:52,079
-I saw nothing!
-He saw nothing!

332
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,814
Then why are you here together?

333
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,884
Why are you here then, Professor Moon?

334
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:02,298
I came here because the Chairman wants
to see him.

335
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:03,891
The Chairman? Why?

336
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:06,102
I guess he is going to give him
another chance.

337
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:08,128
I can't think of any other reason.

338
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:09,830
I don't care.

339
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:11,098
Why not?

340
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:13,242
Can you drop me off at that place
from yesterday?

341
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,268
Looking for Dr Han?

342
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:16,986
-I need to take a good look at her again.
-She won't be there.

343
00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:17,971
What?

344
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,582
She's been moved to the main branch today.

345
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:20,622
The main branch?

346
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:22,919
Then can you drop me off there?

347
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,837
I can take you there!

348
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:37,945
What are you going to do?

349
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:41,328
I'm going to stay here a bit longer.

350
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:43,363
Thanks, anyway.

351
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,078
Dr Han is probably in surgery
for the entire morning.

352
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:32,846
Mr Chairman...

353
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,984
I've decided to give
Dr Park another chance.

354
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,529
I thought I'd never be those parents
who can't ignore their children's wishes.

355
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:01,275
I did like her.

356
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,880
When she looked at me like that,
it made me very comfortable.

357
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,919
I don't know why Eun-hee liked me.

358
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,020
But...

359
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,789
...my feelings for her were genuine.

360
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:23,435
I thought, if there's fate,
this must be it.

361
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:27,868
Father.

362
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:35,642
It's been a while
since you called me that.

363
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:38,745
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:41,582
I was wrong.

365
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,519
And...

366
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:49,923
...thank you.

367
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:56,396
Thank you very much for loving my mom.

368
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,215
There's a lot of traffic.

369
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:42,543
I am afraid we'll be five minutes late.
Will it be okay?

370
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:51,094
Something like this can be decided by you.

371
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,896
Some of the congressmen
wanted to get your approval.

372
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:57,558
The committee is under your command.
There is no need for my approval.

373
00:30:58,634 --> 00:30:59,626
I apologize.

374
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,668
Don't be late next time.

375
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:15,142
I'm sorry, sir. It'll never happen again.

376
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:30,466
Five minutes!

377
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:34,504
Someone who gets irritated
by running five minutes late

378
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:36,763
is the president of this country.

379
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:42,769
That bastard is the president
of the Republic of Korea!

380
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,677
Was the name Han Seung-hee?

381
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:53,256
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:54,882
Let me see her skills.

383
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,387
This is hilarious! It's so funny!

384
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:04,625
I don't think my heart
can take it anymore!

385
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,299
There's someone who looks
just like your girlfriend?

386
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,934
She's not just a look-alike,
she's Jae-hee.

387
00:32:14,025 --> 00:32:16,603
But I heard she claims that she's not her.
What can you do?

388
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:18,423
I know she's Jae-hee.

389
00:32:18,514 --> 00:32:20,483
Do you think that kind of logic will work?

390
00:32:20,574 --> 00:32:23,886
Do you know why people who saw aliens
all saw it alone?

391
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:26,046
Because they made it up!

392
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:28,382
There's someone else who has seen her.

393
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,464
Of course I can recognize her.

394
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:38,325
But, Dr Park, you should forget
about her now.

395
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,739
Where are you?

396
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,466
I'm on my way. Stay with your mom.

397
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:47,501
Okay.

398
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,582
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

399
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:53,674
Why?

400
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,075
A dead person is dead.

401
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,079
You sound like you wish Dr Park's lover
was dead!

402
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,347
No way!

403
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:03,183
What did you say you wanted to eat?

404
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:04,251
Cold noodles.

405
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:07,421
The spicy one, okay?

406
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:34,314
Jang Seok-joo wants to see your skills.

407
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:36,617
He's rushing.

408
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:38,685
I just got here today.

409
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,522
There's a patient who's perfect for this.

410
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:44,635
-You're not saying that...
-Yes.

411
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:49,062
That old lady who said stupid things
to Park Hoon.

412
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,499
I'll arrange everything...

413
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:55,335
...so just focus
on showing off your skills.

414
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:08,724
-Chang-yi!
-Mom suddenly fainted!

415
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:09,907
What?

416
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:12,592
Out of way!

417
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:15,584
Get out of our way!

418
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:16,825
Right there! Make a turn.

419
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,168
Did you just say
that she lost consciousness?

420
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:31,379
She's a female patient, age 65.
It seems like acute myocardial infarction.

421
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,439
Where's Dr Eun?

422
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:34,908
I don't think I can leave this surgery.

423
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:37,077
Dr Eun, I need muscle relaxants.

424
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:38,640
Hurry up!

425
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:46,629
Dr Eun can't make it.

426
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,397
Then, who'll be our anesthesiologist?

427
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:50,282
Time is critical
for acute myocardial infarction.

428
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:52,759
Chief, they're ready to operate.

429
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,603
Everything is in order, Chief.

430
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:04,605
Who did the preparations?

431
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:07,941
My name is Han Seung-hee.

432
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:09,376
Han Seung-hee?

433
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:11,712
It's Dr Eun for you.

434
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:17,495
Who's Han Seung-hee?

435
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:18,752
Is Dr Han there?

436
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:21,374
Do you know her? I've never seen her here.

437
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:24,567
She's an anesthesiologist from a branch.
Apparently, she's good.

438
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:25,792
Why don't you give her a try?

439
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:27,694
I'm coming!

440
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:30,497
Chief, I'm busy now...

441
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:41,208
Etomidate, 10 milligrams...

442
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,311
Do we have dobutamine and dopamine?

443
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:45,679
Yes.

444
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:48,582
You may begin.

445
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,719
I look forward to working together.

446
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,488
Scalpel.

447
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:17,641
Doctor...

448
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,390
The surgery was successful.

449
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,025
She'll wake up soon.

450
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:24,227
What happened?

451
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:26,782
Her condition wasn't serious enough
to cause a myocardial infarction.

452
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:30,324
At her age, anything can happen.

453
00:36:31,758 --> 00:36:32,802
Am I wrong?

454
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:35,362
Her heart wasn't bad enough
to cause a myocardial infarction.

455
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:36,830
What are you doing, Hoon?

456
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:39,833
Thank you anyway, doctor.

457
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:44,238
Thank the anesthesiologist, not me.

458
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:48,008
If the surgery was successful,
it was thanks to her fast preparation.

459
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,289
You said your name was Dr Han, right?

460
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,815
Well done, Chief.

461
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:26,647
Mom, are you okay?

462
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:28,916
She can't talk yet.

463
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:33,020
Would you mind waiting outside
so she can rest?

464
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:49,803
We meet again.

465
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,708
I apologize for last night.

466
00:37:58,345 --> 00:37:59,246
Dr Han?

467
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,316
Nice to meet you, I'm Han Seung-hee.

468
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:03,993
I'm sorry for this surgery
on your first day.

469
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:07,120
I can take it from here.
You should go report to the HR department.

470
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:08,478
Okay.

471
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,735
You mean she's not Jae-hee?

472
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,438
Then... she's someone else?

473
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:26,607
I'm not sure.

474
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,409
I want to ask your mom when she wakes up.

475
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,518
Can we talk for a minute?

476
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,595
I am afraid we should call this bad karma.

477
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:51,932
-What are you talking about?
-The relationship between you and me.

478
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,303
I don't have time to waste,
please get to the point.

479
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,640
I heard you came to this hospital
for your girlfriend.

480
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:04,378
But rumor has it
that she has passed away.

481
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,577
Are you done? Then...

482
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:20,994
So if you're done with your business here,
stop loitering around this hospital.

483
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:26,633
Especially around Dr Oh.

484
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:28,194
Dr Oh?

485
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,071
You mean the quack?

486
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:33,240
Watch your mouth.

487
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:38,879
Dr Oh doesn't deserve
to be called a quack by you.

488
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:40,948
She is a quack in my opinion.

489
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:43,183
What do you think, quack?

490
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:55,515
I'm sorry.

491
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,598
I crossed the line.

492
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:58,932
What's going on?

493
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:02,703
It's nothing.

494
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,405
It seems like you two need to talk.

495
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:07,796
-Dr Park!
-Soo-hyun!

496
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:15,324
I lost my temper
because he called you a quack.

497
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,484
You got into a fight
over something petty like that?

498
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:19,019
That's not very much like you.

499
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,931
You're the most valuable member
on my team.

500
00:40:22,022 --> 00:40:24,725
I can't let anyone
disrespect you like that.

501
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:28,495
I appreciate it.

502
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,967
Do you think it'd be possible
for you two to get along?

503
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,246
Why?

504
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:41,617
Dr Park is going through a tough time.

505
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,043
And he's your colleague.

506
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:45,426
My colleague?

507
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:47,915
The Chairman changed his mind?

508
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:49,783
Yes.

509
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:54,087
So please be nice to him from now on.

510
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:55,622
Okay?

511
00:40:58,174 --> 00:40:59,059
Okay.

512
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:03,139
How about dinner with me tonight?

513
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,499
I'm sorry. I have to go somewhere tonight.

514
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:09,403
-I'll go make my rounds then.
-Soo-hyun...

515
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,016
You seem to be at ease these days.
That's good.

516
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:39,032
-Step aside.
-Let's go.

517
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,210
-Go where?
-To see the Chairman.

518
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:42,703
-Why?
-To beg his pardon!

519
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:45,873
Do you think I brought you here
for no reason?

520
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:47,640
Come.

521
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,878
Why are you hesitating?
You're here anyway.

522
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:54,348
-The Chairman is in, right?
-He's not here.

523
00:41:54,964 --> 00:41:55,899
He's not even here.

524
00:41:58,485 --> 00:41:59,422
Byeong-cheol!

525
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:13,534
Long time no see.

526
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:19,239
Hoon...

527
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,375
...you want to go to your father, right?

528
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:23,559
Yes, Dr Choi.

529
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:27,414
Then come with me.

530
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:37,391
Byeong-cheol, why does the Chairman
want to see Dr Park?

531
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:39,860
He has decided to forgive him.

532
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:41,161
Really?

533
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:43,339
So he can work here again?

534
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,075
I also asked him on your behalf.

535
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,434
Fortunately, he has allowed it.

536
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:49,603
I'm not interested in such a thing.

537
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,438
I heard you're a great surgeon.

538
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:55,242
But if you want to be like your father,
you need to learn more.

539
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,079
Are you entitled to say such a thing?

540
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,147
I believe I am.

541
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:03,750
Because this is my way of apologizing.

542
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,290
You're looking for a girl named Jae-hee.

543
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:22,866
Dr Park!

544
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:35,291
Why do you have that picture?

545
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:40,721
Dr Jan is a friend of your father's,
but he's also a friend of mine.

546
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:45,659
Dr Jan gave me that picture.

547
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:54,601
That picture made me realize
what I should do.

548
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:59,315
Making me a doctor at this hospital?

549
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:03,310
And after finding that girl...

550
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:07,347
Don't be ridiculous.

551
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:14,788
Are you sure that she is in North Korea?

552
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:18,267
-Jae-hee is here.
-What?

553
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:20,403
How can a North Korean girl be here?

554
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:21,428
I don't know.

555
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:22,963
This is so strange!

556
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:54,937
The surgery was successful.

557
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:58,031
That's not what we wanted to look at.

558
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:04,204
You'll see what you want
in the near future.

559
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:14,348
Why did your mom lose consciousness again?

560
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:15,449
I don't know, Hoon.

561
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:18,252
-What if my mom...?
-Stop talking like that.

562
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:21,522
What's happening?

563
00:45:21,613 --> 00:45:23,357
How can she be in critical condition now?

564
00:45:23,448 --> 00:45:26,226
I'm not sure what's happening.
She's going in and out of consciousness.

565
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,371
What happened, Dr Eun?

566
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:29,906
I don't know either.

567
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:32,875
Anesthesiologists use many
different kinds of anesthetics,

568
00:45:32,966 --> 00:45:36,270
but we don't exactly know how they work.

569
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:39,940
Anesthesiology is very enigmatic.

570
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,886
Is there something wrong with my mom?

571
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:45,245
She's okay now.

572
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:46,547
Don't worry too much.

573
00:45:47,736 --> 00:45:48,916
I'm counting on you, Dr Han.

574
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:04,298
Do you recognize me?

575
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:06,233
Yes.

576
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,306
You said you remember
Jae-hee's face, right?

577
00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:14,341
Yes.

578
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:19,580
Doctor...

579
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,663
Dr Choi...

580
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,099
You were just okay
when you crossed the Amnok River.

581
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,667
What is going on?

582
00:46:31,758 --> 00:46:35,495
He's the one who took me out
of the labor camp.

583
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:39,132
Dr Choi...

584
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,771
My dear Dr Choi...

585
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,676
Mom!

586
00:46:53,934 --> 00:46:55,682
-Mom!
-Don't worry.

587
00:46:56,283 --> 00:46:58,118
She'll regain consciousness soon.

588
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,817
She'll be okay once she rests.

589
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:15,302
Did you really bring my mom here?

590
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:16,895
Yes.

591
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,951
Mr Lim really was a swindler.

592
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:23,420
I'm the one who asked him.

593
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,888
Why?

594
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:28,892
I couldn't be directly involved until
we could locate Jae-hee's whereabouts.

595
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:35,131
I wanted to give you hope
by bringing Chang-yi's mom here.

596
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:36,742
What kind of hope?

597
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:38,635
The hope of reuniting with Jae-hee.

598
00:47:43,258 --> 00:47:44,240
Mom...

599
00:48:08,523 --> 00:48:10,934
She really looks like her.

600
00:48:12,936 --> 00:48:15,305
Everyone's been telling me that
since yesterday.

601
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:20,777
If there is anything you need,
just let me know.

602
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:33,692
Ma'am...

603
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:40,196
She's very similar,
but she's not Jae-hee.

604
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:49,205
I witnessed her death with my own eyes.

605
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:54,611
That's not true.

606
00:48:56,746 --> 00:48:58,014
She is alive.

607
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,066
Hoon...

608
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:31,248
PARK HOON, M.D. CARDIOLOGY

609
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:36,219
I've been told that she's alive
from a very reliable source.

610
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:40,090
I'm going back to North Korea
after taking care of some things here.

611
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:41,767
Let me come with you.

612
00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:44,861
It's okay for an old person like me,
but it'll be too dangerous for you.

613
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:48,896
Let's meet up again before I go.

614
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:50,300
I have something to give you.

615
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,354
It's me.

616
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:17,193
Why didn't you just
shut her mouth up forever?

617
00:50:17,894 --> 00:50:19,763
That's not what the Prime Minister wants.

618
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,222
How about Park Hoon?

619
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:28,805
He has come back to work at the hospital.
What about the Chairman?

620
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:30,740
Jang Seok-joo convinced him.

621
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:34,854
Everything is in order now.

622
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:37,122
Park Hoon is back at the hospital,

623
00:50:37,213 --> 00:50:39,082
and we've shown the Prime Minister
what he wants.

624
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:40,459
Yes.

625
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,953
Now we must move forward
to achieve our mission.

626
00:51:06,509 --> 00:51:10,146
That's the record of that lady going in
and out of the alert and the coma stage.

627
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:13,058
ALERT State of conciousness
COMA Loss of conciousness

628
00:51:13,149 --> 00:51:15,785
That should be enough
to prove her abilities.

629
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:32,802
Can I see you for a minute?

630
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:49,092
-Is she your girlfriend or not?
-I'm not sure.

631
00:51:49,321 --> 00:51:51,330
Answer me clearly.

632
00:51:51,421 --> 00:51:54,500
If she's your girlfriend,
that means she's a spy!

633
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:56,960
-Why would Jae-hee be a spy?
-Don't you think so?

634
00:51:57,294 --> 00:51:59,362
It's strange for a North Korean girl
to be here,

635
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,844
and it's strange that she's pretending
she doesn't know you.

636
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:03,667
That can't be true.

637
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:05,302
If it's true, we have a huge problem!

638
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:10,507
We're screwed if she turns out to be a spy
after we pick her to join our team!

639
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:15,888
Okay.
Let's assume that she's your girlfriend.

640
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:18,958
Is there any way to check her identity
other than just her face?

641
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:21,117
Like a scar on her body?

642
00:52:24,387 --> 00:52:26,423
Jae-hee got a kidney transplant
about two years ago.

643
00:52:27,057 --> 00:52:27,924
A kidney transplant?

644
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:31,461
Both kidneys were in abysmal condition,
so she got one transplanted.

645
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:33,500
Let's go.

646
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:36,433
I know how to check that.
Hurry up and come with me.

647
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,570
I said you can't!

648
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:41,947
Don't be so difficult.

649
00:52:42,038 --> 00:52:43,382
Can't you just do it for me?

650
00:52:43,473 --> 00:52:45,150
Of course, it's impossible.

651
00:52:45,241 --> 00:52:47,477
We only need to check Dr Han's kidneys.
Please.

652
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:50,422
That's right. All we need to know
is whether she has one or two kidneys.

653
00:52:50,513 --> 00:52:51,891
I can't do it, Hyung-wook.

654
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:53,316
How can you treat me like this?

655
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:55,794
Hyung-wook,
this is a personal medical record!

656
00:52:55,885 --> 00:52:58,722
You can go to jail for looking at this!

657
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:04,005
Jail time is a bad idea. We should go.

658
00:53:08,264 --> 00:53:10,133
Just for a moment. Really!

659
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:13,803
Hey! Stop!

660
00:53:16,873 --> 00:53:18,050
Hey, stop!

661
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:19,976
We'll be in a big trouble if you see it!

662
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:22,988
Hey, we can stop now.

663
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,857
We haven't seen it yet, so it's okay.

664
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:26,316
But once we see it, we're through!

665
00:53:26,407 --> 00:53:27,250
Step aside.

666
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:31,248
You're going to lose your license
and go to jail!

667
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:32,682
Get off!

668
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,825
I'm not seeing it! Never!

669
00:53:44,734 --> 00:53:45,667
How many?

670
00:53:54,644 --> 00:53:55,745
Two kidneys.

671
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,449
She's not a spy!

672
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:10,894
Hooray!

673
00:55:20,096 --> 00:55:21,164
This is destiny.

674
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:26,569
Apparently, everyone's heartbeat
is different.

675
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,681
Just like how there aren't two people
with the same face.

676
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:35,921
Listen to mine.

677
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:37,514
Mine is the same as yours,
don't you think?

678
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:52,805
I'm the new anesthesiologist.
My name is Han Seung-hee.

679
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:53,830
Nice to meet you all.

680
00:55:57,507 --> 00:56:00,370
We're very lucky to have
a talented anesthesiologist.

681
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:02,472
I look forward to working together.

682
00:56:05,675 --> 00:56:06,819
I hope we get along, Dr Han.

683
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,378
I'll try my best, Dr Oh.

684
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:10,847
You'll try your best with me too, right?
Whatever it is?

685
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:12,315
Nice to meet you.

686
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:14,084
Me too.

687
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,864
We all should go get dinner
when you're free.

688
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:20,090
Thank you, Chief.

689
00:56:20,482 --> 00:56:22,225
Awesome. I call the seat next to hers.

690
00:56:28,014 --> 00:56:30,309
-How is everything going so far?
-Good.

691
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,002
Let me know if there is any trouble.

692
00:56:33,103 --> 00:56:38,108
Dr Han Seung-hee,
can I talk to you for a minute?

693
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,109
-Why, Dr Park?
-It won't be long.

694
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:45,081
Are you apologizing for yesterday?

695
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:50,186
You don't need to apologize.

696
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:53,299
Dr Oh told me the story.

697
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,059
I can understand
what you're going through.

698
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,363
I hope you will end up
meeting with her soon.

699
00:57:01,564 --> 00:57:03,700
Everyone has a different heartbeat.

700
00:57:05,568 --> 00:57:07,612
The movement of a heart is unique...

701
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:10,941
...just like how there are
no two people with the same face.

702
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:16,613
What do you mean by that, Dr Park?

703
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,149
May I ask you for a favor?

704
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:22,470
It'll just be a minute.

705
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:16,482
DOCTOR STRANGER

706
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:17,416
What's wrong with this?

707
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:19,242
If her blood pressure drops,
the baby is at risk.

708
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,453
Her lung is damaged.
That may damage the baby's brain.

709
00:58:21,544 --> 00:58:23,417
That could give a baby a disability.

710
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:24,557
An anesthesiologist?

711
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:26,951
She handled the difficult anesthesia
of a pregnant woman with ease!

712
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:30,114
She would've been perfect to join
my team if she weren't a spy!

713
00:58:30,205 --> 00:58:31,096
A spy?

714
00:58:31,187 --> 00:58:34,867
Is there a way to find out
whether Dr Han has both kidneys?

715
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:36,936
We have mandatory CT screenings
for new hires.

716
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:38,170
But that's a personal record.

717
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:39,305
Blood pressure is dropping!

718
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:41,540
But it's difficult to get it up again
because she's pregnant!

719
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:43,900
Are you going to say that
after killing the patient?
