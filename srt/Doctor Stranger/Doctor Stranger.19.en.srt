1
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,548
Yes.

2
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,597
I'm Lee Seong-hoon

3
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,800
from 20 years ago.

4
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,277
Thank you for not making
my life pointless,

5
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,680
Chairman Oh.

6
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:51,218
You little brat!

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,229
-Get the extra key!
-Yes.

8
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:03,744
Father!

9
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:05,066
Are you okay?

10
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,167
Jae-joon!

11
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,221
Father!

12
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,076
Call the operating room. Hurry up!

13
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,161
Yes.

14
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,947
What the heck did you do?

15
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,686
Father.

16
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,110
Please move him quickly.

17
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,877
I'll never forgive you.

18
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,028
Never...

19
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,818
It's almost done. You can leave.

20
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,222
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

21
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:10,791
I'm distracted by your waiting there.

22
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,566
Okay.

23
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,639
EPISODE 19

24
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,229
How's the Chairman?

25
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,631
He'll be fine.

26
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,634
That's bad news for you, I guess.

27
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,805
Is this what you wanted from
the beginning?

28
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,909
Tell me!

29
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,378
Did you plan to kill my father
from the beginning?

30
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,813
I didn't know he'd collapse.

31
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,825
You're lying to me.

32
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,017
Then why did you lock the door?

33
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,285
I didn't want anyone to interrupt me.

34
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,373
From what?

35
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,188
From killing my father?

36
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,057
-Soo-hyun...
-Then what is it?

37
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:18,125
I told you already.

38
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,993
As long as I get his apology...

39
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,046
Don't be ridiculous.

40
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,263
Without me, my father would've been dead.

41
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,865
Murdered by you!

42
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,170
How could you do something
that cruel as doctor?

43
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,406
A man was dying in front of you!

44
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,544
You're not a doctor but a murderer.

45
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,057
Yes. I'm not a doctor.

46
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,061
I'm just a murderer
whose only goal is revenge.

47
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,601
However, can you understand me
at least a little?

48
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,236
You want me to understand you?

49
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:03,537
What you're feeling right now,

50
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,975
it is the same thing I felt 20 years ago
when I lost my parents.

51
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,843
Why I had to do it.

52
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,179
Why I had to be so cruel.

53
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,615
I want you to think about it.

54
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:18,452
You want me to understand you
after doing this to me?

55
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,655
I can't understand.

56
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:27,127
Get out of this hospital, immediately.

57
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,441
Okay.

58
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,290
Thank you.

59
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,994
I don't know who did it,

60
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,430
but he would have been in danger
without the emergency treatment.

61
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,107
Jae-joon,

62
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,883
that weird rumor
that's been going around...

63
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,019
it's not true, is it?

64
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,587
What rumor?

65
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,490
People say you revenged the chairman

66
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,126
because you're the son
of malpractice victims.

67
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,794
-How ridiculous!
-It's true.

68
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,267
I beg your pardon?

69
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,931
It's not a rumor, but it's true.

70
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,258
Jae-joon...

71
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,606
I'm leaving soon.

72
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,375
This place was never for me anyway.

73
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,248
Do your best to be a great doctor, Chi-gyu.

74
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,131
What are you doing here?

75
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,073
I've resigned.

76
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,076
Then hurry up and go.

77
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,347
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

78
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:44,318
No, don't ever come anywhere
near this hospital again.

79
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,745
He'll wake up soon.

80
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:13,914
Thank you.

81
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,284
Why did you do that?

82
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,255
Because I've been planning
to do it for 20 years.

83
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,825
So, do you feel better now?

84
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,628
My revenge has failed.

85
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,497
It didn't fail but you just gave up.

86
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:04,798
Because you love the quack.

87
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,000
-That's not true.
-Don't lie.

88
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,603
I know you performed CPR
to save the Chairman.

89
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,747
Tell the truth to the quack
and beg for her forgiveness.

90
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:22,416
Otherwise, she'll never know

91
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,484
what you did and resent you
for the rest of her life.

92
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,154
Maybe that's for the best.

93
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,524
Thus, she'll be able to forget me easily.

94
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,263
I'm just here to say goodbye
before I leave.

95
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,098
What do you mean?

96
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,869
I won't practice this doctor job anymore.

97
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,439
-Why?
-I don't deserve to be a doctor.

98
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,543
I became a doctor to take vengeance,

99
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:53,854
not to cure patients.

100
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,620
I thought you were a stranger
in the beginning.

101
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:06,193
But on second thought,
the real stranger was me.

102
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,230
I've come to realize it thanks to you.

103
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:13,000
Doctors who don't respect
the patient's life

104
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,235
are all strangers.

105
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:19,039
If that's what you think,
you should stay here.

106
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,474
Once you stay,

107
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,576
the quack will come
to understand you one day.

108
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,812
I can't forgive myself.

109
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,151
I'll never come back to this hospital.

110
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,188
But I have a favor to ask you.

111
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,743
What favor?

112
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:40,561
Soo-hyun truly likes you.

113
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,033
I'm sorry, but I've found Jae-hee.

114
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,469
I can't tell you the details,
but I've found her.

115
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:54,208
So I can't care about other women,
let alone like them.

116
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,943
I must decline your favor.

117
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,546
Then let me ask you this way.

118
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:05,018
Please take care of Soo-hyun as a friend.

119
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,223
As a friend...

120
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,392
I am begging you.

121
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,747
Father! Are you okay?

122
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,218
What is it? Are you looking for someone?

123
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,554
Dr Han...

124
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,225
Where is Jae-joon?

125
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:47,594
He's gone.

126
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:49,630
Bring him to me.

127
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:51,899
I have something to tell him.

128
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,800
Forget it!

129
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,104
Why are you looking for someone
who just stood there when you collapsed?

130
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,605
No,

131
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,776
Dr Han saved me.

132
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,670
It's for Soo-hyun.

133
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,210
Bring me Jae-joon.

134
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,012
That can't be true.

135
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,481
Hurry up.

136
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,151
He didn't say anything to me...

137
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,787
Jae-joon...

138
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,489
That's a lie.

139
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,060
Now!

140
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,631
Please leave a voicemail...

141
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,903
OH SOO-HYUN

142
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,758
HAN JAE-JOON, M.D.

143
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:08,902
Jae-joon!

144
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,146
I'm sorry.

145
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:22,549
I'm sorry.

146
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,423
So the Chairman is recovering in the ICU.

147
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:32,593
He got seriously trapped by Han Jae-joon.

148
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:35,295
They're going to elect another
acting chairman soon.

149
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,530
They must.

150
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,199
The VIP's surgery is around the corner.

151
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,169
They need a leader to handle it.

152
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,077
You couldn't find the corpse?

153
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,114
We must find the body struck by a bullet.

154
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:55,132
Yes, sir.

155
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,794
Cha Jin-soo might be alive.
So be extremely careful.

156
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,395
Yes, Mr Kim.

157
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,426
I feel burdened by the responsibilities

158
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,895
that are put on me
due to the Chairman's illness.

159
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:53,800
I promise to do my best to carry out
the duties of this position

160
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,802
until the Chairman returns.

161
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,820
Please find out how many doctors you need
and notify the branch hospital.

162
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,122
And also put out hiring notices.

163
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,890
Okay!

164
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:18,892
No.

165
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:22,029
I understood, Ms Acting Chairwoman.

166
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,599
You don't have to speak so formally to me.

167
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:29,503
So, I'm now the head of cardiology, right?

168
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,172
Yes.

169
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:37,744
I'm truly sorry about Dr Han.

170
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,981
-You may leave.
-Okay.

171
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,363
MOON HYUNG WOOK, M.D

172
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,633
I'm just returning to my initial position.

173
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,202
But why am I so overcome with joy?

174
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:05,939
Congratulations, Dr Moon. No, Chief Moon.

175
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,308
Let's do this quickly.

176
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,410
Just give me a second!

177
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:14,448
How can you ask me to do this quickly
in this joyful moment?

178
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,282
A round of applause!

179
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,287
Thank you!

180
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,969
Once the Prime Minister's surgery is over,

181
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,900
our department will reap huge benefits!

182
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,169
What are you doing?

183
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:37,771
Please keep going.

184
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,975
Therefore, my heart is heavy

185
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,745
with these immense responsibilities
as the Chief.

186
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,981
I need all of you to help me

187
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:52,152
make our cardiology department...

188
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,987
QUACK

189
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:56,190
the face of our hospital!

190
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,491
Where are you going?

191
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,360
What weird things did Jae-hee say?

192
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:04,064
Is it true that her kidney came
from her father?

193
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,601
If that's the case,

194
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,070
Jae-hee truly loves you.

195
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,841
If she doesn't, she wouldn't
have come here to find you.

196
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,442
What are you talking about?

197
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,110
She knew it before she met me?

198
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:20,247
She said because of that,
she wasn't sure about meeting you again.

199
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,751
And she said you like me...

200
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,520
I said I don't.

201
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:27,855
I already apologized for it too.

202
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,157
Thank you very much for your confirmation.

203
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:35,195
I just feel like Jae-hee is trying
to push you toward me.

204
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,307
Why did you lie to me?

205
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,547
What do you mean?

206
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,045
I heard that you knew that

207
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:54,214
I transplanted your father's kidney
into you for a long time.

208
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:57,560
Does it matter when I found out?

209
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,187
You said you just found out
and that's why you can't forgive me.

210
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,323
And you even told the quack
to take care of me.

211
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:05,826
You're doing this on purpose.

212
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,562
You're pretending to be angry
so I'll leave you.

213
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,732
Yes, I'm doing this to push you away.

214
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,601
-Why?
-I told you already.

215
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,304
I've realized that your love is hypocrisy.

216
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:19,239
Your feelings for me

217
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,741
are just your sense of guilt
and duty for killing my father.

218
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,609
You just called it love.

219
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:24,645
-Jae-hee...
-I told you to not say that name.

220
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:26,980
Do you know?

221
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,250
Do you know how it feels to live

222
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,287
with my father's death
attached to my body?

223
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:36,156
I can't forget even though I want to.

224
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:41,628
How can I forget
when it's always inside of my body?

225
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:45,165
Every day of my life is a pain.

226
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:51,471
And it hurts even more to think
that all of this is because of you.

227
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,008
You still have no idea?

228
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,245
I say this once for all.

229
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:03,217
I...I never really loved you.

230
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,323
Please leave if you got it.

231
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:18,665
Then what was this?

232
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,369
Every moment of this past month that
I got to spend with you

233
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:26,106
was unforgettable for me.

234
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,477
Especially that time

235
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,814
when you hugged me in the call room.

236
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:37,150
I was so happy.

237
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:40,888
Even if I deny it...

238
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,890
Even if I don't tell you...

239
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,027
I could feel that you recognized me.

240
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:49,592
Listen!

241
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:52,893
Hoon.

242
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:58,372
The reason why I'm doing this alone
is because of your mother.

243
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,278
If something happens to
you after you do the surgery,

244
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:06,914
no one will be able to take care of her.

245
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,685
Look me straight in the eyes and say it.

246
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:16,089
Do you mean it when you say
you never really loved me?

247
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:18,792
Yes.

248
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,462
Say it again.

249
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:24,765
Do you mean it?

250
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,707
Say it!

251
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:32,206
Do you mean it?

252
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:38,212
Yes, I like you!

253
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:39,413
I love you.

254
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:42,082
I've never hated you.

255
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,184
It was so hard to pretend
as if I hated you!

256
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:46,053
I thought about you every day.

257
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,287
Every day,

258
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:50,724
I only dreamed of living
happily ever after with you.

259
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:32,266
Then, why did you do it?

260
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:37,571
I thought I was blocking you
from becoming a doctor.

261
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:42,809
I thought the only way for you to be
more comfortable and safe

262
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:45,879
was that I let you go.

263
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:49,383
I'm sorry.

264
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:54,621
I never thought you'll be in danger
because of me.

265
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,325
Why is it because of you?

266
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:01,562
It's because I made a wrong choice.

267
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:03,530
A wrong choice?

268
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,435
I'm so regretful of making
that choice right now.

269
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:22,683
Don't you want to see Park Hoon?

270
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:44,371
I didn't think
my choice would put you in danger.

271
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:47,774
No, I didn't have a moment
to think about that.

272
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,844
Because I missed you so much.

273
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,015
I'm sorry, Hoon.

274
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,587
I never imagined that
you would be in danger.

275
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:05,092
I just wanted to have the chance

276
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:08,128
to see you again

277
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,931
even if it'd be just for once.

278
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:44,965
Jang Seok-joo tried to kill
you and your mom?

279
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,168
I didn't tell you because you might worry.

280
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:49,383
I'm sorry.

281
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:53,841
No, it was stupid of me to expect him
to let you go that easily.

282
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,643
I'm going to meet Mr Kim tomorrow.

283
00:27:57,277 --> 00:27:58,779
The secretary of Jang Seok-joo?

284
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:03,016
I think if I talk to him,
there might be a solution.

285
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:05,285
Do you think it'll be possible?

286
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:08,622
At least I must try it.
We must do something at least.

287
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,500
That's right.

288
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,233
You want me to betray the Prime Minister?

289
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,303
A man like Jang Seok-joo doesn't
deserve to be a leader of a country.

290
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,373
I'm sure you know it better
than anyone else.

291
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,045
I have a plan to stop him with your help.

292
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:34,915
I worked in intelligence,
but I'm still a soldier.

293
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,651
To soldiers, there's a valuable thing
that money can't buy.

294
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:39,920
Do you know what it is?

295
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,656
It's loyalty.

296
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:46,960
And that's the same for every member
of the Prime Minister's security team.

297
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:49,563
Do you think Jang Seok-joo
is really aware of it?

298
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,233
He wouldn't have let me stay with him
for 20 years if he isn't aware of it.

299
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,470
Loyalty, if it's so important,

300
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:58,539
then why did you save me
and take care of my mother?

301
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:00,807
Is that what he ordered you to do?

302
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,076
I thought it was some kind of debt.

303
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:12,019
To me, this conversation never happened.

304
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,054
Focus on preparing for the surgery

305
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,924
instead of getting distracted
by weird ideas.

306
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:32,139
Hello, this is Jang Seok-joo.

307
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:33,941
The VIP on the line for you,
Mr Prime Minister.

308
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:40,714
Yes, Mr President.

309
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:42,516
How are you doing?

310
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,185
It's not too bad.

311
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:48,188
I'm planning on visiting you tomorrow.

312
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:50,090
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

313
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:54,094
I can't just sit here and do nothing
while you're hospitalized.

314
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,863
I see.

315
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:06,773
It'll all be over soon.

316
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:08,242
EARLY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PREDICTIONS
Prime Minister Jang leading the polls

317
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,244
APPROVAL RATING
OF EACH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

318
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,677
If the election occurs right now,
you'll be able to get what you want.

319
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:45,212
The very nature of elections defies

320
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,617
the principle of the nature by which
the strongest one rules the world

321
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:51,919
by conquering the weak ones.

322
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,121
It's an outhouse

323
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:57,491
through which the stupid public excretes
its political desires.

324
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:02,062
Their support for me
isn't what I need to win.

325
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:05,132
What I need is a lot of toilet paper

326
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,835
called money to wipe
the butt of the public.

327
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:11,839
Or, I need a very interesting event

328
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:14,007
that will make them completely
forget about wiping their butt.

329
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:16,777
Something like
the North and South Summit?

330
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:18,812
Exact.

331
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:22,565
What brings you here?

332
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,519
I presume you aren't here to learn
about my political philosophy.

333
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,322
Please release Park Hoon's mother.

334
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:32,326
And why would I do that?

335
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:37,865
Otherwise, we can't operate on
the president as you wish.

336
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:40,334
Is that how it'll work out?

337
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:45,172
I believe you need a carrot
and a stick to make a horse run.

338
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,709
You can't move the person

339
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:51,778
who almost died because of your tricks
with threats alone.

340
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:56,149
Since the stick won't work,
give him the carrot?

341
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:57,918
Releasing the mother would be enough.

342
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:02,489
You can still have your men keep
an eye on them.

343
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,326
I feel like I have no other choice.

344
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,794
Just remember that

345
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:13,400
you have no other choice than Park Hoon.

346
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:27,414
The President is coming?

347
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,051
Yes, he'll be here tomorrow to visit
the Prime Minister.

348
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,322
He might want to meet the surgery team,

349
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:36,757
so you should be prepared too.

350
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:41,762
It'd be my family's great honor for me
to shake the hand of the President!

351
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:48,202
No, I must take a picture with him
as soon as I meet him!

352
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:51,004
HAN SEUNG-HEE

353
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:53,807
It's me.

354
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,209
Stop by my place.

355
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:56,577
What's up?

356
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,813
Your mother is here.

357
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:10,791
Mom.

358
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:43,023
It's a lot better than the last one, right?

359
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:25,666
Bon appetite.

360
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,543
This is Jae-hee. She's my girlfriend.

361
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:39,313
Girlfriend?

362
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,981
She's pretty, isn't she?

363
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,017
Yes, she is.

364
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:54,561
You're pretty too!

365
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,096
Of course! She's my mom!

366
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:05,599
See you later.

367
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:33,961
You're going to meet the President?

368
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:35,963
Isn't this a great chance?

369
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:39,132
Our safety will be guaranteed

370
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,001
once we tell the President
about Jang Seok-joo's conspiracy.

371
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,036
His men will be there.

372
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:45,339
And the President's security team
will also be there.

373
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,607
Can you still manage to meet him?

374
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:49,009
I'll take care of the people
who will be watching me.

375
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,144
I need you to convince the quack.

376
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:52,880
Convince Dr Oh?

377
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:56,850
I need her help to meet the President.

378
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:29,149
How are you doing?

379
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,986
I'm a bit bored to not be doing anything.

380
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:34,888
But what brings you here?

381
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:37,391
You could've called
if you had anything to say.

382
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,427
There's someone I want to meet.

383
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:41,728
Who would that be?

384
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:43,430
Dr Park Hoon.

385
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,158
-Dr Park?
-Yes.

386
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:48,936
He's the doctor who'll fix my heart.

387
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:51,538
I should at least meet him
in person before.

388
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:55,209
He's not yet aware that the surgery
is for you.

389
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,144
I'm worried that

390
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:59,413
all our work keeping
the secret would be for nothing

391
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:01,215
if the word gets out right now.

392
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:03,083
Is that so?

393
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:07,921
Then maybe I'll leave after taking
a tour of the hospital.

394
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:10,424
Of course, sir. I'll let them know.

395
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:17,898
Our men are watching Park Hoon
and Han Seung-hee, right?

396
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,420
Yes, sir.

397
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:25,706
No, we can't risk their babbling
to the President.

398
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,474
You should take care of it yourself.

399
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:28,957
Yes, sir.

400
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,474
What?

401
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:50,490
You've lost him?

402
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:52,359
I'm sorry, sir.

403
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,295
Where's the President?

404
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:04,271
Hoon has a reason why
he needs to meet the President.

405
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:07,107
Would it be even possible for him
to meet the President alone?

406
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:09,576
I am begging you. It's very important.

407
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:11,078
What is this about?

408
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:13,180
It's not something that would hurt
the hospital.

409
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:16,083
So please help him.

410
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,253
Is this the doctors' lounge?

411
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:21,822
Yes. Please take a look.

412
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:35,202
Stop him!

413
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,386
I'm Park Hoon, Mr President.

414
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:46,113
You're the surgeon
who will operate on the Prime Minister.

415
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,081
I have something to tell you.

416
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:49,781
To me?

417
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,732
It's totally private, Mr President.

418
00:41:05,899 --> 00:41:08,235
I'm afraid that's not possible.
What is it?

419
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,740
He's fine. You can speak.

420
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:16,655
Okay.

421
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:18,412
The prime minister's surgery.

422
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,481
You're here!

423
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,117
Prime Minister Jang!

424
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,620
It seems like you've already met him.

425
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,723
This is Dr Park Hoon
who will operate on me.

426
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:37,064
He's preparing for the surgery
even though his mother is ill.

427
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:38,498
I see.

428
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,604
Please take good care
of the Prime Minister.

429
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,417
What are you doing?

430
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:00,287
I'm sorry, sir.

431
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:26,079
You almost ruined
what we've worked for 10 years.

432
00:42:26,146 --> 00:42:27,614
-Are you aware?
-I'm sorry.

433
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:28,649
Your apology isn't enough!

434
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,286
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

435
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,821
You let him loose on purpose, didn't you?

436
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:36,256
-Mr Prime Minister...
-If not,

437
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:38,692
then how could you lose him?

438
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:44,164
Yes, I thought that
you've been oddly protective of him.

439
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,133
You saved him when I told you to kill him.

440
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,235
You took care of his mom
for more than 10 years

441
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:49,236
when I told you to kill her.

442
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:50,704
I didn't think it was necessary, sir.

443
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:51,805
Be quiet!

444
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:56,210
You also said many weird things

445
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:58,045
when the prosecutors were
investigating me.

446
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,280
I heard things from the prosecutors!

447
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:03,851
I've served you for more than 20 years,
Mr Prime Minister.

448
00:43:04,284 --> 00:43:06,620
-How could you doubt my loyalty?
-Loyalty?

449
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:11,925
Let's be honest. Honest!

450
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,061
The only reason why you're still with me

451
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:16,463
is to become the head of my security team
once I become president!

452
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:18,432
-Mr Prime Minister...
-Then stay with me!

453
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,169
Once we get there, I'll forgive you
no matter what you do.

454
00:43:22,236 --> 00:43:23,904
But until then,

455
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:27,608
I want you to focus and make no mistake!

456
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:51,064
Yes, Mr President.

457
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:53,767
I think we should get the surgery
at Min Kook Hospital.

458
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:58,071
The surgery is next week. I'm not sure...

459
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:02,109
Myung-woo's Chairman has collapsed,
and his son is in prison.

460
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:05,112
But everything has been arranged here.

461
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:08,749
I need more time to consider Myung-woo.

462
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:24,298
Do you think it was necessary to kill him?

463
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:27,134
It was a sacrifice for greater cause.

464
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:38,078
I want to make it clear that

465
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,515
this incident has nothing to do
with the Prime Minister.

466
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:42,916
You also said many weird things

467
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:44,785
when the prosecutors were
investigating me.

468
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,654
I heard things from the prosecutors!

469
00:45:02,636 --> 00:45:04,304
I am home.

470
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:29,730
Jang Seok-joo saw you?

471
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,902
Is there anything you told the President?

472
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,480
None.

473
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:39,006
Then how could you be so calm?

474
00:45:39,373 --> 00:45:42,176
He might get his surgery
at Min Kook Hospital.

475
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:45,546
That is not possible.

476
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:47,168
What?

477
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:50,584
The President won't get his surgery
anywhere else.

478
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,352
There's no one other than me
who can do the surgery.

479
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:54,821
What are you talking about?

480
00:45:54,888 --> 00:45:55,923
I'll tell you soon.

481
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:58,091
But I need your help on something.

482
00:45:58,985 --> 00:45:59,927
My help?

483
00:46:00,027 --> 00:46:01,019
What is it?

484
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:02,415
That is...

485
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:06,333
What did you tell him?

486
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,135
Did something happen?

487
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:09,091
What did you say that made

488
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:11,104
the President to not want to get
the surgery here?

489
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:13,607
The President can't go
to any other hospital.

490
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:17,678
His heart also only has a week.

491
00:46:19,746 --> 00:46:20,914
I'm sorry, sir.

492
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,669
I can't even guarantee more
than one week.

493
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:28,655
It might be dangerous,
but you should consider heart transplant.

494
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,325
If he wants to live,
he needs a heart transplant.

495
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:33,560
So there must be a reason why
he's being hesitant about it.

496
00:46:33,694 --> 00:46:34,995
He probably has a disease that

497
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:36,530
prevents the use
of immunosuppressive drugs.

498
00:46:36,597 --> 00:46:38,665
You told me that I'll die
if I take immunosuppressive drugs.

499
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,534
Is there any other way?

500
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:41,869
There's the Batista Procedure.

501
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:43,904
But its success rate is too low.

502
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:45,873
So I don't have any options?

503
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:47,574
We do have an option.

504
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:51,879
There's a procedure that's most ideal
for your heart shape

505
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:56,216
but it's an obsolete procedure.

506
00:46:56,307 --> 00:46:57,408
What would that be?

507
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:59,110
"The Saver Procedure."

508
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:03,156
I went through all the journals
published in the last decade,

509
00:47:03,247 --> 00:47:04,892
but I couldn't find
a single case of a clinical trial,

510
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:06,885
let alone a successful case.

511
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:09,830
There is one.

512
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:19,072
There's a surgeon who did the procedure.

513
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:21,842
He needs the Saver procedure
if he wants to live.

514
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:23,210
What if you're wrong?

515
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:24,978
He'll call.

516
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:26,704
Don't be so arrogant!

517
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:46,068
Yes, sir.

518
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:47,460
It's me, Prime Minister.

519
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:50,170
Yes, sir. What is it?

520
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:54,041
I think I should do it at Myung-woo.

521
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,099
Jae-hee.

522
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,291
How did it go?

523
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,227
The President will come here.

524
00:48:22,669 --> 00:48:24,238
We're almost there.

525
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:29,833
Everything will be okay.

526
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:48,395
I guess we should tell him now.

527
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:51,031
Yes, Mr President.

528
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:56,103
The surgery won't be
for the Prime Minister

529
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:57,938
but for me.

530
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:07,681
The surgery that you did recently.

531
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:09,016
The Saver procedure.

532
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,164
Yes, sir.

533
00:49:11,752 --> 00:49:15,722
Hopefully, the patient from that surgery
is doing well these days?

534
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,591
Of course, sir.

535
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:34,608
Do you think I can get
the Saver Procedure?

536
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,163
Your left heart chamber is
more stretched than normal.

537
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:57,764
This is called a ventricular aneurysm.

538
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:00,100
I've heard of all these from my doctors.

539
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:03,837
Please tell me the probability of success.

540
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:06,507
It's hard to guarantee that
it'll be 100 percent.

541
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,742
I hate it when doctors talk like that.

542
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:11,678
"We'll try our best.
We need to observe the progress."

543
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:14,248
They never give me a straight answer.

544
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:17,518
Only God can guarantee
100 percent success in surgeries.

545
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:21,922
No such thing as a presidential premium?

546
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:25,859
Once on the operating table,
you're just another patient to me.

547
00:50:27,594 --> 00:50:29,096
You're meant to be a doctor.

548
00:50:30,964 --> 00:50:35,669
Then let's hear
what you wanted to tell me before.

549
00:50:40,774 --> 00:50:43,544
He has four bodyguards with him
in this building.

550
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:46,146
There's another team waiting
outside of the building.

551
00:51:00,994 --> 00:51:01,995
How is he?

552
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:04,731
His heart is in worse condition
than I expected.

553
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:08,369
Let's move up the surgery to tomorrow.

554
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:10,838
Yes, Mr President.

555
00:51:11,972 --> 00:51:13,907
Please take good care of me.

556
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:17,811
Mr President!

557
00:51:17,878 --> 00:51:19,646
Help me. Just for a bit.

558
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:21,480
Go.

559
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:38,832
Dr Park.

560
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:46,607
I beg of you.

561
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:56,517
EMERGENCY

562
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:58,652
Let's move him.

563
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,097
Listen, all guards!

564
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:11,098
Mr Song.

565
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:16,270
You're aware of Article 71
of the Constitution, right?

566
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:27,581
From now on, until the President wakes up,

567
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:31,785
I'll be the acting president

568
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:36,156
per Article 71 of the Constitution.

569
00:52:37,691 --> 00:52:41,895
Call Chief of Staff to set up a meeting
with the cabinet right now.

570
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:43,430
How about the President's condition?

571
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,132
That should still be confidential.

572
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:47,167
Yes, sir.

573
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:05,986
What is this, Dr Park?

574
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:07,254
It's a surgery, Nurse Min.

575
00:53:07,321 --> 00:53:08,188
What's going on all of a sudden?

576
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:11,091
Be quiet and focus. Do you understand me?

577
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:12,092
Okay.

578
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:20,200
Hurry up and get prepared.

579
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:41,889
We're ready.

580
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,100
I'll start the Saver Procedure.

581
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,439
Scalpel.

582
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:06,513
What do you mean
by "The President has collapsed"?

583
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,416
He's getting an emergency surgery
right now.

584
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:10,784
Where is he?

585
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:12,419
He's at Myung-woo Hospital.

586
00:54:13,153 --> 00:54:16,657
What'll happen if something bad happens?

587
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:17,958
Something bad?

588
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,426
It's an obvious question.

589
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:22,296
What'll happen if something bad
happens during the surgery?

590
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,531
Are you hoping for something bad
to happen?

591
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:26,900
Calm down, please.

592
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,903
There's no question about it.

593
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:33,907
The Constitution is pretty clear
about what we should do.

594
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:36,944
If the President is unable
to discharge his duties,

595
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:39,279
the Prime Minister shall act for him.

596
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:52,559
NEW MESSAGE

597
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,412
The surgery went well as you hoped.

598
00:55:26,193 --> 00:55:29,162
He's under anesthesia
if this BIS number is between 40 and 60.

599
00:55:29,296 --> 00:55:31,665
He'll wake up when the BIS number
is higher than 80.

600
00:55:32,766 --> 00:55:34,468
If the current status continues,

601
00:55:34,568 --> 00:55:36,236
he'll be considered permanently incapable
of carrying out his duties.

602
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,641
But if the BIS figure goes over 80,
then comes back down,

603
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:42,743
he'll be considered
as if he's in a temporary accident.

604
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:09,770
Do you know who my favorite king is
among the kings during the Joseon Dynasty?

605
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,371
That'll be King Sejo.

606
00:56:11,872 --> 00:56:15,909
The seventh king of Joseon Dynasty.

607
00:56:15,976 --> 00:56:20,480
That one who became king
after killing his nephew.

608
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:23,684
That one was aware of something
very important.

609
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:25,419
What, you might ask?

610
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:28,288
The difference between
the strong and the weak.

611
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:32,492
Being strong isn't just
about being powerful.

612
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:36,296
Being strong means knowing how
to properly stamp on the weak!

613
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:40,434
Nephew?
Things like that shouldn't matter.

614
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:42,536
There should be no room for mercy.

615
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:45,672
The principle of life dictates the strong
to trample on the weak

616
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:48,542
at every moment possible.

617
00:56:57,117 --> 00:57:01,889
Because he didn't know that,
my dear president is lying here like this!

618
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:05,473
Listen!

619
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:07,995
You should've finished me
when you found out

620
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:11,131
about my illegal campaign fund
for the primary race.

621
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:13,600
Did you think that
I'll be dragged around by you,

622
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:15,068
doing everything you tell me to...

623
00:57:15,135 --> 00:57:19,439
If you put a stupid dog collar
on my neck like that?

624
00:57:21,074 --> 00:57:22,142
Nonsense, dude.

625
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:35,889
There'll be a presidential election soon.

626
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:38,759
Get some rest until then.

627
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:44,531
Once I hold the North and South Summit
and excite the ignorant electorate.

628
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:51,324
Then, I'll let you rest
in peace forever, okay?
