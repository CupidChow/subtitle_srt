1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,525
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,863
You know what?

3
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,699
Now I want to win this competition.

4
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:39,072
I won't let you go
into any operating room alone.

5
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,151
-The surgery has begun!
-Yes.

6
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,499
We'll perform the Saver procedure.

7
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,835
If we operate
without the family's consent,

8
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,294
there's no way out of this.

9
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,931
His blood pressure is dropping!

10
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,576
Let's begin.

11
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,901
Please get ready.

12
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:08,945
Dr Park...

13
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,771
The patient will die
even if we abort right now.

14
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,040
We need the family's consent!

15
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,378
No consent will be necessary
if the patient dies!

16
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,349
What are you doing?

17
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,729
Prepare for shock.

18
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,832
If you see any bleeding, let me know.

19
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:53,470
Let's start the Saver procedure.

20
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,662
Scalpel.

21
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,931
Are these the surgeons in competition?

22
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,935
Yes, sir.
They're competing at Myung-woo right now.

23
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,772
-And this is the final round?
-Yes, sir.

24
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,644
How is the winner decided?

25
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:26,000
Most importantly, the patient's heart...

26
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,250
...should start beating again
after the surgery.

27
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,253
Quite simple, I like it.

28
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,956
Bone saw.

29
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:47,734
EPISODE 15

30
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:55,342
-That's gross.
-That's right.

31
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:59,989
The path of a doctor
can be gross and scary.

32
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,524
That's why I'm always struggling!

33
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,516
Hey!

34
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,655
Hoon is operating on a patient.
Why don't you come and see?

35
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,357
-Really?
-Yes.

36
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,157
This is a very important surgery

37
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,634
that will decide who gets to operate
on the Prime Minister.

38
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,770
And Hoon is going to...

39
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,310
Which one is Hoon's?

40
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,146
This one.

41
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,783
Bovie.

42
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,623
Bone saw please.

43
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:57,371
Nurse Min?

44
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,413
Give it to me.

45
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,705
Dr Park, please check the saw
one more time.

46
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,790
We don't have time.

47
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,112
Hold on a minute!

48
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,620
Dr Park!

49
00:04:58,966 --> 00:04:59,942
What happened?

50
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,477
It looks like the blade popped out.

51
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:02,444
What?

52
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,204
That happens sometimes.

53
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,209
-Dr Park...
-Be quiet.

54
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,647
Please get me another pair of gloves.

55
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,487
Vitals?

56
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,857
-His blood pressure is unstable. But...
-Just focus on the vitals.

57
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,202
I need to stitch this up first.
Needle and thread please.

58
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,971
Come over here.

59
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,107
Get out of this room.

60
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,444
Get out immediately!

61
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,915
-Nurse Min!
-Don't you hear me?

62
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,526
What are you doing?

63
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,085
If you need to talk to him, do it later.

64
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,787
Get out of here, Jung-han!

65
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:37,998
You don't deserve to be here. Get out.

66
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,839
What's going on there?

67
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,075
Is something happening?

68
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,043
It looks like Dr Park is hurt.

69
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:51,754
He got cut by a bone saw blade.

70
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:52,913
How big of a cut?

71
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,147
About this long.

72
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:55,582
Then how is he going to operate?

73
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,017
He's in deep trouble.

74
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,088
Why is Dr Yang leaving?

75
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:25,879
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,348
-He could cause more trouble...
-Later.

77
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,350
Please call another doctor.

78
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,786
All the other staff members
are in surgery.

79
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,057
Dr Yang shouldn't be here.

80
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,859
Call the room next door.

81
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,030
O.R. number 2.

82
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:49,803
What do you want?

83
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,506
Let me borrow a doctor.

84
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,854
Why don't you call Dr Yang back?

85
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,314
There's a reason I can't.
So please let me borrow just one.

86
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,951
I'll send Kim Chi-gyu.

87
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,103
Bovie.

88
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,806
Jae-joon...

89
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,008
Focus.

90
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:30,345
Chi-gyu isn't experienced enough
to be his first assistant!

91
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:32,913
-Where's the donor's heart?
-It'll arrive here soon.

92
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,720
Hello?

93
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:41,955
Yes.

94
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,625
I see.

95
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,695
Step aside please!

96
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,375
Get ready.

97
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,315
I'll go to the next room.

98
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,118
-Chi-gyu is on his way.
-Jae-joon...

99
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,162
-What's wrong with you?
-You don't know why?

100
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,298
I'm volunteering
because Chi-gyu can't do it.

101
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,025
Is that really the only reason
you're volunteering?

102
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:21,995
Don't go.

103
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,864
It's just your curiosity.

104
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,999
It's a temporary attraction
to something new!

105
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,344
Do you really think so?

106
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,284
Did you call me?

107
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,629
-Go to the next room.
-Okay.

108
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,989
No. Stay here.

109
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,132
What?

110
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:51,825
Dr Oh!

111
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,054
-Did it really have to be you, quack?
-Be quiet.

112
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,748
Look at you!
You got injured like an idiot.

113
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,538
That's my spot.

114
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:38,906
You want me to operate?

115
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,716
Is your injury that bad?

116
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,943
Stop talking nonsense and come over here.

117
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,252
What is this?

118
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,652
You're going to operate
with your left hand?

119
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:07,201
What's going on?

120
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,436
Is the Water Bottle going
to operate with his left hand?

121
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:10,938
Be quiet and watch.

122
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,244
Let's start.

123
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,885
Scalpel.

124
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,422
What is he trying to do now?

125
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,461
Can he do it with his left hand like that?

126
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:35,487
He's doing it!

127
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,798
It's not easy though.

128
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,169
Is this something that can be done
only with the left hand?

129
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,578
It's very much like him, Dr Han!

130
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,348
Needle holder.

131
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,200
Cut.

132
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,337
Aorta cross clamping, off.

133
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,120
ACC off (Aorta cross clamping off)

134
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,318
Pads.

135
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:02,592
Charge 50 Joules.

136
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:03,593
Charged.

137
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:04,901
Shot!

138
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,288
Cut.

139
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:49,229
Aorta cross clamping, off.

140
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,917
Charge 50 Joules.

141
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,018
Charged.

142
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,219
Shot!

143
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,617
Charge 70 Joules.

144
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,053
Shot!

145
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,296
With 70 Joules once more.

146
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,023
Shot!

147
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,898
Seventy Joules again. Shot.

148
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,485
That's it.

149
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,577
How did it go?

150
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:45,512
I think he made it.

151
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:46,914
Really?

152
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,887
That's great.

153
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,554
Yes!

154
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,562
It's successful, Dr Park.

155
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,165
Great work, Dr Park.

156
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,834
Good work, Nurse Min!

157
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,337
-Great work!
-What are you doing?

158
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:45,648
I'm sorry.

159
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,023
-Thank you.
-Great work!

160
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,543
Thank you.

161
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,185
Hey, quack!

162
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,933
What's wrong? You did well. Good job.

163
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,136
I'm going to see the family.

164
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,159
The surgery was successful.

165
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,474
His condition before the surgery

166
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,210
was so bad that it might take longer
in recovery treatment.

167
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,412
The recovery treatment?

168
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,581
He'll be in an induced coma

169
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,508
until his heart function
returns to normal.

170
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,178
Then when will he wake up?

171
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,415
Three days of treatment
will be better for him.

172
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:04,852
It's not because the surgery
went wrong, right?

173
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,553
We did our best. So please rest assure.

174
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,592
Thank you.

175
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:19,900
Dr Park.

176
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:24,547
Can you go check on the patient in ICU?

177
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,840
-I have something to talk to you about.
-Later.

178
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,585
-Have you seen Dr Yang or Nurse Min?
-Dr Park...

179
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,211
You did a great job today.

180
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,124
Wow. I'm exhausted! Where is Nurse Min?

181
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:44,903
Do you actually know
how hard it was for me?

182
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,471
What did you do?

183
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,609
Jung-han!

184
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,115
That patient almost died
because he didn't have the money.

185
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,725
But we still did the surgery.

186
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,752
Yes. That's because of Park Hoon.

187
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,730
But there's only one Park Hoon
in this world.

188
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,400
There's no Park Hoon who will help us
every time we're in need.

189
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,536
We need money and power
if we need to protect ourselves!

190
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,763
Is that why you did that
in the operating room?

191
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,834
Yes. For my family.

192
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,511
Wasn't it because of money?

193
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,346
-What's the difference?
-Are they the same then?

194
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:31,905
I can't leave my family up to luck.

195
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,941
What our family needs isn't money.

196
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,443
It needs a proud dad and husband!

197
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,346
Don't you realize?

198
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:43,092
How much longer do
we have to live like this?

199
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,918
Me as an unpaid fellow!

200
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,458
Apologize.

201
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:53,694
I'm sorry, Soo-ji.

202
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:57,197
Not to me but to Dr Park.

203
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,677
I don't like him.

204
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:02,836
Why?

205
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,539
Answer me. Why?

206
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,975
I just don't like him. He's too good.

207
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:13,213
Dr Yang!

208
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,059
What are you doing here?

209
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,485
Did you hear everything?

210
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,355
How can I not hear it
if you talk that loudly?

211
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:27,870
I'm sorry.

212
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,029
Don't worry.

213
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,331
I have a bad memory,
so I forgot everything already.

214
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:33,743
Thank you.

215
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:37,504
But don't eavesdrop
on other people's conversations anymore.

216
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:38,805
Understand?

217
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,758
His blood pressure is dropping.

218
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,384
Inject more norepinephrine.

219
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:52,391
Norepinephrine

220
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:58,634
But, doctor, is this patient
going to get better?

221
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,762
All these things frequently occur after
a big surgery, so don't make a fuss.

222
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:04,565
The patient's family is watching.

223
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:13,231
We finished a difficult
surgery successfully.

224
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:16,044
You don't need to create
more headaches after a big surgery.

225
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,518
Yes, I understand.

226
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:30,399
They still have to go through
the recovery treatment,

227
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,859
but the patient himself is stable.

228
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:36,072
What should we do?

229
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:37,431
We need to find a way.

230
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:56,383
May I talk to you?

231
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:58,519
Sure.

232
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,833
No one performs
that surgery method anymore?

233
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:08,061
So the surgeon had you sign
for the VAD procedure, right?

234
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:12,408
Yes. He said it's very expensive,
but he'll do it for free...

235
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,811
But he didn't do that.
Instead, he did something weird.

236
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,670
That's why your husband
is still in a coma.

237
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:21,717
But the doctor said the surgery
was successful.

238
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,620
Have you ever met a doctor
who says the surgery went bad?

239
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,514
To be frank with you,
he even killed a patient during surgery.

240
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:32,186
He was going to show off his skills,
but the patient died!

241
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:38,492
Didn't he graduate
from Myung-woo University?

242
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:42,138
I heard all graduates from there are good.

243
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:44,565
Don't be ridiculous.

244
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,434
That guy is from North Korea.

245
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:48,802
North Korea?

246
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:50,871
Yes, he graduated
from Pyeongyang Medical School.

247
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:57,911
I wasn't going to say this,
but he did a weird procedure this time

248
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,380
to make up for killing a patient before.

249
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,224
Both surgeries were successful,
Mr Chairman.

250
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:18,432
Honestly, the Saver procedure
is a lot harder than a heart transplant.

251
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:23,278
There's a reason
why no one does it anymore.

252
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:28,141
I agree that he managed
a difficult surgery well.

253
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,513
But that doesn't mean
that the competition is over.

254
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:35,983
-I beg your pardon?
-Both patients are recovering right now.

255
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:39,486
We can decide who won
after they both wake up.

256
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,696
The patient will wake up
without a problem, right?

257
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,331
Of course.

258
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:54,735
So go get his signature on an agreement.

259
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:56,336
What agreement?

260
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,907
My surgery was a lot harder and better.

261
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,075
So get some kind of document

262
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,612
that guarantees our win
if the patient wakes up.

263
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,726
I must meet Dr Park!

264
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:15,088
-You can't go in!
-I must meet him!

265
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:20,928
I heard that other doctors
don't perform the Saver procedure.

266
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,597
But we had choice for your husband's case.

267
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:25,566
And the surgery was successful...

268
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:26,900
Don't lie!

269
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:28,435
Then why is he still in a coma?

270
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,737
Because he's recovering
as I told you earlier...

271
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,105
Don't lie to me.

272
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:33,473
Lie to you?

273
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:37,044
I heard that you even killed
a patient during a surgery.

274
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:42,983
And you aren't even from Myung-woo
but from North Korea!

275
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:47,888
The fact is that a man like you

276
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:50,123
performed an obscure procedure
without my consent!

277
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,760
I apologize for not getting your consent
before the surgery.

278
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:55,529
-But...
-I don't want to hear it!

279
00:24:56,897 --> 00:25:01,335
If the surgery was really successful,
wake him up right now.

280
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:03,279
I can't do that.

281
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,205
Because the surgery went wrong!

282
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:09,776
Are you going to tell me the truth
when I press charges for murder?

283
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,549
Fluctuation in blood pressure

284
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,818
and dysrhythmia occur frequently
after a heart surgery.

285
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:24,700
No matter how many times I tried
to explain it to her, she didn't listen.

286
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,426
I guess we'll keep explaining
until she listens.

287
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:29,572
Should we just wake him up briefly?

288
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,932
So the family can calm down?

289
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:33,407
You want to do something damaging

290
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,514
to the patient just because
the family yelled at you?

291
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,972
It'll all be over once he wakes up.

292
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:40,983
We can't do anything
that'll damage the patient.

293
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:43,177
All we need to do is just wait it out.

294
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:46,622
If we don't show the family
that he's okay,

295
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:50,226
the fact that you did the surgery without
their consent might become a big problem.

296
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:51,494
A big problem?

297
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,487
This could go
to the disciplinary committee.

298
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:59,493
It doesn't matter.
The patient will wake up.

299
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,138
That also means that we'll win
the competition.

300
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,797
So don't worry too much.

301
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:05,632
Okay.

302
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,701
But please stay with him.

303
00:26:08,202 --> 00:26:10,237
Even if someone tells you
to wake him up,

304
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:11,538
don't do it unless I approve.

305
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,337
You have nothing to say to me?

306
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:50,911
I'm sorry for leaving
your operating room.

307
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:53,180
Not that.

308
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:56,950
Park Hoon...

309
00:26:58,218 --> 00:26:59,353
...isn't the right man for you.

310
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:02,265
Why?

311
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:03,323
Do you really not know?

312
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,659
He already has someone else.

313
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,804
Yes. Jae-hee.

314
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:09,439
You'll just get hurt.

315
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,231
He may never find her again.

316
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:13,876
She may not be in front of his eyes,
but she'll always be in his heart.

317
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,302
It's not about if he'll find her or not!

318
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:16,879
-I know!
-Soo-hyun...

319
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,305
I know that...

320
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:20,707
But I'm still like this.

321
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:25,888
Even though I know that Dr Park
is in love with Jae-hee...

322
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,648
But I still like him. What can I do?

323
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:30,326
I did think it was just a simple curiosity
in the beginning.

324
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,762
I did think that I'd get sick
of him eventually.

325
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:34,988
So I tried to forget him.
But it's not working out!

326
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,701
Every time I try to forget him,
I think about him.

327
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,295
And I can't stop crying.

328
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:47,401
I'm sorry.

329
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:52,806
I don't want to hurt you anymore.

330
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:55,342
I really mean it.

331
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,084
Don't go.

332
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,187
Please let me go.

333
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:12,359
You'll be able to forget me soon.

334
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:15,862
Please.

335
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:42,623
Stop.

336
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:45,659
Do you know what this is?

337
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:51,064
I don't know. So can you please get lost?

338
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:54,043
Don't be like that. This is called a BIS.

339
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:57,914
The Water Bottle did the competition
with Jae-joon yesterday, right?

340
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,841
This is the machine that'll decide
the winner of the competition!

341
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:03,186
How?

342
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:07,814
This will be used to check
if the patient regains consciousness.

343
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,418
If the number here increases,
that means the patient is waking up.

344
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:15,189
But the real function of this machine
is something else.

345
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,892
If you put it on your forehead
like this...

346
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:27,334
...you can check if you're meant
to be together!

347
00:29:29,675 --> 00:29:31,738
Then you must know
what I'm thinking right now, too!

348
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:50,757
Dr Han,
isn't it too early to wake the patient up?

349
00:29:51,692 --> 00:29:53,393
I'm waking her up because it's time.

350
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:10,853
-Mom!
-Honey!

351
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,579
Dad, Mom is opening her eyes.

352
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:18,051
Thank you so much, doctor! Thank you!

353
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:19,620
Honey...

354
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:25,792
Please blink if you can hear me, ma'am.

355
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,435
Why isn't our guy waking up?

356
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,576
Today and tomorrow will be crucial.
So pay close attention.

357
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,622
Shall we go outside?

358
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:48,315
I'll explain everything in detail.

359
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:51,118
That's right. Tell me.

360
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:54,821
That woman woke up,
but why is my husband still in a coma?

361
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,193
Your husband was in bad shape
before the surgery,

362
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:00,837
so it'll take longer to recover.

363
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:02,763
Then when will he wake up?

364
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,398
Give me an exact answer.

365
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,776
If we wake him up prematurely,
complications could occur.

366
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,377
That's why we're very careful with him.

367
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:11,538
We're doing our best,
so please give us a couple more days.

368
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,040
So how many days?

369
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,587
Are you trying to get rid

370
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:20,480
of the evidence of your malpractice
before I find out?

371
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,282
There's no such thing, ma'am.

372
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:24,594
-If you wait a bit longer...
-I don't want to hear it!

373
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,120
Wake him up immediately!

374
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:34,995
Male patient, age 45.

375
00:31:35,086 --> 00:31:38,138
We performed additional tests after
detecting myocardial infarction symptoms.

376
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:41,978
We found irregularities
on his mitral valve and left atrium...

377
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,747
So we were going to install
a VAD on his heart,

378
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:46,215
but the patient
suffered from coagulopathy.

379
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:49,209
So the procedure was changed
to Saver at the surgeon's discretion.

380
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:54,257
Why did you perform a procedure
that's obscure?

381
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:55,749
That's a stupid question.

382
00:31:57,017 --> 00:32:00,220
The procedure may be difficult,
but it's still performed by surgeons.

383
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:01,755
It was indeed difficult

384
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:04,725
for this patient as 40 percent
of his atrium had to be removed,

385
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:06,059
but the surgery was successful.

386
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:09,162
How can you be so sure?

387
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,731
Because I've done it many times.

388
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,700
Where?

389
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,438
In North Korea?

390
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,244
Yes.

391
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:27,581
Did all of your patients survive?

392
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:31,385
Did all of them survive?

393
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,387
No.

394
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:36,422
So there's a chance that the patient
might die this time.

395
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,227
You performed a dangerous surgery
on your own.

396
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:41,728
Am I correct?

397
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:44,998
Did all of your patients survive surgery?

398
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,402
Did all of them survive?

399
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:57,429
I've been told
that a cardiac surgeon's skills

400
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,689
are measured by how many patients die
during surgery.

401
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,958
Don't we all strive to do our very best

402
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:05,018
to ensure that those deaths
were not in vain?

403
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:07,487
Because we can't kill the next one.

404
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:09,756
Because we must save them this time.

405
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:14,428
That's the only way we can be forgiven
by the patients that we've killed.

406
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,364
The surgery was successful.

407
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:21,134
The patients that I've killed,
so far, will forgive me.

408
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:25,314
And they would not have forgiven me
if I didn't perform the procedure

409
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:27,174
because I was afraid
that the patient might die.

410
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,677
What a touching speech!

411
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:35,516
But isn't it too early for you
to be forgiven?

412
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:38,719
The patient must wake up first
for you to be forgiven.

413
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:42,122
I'm letting him sleep,
so he can recover better.

414
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,700
Are you sure you let him sleep?
Or is it because you can't wake him up?

415
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:45,759
What do you mean?

416
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,230
Are you not waking the patient up

417
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:49,483
so you can hide the fact
that your surgery failed?

418
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,375
I said that isn't so.

419
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,969
I'm suspicious of your especially
long recovery treatment.

420
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:58,138
I'll wake him up in two days.

421
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:00,140
-What if he doesn't wake up?
-That won't happen.

422
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:03,243
-He'll wake up.
-He must.

423
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,223
If he doesn't, losing the competition
wouldn't be your only problem.

424
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:09,234
An even bigger problem will be
that you'll be a murderer.

425
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:17,591
You performed the surgery
without the family's consent, correct?

426
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:20,269
Performing a surgery without
the family's consent was clearly my fault.

427
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,796
I'll accept any disciplinary action
that arises from it.

428
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:24,452
Disciplinary action isn't the problem.

429
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:28,502
The patient's wife wants to press charges
for murder. What will you do?

430
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:31,271
That won't be a problem
once the patient wakes up...

431
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,174
Did you tell her that you performed
the Saver procedure?

432
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:36,176
I couldn't.

433
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:38,645
Did you not notify the family on purpose?

434
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:43,717
-That's not the case.
-Then why didn't you notify the family?

435
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:46,229
I thought it was an emergency situation.

436
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,988
What kind of emergency?

437
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:52,125
Are you perhaps referring to coagulopathy?

438
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:53,360
That's correct.

439
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:58,632
Dr Yang, when did Dr Park find out
about the patient's coagulopathy?

440
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,795
I told him before he made the incision.

441
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,548
So, technically, you found out
before the surgery started.

442
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:08,518
Even though you had enough time
to notify the family,

443
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,644
you just went ahead on your own.

444
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:12,312
Correct?

445
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:15,148
Considering the patient's condition,
I thought it'd be better to move quickly.

446
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,161
Shouldn't you have stopped
because the patient was in bad shape?

447
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:20,120
If the patient could endure the surgery...

448
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:22,565
Stop making excuses.

449
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:24,992
The patient was in no shape
to endure the surgery.

450
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,628
I had to save the patient.

451
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:33,400
You're saying that again.
"I had to save the patient."

452
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:39,165
You should stop pretending as if you're
the only doctor who cares about patients.

453
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:40,174
Dr Han...

454
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,010
Do you think others get familial consent
because they don't think that way?

455
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,313
The consents are designed
to protect the patient.

456
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:48,024
And you ignored it on purpose.

457
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:51,985
How can you say that you care
about patients after that?

458
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:55,189
-I'll apologize to the family...
-An apology?

459
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:59,126
You didn't tell them what kind
of procedure you were doing.

460
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:01,184
The patient is still in coma.

461
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:03,062
What kind of family
will accept your apology?

462
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:04,765
The patient will wake up.

463
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:05,999
Wake him up now.

464
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:10,370
You must prove to the family
that the patient is okay.

465
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:29,830
-So he did the surgery without consent?
-Guess that's what they do in North Korea.

466
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:32,092
-Has he lost his mind?
-Is surgery a joke to him?

467
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:35,295
Did you see it?

468
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:37,807
Did you see that he did that on purpose?

469
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:39,375
If not, just shut up!

470
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:41,502
Don't gossip about something
you don't know!

471
00:36:56,016 --> 00:36:57,460
He'll wake up.

472
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,585
He must.

473
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:01,397
If he doesn't, losing the competition
wouldn't be your only problem.

474
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:02,832
An even bigger problem will be
that you'll be a murderer.

475
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:04,925
The wife wants to press charges
for murder.

476
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,193
What will you do?

477
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,561
Wake him up immediately.

478
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:11,532
You must prove to the family
that the patient is okay.

479
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:28,649
The patient cannot be disturbed!

480
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:31,527
Please give me just two days.

481
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:33,296
This isn't up to me.

482
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:34,755
Time doesn't matter.

483
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:37,266
The only condition of the competition
was whether the surgery was successful!

484
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:40,794
It may be the case that you failed
and are trying to deceive us.

485
00:37:41,795 --> 00:37:42,930
You know that's not the case.

486
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:44,231
I'm not sure.

487
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:50,771
I actually thought we could be friends.

488
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:53,273
We may be competing against each other...

489
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:56,743
...and I thought we'll be friends
once the competition is over.

490
00:37:58,212 --> 00:37:59,413
But I was mistaken.

491
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:04,318
That'll never happen. I assure you.

492
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,157
Code blue. Code blue.
Cardiology ICU, code blue.

493
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:16,330
What happened?

494
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,066
Once more! Shot!

495
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:22,503
Once more! Shot!

496
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:40,320
He had cardiac arrest
when we tried to wake him up.

497
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:43,323
What's wrong with my husband?

498
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:46,660
Are you sure you didn't do anything wrong?

499
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:49,138
This is a common occurrence
after a heart surgery.

500
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:50,364
You have nothing to worry.

501
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:51,874
How can I not worry?

502
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:54,811
You said you'll wake him up,
but his heart stopped!

503
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:58,205
Atrial fibrillation can occur
after a major heart surgery.

504
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,483
And we are prepared for it, too.

505
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:01,708
Be quiet!

506
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:03,877
What?

507
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:06,122
Did I say something wrong?

508
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,048
Please keep an eye on the patient.

509
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:19,235
How can you call yourself a doctor?

510
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:20,994
-What did I do?
-You almost killed the patient!

511
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:23,039
-It's because I trusted you.
-Then you should've waited.

512
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,455
The surgery was successful.
I saw it with my own eyes!

513
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:28,335
-So?
-I thought it'd be okay to wake him up.

514
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:31,514
Why? Why on your own?

515
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:33,340
Because you could get kicked out
if I don't!

516
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,843
What does it have to do with you?
Who are you to care?

517
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:39,880
I...

518
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:45,853
I love you.

519
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:50,457
Because I love you.

520
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,928
I tried to help you
from getting kicked out.

521
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,095
Are you happy now?

522
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,368
Don't tell me to not love you.

523
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:05,065
If it was something I could control, it
wouldn't have come to this to begin with.

524
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,249
Is it because of Jae-hee?

525
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:23,257
Your father sent my father to North Korea.

526
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:28,042
He conspired with Jang Seok-joo
and sent my father to North Korea.

527
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:29,705
What are you talking about?

528
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:33,075
Because my father wanted to testify
against Myung-woo Hospital,

529
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:35,402
your father sent my father to North Korea.

530
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,709
Now that you know, come to your senses.

531
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:18,654
Is it true?

532
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:19,722
What do you mean?

533
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:23,917
Did you really send Dr Park's father
to North Korea?

534
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:27,572
Is it true?

535
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:29,356
Did he tell you?

536
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,692
Answer me! Is it true?

537
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:34,361
Yes, it is true.

538
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:43,337
How... How could you do something
so awful?

539
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,842
He tried to ruin my Myung-woo.

540
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:51,921
Why did you do it? Why?

541
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,114
I did what I had to do
to protect Myung-woo.

542
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:55,883
Father...

543
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:59,353
So don't be close with Park Hoon.

544
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,891
How can I look him in the eye ever again?

545
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,067
How can I?

546
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:07,761
Then don't see him!

547
00:42:07,852 --> 00:42:10,964
I can't help not seeing him!

548
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:32,119
What brings you here all of a sudden?

549
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:36,657
I've been told the competition is over
without defining a winner yet.

550
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:39,893
Dr Park's patient hasn't woken up.

551
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:42,829
Has your patient woken up?

552
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,740
Yes, sir.

553
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:45,942
Fine.

554
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:47,734
Then what about this?

555
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,347
If Dr Park wakes the patient up
right now and if the patient is okay,

556
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:52,539
it'll be a tie.

557
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:55,342
If not, he loses.

558
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:00,278
-What do you think?
-That's a good idea, Prime Minister.

559
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:13,293
What are you going to do?

560
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:15,838
If you don't wake him up right now,
we'll lose!

561
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,297
We can't wake him up.

562
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:20,119
It might take extra days
because of yesterday's cardiac arrest.

563
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:22,069
I think it might be okay.

564
00:43:25,873 --> 00:43:29,042
His vitals have been stable
ever since the night of the surgery.

565
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:33,714
I checked it every two hours
after yesterday's cardiac arrest.

566
00:43:33,805 --> 00:43:34,948
They're still stable.

567
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:36,216
It's done!

568
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:38,519
I'm going to tell them
that we're waking him up.

569
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,586
There's no turning back!

570
00:43:44,992 --> 00:43:46,593
I'm still not sure.

571
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:49,796
Let's wake him up. I think he'll be okay.

572
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:52,299
Is it because you want to win?

573
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:55,536
No, because I trust you.

574
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:59,339
Because the surgery went well,
he'll definitely wake up.

575
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,188
I think we have a winner.

576
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,064
Sir!

577
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,508
Do you recognize me, sir?

578
00:45:28,428 --> 00:45:29,363
Honey...

579
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,900
...do you recognize me?

580
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:52,119
Honey...

581
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:56,423
Yes, it's me. Your wife!

582
00:45:57,524 --> 00:46:02,229
Honey!

583
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:39,266
So it's a tie then?

584
00:46:40,067 --> 00:46:41,201
Yes, sir.

585
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:43,237
I guess we need an extra round.

586
00:46:43,437 --> 00:46:44,338
Of course.

587
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:49,810
I hope we have a winner
after the next round.

588
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,097
Good luck preparing for the next round.

589
00:47:15,402 --> 00:47:16,803
That's what I wanted to say.

590
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:20,007
Are you perhaps bipolar or something?

591
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:24,912
You were fine before the surgery,
and now you hate me to death.

592
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:26,146
What's the reason?

593
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:33,020
I feel so good.

594
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:36,323
I feel so good every time he frowns.

595
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,326
That's because you're a naturally
mean person.

596
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,396
Are you on his side or mine?

597
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:43,830
I'm on my side!

598
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:45,399
That little...

599
00:47:57,444 --> 00:48:01,348
Jae-joon, Dr Oh didn't come in
to work today.

600
00:48:01,439 --> 00:48:03,426
So I'll be your assistant.

601
00:48:03,517 --> 00:48:04,918
-She didn't?
-Yes.

602
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:06,520
She caught a cold apparently.

603
00:48:08,856 --> 00:48:10,791
-What time is the surgery?
-Five o'clock.

604
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:28,408
I'll see you later.

605
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:55,736
This is not good.

606
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,083
You should see a doctor.

607
00:49:00,174 --> 00:49:01,008
I'm fine.

608
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:02,576
No, you're not!

609
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:05,512
-You look very ill.
-I said I'm fine.

610
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:07,014
Soo-hyun...

611
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:11,485
I'm sorry. But just leave me alone.

612
00:49:11,685 --> 00:49:12,586
You can't.

613
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:16,123
-What if you faint...?
-Please leave me alone!

614
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:22,963
Did Dr Park yell at you
for waking up the patient?

615
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:28,502
Then what's wrong?

616
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:32,139
Jae-joon...

617
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:37,211
...you once told me that...

618
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:44,017
...Dr Park is like a new bag.

619
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:49,122
Then...

620
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:53,493
...why am I like this?

621
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:03,971
It hurts so much.

622
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:07,374
Too much.

623
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,024
What's going on?

624
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:26,293
Tell me the truth.

625
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:29,830
I told Dr Park that...

626
00:50:30,964 --> 00:50:32,332
...I am in love with him.

627
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:35,190
What?

628
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:37,571
But he said we can never be together.

629
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:58,625
It hurts so much. I feel like I'll die.

630
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:02,863
What do I do?

631
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,803
Okay. Just cry.

632
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:46,874
Just cry in my arms.

633
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:18,939
Where did you just go, Jae-joon?

634
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:21,975
-Chi-gyu...
-Yeah?

635
00:52:22,066 --> 00:52:23,719
The princess who lives in the castle...

636
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,843
The princess?

637
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:26,547
Oh, that princess.

638
00:52:26,638 --> 00:52:28,982
That princess has been in love
with another knight.

639
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:31,652
A love triangle!

640
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:34,537
When the knight witnessed
the princess crying...

641
00:52:35,522 --> 00:52:39,793
...after getting rejected
by the other knight...

642
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,331
...he wasn't angry.

643
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:49,725
Instead, he was heartbroken.

644
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:54,007
That means he really loves her.

645
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,775
-Real love?
-Yeah.

646
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:02,983
The knight hates her,
but he is also heartbroken.

647
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:06,262
Then his quest for the castle is over

648
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,495
if he really fell in love
with the princess.

649
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:20,434
You should eat this. It's porridge.

650
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:23,403
I'm sorry.

651
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:26,039
But I don't think I can eat anything.

652
00:53:33,347 --> 00:53:34,481
What happened?

653
00:53:38,185 --> 00:53:43,557
I got rejected by Dr Park
after confessing my feelings for him.

654
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:52,466
It's funny, isn't it?

655
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:54,902
Dr Oh...

656
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,571
It's fine.

657
00:53:57,971 --> 00:53:59,239
You don't need to console me.

658
00:54:02,843 --> 00:54:03,911
I'm sorry.

659
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:07,414
Why are you apologizing?

660
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,587
I'm so sorry.

661
00:54:15,322 --> 00:54:16,290
You don't need to be.

662
00:54:18,525 --> 00:54:19,626
I'm fine.

663
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:48,755
I heard about Dr Oh.

664
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:51,792
I told her about the Chairman.

665
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:53,627
She must be in shock.

666
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:57,331
I didn't mean to hurt her like that.

667
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:05,172
How's my mom doing?

668
00:55:11,211 --> 00:55:12,412
You said a month, right?

669
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:17,184
Okay. I'll wait.

670
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:19,920
But please take good care of her.

671
00:55:29,563 --> 00:55:33,033
Your father sent my father to North Korea.

672
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:37,971
He conspired with Jang Seok-joo
and sent my father to North Korea.

673
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:40,983
Because my father wanted to testify
against Myung-woo Hospital,

674
00:55:41,074 --> 00:55:43,210
your father sent my father to North Korea.

675
00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:46,180
Now that you know, come to your senses.

676
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,524
He tried to ruin my Myung-woo.

677
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,920
I did what I had to do
to protect Myung-woo.

678
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:13,700
Jae-hee had a kidney transplant
two years ago.

679
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,102
A kidney transplant?

680
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:02,416
Both of her kidneys were bad,
so she got one kidney replaced.

681
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:23,737
I'm so sorry.
