1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,076
Hi, I'm Han Jae-joon.

3
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,001
I'm Jang Seok-joo.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,081
Are you looking for someone?

5
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:49,892
Ah, by the way,

6
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,053
I heard there will be two teams
competing at Myung-woo Hospital.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,464
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,358
Dr Han's team will compete
against Dr Park Hoon's team.

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,528
Dr Park told me that he's forfeiting.

10
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:05,065
Forfeiting?

11
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:18,717
CARDIOLOGY PARK HOON

12
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,827
You look like a doctor now...

13
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,232
...Dr Park Hoon.

14
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:49,109
I am sure the person you're looking for
is expecting you to act like that.

15
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,845
That's funny.

16
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,647
What do you mean?

17
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,117
Anyway, you'll help me
with the twins' surgery then, right?

18
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:58,966
Of course.

19
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,192
I thought you forfeited?

20
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,634
I'll accept it on one condition.

21
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,207
A condition?

22
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:16,637
The cost of this competition
will be fully paid for by the hospital.

23
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,975
Is that it?

24
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,011
Then I'll assume you accept the condition.

25
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:27,743
I'll look forward
to your good performance.

26
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,577
Are you Professor Park Cheol?

27
00:02:55,676 --> 00:03:01,181
EPISODE 8

28
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,550
What's the matter, Prime Minister?

29
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,619
Nothing.

30
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,588
I need to use the restroom.

31
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,133
Are you sure that he is Park Hoon?

32
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,469
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,640
But he just left without saying anything.

34
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,709
After seeing me?

35
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,188
I guess he's too soft.

36
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:02,776
Now that I see you in person,
you look a lot like your father.

37
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:10,117
I heard what happened to your father.

38
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,785
I am sorry.

39
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,153
Why did you do it?

40
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:15,722
Why did I do it?

41
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:27,123
Father!

42
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:39,613
Prime Minister!

43
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:42,683
You know what?

44
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:45,519
Now I want to win this lousy competition.

45
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,465
I'm very curious
what your heart looks like.

46
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,234
I'm curious, too.

47
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,694
I am curious how you'll fix my heart.

48
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:00,300
Just pray that it won't be me.

49
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:06,106
If I get to take your heart out,
I'll put a hole in it immediately!

50
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,713
If you want to see my heart,
you should really try your best.

51
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:17,985
If not, you might never meet
your girlfriend from North Korea.

52
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,262
Prime Minister, what happened?

53
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,731
Nothing.

54
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,633
I was dizzy for a second. I am okay now.

55
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:53,754
Dr Park!

56
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:55,022
Park Hoon!

57
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,623
Oh, my

58
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:59,693
Say it again

59
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:03,597
Tell me, tell me...

60
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:12,873
What happened, sir?

61
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:15,943
It really was nothing.
I was dizzy for a second.

62
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,048
I should've told you earlier.

63
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:26,787
You already know that guy, Park Hoon...

64
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,366
I do?

65
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,691
It's his son.

66
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,096
Yes, the son of Park Cheol.

67
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,249
That was so tense!

68
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,327
Is this what usually happens
in men's restrooms?

69
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,597
No, usually it's only filled
with the sound of men pissing.

70
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,106
The space is tight. Come in.

71
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,380
Thank you for your hard work.

72
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:38,689
Ah, right.

73
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:42,416
-Did you say your name is Dr Han?
-Yes.

74
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:46,533
Do you have any specific reason
why you want to operate on my heart?

75
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,419
Because I want to become
the owner of Myung-woo.

76
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,277
Dr Han!

77
00:07:57,368 --> 00:08:01,858
Once I prove that I'm the best,
I'd like to take the highest seat

78
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,151
if Mr Chairman allows it.

79
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,723
How can you say such a thing
in front of the Prime Minister?

80
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:22,369
I like people who have specific
targets like you.

81
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,872
Like you, Mr Chairman.

82
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,674
Keep going that way.

83
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:29,710
Thank you, everyone.

84
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,589
By the way,
Dr Han seems to be very reliable.

85
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,759
I wanted him to be my son-in-law,
but what he said now was a bit reckless.

86
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,361
I don't think so.

87
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,732
I want my surgeon to have
at least that much guts.

88
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,766
Do you really think so?

89
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,704
What about Park Hoon?

90
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:05,579
If he's going up against Dr Han,
it'll be an uphill battle for him.

91
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,568
Do you think that makes any sense?

92
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,206
Why is the son of Park Cheol
in my hospital?

93
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,383
He's just a great surgeon.

94
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,910
-Just like Dr Park Cheol.
-Director Choi!

95
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,889
He is lacking in some aspects right now,

96
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,283
but once he competes against Dr Han,
he'll become a better doctor.

97
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,295
Do you think I'll let him stay here?

98
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,487
You must.

99
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,592
I know a bit too much about this hospital.

100
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,660
Dr Choi, what do you mean?

101
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:57,998
Prime Minister Jang also wants to see
how the competition goes.

102
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,834
Are you going to betray me
because you feel guilty?

103
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,470
You can think whatever you want.

104
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:08,242
But I just want this competition
to be fair.

105
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,016
Fine, but...

106
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,516
...I don't want him to stay here
for a long time.

107
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,451
We don't need to drag this out.

108
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:20,020
We'll finish the competition
in one surgery.

109
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,005
Hello?

110
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:29,293
Is this Professor Choi?

111
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,838
Yes, I'm Choi Byeong Cheol.

112
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:36,008
Hello, I'm Mr John
from the Hope Children's Services...

113
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,545
...who was adopted to the U.S.
about 20 years ago.

114
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,593
Yes. Did you find him?

115
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:47,562
Yes.

116
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:50,495
I hear that he has recently returned
to Korea.

117
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:53,019
Is Lee Sung Hoon...

118
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:54,840
...really in Korea?

119
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:58,763
Yes, I have found someone who we think
to believe is Mr Lee.

120
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:03,835
First, I will confirm if it's really him,
and then contact you.

121
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:07,849
THORACIC SURGEON CHIEF

122
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,145
Mr Lee Sung-hoon?

123
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,441
People say, “You look for a donkey
on the back of the donkey.”

124
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,201
Or in Korea, do they say the darkest area
is right below the gaslight?

125
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,172
Did you meet with Dr Choi?

126
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,274
It depends on you.

127
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,544
Are you going to stay in Korea
for a while?

128
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:52,212
I need to go to Beijing.

129
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,258
I assume today isn't the best day.

130
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:56,517
Why Beijing?

131
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:00,121
TAOBAO

132
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:03,366
You fixed my father's heart too well.

133
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:04,925
He's getting married for the third time.

134
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,138
I bought a 6 PM flight for you.

135
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,310
You should do my job as his son.

136
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,870
It seems like you want to kick me out
of Korea as soon as possible.

137
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,903
Please give my regards to your father.

138
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,421
It's almost done.

139
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:35,622
Almost...

140
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,660
What are you going to do once you're done?

141
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,484
I'll have to tear it down.

142
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,101
I built that castle
just so I can tear it down.

143
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:24,705
How did it go?

144
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,196
I have something to ask you.

145
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,764
The results of the ABGA test
is getting worse.

146
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,256
We must operate soon.

147
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:22,095
If you want to see my heart,
you should really try your best.

148
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,035
If not, you might never meet
your girlfriend from North Korea.

149
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,681
Why did you volunteer for this surgery?

150
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,282
So I can save the babies.

151
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,575
Is that the only reason?

152
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,962
-Why?
-Dr Park!

153
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,380
How did it go?

154
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,283
You really don't know? I said I'll do it.

155
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:44,785
That's good.

156
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,722
How much are you going
to get paid this time?

157
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:51,625
Get paid? No way!

158
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,260
What are you talking about?

159
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,195
So...

160
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,904
He receives money
straight from the patient?

161
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:07,207
I took 50 cents. Is that really wrong?

162
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:08,618
Of course it's wrong.

163
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,110
It was probably her lunch money.

164
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:11,980
That was originally mine!

165
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:14,748
I'm the one who found it first,
but she swindled me out of it!

166
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,116
Is that really all?

167
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,451
Of course, that's all!

168
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,322
Every stitch is extra. USD 100 per stitch.

169
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:27,136
Why did you do such a thing?

170
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:31,541
Apparently, it costs a lot of money
to take his girlfriend out of North Korea.

171
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:32,742
How much was it again?

172
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,709
I don't know.

173
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,111
This is deplorable.

174
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,671
What do you think your girlfriend
will say once she finds out?

175
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,073
What would she say?

176
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:41,141
You really don't know?

177
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,919
Do you still think she's Jae-hee?

178
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,578
Why are you taking it out on Dr Han?

179
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:46,324
Forget it. I'm leaving.

180
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,016
Where are you going?

181
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,450
Eat what you ordered first!

182
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,691
Can you do this in front of Jae-hee?

183
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:58,792
Geez...

184
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,527
Yes, why don't you just take a seat?

185
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,803
I'm curious about how you and Jae-hee met.

186
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,071
We just met.

187
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,574
I'm Song Jae-hee.

188
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:14,975
What about you?

189
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,378
You love each other that much
and the beginning was that boring?

190
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,449
Was it love at first sight?

191
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:27,855
You said she smiles a lot.

192
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,091
Ha ha...

193
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,094
That's not what you said before.

194
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,594
What's her personality like?

195
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:40,910
Wait a minute!

196
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,136
How can you do this to the man
you're destined to be with?

197
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,475
She can be pretty aggressive.
Sometimes I think she's just plain mean.

198
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,077
I'll marry you.

199
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,645
In 100 years!

200
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,648
And you still like her that much?

201
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,451
That's because she's Jae-hee.

202
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,623
I'm envious.

203
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,392
I wonder if Jae-hee knows
how you feel about her.

204
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,129
How could she know?
She couldn't hear it to begin with.

205
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:12,966
Bye.

206
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,069
What are you going to say
when you see her?

207
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:19,573
I missed you?

208
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:21,918
No.

209
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:22,876
Then?

210
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,417
Don't worry about the babies.
I'll save them.

211
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,719
But what's your real reason?

212
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,889
The real reason
why you want to do this surgery.

213
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,330
That's what I want to say.

214
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,098
Bye.

215
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:01,648
Excuse me.

216
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:02,883
Sure.

217
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,628
What brings you here?
What if Park Hoon sees you?

218
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:20,501
What did Park Hoon do
to the Prime Minister?

219
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,970
-What do you mean?
-I got a call.

220
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,439
He wants us to stay away from him.

221
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,108
Then what about the surgery team?

222
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:34,848
Join Han Jae-joon's team.

223
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:46,493
As you said, without Han Seung-hee,
Park Hoon will be unlikely to win.

224
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,737
And what's wrong with that?

225
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,806
Are you giving up on him?

226
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,698
I think Han Jae-joon isn't a bad option.

227
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,842
Good to see you again.

228
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:21,832
Which one are you going to choose?

229
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:24,998
It doesn't matter, let's just do it soon.

230
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,870
Is tonight okay?

231
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,406
-I'm good with that.
-Are you sure?

232
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,576
You only get one chance.

233
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,448
I like to keep things simple. One chance.

234
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,649
I look forward to a good competition.

235
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,062
Please have a seat.

236
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,387
This competition...

237
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,347
Why is it just one surgery?

238
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:15,115
Why? Does it matter?
All we need to do is win.

239
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,416
Are you confident?

240
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,888
-I'm a bit nervous. Should I give up?
-Hey!

241
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,957
In any scenario, we must be very quick

242
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:27,794
and finish this surgery in 45 minutes
like a soccer game.

243
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,908
If we don't finish within that time,
we lose.

244
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,100
There won't be a second chance.

245
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,135
Why does it have to be so short?

246
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:39,373
The purpose of this Norwood Procedure
is to create an artery for the baby.

247
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:43,753
That involves stopping the bypass machine,
so he might die if there is a time delay.

248
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:44,972
And that's the end.

249
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:49,616
So I need the help of the best doctors.

250
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,612
They must follow the operating surgeon's
orders very precisely.

251
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,174
Particularly, the surgical first assistant
can make or break the surgery.

252
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:21,991
Don't worry.

253
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:25,252
I have a lot of experience assisting,
and I've been researching on my own.

254
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:26,496
That's right.

255
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:30,991
Just win this thing
by working together as one!

256
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:34,428
Here.

257
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:38,832
-What is that?
-This is your prize money!

258
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:44,471
If you want this...

259
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,648
...you must absolutely win!

260
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,558
By the way, who will be
our surgical first assistant?

261
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,550
That would be Dr Oh.

262
00:21:56,641 --> 00:22:00,454
I'm sorry for saying this in front of her,
but I don't think she's the right person.

263
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:02,439
What do you mean?

264
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,492
The anesthesiologist knows best
when it comes to surgeons' skill levels.

265
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,130
We have seen Dr Oh
making a fool of herself.

266
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:14,301
Okay. I'll step aside if you'll take over.

267
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,279
I don't care as long as the patient lives.

268
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,805
I'm afraid this isn't something
you're capable of.

269
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,743
There are only a handful of surgeons

270
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,054
capable of performing
septal rupture repair and CABG!

271
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:26,480
And Dr Keum is one of them.

272
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:28,315
Dr Eun...

273
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,826
This competition requires

274
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:33,529
the first surgical assistant
to be as good as the operating surgeon.

275
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,875
Don't you agree, Chief?

276
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:39,927
I believe Dr Keum should be the first
surgical assistant in this competition.

277
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,206
Honestly, there isn't anything special
about Dr Oh

278
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:46,609
other than the fact
that she's the daughter of the Chairman.

279
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,619
You're too harsh, Dr Eun!

280
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,645
I don't think so.

281
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,104
You should stop, Dr Eun.

282
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:52,548
Don't say that.

283
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,575
Did I say something wrong?

284
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,343
Knock it off.

285
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,415
I'm the one who decides.

286
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,918
And our first surgical assistant is Dr Oh.

287
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,025
That'll be all.

288
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,401
Dr Oh, stay a minute.

289
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,645
Don't mind too much
about what Dr Eun said.

290
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,631
If you think I'm not good enough,
you should tell me right now.

291
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,617
I don't want to make you lose
because of me.

292
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:41,188
As I told you before,
you are my first surgical assistant.

293
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,268
You're sure, right?

294
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,628
But please make sure
that you're ready for everything.

295
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,798
Of course. I'll do my best.

296
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:58,200
We have the first surgical assistant.
Anesthesiologist?

297
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,673
Dr Han said she'll do it.

298
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,789
Really?

299
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:05,045
I get it. You'll help me
with the twin's surgery then, right?

300
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,747
Of course.

301
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:09,892
You'll be the operating surgeon.

302
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,388
Dr Yang first assistant.
And Dr Han the anesthesiologist.

303
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,763
We're good to go!

304
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:15,694
-We need a scrub nurse.
-Why?

305
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:19,070
The baby's chance of survival increases
as the turnaround time for tools decrease.

306
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,808
That's right.
There will be strict time constraints.

307
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,198
Then why are we leaving the hospital?

308
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,201
The person I want is outside
of this hospital.

309
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:29,277
-Outside of this hospital?
-Let's go.

310
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:32,849
Go, go!

311
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,063
Let's go!

312
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:47,049
If I join Dr Han's team,
that means we're giving up on Park Hoon.

313
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,389
I don't know what they're thinking either.

314
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:55,562
But now that the competition has started,
Park Hoon must win it now.

315
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,474
How can he win
without an anesthesiologist?

316
00:24:58,565 --> 00:24:59,663
He must win.

317
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,669
Otherwise, he'll be
a worthless piece of garbage.

318
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:09,576
You, he, and I will all die.

319
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,861
I'm speechless!

320
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,864
Did something happen?

321
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,699
The twins' surgery...

322
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:35,478
Dr Oh is going to be the first assistant!

323
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,080
Not Dr Keum?

324
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:38,338
That's what I mean!

325
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,043
He's giving preferential treatment
to his girlfriend!

326
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,927
-Dr Eun.
-What?

327
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:51,885
Should we try to change Dr Han's mind?

328
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:05,308
Why are we here
if we're looking for a scrub nurse?

329
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,902
I heard Nurse Min was the most experienced
in an operating room before she came here.

330
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,239
Atrial septal defect is a deadly condition
for infants, isn't it?

331
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,475
And I think she has
some experience in this.

332
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:22,015
Nurse Min!

333
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:33,694
The baby just fell asleep.
Please don't ring the bell.

334
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:35,970
What kind of weird situation is this?

335
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:39,666
She said the baby is sleeping!

336
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:40,901
Whatever.

337
00:26:59,303 --> 00:27:00,888
What do you think you're doing?

338
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,476
Please get out of here at once!

339
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:14,602
My back!

340
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,816
The baby might wake up, Nurse Min.

341
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:22,314
Let's get out of here.

342
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,884
Do you want to beat Dr Han this bad?

343
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:34,764
The surgery is tonight.

344
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:37,166
It's been a while
since I left the operating room.

345
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:41,695
And I'm sure there are many qualified
nurses other than me at Myung-woo.

346
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:54,550
He's so cute.

347
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:55,709
What's his name?

348
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:58,579
Seung-min.

349
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:03,217
The twins don't even have the names yet.

350
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:06,887
They're the same age as Seung-min.

351
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:11,267
They could be at the same kindergarten,
the same elementary school.

352
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,460
Maybe they'll sit next to each other
in class.

353
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:21,068
I'm begging you, Nurse Min.

354
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,572
That was pretty touching.

355
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,075
It didn't work?

356
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:30,310
It almost worked.

357
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:31,712
Which part?

358
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:34,480
The same school part? Sitting together?

359
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:45,225
Hey, are you really making this much
of a fuss for a scrub nurse?

360
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,394
It's because she's worth it.

361
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:49,605
-So did she say yes?
-I don't know.

362
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:53,433
What do you mean you don't know?
You did so much to get in there!

363
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,103
Why are you getting angry
if I'm the one who did the work?

364
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,272
I have my reasons!
I got the door slammed in my face.

365
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,562
Give me 10 USD.

366
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,466
-Why?
-I want some ice cream.

367
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:02,843
That little brat...

368
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,730
I'll give you 100 USD! Here you go!

369
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:21,116
You did the right thing.

370
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:23,704
It's been a while
since you quit that position.

371
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:26,466
What do you think will happen tonight?

372
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,603
You're Dr Park's first assistant
on the team.

373
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:31,438
It'll be useless.

374
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:38,533
Dr Park will never beat Dr Han.

375
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,821
Park Hoon!

376
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:50,624
Wasn't Dr Han our anesthesiologist?

377
00:29:50,715 --> 00:29:52,459
-Yes. Why?
-Why?

378
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,660
She says she won't do it!

379
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:55,288
Go now!

380
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,664
I'm sorry, I took a day off.

381
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:58,732
A day off?

382
00:29:58,823 --> 00:30:00,309
I have something to do after work.

383
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,292
What can be so that important for you
to skip this surgery?

384
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,672
Do I have to tell you what it is?

385
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:08,108
-Didn't you want to save the babies?
-Yes, I did.

386
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:10,043
But today is really not a good day.

387
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:11,645
What kind of game are you playing?

388
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:16,550
I haven't had a day-off since I got here.
So I want to take a break.

389
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:17,751
What about the babies?

390
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,054
I'm not the only anesthesiologist
in this hospital.

391
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,321
To me, you're the only one.

392
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:27,003
You know how important anesthetics
are in this surgery.

393
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:27,961
Please.

394
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:29,872
I'm sorry.

395
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:38,906
Yes, the surgery will be at 10:00.

396
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:40,212
What? Going home?

397
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:42,952
Hey, head of anesthesiology
leaves work so early?

398
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:45,088
How come everyone in anesthesiology
goes home so early?

399
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,947
Hey!

400
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:49,349
Darn!

401
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,851
I got it.

402
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:52,719
You'll help me with the twins' surgery?

403
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:54,632
Of course.

404
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,437
Why did you volunteer for this surgery?

405
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:58,058
To save the babies.

406
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,293
Is that the only reason?

407
00:30:59,384 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm sorry.

408
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:10,671
-Dr Moon?-
What is it?

409
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:17,987
Aren't you in need of an anesthesiologist
right now?

410
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,947
Are you throwing salt in my wounds?

411
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:22,616
Not at all.

412
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,219
I'm here to offer my services.

413
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:32,969
Is Dr Eun going to help Water Bottle?

414
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,396
Yes, I don't know why, but she said so.

415
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,218
-She's doing that because of you.
-I beg your pardon?

416
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:42,980
She's going on strike to make you
the first assistant on the team.

417
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:45,939
I'm sorry, Chief.

418
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,158
-Because of me...
-No need to apologize.

419
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,644
We can get another anesthesiologist.

420
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:54,147
I guess so.

421
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,652
For tonight's surgery?

422
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,055
Yes. I want you to join our team.

423
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,992
They're twins with aterial septal defect.

424
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:10,764
Join Dr Han's team.

425
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:15,335
I'm sorry, Dr Han.
But I must go home after work.

426
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,206
-Home?
-Yes, I have a prior engagement.

427
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:22,009
I don't know what kind of engagement
that is, but please postpone it.

428
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:26,022
The babies need the surgery right now.

429
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,324
I heard you got an anesthesiologist.

430
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:29,483
Not for my operating team.

431
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:37,558
Do you want me to join Dr Han's team?

432
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:40,302
What is this?

433
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:43,330
I thought you guys were competing
against each other.

434
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:44,765
That's why we must be fair.

435
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:46,809
Otherwise, there's no meaning in winning.

436
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,511
That's interesting.

437
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:49,970
But I can't do it today.

438
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,640
Dr Han!

439
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:58,212
You already stole my anesthesiologist.

440
00:32:58,478 --> 00:32:59,713
Are you playing with me right now?

441
00:32:59,804 --> 00:33:01,915
That's why I'm trying to give you
another anesthesiologist.

442
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:03,817
Do you think I'm that easy?

443
00:33:04,997 --> 00:33:07,276
You think I'll lose
because of an anesthesiologist?

444
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:14,661
Don't you know that this surgery will be
difficult without a good anesthesiologist?

445
00:33:16,597 --> 00:33:17,807
After all, the result of this competition

446
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:19,527
depends on the hands
of the operating surgeons.

447
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:23,370
I like your confidence.

448
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,173
Let's play a fair game then!

449
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,208
Dr Han?

450
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:48,571
Mr Chairman.

451
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,207
Does this castle represent Myung-woo?

452
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:54,334
They're just toys,
for me to relieve my stress.

453
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:56,803
Who do you think is the owner
of this castle right now?

454
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:59,473
If that's Myung-woo, of course it is...

455
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:01,981
Me?

456
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:04,353
That's not true.

457
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:07,281
The owner of the castle
is the castle itself.

458
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:09,082
This is the castle named Myung-woo.

459
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:12,352
I'm only the temporary caretaker
that the castle allowed.

460
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,743
Once I lose my ability
to protect Myung-woo,

461
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,481
it'll abandon me right away.

462
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,070
You said you want to be
the owner of the castle, right?

463
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:25,499
Then, you must show Myung-woo
that you're capable of it.

464
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,175
Take care of the stranger
who has entered the castle.

465
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,479
-Are you talking about Park Hoon?
-Keep this in mind.

466
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,416
I am not watching, but Myung-woo is.

467
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:47,721
It is watching to see
how you'll get rid of the stranger.

468
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,499
I believe Dr Keum should be

469
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,802
the first assistant on the team
for this competition.

470
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:05,281
There isn't anything special about Dr Oh

471
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:08,609
other than the fact that
she's the daughter of the Chairman.

472
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:13,046
As I told you before,
you are the first assistant on this team.

473
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,077
Scalpel.

474
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,551
I've been curious for a while.

475
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,321
Darn it!

476
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,760
Is something there?

477
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,718
There's a quack, apparently!
Don't be silly!

478
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:05,095
It's for image training.
Move aside! Leave!

479
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:09,503
Can you tell me what a first assistant
should do for this surgery?

480
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,074
You want me to train
the other team's first assistant?

481
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:15,375
Does it matter?

482
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:18,345
If you can't survive on your own,
you must be good at freeloading!

483
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:19,279
Hey, Dr Park!

484
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:23,183
-What are you doing?
-You wanted me to teach you!

485
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,064
What's so funny?

486
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:32,526
Did you expect me to touch you
in inappropriate places, quack?

487
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:34,436
Okay, fine. Forget it.

488
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:37,073
Fine, I'm sorry.

489
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:38,232
We must save the twins.

490
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:39,299
Let go of me!

491
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:45,550
Close your eyes.

492
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:53,247
Do you see the baby's heart
at the end of your hand?

493
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,309
What are you doing, Dr Oh?

494
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:03,914
Can we talk?

495
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:10,524
Thank you, Dr Park.

496
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:11,825
Sure.

497
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:29,710
Did you forget that Dr Oh
is the first assistant on your rival team?

498
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,013
You're competing against Dr Han.

499
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:42,565
Do you think this competition
is a joke, Dr Park?

500
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:46,193
You're the one who thinks this is a joke.
You went back on your promise with me.

501
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:47,661
And you refused to help the other team.

502
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:48,896
Let me give you some advice.

503
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,901
The stakes are high for this competition.

504
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:55,335
In what way?

505
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:58,405
Am I going to die if I lose?

506
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,942
For a moment, I thought you were Jae-hee.

507
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:07,714
But I don't think you are.

508
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,285
Why?

509
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:14,888
Jae-hee would've said
that winning or losing doesn't matter.

510
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,723
This is something that's important to you.

511
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:19,014
What's more important
than the babies right now?

512
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:23,964
Can't you see them?

513
00:39:24,317 --> 00:39:27,977
Infants less than a month old are sucking
on tubes instead of their mother's breasts

514
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:29,664
and they can't even say they're suffering!

515
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:33,073
Their soft chests will be cut open
by scalpels tonight!

516
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,598
And we can't even be sure
whether they'll survive after all this.

517
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:37,377
So what's so important about competition?

518
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,047
Why does it matter so much
who wins and loses?

519
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,115
But, Dr Park...

520
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:43,784
I got it.

521
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:45,402
You should go get some rest.

522
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:49,456
I'll take care of this lousy competition.
So just go.

523
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,298
Don't worry about the anesthesiologist.

524
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:00,434
Just go.

525
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,034
What do you mean?

526
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:36,603
You want me to give up my position?

527
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:38,071
Yes.

528
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,716
Let's give it to Dr Keum just this once.

529
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:41,775
What's the reason?

530
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:44,044
Dr Eun is going
to the water bottle's team.

531
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,313
So?

532
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,548
She'll come back if we make Dr Keum
the first assistant.

533
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,186
-I refuse.
-Soo-hyun...

534
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,454
I really want to do this one.

535
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:57,491
I even went to Dr Park, despite
the embarrassment, to get ready for this.

536
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,593
But now you want me to give it up?

537
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:02,738
I'm sorry, Jae-joon.

538
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:04,064
Why were you embarrassed?

539
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:09,303
To me, you seemed
to be fully enjoying the situation.

540
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:13,409
Are you jealous, Jae-joon?

541
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,175
The chief is ordering his staff.

542
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,721
Give the first assistant position
to Dr Keum.

543
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,971
-I said I'll do it!
-Listen to your chief!

544
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:27,120
This is why they talk about you being
the daughter of the Chairman!

545
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:29,132
That's not the reason
why I want to do this.

546
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:32,168
Every doctor wants to try difficult
surgeries like the Norwood procedure!

547
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:34,695
I need someone who can do it,
not who wants to do it.

548
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:38,398
What are you talking about?

549
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:42,402
Are you saying that I can't do it?

550
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:43,481
That's right.

551
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:48,542
At least Dr Keum won't go
to Water Bottle to learn.

552
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:50,892
Jae-joon...

553
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:04,052
Okay.

554
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:06,894
Dr Keum will be your first.

555
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:23,829
Of course, Dr Eun!

556
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,445
I'm heading to the operating room!

557
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:31,652
Dr Keum will be the first assistant
for Dr Han.

558
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:34,922
What happened to the quack...?
What happened to Dr Oh?

559
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,090
I guess it just happened.

560
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:45,399
What is this?

561
00:42:58,212 --> 00:42:59,822
Can you do that somewhere else?

562
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,248
Yes, let's go somewhere else.

563
00:44:05,748 --> 00:44:10,880
Norwood

564
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:21,328
I need the help of the knight.

565
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,065
Is this what you meant by being useless?

566
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,739
I can't live as an unpaid fellow forever.

567
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,178
I'll get an assistant professor position
if I do as Dr Han says.

568
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:47,281
Then our lives will be better.

569
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:50,393
You know you're putting the lives
of the babies in danger right now.

570
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:52,920
-How could you...?
-Dr Han will do it if Park Hoon can't.

571
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:55,422
Don't you know why they're rushing
this surgery?

572
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:58,959
You are a parent, too.

573
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:00,494
You're a father, too.

574
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:04,998
I'm doing this to be a better father,
Soo-ji.

575
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:09,036
Then what about being a good doctor?

576
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,575
I came here to discuss something.

577
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,677
But I guess it isn't necessary anymore.

578
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:24,914
Get out of here! Get out immediately!

579
00:46:26,023 --> 00:46:28,255
That ass!

580
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:29,690
What is going on?

581
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,993
I'm so sorry to be like this
right before the surgery.

582
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:42,145
What did I do in my previous lives?

583
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:44,137
Why are these bad things happening to me?

584
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:46,885
There's no way around it.
You should do it, my master.

585
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:48,976
Aren't you aware that I'm on probation?

586
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:50,577
Then who will be my first assistant?

587
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:52,980
Do you think I'd be like this
if I had any idea?

588
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,925
This is driving me crazy!

589
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:18,883
Hey, quack.

590
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:22,820
Are you sleeping?

591
00:47:22,911 --> 00:47:24,754
I have no time to play with you.
Leave me alone.

592
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,047
-I heard you got fired...
-I said get lost!

593
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:38,101
Help me.

594
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:39,493
My first assistant is injured.

595
00:47:40,794 --> 00:47:42,362
Don't you know that I'm on
Dr Han's team?

596
00:47:42,453 --> 00:47:43,630
The teams don't matter right now.

597
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,132
Then what matters?

598
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:47,801
We need to save the babies.

599
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:56,443
How can you save the babies
with an unskilled quack like me?

600
00:47:57,211 --> 00:48:00,547
If it's a quack who tries hard like you,
I think it'll be possible.

601
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:07,900
We're running out of time.
Are you going to help me or not?

602
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:22,803
Right.

603
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:25,239
Your hands are perfect
to be a cardiac surgeon.

604
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:32,246
But I want you to know something.

605
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:38,694
What do you think you're doing?

606
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,387
What do you mean?
Getting ready for surgery.

607
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:42,689
-Whose surgery?
-Dr Han's.

608
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,158
What about my surgery?
You said you'll help me out!

609
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:46,593
-I did.
-Dr Eun!

610
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:49,196
Calm down, Dr Park.

611
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:52,833
I'm the senior physician
of the Anesthesiology Department.

612
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,170
You won't believe the influence
I can yield over my underlings.

613
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:58,872
Where are you, Dr Han?

614
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:02,585
I'm looking at apartments.

615
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:04,344
There is an urgent surgery. Come in.

616
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:06,780
I assume everything worked out.

617
00:49:06,871 --> 00:49:07,781
Yes.

618
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:09,650
It's 8:00 right now.

619
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:11,318
The surgery is at 10:00.
Can you make it?

620
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:12,986
Yes, doctor.

621
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:15,789
Also, hold on.

622
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:20,626
It's me.

623
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:23,398
Hi.

624
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:25,990
I'm sorry.

625
00:49:27,835 --> 00:49:28,969
It's okay, doctor.

626
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:32,093
Can you come in?

627
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:33,923
We must save the babies.

628
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,349
Are you going to refuse
Jang Seok-joo's request?

629
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,707
I didn't volunteer
to join Park Hoon's team.

630
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:46,420
I was ordered by my superior.

631
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,524
It'll cause even more suspicion
if I insist on joining Dr Han's team.

632
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:57,064
I don't know what they're thinking,
but we must continue with our plan.

633
00:50:21,788 --> 00:50:22,817
What's up, Hoon?

634
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,867
Are you following her?

635
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:26,860
Why do you want me to follow her anyway?

636
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:28,301
Where are you right now?

637
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:30,003
ANJUNG
ASAN

638
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,199
In Pyeongtaek.

639
00:50:33,634 --> 00:50:35,896
Keep an eye on her.
And call me if anything happens.

640
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:49,326
Yes.

641
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,719
The Prime Minister has arrived
at the residence.

642
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:55,264
Yes, sir.

643
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:16,542
Yes.

644
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:19,813
The Prime Minister has arrived
at the residence.

645
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:22,282
Yes, sir.

646
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:26,520
Should we go to the residence together?

647
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:22,938
Is he her boyfriend?

648
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,331
It worked out.

649
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,591
You wanted Dr Han
from the beginning anyway.

650
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:40,209
Who will be our scrub nurse?

651
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:41,828
I got one.

652
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,375
When will Dr Han be here?

653
00:52:57,878 --> 00:52:59,847
Is something wrong?

654
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:06,253
What would you do if I disappeared
all of a sudden?

655
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:10,190
I'll search the whole world and find you.

656
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:12,292
Really?

657
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,482
What's up with this strange mood?

658
00:54:22,296 --> 00:54:23,372
Do you have to do this?

659
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:24,765
Why do you care?

660
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:26,976
Anyway, I'm worse than Dr Keum.

661
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,743
But how could you
go to Park Hoon's team?

662
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:36,877
I'm the one who asked.

663
00:54:40,747 --> 00:54:42,759
Now you're stealing my team's
first assistant?

664
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,552
I'll return her to you later.
So just focus on your surgery.

665
00:54:45,643 --> 00:54:46,720
You're so cheap!

666
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:49,356
Do you want to win that much?

667
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:50,858
How did you know?

668
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:53,360
So you can stop embarrassing me
by stop talking about it.

669
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:59,202
You must save the baby at all costs.
Do you understand?

670
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:37,219
Mr Chairman.

671
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:20,967
LEE CHANG-YI

672
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:24,685
Are you still in Pyeongtaek?

673
00:56:27,754 --> 00:56:28,743
Yeah, Hoon.

674
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:30,657
What's this all about?

675
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:49,084
What are you doing?

676
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:02,826
What?

677
00:57:03,414 --> 00:57:05,384
Something strange is happening here.

678
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:08,428
Is Dr Han okay?

679
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,079
Jae-hee...

680
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,260
Why did you want to see us?

681
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:47,367
We changed the plans.

682
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:49,027
Changed?

683
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:50,604
Yes.

684
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,414
We want Han Jae-joon to operate
on the Prime Minister.

685
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:07,645
Hoon!

686
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:09,899
What's going on?

687
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,525
That woman who looks like Jae-hee...

688
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,162
Yes, Dr Han!

689
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:23,437
I think he's going to kill her!

690
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,825
DOCTOR STRANGER

691
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:47,042
What do you mean by using Han Jae-joon?

692
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:49,380
Han Jae-joon will operate on him.

693
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,340
The original plan was to join
Park Hoon's team.

694
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:52,708
The plan has changed.

695
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,311
Did my government agree
with your new plan?

696
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:56,579
Do you think we're that easy?

697
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:57,638
How do we decide who won?

698
00:58:57,729 --> 00:59:00,917
The shorter it takes to make the artery,
the better the result will be.

699
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:04,491
So whoever makes the artery first
within 45 minutes wins?

700
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,242
-A surgical scar?
-You can always attach another kidney,

701
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,982
but you can't hide the scar.

702
00:59:09,249 --> 00:59:10,317
Are you curious?

703
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:13,420
If Park Hoon loses,
you'll get buried next to him!
