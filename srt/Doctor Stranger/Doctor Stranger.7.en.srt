1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,499
Dr Han,
everyone has a different heartbeat.

3
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:39,139
Like how two different people can't have
the same face, the heartbeat is unique.

4
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,677
What are you talking about, Dr Park?

5
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,212
It'll just be a minute.

6
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:11,939
What are you doing?

7
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,441
What are you doing? Apologize to her.

8
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,143
Forget it, Dr Oh.

9
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,421
Are you out of your mind?

10
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,622
What's wrong with you?

11
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:32,097
There is only one person in the world
who shares the same heartbeat as you.

12
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:34,328
That person is your soul mate.

13
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:36,196
Is that true?

14
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:39,299
Then, Dr Han...

15
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,971
Just kidding!
How can there be such a thing?

16
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,239
What?

17
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,046
Even if such a thing exists, it's not her.

18
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,076
Wait a minute.

19
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,514
Could it be that you're my soul mate?

20
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,185
Why don't we check each other's heartbeat
to see if we're soul mates?

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,468
You shouldn't joke with people like this!

22
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:31,919
EPISODE 7

23
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,368
I sincerely apologize.
I believe I was mistaken.

24
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,936
Hello, this is Han Seung-hee.

25
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,780
Hello, this is Oh Soo-hyun.

26
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,838
Got it.
Okay.

27
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,579
Stop doing things
that ashame your doctor's coat.

28
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:02,850
Go.

29
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:04,985
Where?

30
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:06,753
The emergency room.
There's an urgent patient.

31
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,852
-I don't care. I'm not going.
-Stop blabbering and just follow me!

32
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,071
Enough?

33
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,931
From now on, there isn't any problem
with this, okay?

34
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,278
Hey, can you cut us some slack?
We were just trying to catch a spy!

35
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,371
You're quite naive, Hyung-wook.

36
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,241
If she were a spy,
she would've manipulated this already!

37
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,275
Manipulated it?

38
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,019
If she knew that in advance,

39
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,145
she'd somehow submit a scan
with two kidneys!

40
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:33,329
That makes sense.

41
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,702
Her blood pressure is instable.

42
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,829
Please get more saline solution
and blood plasma.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,830
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,710
What's going on?
She's losing a lot of blood.

45
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,770
If her blood pressure falls,
the baby is in danger.

46
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,862
What?

47
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,492
Her blood pressure is going down because
air in her lungs is pressing the heart.

48
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,851
Just remove the air.

49
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,482
What?

50
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,767
Air is leaking,
and she's losing a lot of blood?

51
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:29,870
Tell them to check her pulmonary tissue.

52
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,681
Her lung is ripped.

53
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,082
We should do a CT scan first.

54
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,384
We don't have time for that
if her lung is really damaged.

55
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,020
If a pregnant woman loses her
blood pressure, the baby gets less oxygen.

56
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,523
Which will lead to a miscarriage,
or damage the baby's brain.

57
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,716
We may be giving a permanent disability
to a normal baby.

58
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,053
EMERGENCY OPERATING ROOM

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,921
You're the anesthesiologist?

60
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,524
Let's go.

61
00:04:57,374 --> 00:05:00,943
How come that ass always speaks
so informally to everyone?

62
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,936
What's wrong with that?
I think that's attractive.

63
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,439
Are you out of your mind?

64
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:31,975
You may begin.

65
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:34,535
Scalpel.

66
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,616
Everything is over if you can't maintain
her blood pressure.

67
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,708
Don't worry.

68
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,287
Can you assist me, quack?

69
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,779
Can you stop calling me a quack?

70
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,881
Focus.

71
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,839
It took less than five minutes for them
to start the surgery.

72
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,698
Anesthetizing a pregnant woman
isn't an easy feat.

73
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,509
But she did it perfectly.

74
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,041
Only if she weren't a spy,

75
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:10,437
she could have been perfect
to be our anesthesiologist!

76
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:11,738
A spy?

77
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,284
I guess that makes sense.

78
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,489
If she really is a spy, it was probably
easy to manipulate her CT scan results!

79
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,958
Can you think of any ideas?

80
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,483
I do have an idea.

81
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,353
But before I speak...

82
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,257
...do you think I can get an advance
on this month's salary?

83
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,960
Dr Han hasn't taken care of that yet?

84
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,671
The salary of unpaid fellows
is the chief's responsibility.

85
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,931
I am afraid that he forgot me
because I'm on your team.

86
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,244
Fine. I'll wire you the money right now.

87
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,970
What's your idea?

88
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,683
You can tell her that we don't accept
the branch hospital's health exam record.

89
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,135
Out check-up list contains a CT scan, too,
so it'll show up.

90
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,381
That's right.

91
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,650
I got it.

92
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,909
Her blood pressure is dropping!

93
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:10,864
I got it.

94
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,242
Oxygen saturation is at 90.
Is her bronchus blocked?

95
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,301
It's not blocked.

96
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,435
Then why is it not going up?

97
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,337
Ninety is not bad.

98
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:19,773
She's pregnant, idiot!
Even 100 can be dangerous.

99
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:20,807
I want to bring it up, too.

100
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,210
But her lung capacity is too low
because of her pregnancy.

101
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,778
Her other lung isn't in good condition.

102
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:26,880
You're going to say that
after you kill the patient?

103
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:29,683
Dr Park...

104
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,053
Two-lung ventilation.

105
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,867
Do you think you can do it?
It'll be hard to see.

106
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,825
I can do it.

107
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,177
Let's try one-lung ventilation again.

108
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,857
The blood clot that went over
has been removed.

109
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:01,915
So it'll be fine.

110
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:17,130
You were too harsh on her.

111
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,643
She isn't used to this hospital yet.

112
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,146
That doesn't matter to the patient.

113
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:23,237
Show me more inside.

114
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:25,405
Take it easy on her.

115
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,950
You're angry because she isn't
the one you looked for.

116
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,952
Stop talking nonsense
and call an obstetrician.

117
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:30,911
Childbirth?

118
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:33,514
If she was going to get a C-section,
now might be a good time.

119
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,065
Release the one-lung ventilation.

120
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,506
No bubbles. I think it's been sealed.

121
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,124
Suction.

122
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,189
They're twins!

123
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,406
You'll do the drain?

124
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,165
Don't worry. Good job.

125
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:31,948
Get another health exam?

126
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,048
That's right.

127
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,519
Do another health exam
on Dr Han Seung-hee.

128
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,812
And send me the results immediately.

129
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,491
We can go to jail for that, Hyung-wook!

130
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,884
We're already in the same boat.

131
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:47,721
If you don't do as I say, we all die!
I'm going to reveal everything!

132
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:49,784
Hyung-wook!

133
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,070
Should I send this
to the Disciplinary Committee?

134
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,139
Or should I just send this directly
to the police?

135
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,164
Hyung-wook!

136
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,099
So just do as I say.

137
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,559
What happened?

138
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,896
-Why...?
-They're twins, Jae-joon.

139
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,253
I guess you felt like this quite often.

140
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,370
That moment when the patient
looks at you after the surgery,

141
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:42,075
that feeling that makes you both happy
and responsible.

142
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,244
It's painful sometimes.

143
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,213
I can only imagine.

144
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,617
Anyway, Dr Park was incredible.

145
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,120
It's a good thing that we get
to work with him.

146
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,665
I need to go check on a patient.

147
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,669
Soo-hyun, you did a good job
on the surgery.

148
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,773
But I want you to remember one thing.

149
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,283
What?

150
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,344
You're the first assistant on my team.

151
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,229
Of course. I'll see you later.

152
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:55,331
No one is better than Dr Han
to be the anesthesiologist on our team.

153
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:56,357
You agree, right?

154
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:58,719
She isn't bad.

155
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,623
You must understand the distress
that I'm going through.

156
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,793
If she's Han Seung-hee, you won't
be happy, but I would be thrilled.

157
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:12,175
If she's Jae-hee, you'll be very happy,
but that'll be the end of my career.

158
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,001
That means that you're a spy, too!

159
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,145
Or not?

160
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,472
What's that?
We confirmed that she's not Jae-hee!

161
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,207
Only based on a CT scan of her kidneys?

162
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,878
If she were a spy, she would have been
able to manipulate it so easily!

163
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,716
Let's see the end of this today!

164
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,100
I submitted my health record
from the branch hospital.

165
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,159
Why do I need to go through
another one?

166
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,229
I apologize for the inconvenience,
but that's the policy.

167
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,400
We require the health exam
to be done here.

168
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,525
What if we really end up going to jail?

169
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,697
The die is cast. There's no going back!

170
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:32,079
She'll get another health exam
as a new hire.

171
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:36,037
Things like the blood,
sight and hearing tests.

172
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:48,428
But this is certain!
It was taken here today.

173
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:09,627
Another health exam?

174
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:10,760
Yes.

175
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,762
Didn't you get one at the branch hospital?

176
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,319
They told me to get another one.

177
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,390
So did you get one?

178
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:17,844
Yes.

179
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,528
This is unexpected, though.

180
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,830
But medical records
are confidential by law.

181
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,766
I assume that's same in South Korea, too.

182
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,434
Dr Han!

183
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:32,806
I'll call you later.

184
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,193
How can I help you?

185
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:56,230
I need to check if you're a spy, Dr Han.

186
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,474
What do you mean?

187
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,468
Dr Park's girlfriend
only has one kidney, right?

188
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,272
So if today's exam results show
that you only have one kidney,

189
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,709
that means you're Dr Park's girlfriend,
which means you're a spy.

190
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:09,977
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:17,651
But if you do have two kidneys,
then I must sincerely apologize.

192
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,286
Give it to me.

193
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:24,691
Are you saying
that is my personal medical record?

194
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,362
This is for my master.
So don't say anything.

195
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,798
Do you know that it's illegal
to see other people's medical record?

196
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,867
What are you doing?

197
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:36,870
Let go of me!

198
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,175
Just stay still.

199
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,187
Great.

200
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,936
What do you think you're doing?

201
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,528
Byeong-cheol...

202
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,072
Give me that CD immediately.

203
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:14,484
I must check something on it...

204
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:18,078
You can't possibly think it's okay
to browse other people's medical records!

205
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:20,113
Give it to me right now.

206
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,254
What are you doing?

207
00:16:29,242 --> 00:16:30,257
Hoon!

208
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:01,855
Two kidneys.

209
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,027
I won't let this slide.

210
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:22,876
Dr Han, I apologize on their behalf.

211
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,380
It'd be great if you could forget
about this.

212
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:30,817
How can doctors, of all the people,
be so insensitive about medical records?

213
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:32,586
I'll apologize on their behalf.

214
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,009
Please.

215
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:38,392
Dr Han, I'm so sorry!

216
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,828
I'm sorry, too.
So can we just let this one slide?

217
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,066
Yes, please forgive us this time!

218
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:01,481
Dr Han!

219
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,933
What are you doing here, Chang-yi?

220
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,594
I need to make money
to pay for Mom's hospital bills.

221
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,704
Hey! What are you doing?

222
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:26,773
I need to go to another job
across the street.

223
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,643
Really?

224
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,745
What are you wearing under that uniform?

225
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,160
This one's for the spa.

226
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,886
Do you want to see the one
under this too?

227
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,355
Forget it. Give me the key for the truck.

228
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,501
-Where are you going, Hoon?
-Garibong.

229
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,493
Do you want me to drive?

230
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,328
It's fine.
You said you need to go make money.

231
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,964
Ask her to treat you
to a nice dinner, Ma'am!

232
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:51,999
Okay.

233
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,813
Goodbye.

234
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,081
Why do you call him Dr Park Hoon?

235
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,306
What's wrong with that?

236
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:02,276
You should call him oppa!

237
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,245
It's embarrassing!

238
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,223
I feel better that way.

239
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,758
What do you mean?

240
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:09,850
You don't want to know.

241
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,219
Are you going to eat that?
Can I eat it for you?

242
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,846
This must be your clinic.

243
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,084
What brings you here?

244
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,126
I'm leaving for China in a couple of days.

245
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,937
You shouldn't go.

246
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,473
Someone will come meet me
and take me into North Korea.

247
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,132
I'll find Jae-hee on my own.

248
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:02,436
So you don't need to be involved anymore.

249
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,715
I must tell you something before I go.

250
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:06,940
I don't want to hear it.

251
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:13,814
The reason why your father went
to North Korea...

252
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:26,627
LEGAL COMPLAINT

253
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:33,242
"Legal Complaint."

254
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,837
"Plaintiff, Park Cheol.
Named defendant, Myung-woo Hospital?"

255
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:55,088
Your hospital will get a call
sometime next week.

256
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,127
Dr Park, is this really necessary?

257
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,706
A patient died during surgery.

258
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,632
Everyone makes mistakes.

259
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:11,772
Listen, do you know why people respect us?

260
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:16,185
It's because we aren't allowed
to make a single mistake.

261
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,121
We deal with people's lives.

262
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,479
Listen, Professor Park...

263
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,550
They never revealed
who performed the surgery.

264
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:28,822
Please go tell him that he should feel...

265
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,326
...the weight of the doctor's coat
that he's wearing.

266
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:41,811
I'll be responsible for this
whole thing, Mr Chairman.

267
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:43,846
Be responsible? For what?

268
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:47,483
It happened during my surgery.
We should admit the malpractice.

269
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,318
Then what'll happen to our hospital?

270
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,221
This hospital is so close
to getting medical school certified?

271
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,824
We can get the certification next year.

272
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:58,352
Dr Choi, you made a promise to me!

273
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,931
To make this hospital the best
in the world!

274
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:02,923
Have you forgotten?

275
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:04,992
This is to keep that promise.

276
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,728
If we don't get certified this year,
we'll go bankrupt!

277
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:09,396
How are you going to keep
the promise then?

278
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:10,998
Mr Chairman...

279
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,107
You guys are here.

280
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:22,342
Good work, everyone.

281
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:31,285
I want to help you two keep your promise.

282
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,220
What do you mean?

283
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:38,067
The North Korean government asked us

284
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:41,404
to send a skilled cardiologist.

285
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:44,665
Is that so? That's great!

286
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:47,467
Dr Choi is the perfect candidate!

287
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:50,813
But this is an unofficial request,

288
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:53,407
so I don't think it'll help to promote
the hospital's name.

289
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,471
Besides, Dr Choi must take care of me
as my main physician!

290
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,855
I spend a lot of money
to support you every year.

291
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:10,958
Shouldn't it be more like give and take?

292
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:16,830
They need a doctor to operate
on Kim Il-sung's heart.

293
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:20,033
Did you say Kim Il-sung?

294
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:25,739
Once someone goes up there,
he won't be able to come back for a while.

295
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:28,351
So then...

296
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:32,346
Yes, I'm thinking of Dr Park Cheol.

297
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,587
I guess that should stop
the malpractice lawsuit for a while.

298
00:23:40,678 --> 00:23:44,491
You can get your certification
while preparing for the lawsuit.

299
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:50,030
Congressman Jang!

300
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:56,170
In return, you need to help me out,
Dr Choi!

301
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,621
There is a serious stricture
of coronary arteries.

302
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,724
At this rate, he won't survive
more than a month.

303
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,028
The patient can't come here.

304
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,308
Are you saying that this is...?

305
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,801
That's right.
That's the heart of Kim Il-sung.

306
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:30,613
I said I can't tell you the reason.

307
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:32,105
I'm getting married in a few days.

308
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:34,341
How can you expect me to take care
of Hoon all of a sudden?

309
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:38,154
I know it's not an easy thing.
But he is your son, too!

310
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,047
I want to forget everything
that's related to you.

311
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:42,349
-That includes both you and Hoon.
-Honey...

312
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,092
I'm so sick of everything!
Please don't call me ever again.

313
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:51,692
Can you take care of him for a week?
Then his mom will come to pick him up.

314
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:53,794
What's going on, Dr Park?

315
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:58,398
Let me tell you everything later.
Please take good care of Hoon.

316
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,975
Don't worry too much, Dr Park.

317
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:15,282
I'll make sure to have them return
to South Korea.

318
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,632
Liar. Make sure?

319
00:25:32,486 --> 00:25:33,509
Sure what?

320
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,414
Congressman Jang and I tried our best
to ensure your safe return.

321
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:40,641
You told them to kill us.

322
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,142
What do you mean?

323
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:43,911
Tell them to kill you?

324
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,355
Stop pretending.
I heard it with my own ears.

325
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:49,092
The North Koreans probably lied to you.
That's impossible.

326
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:50,551
Stop talking nonsense!

327
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:57,958
You can decide
whether to believe me or not.

328
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:03,363
But someone had to go.
If not, a war would have broken out.

329
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,768
He went to save a patient as a doctor.

330
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:10,604
And you used my father like that.

331
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,608
You sent me and my father
because of your greed.

332
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:18,178
Then, you abandoned us.

333
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,315
Do you know...

334
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:27,621
...what we had to go through
in that weird society?

335
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,991
Still, your father made you a doctor.

336
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:32,180
A doctor?

337
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:39,175
Do you think I'm a doctor?

338
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,167
Hoon...

339
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:44,838
Fine.

340
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:48,542
My father wanted to make me a doctor.

341
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:52,379
He said a doctor would never kill anyone.

342
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,381
But that wasn't the case.

343
00:26:57,692 --> 00:27:02,697
In North Korea, doctors kill people, too.

344
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,898
I... I killed a lot of people.
So many people...

345
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,035
That's not a doctor.

346
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:20,107
That's a mad dog that cuts people open
because he was ordered to.

347
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:23,243
Yes.

348
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:29,516
I understand why you think like that.

349
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:34,297
But you're a doctor,
no matter what anyone says!

350
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,266
If you can understand at least
a bit of your father's intention...

351
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:38,225
Be quiet!

352
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:44,498
How do you know my father's intention?

353
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:55,142
My father took bullets, so he can turn
this mad dog into a proper doctor.

354
00:27:58,312 --> 00:28:00,948
How do you understand that?

355
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:07,788
And how do you understand me
who abandoned his father and ran away?

356
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,416
Just go.

357
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:35,582
I couldn't find Professor Park's body.

358
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:09,231
Hoon!

359
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:12,586
Hoon...

360
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,076
Dad...

361
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,984
Thanks for bringing me his belongings.

362
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:19,746
But I want you to stay out
of this entirely.

363
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:21,048
Hoon...

364
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:26,086
So what happened to these people?

365
00:31:26,854 --> 00:31:30,991
The wife followed her husband
shortly after he died.

366
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,603
They had a boy...

367
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:35,462
But he became an orphan
because of you.

368
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:40,000
I heard he was adopted
by an American family.

369
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:45,839
I want to go look for him
after I bring Jae-hee back.

370
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:47,774
I'll find Jae-hee on my own.

371
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,478
So you should go find that guy
and apologize to him.

372
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:53,046
Hoon...

373
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:55,324
I mean you should go to America,
not North Korea.

374
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,144
And stop getting involved in my business.

375
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,347
Jae-joon!

376
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,561
What are you doing here?

377
00:32:31,652 --> 00:32:33,830
My father wanted to see me.

378
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:34,772
You too?

379
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,126
I guess he wants to tell us something.

380
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,826
Jae-joon.

381
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,562
Yeah?

382
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:25,906
What's up?

383
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:28,075
Stay still.

384
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:51,665
We're here.

385
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:57,304
Do you believe in destiny?

386
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:58,327
Destiny?

387
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,375
Do you believe such a thing?

388
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:03,544
Right?

389
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:21,228
I think you know why I asked
to see you both.

390
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:24,398
That's right.

391
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,067
I think it's about time to think
about marriage.

392
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:31,805
You believe in destiny, right?

393
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:34,842
Destiny? What are you talking about?

394
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,411
You said you felt it when you saw Mom
for the first time.

395
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:47,187
I truly appreciate
that you're worried about us.

396
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:50,891
But I believe the marriage should be
decided by Soo-hyun and me.

397
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,628
Are there any problems between you two?

398
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,767
No, I like Jae-joon.
And he likes me, too, right?

399
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:05,405
But I'd need some more time
to think about marriage.

400
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:13,714
Yes?

401
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:16,088
I understand.

402
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:19,777
-Do you mind if i leave first?
-Go ahead.

403
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:35,032
Going back to the hospital?

404
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:36,770
Yes.

405
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:40,040
-Do you want a ride?
-And leave my father alone?

406
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:49,423
Soo-hyun, the destiny that I know isn't
something that you believe in or not.

407
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:56,623
I believe such thing is something
man can make.

408
00:35:58,049 --> 00:35:59,293
That's very much like you.

409
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:02,376
I'll see you later.

410
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:08,758
LOBBY

411
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:55,024
You must be out of your mind!

412
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,461
You'll marry Soo-hyun, right?

413
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,064
-Of course, sir.
-Be responsible for Myung-woo, too.

414
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,902
Be responsible for everything I have.

415
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:31,818
Hi, Jae-joon.

416
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:34,221
Weren't you going to the hospital?

417
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:36,390
I'm sorry. I had to make a quick stop.

418
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:39,426
If you don't hurry, someone else
will take the place!

419
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:40,360
Okay.

420
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:42,196
Are you at the hospital?

421
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,131
Yes.

422
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:45,899
Are you coming?

423
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,303
No, I am going home. Why?

424
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:52,206
Since you left all of a sudden,
I miss you.

425
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,251
I also need to talk to you
about our surgery team.

426
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:57,177
Let's talk about it tomorrow, okay?

427
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,080
Sure. Get home safely.

428
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:22,469
Mother. Father. I'm almost there.

429
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,641
Please wait a bit longer.

430
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:40,988
Dr Han! I'm begging you!

431
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:53,233
Please forgive us, Dr Han!

432
00:38:53,324 --> 00:38:56,236
I told you that I won't report it!

433
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,606
And I am grateful to you for that.

434
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:01,551
But the forgiveness that I'm asking for

435
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:03,377
can only be achieved
when you join my team!

436
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:05,354
I just don't want to make
any more trouble.

437
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:07,314
But I've never forgiven your action.

438
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:09,783
-Dr Han!
-I'm sorry.

439
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:11,685
I guess there will be times when I'm in

440
00:39:11,776 --> 00:39:13,996
the same operating room
with you or Dr Park.

441
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:17,238
But I'm not interested
in joining your team.

442
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:21,528
Dr Han!

443
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,899
Are you really going to ignore me
like this?

444
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,836
I really need you, Dr Han!

445
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,040
-Dr Han!
-Stop, stop.

446
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:35,409
-What is it?
-Don't you think you're too harsh?

447
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,370
What is it?

448
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:40,447
You're a married man, and she's
young enough to be your daughter!

449
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:41,958
Aren't you ashamed doing this in public?

450
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,084
Why?

451
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,153
If I'm old and married,
I'm not allowed to confess my love?

452
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:47,521
Mind your own business.

453
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:51,158
-Dr Han!
-I guess he can.

454
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:55,395
Well, that's good.
I guess the team is over now.

455
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:57,164
It's far from being over!

456
00:39:57,255 --> 00:40:00,501
How can we form a cardiac surgery team
without a good anesthesiologist?

457
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:02,870
You should at least
make a partial payment.

458
00:40:02,961 --> 00:40:04,505
It's been overdue for more than a week.

459
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:06,173
I'm sorry.

460
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:10,210
I'm trying to get money.
So please give me some more time.

461
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:12,779
I wish I could, but...

462
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,858
I'm so sorry, nurse. I'm sorry.

463
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,317
Being sick isn't a sin.

464
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,513
You should stop apologizing.

465
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:22,422
Let's go. I'll change your bandage.

466
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:32,132
Come with me. Master!

467
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:39,706
It's hard being a parent
when you don't have money.

468
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:47,414
Can you give me the blood test results
for Mr Son in room 1102?

469
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,821
Your twins are sick?

470
00:40:55,155 --> 00:40:56,323
Yes, doctor.

471
00:40:57,724 --> 00:41:00,060
But because of the hospital bill...

472
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:03,630
I'll go take a look at them.
So you should stay here and rest.

473
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:05,666
This isn't that urgent!

474
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:07,568
The team selection deadline
is approaching.

475
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,004
What's more urgent than taking care
of a patient to a doctor?

476
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:12,039
I'm a patient, too!

477
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,075
My heart skips a beat because of you guys!

478
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,847
The mother has to be healthy
to take care of the children!

479
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:20,948
Hey!

480
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,420
Why are you so hung up on this whole
surgery team business?

481
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:31,291
I want to beat Han Jae-joon
and take the chief title.

482
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,794
What's so important about the title?

483
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:36,005
It's very important. You don't know?

484
00:41:36,096 --> 00:41:39,666
The head of this hospital is only picked
from former heads of cardiology!

485
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:43,904
The Chairman and Byeong-cheol
were both heads of cardiology.

486
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,508
My master has a lot
of money and doesn't lack anything.

487
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,076
And you want it that much?

488
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:50,277
That's my dream.

489
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:52,012
Why? Problem?

490
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:54,648
-How can such a thing be your dream?
-It can be.

491
00:41:56,283 --> 00:42:01,021
My father was a pharmaceutical salesman
for 30 years.

492
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:06,493
His back was always bent at 90 degrees
when he was in front of doctors.

493
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:12,699
Do you know what he told me
on his deathbed?

494
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,931
"Hyung-wook..."

495
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:20,274
"...you must become the head
of a hospital!"

496
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:22,976
"And then..."

497
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:29,917
"...have all your doctors
bow to my grave at 90 degrees!"

498
00:42:31,618 --> 00:42:32,719
That's what my father said.

499
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,408
-That can't be your only reason.
-Of course!

500
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:47,367
Do you know how much money
I'll get to control?

501
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,269
No, no, no...

502
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,939
I said it was my father's last wish!

503
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:53,841
I'm at your service, Master.

504
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,143
Then we should seek
another anesthesiologist.

505
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:57,177
I don't want anyone else.

506
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:00,781
I only want the best!

507
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:04,155
You'll be the main surgeon,
and Han Seung-hee my anesthesiologist.

508
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:07,087
Why are you so insistent
on being the best?

509
00:43:07,178 --> 00:43:08,589
Who is the team for?

510
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,959
Prime Minister Jang Seok-joo.

511
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:16,530
-Who did you say?
-Prime Minister Jang.

512
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,668
Yes, it's for that Jang Seok-joo.

513
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:45,893
This is great.

514
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:58,071
I want to meet them.

515
00:43:58,605 --> 00:43:59,640
You mean in person?

516
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:04,720
There are eyes everywhere.
It could be dangerous.

517
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:08,691
They're the one who will decide
my political career and my life.

518
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,318
I think I can risk at least
that much danger.

519
00:44:22,563 --> 00:44:27,835
I heard there is a joke that's been
going around among cardiologists.

520
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:34,007
"There won't be any cardiologist left
by the time we retire."

521
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:38,221
"So if you ever have a heart problem,"

522
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:41,782
"just jump off a bridge
over the Han River."

523
00:44:44,384 --> 00:44:47,387
No, this isn't something
we should laugh at.

524
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:53,393
If there are less cardiologists,
the citizens of Korea will suffer.

525
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,129
Is the president aware of this event?

526
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,231
Of course.

527
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:02,970
The president is quite curious
about who will fix my heart.

528
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:04,872
Do you have a hospital in mind?

529
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:11,954
We've narrowed it down to Jae-il Hospital,
Dong-hoon Hospital,

530
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:17,317
Min-kook Hospital, and Myung-woo Hospital.

531
00:45:23,023 --> 00:45:25,388
What would be the criteria
for the final selection?

532
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,396
The hospital's financial health
and its dedication to public service,

533
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:31,698
along with the patient's satisfaction.

534
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:34,067
This team will operate
on the prime Minister's heart.

535
00:45:35,335 --> 00:45:39,549
In the end, the hospital with the best
surgical team will be chosen.

536
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,509
The chosen hospital will receive
10 million USD in research grants,

537
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,745
Fifteen million USD for the promotion
of lesser known fields.

538
00:45:44,836 --> 00:45:47,514
The economic benefit will be
more than 100 million USD

539
00:45:47,605 --> 00:45:49,550
if we include the PR we'll get.

540
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:53,663
This is another chance for us
to take a great leap.

541
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:56,899
I look forward to your full cooperation
for this project.

542
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,092
Is Dr Han's team
going to represent our hospital?

543
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:00,036
No.

544
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:01,795
There are two teams competing
against each other.

545
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:04,565
Two teams?

546
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:08,869
Yes, the first team
will be Dr Han Jae-joon's team.

547
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:16,677
Irrigation.

548
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:20,514
Suction.

549
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,789
Everyone thinks that we'll be
the Prime Minister's surgery team,

550
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,390
so they are getting
some photos in advance.

551
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:32,759
Then you should smile at the camera.

552
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,506
How can we smile if we're wearing masks?

553
00:46:35,596 --> 00:46:37,173
Then why don't you wave your hand?

554
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:40,734
Is there a team other than
Dr Han's in cardiology?

555
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,569
Dr Park Hoon has another team.

556
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,542
But father, he's a North Korean refugee!

557
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:51,378
What matters is the doctor's ability,
not where he's from.

558
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,517
Anyone can represent this hospital
as long as that person is skilled!

559
00:46:57,618 --> 00:47:00,454
Representing Myung-woo? Don't be absurd.

560
00:47:02,523 --> 00:47:04,967
You of all people, you can't tell me this.

561
00:47:05,058 --> 00:47:06,760
Operating on the Prime Minister
means that...

562
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:10,130
...everyone will acknowledge you
as the best cardiologist in the country!

563
00:47:10,221 --> 00:47:13,145
-What are you hiding this time?
-Hoon!

564
00:47:13,236 --> 00:47:16,603
Otherwise, how can you possibly expect me
to operate on him?

565
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:24,111
Do you know what my father and I
had to go through because of him?

566
00:47:25,078 --> 00:47:27,381
If anything, I'd like to kill him,
let alone operate on him.

567
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:31,218
Your father
even saved Kim Il-sung's heart.

568
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:32,619
But I'm not my father.

569
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,854
But you're also a doctor!

570
00:47:33,945 --> 00:47:37,357
Things like that mean nothing to me!

571
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:41,929
Hoon!

572
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:47,659
Hoon!

573
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:52,782
I can't do it.

574
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:55,342
I can't even pretend to be a doctor
in front of someone like him.

575
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,982
Hey, Park Hoon!

576
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:15,395
What is this?

577
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:16,964
Throwing in my towel.

578
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:20,567
We haven't even begun.
Are you surrendering already?

579
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:21,835
Is that against the rule?

580
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:26,673
Competition between doctors
who're supposed to save patients?

581
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,619
Hideous.
It's not like we're warriors with swords.

582
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,521
That's why I'm not going to do it.

583
00:48:31,612 --> 00:48:33,413
But I've been secretly excited
for this match.

584
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:38,385
What would happen if I go against
the famous Dr Park?

585
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:42,856
I'm very sorry for disappointing you.

586
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:50,264
You're not doing this
because you're afraid to lose, are you?

587
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:54,067
You can think whatever you want. You won.

588
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:55,235
So long.

589
00:48:56,737 --> 00:48:58,839
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

590
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:04,444
Dr Han, this isn't over.
We're not surrendering yet!

591
00:49:06,346 --> 00:49:07,414
Hey, Hoon!

592
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:25,732
-Is she okay?
-I got her. Go to Room 1129.

593
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:40,123
Please calm down.

594
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:42,169
Would you please put that down?

595
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,853
We'll die anyway once we get kicked out
of this hospital!

596
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:48,698
-We have social workers. Once you...
-It's useless.

597
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:51,701
-Ma'am!
-Doctor! Don't come near me.

598
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:53,485
I'm leaving with my kids.

599
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,097
What happened?

600
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,773
-Both of the twins have defective hearts.
-What?

601
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:07,283
Why did you put yourself out there
in danger?

602
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:08,384
I'm sorry.

603
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:09,743
But the babies...

604
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:13,113
If something happens to you,
who will take care of our baby?

605
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,651
Let me see the charts of the twins.

606
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:19,086
On that monitor.

607
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:26,527
She would've found out if she had gotten
a sonogram during pregnancy.

608
00:50:26,618 --> 00:50:28,063
She didn't have the money for it.

609
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,574
The arteries are already too narrow.
And they have atrial septal defect.

610
00:50:31,665 --> 00:50:34,168
Atrial septal defect is a deadly condition
for infants.

611
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,172
She spent most of her career
in operating rooms.

612
00:50:39,573 --> 00:50:40,950
Please get an operating room ready.

613
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,209
What operating room?

614
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:50,017
Good to see you, Director Choi.

615
00:50:50,108 --> 00:50:51,318
Why did you want to see me?

616
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,521
Have all department heads
come to the main entrance.

617
00:50:54,612 --> 00:50:55,455
Yes, sir.

618
00:50:55,546 --> 00:50:57,300
Is there someone very important coming?

619
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:59,092
Let's go. You know him well, too.

620
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,236
You want to abandon a patient?

621
00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:10,838
You already spent several thousand USD
on the cardiac surgery and C-section.

622
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:12,372
We've tried our best.

623
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:14,016
But the babies are sick.

624
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:16,719
The surgery per baby will cost USD 30,000.
USD 60,000 for both.

625
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,155
-Will you pay for them?
-Still, you're kicking them out?

626
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:20,948
No one's kicking them out.

627
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:23,617
We'll just hand them to the police.
Or something like that.

628
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:25,461
Police?

629
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:27,187
I heard there is a hostage situation.

630
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:29,318
Were you injured from it?

631
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:32,593
Isn't this perfect?

632
00:51:32,684 --> 00:51:35,329
We can get them out,
and the police will take care of the rest.

633
00:51:39,466 --> 00:51:40,501
What's going on?

634
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:13,200
It's been a while.

635
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:24,745
What should we do, doctor?
The baby stopped moving.

636
00:52:25,718 --> 00:52:26,756
Let me see your babies.

637
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:29,492
Don't come any closer!
We're dying together!

638
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:30,651
Nobody's dying here today!

639
00:52:34,855 --> 00:52:35,889
He's not breathing.

640
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,193
-Bring me the intubation set.
-Yes, doctor.

641
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:44,240
-Don't let him in here.
-Why?

642
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,620
He's calling the police!
These babies will be kicked out!

643
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:57,425
-Step aside!
-He's seeing a patient.

644
00:52:57,516 --> 00:52:59,780
-This is a hostage situation.
-I said he's seeing a patient!

645
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:01,396
Are you kidding? Start moving!

646
00:53:03,025 --> 00:53:04,251
I'm Oh Soo-hyun.

647
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:07,894
Take another step from where you are,
I'll make sure that you pay for it.

648
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:21,201
There's no pulse.
We should get him to the NICU.

649
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:57,898
You need to be with your mom.

650
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:39,030
Now you look like a doctor...

651
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,201
...Dr Park Hoon.

652
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:54,688
Who do you think you are?
Enough with your tantrums!

653
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:58,701
Step aside!

654
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,027
What are you doing right now?

655
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:01,995
Move the babies to the NICU.

656
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:03,497
Get going!

657
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:13,015
Let's talk, Dr Park.

658
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:15,642
It will have to be later.
I need to be somewhere right now.

659
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,835
Did you say Dr Park forfeited?

660
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:35,529
Yes, he said so earlier.

661
00:56:36,864 --> 00:56:38,065
It doesn't matter.

662
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,167
We still have Dr Han Jae-joon here.

663
00:56:43,303 --> 00:56:45,138
That's true...

664
00:56:45,229 --> 00:56:48,141
Let go of me!

665
00:56:48,232 --> 00:56:49,476
You can't be in here!

666
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,762
It's fine.

667
00:57:00,954 --> 00:57:02,356
Dr Park Hoon?

668
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:08,871
What do you want?

669
00:57:08,962 --> 00:57:10,364
I need to get something back.

670
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:18,472
I thought you gave up?

671
00:57:19,306 --> 00:57:20,541
I'll compete under one condition.

672
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:24,378
A condition?

673
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:29,917
The cost of this competition
will be paid for by the hospital.

674
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:35,255
Is that the only condition?

675
00:57:35,346 --> 00:57:37,257
Then I'll assume that it's been accepted.

676
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,994
I'll look forward to your performance.

677
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:20,209
DOCTOR STRANGER

678
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,211
You don't need to drag this out.
One surgery is enough.

679
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:24,638
Now I want to win this competition
or something.

680
00:58:24,729 --> 00:58:27,650
You may never see your girlfriend
ever again.

681
00:58:27,741 --> 00:58:30,077
You, me and him... all of us will die.

682
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:31,945
Han Jae-joon won't be the worst choice.

683
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:34,190
You need to get onto Han Jae-joon's team.

684
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,392
Dr Park will never beat Dr Han.

685
00:58:36,483 --> 00:58:37,351
Are you jealous?

686
00:58:37,442 --> 00:58:39,445
It seems to me
that you're enjoying it a lot.

687
00:58:39,536 --> 00:58:41,455
-Help me.
-Don't you know I'm in Dr Han's team?

688
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:42,823
You want to take over the castle?

689
00:58:42,914 --> 00:58:44,858
Then, get rid of the stranger
who entered the castle.

690
00:58:44,949 --> 00:58:46,426
The stakes are high for this competition.

691
00:58:46,517 --> 00:58:48,795
What's more important than the babies?
