1
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,562
There should be no room for mercy.

2
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,798
The principle of life dictates the strong
to trample on the weak

3
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,201
at every moment possible.

4
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:47,948
Because he didn't know that,
my dear president is lying here like this!

5
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,590
Listen!

6
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,054
You should've finished me
when you found out

7
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:57,224
about my illegal campaign fund
for the primary race.

8
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,560
Did you think that
I'll be dragged around by you,

9
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,094
doing everything you tell me to...

10
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:05,399
If you put a stupid dog collar
on my neck like that?

11
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,602
Nonsense, dude.

12
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:22,115
There'll be a presidential election soon.

13
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,952
Get some rest until then.

14
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:30,591
Once I hold the North and South Summit
and excite the ignorant electorate.

15
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:37,364
Then, I'll let you rest
in peace forever, okay?

16
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,476
EPISODE 20

17
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,546
Thank you for your very nice speech,
Mr Prime Minister.

18
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,483
You deceived me?

19
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,519
Your conspiracy is over.

20
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,694
All you need to do is manipulate the BIS
after the surgery.

21
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,071
And then?

22
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,133
Jang Seok-joo will spill everything
believing that he has achieved his goal.

23
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,811
There's no one here
from the President's security team.

24
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,280
Only my guys.

25
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,550
Geez...

26
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,752
Take those two away!

27
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,826
Even if you die right now,
I'll still have 60 days to rule!

28
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,730
What are you doing?

29
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,733
Can't you hear me?

30
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,502
Take them away!

31
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,739
Mr Prime Minister, you should stop.

32
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,710
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,128
You too?

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,948
Mr Prime Minister,

35
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,353
let's end this quietly.

36
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,656
What does it mean to be a politician?

37
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,260
There's neither an eternal enemy

38
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,596
nor an eternal ally.

39
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:58,205
If you stop here,
this will stay only between you and me.

40
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:04,578
I'll not hold you responsible
for this incident.

41
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,985
Are you negotiating with me?

42
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,655
That's right, I'm negotiating.

43
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,392
I'll forgive everything.

44
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:24,831
I'll also let you keep your position
as prime minister.

45
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,471
I'll not trample you to death.

46
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,632
Instead,

47
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:37,311
even though it might be a stupid dog
collar around your neck,

48
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:40,147
you will do everything I tell you to,

49
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,984
"Yes, sir."

50
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:48,121
"Yes, I'll do anything you want."

51
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,825
As I drag you around as I please.

52
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,763
What are you doing?

53
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,534
He just tried to kill you, Mr President.

54
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,470
Stay out of this, Dr Park.

55
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,274
If you let him slide this time,
he might try the same thing in the future.

56
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,178
I said you should stay out of this.

57
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,513
Mr President.

58
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,056
Getting rewarded for bad things,

59
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,492
and getting punished for good things.

60
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,427
That is politics.

61
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:28,896
Don't you agree,

62
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,534
Prime Minister Jang?

63
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,206
Okay.

64
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,276
I'll make sure all the congressmen
under me

65
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,180
will only follow your orders from now on.

66
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,176
But,

67
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,385
I also have a condition.

68
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,020
Go ahead and tell me.

69
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:05,265
He must continue to serve you
in the future.

70
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,840
Okay.

71
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:12,094
I guess I can deal with one spy from you.

72
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:16,343
But you must grant my second wish.

73
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,581
These two people...

74
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,518
I want them.

75
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,693
They're yours.

76
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,961
Mr President!

77
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,395
This is different from what you promised!

78
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,465
Nothing serious will happen.

79
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,935
Right, Mr Prime Minister?

80
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,271
Of course not, Mr President.

81
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,573
Mr President!

82
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,642
You can't do this!

83
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:49,843
You promised me!

84
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,979
You promised to save our lives!

85
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,691
I guess we have a lot to talk about.

86
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,284
What happened?

87
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,820
Apparently the operating rooms are closed
until tomorrow morning.

88
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,323
-Why?
-The Prime Minister's orders.

89
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,158
They're not letting anyone in.

90
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,600
This can't be right.

91
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,634
This doesn't make any sense.

92
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,170
We shouldn't have trusted those people.

93
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,305
How could he flip his promise so easily?

94
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,373
We've been deceived.

95
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,010
He never intended to keep his promised.

96
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,379
He said he'll let us go in his own words.

97
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:38,352
Then let's hear
what you wanted to tell me before.

98
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,457
Is it perhaps related
to Prime Minister Jang?

99
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,560
Go ahead.

100
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,364
Prime Minister Jang
is trying to assassinate you.

101
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:55,169
To be exact, he's trying to put you
in a coma after the surgery.

102
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,071
He wants to be the acting president.

103
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,741
We'll testify.

104
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,710
He is the prime minister.

105
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,912
And he is out of my power

106
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,216
because he already has built
enough support within the party.

107
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,853
A testimony from a couple of doctors
won't do anything.

108
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,556
Then would you do as we tell you to?

109
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:16,924
What do you mean by "we"?

110
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,659
It'd be me and the anesthesiologist.

111
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,929
And one of Jang's men
has agreed to help us.

112
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,098
Even one of Jang's men?

113
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,205
In return, you must guarantee our safety.

114
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,542
Mr President.

115
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,012
I understood.

116
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,317
That's what he told me.

117
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,314
He agreed.

118
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,753
He agreed to guarantee our safety.

119
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,324
I'm sorry, Hoon.

120
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,535
I'm so regretful.

121
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,829
Only if I hadn't made
that choice back then.

122
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,908
All of this started
when I grabbed Cha Jin-soo's hand.

123
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:12,446
It started from my desire
to see you again but...

124
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,751
I never expected it
to cause this disaster for us.

125
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,087
It's not your fault.

126
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:21,622
If I could go back,

127
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,824
If only I could go back,

128
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,528
I would've just buried you in my heart.

129
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,164
Then none of this would've happened.

130
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,104
It's not over yet.

131
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,707
However, what can we do now?

132
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,117
Don't even think about it.

133
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:55,822
I saw you taking down many
of my men by yourself.

134
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,124
But what would you do

135
00:10:57,191 --> 00:11:01,528
if a bullet goes through
your lover's head during our dogfight?

136
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,138
When coincidences repeat, it's destiny.

137
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,807
Coincidentally, you're alive

138
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:17,578
even though I asked them
to kill you 20 years ago.

139
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:18,988
Coincidentally, you're alive

140
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,549
even though I locked
the embassy gate in Hungary.

141
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,352
Was it you who did those things, too?

142
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:26,376
Yes.

143
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:32,092
So I thought I should work with you two.

144
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,928
This is not just another coincidence
but a destiny.

145
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,999
Destiny, whatever.

146
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,637
I can only laugh at myself.

147
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,740
This feeling of seeing everything
that I've worked for turning into ashes.

148
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,911
The last time I felt like this
was two years ago

149
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,346
when I lost the primary race.

150
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:54,715
I just can't get used to it.

151
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,786
Did you expect
the President to be any different?

152
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:04,191
Did you expect him to do
everything you ask him?

153
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,296
You would've been better off
asking for mercy from me.

154
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,866
You should've done as I told you
so I could've become president.

155
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:17,437
Once I hold the head of this country,

156
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:24,211
that's when you should've begged me
to save your miserable lives.

157
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,981
That would've been a smarter choice.

158
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,618
You wouldn't have saved us anyway.

159
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,287
Probably not.

160
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,390
Shall we go?

161
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,392
There are a lot of eyes watching here.

162
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,027
It's also a hospital.

163
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,162
A hospital that saves people's lives.

164
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:48,769
When you follow me, don't say a word.

165
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:52,272
Otherwise, your mom will go before you do.

166
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,116
What is it?

167
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,994
You can go first.

168
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,413
Mr Prime Minister!

169
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,241
He's still alive.

170
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,326
Bring a stretcher
and an intubation set, quickly.

171
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,295
Yes, sir.

172
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,914
How's he doing?

173
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,016
He's in critical condition.

174
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,326
Yes, sir.

175
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,346
Yes, sir.

176
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,379
What are you doing here?

177
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,248
Have you seen Hoon?

178
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,482
The Water Bottle? Why?

179
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,417
He's not answering his phone.

180
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:21,655
You should call someone like me instead,
who will always pick up your phone.

181
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,224
I'm always here standing by for you.

182
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,426
I can't reach Hoon,

183
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,830
and his mom just disappeared.

184
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:31,965
What should I do?

185
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,901
Really?

186
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,903
What should I do?

187
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,105
Don't worry. I'll look for him with you.

188
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,974
Give Dr Oh a call. I'll look for him.

189
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:48,749
Have you seen Water Bottle?

190
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,350
Dr Park? I haven't seen him.

191
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,253
Didn't you go to the ICU
with him after the surgery?

192
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,989
I couldn't even dare to go in there
because of the security!

193
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,124
It's not only there.

194
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,993
There are 007s all over
in the operations center.

195
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,795
-The operations center too?
-Yes.

196
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:05,766
So they're rerouting all patients to
the operating center in the new building.

197
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,069
Yesterday and today...
What's wrong with here?

198
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:25,261
What are you doing?

199
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,261
Hoon...

200
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,058
This man is in critical condition.

201
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,693
Yes, that's why we must
bring him in quickly...

202
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,727
Listen!

203
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,364
We'll be in danger once this man wakes up.

204
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,565
What do you mean?

205
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,040
Stop doing that.

206
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,009
-What?
-Hoon...

207
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,513
Not only we'll be in danger,
but your mom will also be in danger!

208
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:56,149
He's still breathing. He's still alive.

209
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,552
He was going to get
a heart surgery anyway.

210
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,220
He was shot in the chest.

211
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,556
No one would be suspicious
if he dies right now.

212
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:07,094
All you need to do is stop doing that
and wait for a while before we go in.

213
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,063
Then we can say he died during surgery...

214
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,098
I can't do it.

215
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,566
Look at him!

216
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:16,837
He's Jang Seok-joo! Not anyone else!

217
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,006
He tried to kill you and your parents.

218
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,408
And he turned your mother into a madwoman!

219
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,344
-However...
-Ignore him just once.

220
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,713
All you need to do is stop it.

221
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,516
Then everything will be over.

222
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,027
What are you doing?

223
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,129
-Let go.
-I won't.

224
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:43,096
Why not?

225
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:46,400
You cut open my father
and took his kidney out for me.

226
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,970
That will be the scar
of our lives forever.

227
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,339
You said it was to save me.

228
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,302
Then stop it to save me again.

229
00:17:55,676 --> 00:18:00,013
No, let them go to save
you and your mother!

230
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,050
Hoon, please.

231
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:07,287
If it wasn't for this man,
we wouldn't have lived such tragic lives.

232
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,225
Yes, if only the embassy's gate had
opened back then...

233
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,994
We would be living normal lives just like
the people outside of this hospital.

234
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,698
We'd be living just as your father wished.

235
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,499
That's why I can't let my hands go.

236
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,469
Do you know why my father died?

237
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,939
Yes, he wanted me
to live happily with you.

238
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,244
But he also didn't want me to be
a mad dog of Cha Jin-soo anymore.

239
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:35,382
He took bullets so I'll grab
my scalpel only to save lives.

240
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,951
So how could I do it again?

241
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:40,554
He's Jang Seok-joo! He's different!

242
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,955
He's just a patient like others to me.

243
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:42,956
Hoon...

244
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:46,193
You know better than anyone
why I became a doctor.

245
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,794
To take care of sick people.

246
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,463
Nothing more, nothing less.

247
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,100
The thing that my father and I wanted
was just treating people.

248
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,601
That's it.

249
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,233
I beg you.

250
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:04,344
After seeing you again,
I really didn't want to return to my past.

251
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,682
No matter what you tell me,
I want to keep my principles.

252
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,851
What I thought initially,

253
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,286
what my father told me...

254
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,988
If I don't save this man right now,

255
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:18,158
I'll ruin all the principles that I've
been trying to keep since I met you.

256
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:24,198
My father's wish that he burdened me
with by throwing away his life...

257
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,500
I'll be ruining all that.

258
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:35,809
Look.

259
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:37,845
It's still beating.

260
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,486
It's the same heart.

261
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:51,658
The same heart as the hearts
of the patients we've saved so far.

262
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,361
This isn't different.

263
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,130
Let's go, Jae-hee.

264
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,566
Please.

265
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,984
Please call Dr Oh of cardiology
and nurse Min Soo-ji.

266
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:51,989
Hurry up.

267
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:12,005
What are you doing?

268
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:13,574
Is he still alive?

269
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,409
Of course he is.

270
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,812
No one will hold you responsible
even if he dies.

271
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:20,180
What?

272
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,849
How's he doing?

273
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,117
He's in critical condition.

274
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:27,321
I think Dr Park Hoon should operate on him.

275
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:33,493
He was going to operate
on his heart anyway.

276
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,929
It also seemed like

277
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,766
they're very close to each other.

278
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:41,768
Just as you heard.

279
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:45,539
You have the permission
to have a table death in this room.

280
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,010
Nothing good will happen
to you once he wakes up.

281
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:54,181
But if the opposite occurs,
you two are free.

282
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,216
Just as you wanted from the beginning.

283
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:00,287
If you just say there wasn't
anything you could do,

284
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,891
everything will be over.

285
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,731
My master once told me something.

286
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,433
The only thing policemen should
be good at is catching criminals.

287
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,335
And the only thing doctors should
be good at is treating patients.

288
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:20,507
I'm sorry, but I'm going to do just that.
Nothing more, nothing less.

289
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,913
I guess you've done a lot of bad things.

290
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:29,116
How can there be not a single person
who wants me to save your life?

291
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,154
It'll be just you two.

292
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,390
Are you still going to do it?

293
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,682
Just don't interrupt.

294
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,940
If the Prime Minister lives,
all of us will be in danger.

295
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,108
I'll drag Park Hoon out.

296
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:57,377
Just let him do it.

297
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,314
Mr. Kim...

298
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,183
Right now,

299
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:08,021
I just want to watch the choice
made by that man.

300
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,095
So, the surgery has begun?

301
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,464
Yes, sir.

302
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,587
Two near pulmonary artery,
and one in interatrial septum.

303
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:41,731
Three in total.

304
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:42,990
One in interatrial septum?

305
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,325
That's going to be tricky.

306
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:57,971
Unbelievable.

307
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,574
Now I understand how he could make
the Saver procedure successful.

308
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:23,997
I think the Prime Minister
is going to make it.

309
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,716
Now we have the trickiest one left.

310
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:24,758
It seems like every one of us
is on Park Hoon's side now.

311
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,428
What do you mean?

312
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:32,032
All of us wanted the table death,

313
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:35,936
but now we're glad that
the surgery is successful.

314
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,137
Am I?

315
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:08,135
Mr Prime Minister!

316
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,103
Hurry up and bring him to the ICU!

317
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,038
Yes, sir!

318
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,586
You saved Jang Seok-joo
who was almost dead.

319
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:29,523
Now that the flame of power
is alive again,

320
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:32,125
moths will naturally gather.

321
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,465
Those moths will come after you soon.

322
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:44,738
There's a car waiting for you
across the bridge behind this hospital.

323
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,446
There'll be money and provisions
that'll help you to hide away for a while.

324
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,848
Try to go as far away from Seoul
as possible.

325
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,551
Once your passports are ready,

326
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,087
I'll call you.

327
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:01,822
What about my mother?

328
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:02,990
Trust me.

329
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,858
I'll make sure

330
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,328
to hide her in a safe place.

331
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,496
Yes, I'm at the operations center
in the new building.

332
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:43,897
Who?

333
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:46,366
Chang-yi?

334
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,469
Tell her to wait in my room.

335
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:53,173
Jae-hee didn't come from Japan?

336
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,442
Hoon told me not to say it

337
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:58,979
but I can't reach Hoon and his mother
has disappeared.

338
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:00,547
I'm very worried.

339
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:03,684
It's my first time hearing
about Dr Park's mother.

340
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:04,952
What can I do, doctor?

341
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,222
What if something happened to Hoon?

342
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:11,558
KIM CHI-GYU

343
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:15,905
Yes, Dr Kim.

344
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:18,398
Did something happen
at the operations center today?

345
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:21,975
Yes, sir.

346
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,371
It's for the prime minister's surgery...

347
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:26,640
I heard he's in the ICU.

348
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:27,941
Then who performed the surgery?

349
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,443
I don't know.

350
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:30,677
But have you seen Dr Park?

351
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:32,713
I saw him going to the
back side of the hospital.

352
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,348
The back side?

353
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:57,104
You go first, Jae-hee.

354
00:28:57,538 --> 00:28:58,472
Why?

355
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:00,040
Hurry up.

356
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,245
Hoon...

357
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,573
Cha Jin-soo...

358
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:26,285
Go, now!

359
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:51,796
No!

360
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,180
Hello? Is it police?

361
00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:19,152
Hold on, Jae-hee...

362
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,464
Don't do it!

363
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:31,565
Don't do it, Song Jae-hee!

364
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:33,291
You should run, Hoon.

365
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:34,750
Don't do it, Song Jae-hee!

366
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,709
Love is good.

367
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:48,215
I believe I saw
something like this before.

368
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,251
Was it two years ago?

369
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:54,521
That's right.

370
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:56,723
Two years ago.

371
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:00,928
Jae-hee...

372
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:03,463
Hoon...

373
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:07,668
Right, there's one thing different.

374
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:10,070
I don't know whom it was back then...

375
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:15,442
But now you don't have anyone to help you.

376
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:18,946
Do you want to live?

377
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,384
Fine, why don't we do this?

378
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:28,188
I'll save you if you let that hand go.

379
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:29,523
You little crazy.

380
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,558
Yes, I must be crazy.

381
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:36,864
I'm willing to save one of you
while I still hate both of you.

382
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:39,967
Just kill me instead.

383
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:40,968
I will not.

384
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:44,938
You'll have to spend the rest of your life
with the pain of killing your woman.

385
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:47,674
That'll be more painful for you.

386
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:50,019
Right?

387
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,579
Hoon, let go of me. Now!

388
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:00,521
I'll count to three.

389
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:02,848
One...

390
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:03,891
Hoon!

391
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,727
Jae-hee...

392
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:09,596
Do you remember?

393
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:14,601
I said letting your hand go back then
has been the worst regret of my life.

394
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:16,637
Hoon...

395
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,951
I told you that I'll go wherever you go.

396
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,443
No, you can't!

397
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:25,199
Two!

398
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:27,681
You see the river, right?

399
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:32,619
Don't worry wherever it takes you.

400
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:34,007
Hoon...

401
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:38,759
Because I'll be right there with you.

402
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,095
Three!

403
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,089
Hoon!

404
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:54,274
Hoon!

405
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,206
Long live...

406
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:33,847
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

407
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:49,563
Hoon!

408
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,601
ONE YEAR LATER

409
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,971
Prime Minister Jang Seok-joo
has been arrested.

410
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:35,309
Prime Minister Jang has been imprisoned
today for receiving illegal donations

411
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,810
during his primary campaign.

412
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,645
This imprisonment reflects

413
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:42,516
the President's will not to tolerate
any form of corruption

414
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:46,220
among the holders of high public office.

415
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:54,962
They say clear water doesn't attract fish.

416
00:34:57,297 --> 00:35:01,134
If the fish doesn't like clear water,
they can leave.

417
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,239
You used to be more willing to tolerate,
forgive, and compromise.

418
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,941
It seems like you've changed
in this past year.

419
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:13,914
Apparently that guy said this.

420
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:16,884
The only thing policemen should
be good at is catching criminals.

421
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:20,954
And the only thing doctors should
be good at is treating patients.

422
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:28,295
After hearing that, I came to realize...

423
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,699
The only thing politicians should be good
at is governing without corruption.

424
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,712
The least you could do is say hello.

425
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,009
Hi.

426
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,718
I'm interviewing
for the manager position here.

427
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:52,968
How do I look?

428
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,155
Beautiful!

429
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:57,903
Right?

430
00:35:58,192 --> 00:35:59,893
I spent a lot of money on this.

431
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,970
No,

432
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:04,264
your perseverance that got you here
from being a part-time worker

433
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,532
is beautiful.

434
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,736
Your perspective on people
has changed a lot.

435
00:36:09,803 --> 00:36:14,174
I mean, your body is beautiful too.

436
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:18,946
Chang-yi!

437
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:21,648
You're great.

438
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,825
Pull gently.

439
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,497
I said pull gently!

440
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:39,766
I'm sorry, Dr Oh.

441
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,002
This is heart failure
and myocardial infarction.

442
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:43,504
This heart is as soft as tofu
because of septal rupture.

443
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,771
How can you pull so hard like that?

444
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:47,074
I'm sorry.

445
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,410
You'll also hear from me
if you don't do it right!

446
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:51,805
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:09,429
Do you know something, Dr Oh?

448
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:10,764
Know what?

449
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:12,366
About today's patient.

450
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:15,769
Of course I do.

451
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:20,107
Today's surgery was
the same surgery that Dr Park did

452
00:37:20,174 --> 00:37:21,875
when I first met him.

453
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:25,145
Septal rupture repair is done,
so you only have to do CABG.

454
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:28,715
I don't think this is something
you're capable of.

455
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:33,253
I really hated you back then.

456
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:35,622
I know.

457
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:40,260
It's time.

458
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,601
Right!

459
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:50,337
I heard Dr Keum is becoming
an assistant professor next month.

460
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:52,973
Also a father soon.

461
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,508
Really?

462
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:56,610
It only has been three months.

463
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,079
Congratulations.

464
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:13,760
Congratulations
on becoming a father, Dr Keum.

465
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:17,064
I was going to tell her.

466
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:18,899
But you told her already?

467
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:19,967
Sorry.

468
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:21,502
Congratulations anyways.

469
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:22,769
Thanks.

470
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:24,438
You should get married too, Dr Oh.

471
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:29,376
So, what are the symptoms of MS?

472
00:38:29,443 --> 00:38:30,978
Difficulty in breathing and...

473
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:33,380
My breathing gets difficult
when I look at you.

474
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:36,183
Atrial fibrillation, thrombosis,
hemoptysis, and possible stroke...

475
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,150
Do you understand me?

476
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:38,150
Hey.

477
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:40,120
Just knock it off and get on.

478
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:42,055
Study harder.

479
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:43,290
I'll ask you again!

480
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:44,858
I'm Kim Chi-gyu!

481
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,660
And don't cry!

482
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,161
Oh my...

483
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,030
You're too harsh on those kids.

484
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:52,533
Kids these days think of this hospital
as a playground.

485
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,734
They're exaggerating, aren't they?

486
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,702
You were just like that a year ago!

487
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:57,871
Bong-hyun, how could you say such...

488
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,751
You look so nervous, Dr Moon!

489
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:12,886
I've never been this nervous

490
00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:14,821
since my class president election
in elementary school!

491
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:16,723
Don't be so nervous.

492
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,426
All of the previous heads of this hospital
came from the cardiology department.

493
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:23,063
Dr. Hah of the orthopedics department
is a strong contender.

494
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,999
What do you want to do if you're
chosen as the head of this hospital?

495
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:27,467
You really don't know that?

496
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:30,838
I'll devote myself to this hospital!

497
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,613
I feel like we're missing something.

498
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,014
Missing what?

499
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:44,785
It's easier to notice
someone's empty space.

500
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,387
I guess there are some people

501
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:51,358
we would've preferred to have
in this elevator right now.

502
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:05,539
Hey, hang tight since we're almost there.

503
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:08,742
I got really gassy when I'm nervous.

504
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:11,011
Don't you think this is too much,
Dr Moon?

505
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:12,813
Way too much!

506
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,848
We're almost there!

507
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,584
Why is this thing not opening?

508
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:19,853
Let's give a round of applause

509
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,657
for the 16th head of Myung-woo Hospital!

510
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:39,106
Hello, I'm Moon Hyung-wook,
the new head of Myung-woo Hospital.

511
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:43,944
First, I'd like to thank the doctors
who've supported me all along.

512
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:47,181
I'd like to also thank
the former chairman Oh Joon-gyu,

513
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,650
and the current chairman Han Sang-dae.

514
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:55,522
I also thank Dr Park Doo-oh of Internal
Medicine who was always there for me...

515
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:59,226
And Dr Lim Sung-hoon of Endocrinology,

516
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,828
Dr. Sunwoo Jae-min of Neurosurgery,

517
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:05,766
Dr Yang Seok-cheon of Imaging Diagnosis,

518
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:10,470
Dr Yang Choon-man
of Rehabilitation Medicine,

519
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:12,773
Dr Kim Jae-man of Family Medicine,

520
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,309
Dr Park Sang-tae of Pathology,

521
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,744
Dr Han Bong-hee of Ophthalmology...

522
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:20,247
Are we sure that he's the right
person to lead this hospital?

523
00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:22,716
That's what I am saying.

524
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,351
Thank you very much!

525
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:36,230
What are you doing here?

526
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:39,433
I'm overcome with joy.

527
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:44,471
There's no reason to cry.

528
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:49,710
Park Hoon should be watching
from up there too, right?

529
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,550
He would've been so happy to find out that

530
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,219
I've become the head of this hospital.

531
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:19,039
PARK HOON

532
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:21,909
The name tag is still here.

533
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:26,847
I'll be sure to follow my father's will

534
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:33,887
and do my best to make this hospital
a great place.

535
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:56,243
Doctor.

536
00:42:58,178 --> 00:42:59,146
Chang-yi!

537
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:10,891
He must be in a nice place up there,
right?

538
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,162
He went with someone he loved.

539
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:22,169
How come you already treated him
like your brother?

540
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:29,176
Knowing that he'll always have Jae-hee,

541
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:33,447
I was afraid that
I might fall in love with him.

542
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:42,656
That's why I wasn't going to come
because I didn't want to cry.

543
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,756
Don't be so sad.

544
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:17,724
We'll see them again one day.

545
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,758
Are you moving to another hospital?

546
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,498
To the public health center
where my husband works.

547
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,367
Dr Yang?

548
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:29,403
You've known it all along?

549
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:32,172
Of course, I am a very sensitive woman.

550
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:36,877
Take care.

551
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:38,245
I'll come visit you.

552
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:54,661
I heard Jae-joon is here.

553
00:44:54,728 --> 00:44:56,096
Yes, in there.

554
00:44:57,965 --> 00:44:59,199
Just wait here.

555
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,869
What if my father gets mad at you again?

556
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:05,597
I've been standing here all along,
but they're just talking.

557
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:08,942
They must have a lot to talk about.

558
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:10,577
Let's give them some time.

559
00:45:15,282 --> 00:45:17,251
You're here to apologize?

560
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:19,383
Yes, sir.

561
00:45:19,686 --> 00:45:21,455
Not to get my apology?

562
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:24,758
I believe I've already gotten
your apology.

563
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:28,128
I never apologized.

564
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:33,133
I'm working with my friend
at his law firm in America.

565
00:45:34,535 --> 00:45:35,511
Law firm?

566
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,705
Because I don't deserve
to be a doctor anymore.

567
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,378
I saw something interesting there.

568
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:48,949
A list of malpractice suits against
major hospitals in Korea this past year.

569
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:50,417
I don't want to hear it. Stop.

570
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:54,087
It was one-tenth of other major hospitals.

571
00:45:54,888 --> 00:45:59,459
There were many comments about how
this hospital gives sincere apologies.

572
00:45:59,526 --> 00:46:03,597
That's because
I'm not the chairman anymore.

573
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:08,302
I know you make all the decisions
for this hospital from this room.

574
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:14,608
My parents would be pleased to find out.

575
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:15,843
Be quiet.

576
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,513
I don't want to hear it anymore.
You may leave.

577
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:33,227
For what do you want to apologize to me?

578
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:43,003
An apology for Soo-hyun's father.

579
00:46:46,507 --> 00:46:50,177
I hurt Soo-hyun with my stupidity.

580
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:57,117
I'm not sure if I'll ever get the chance.

581
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:59,653
But I'd like to have your forgiveness
for my faults.

582
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:31,818
I'll only forgive Soo-hyun's Han Jae-joon.

583
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:35,422
Father...

584
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:42,863
What are you doing there?

585
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,998
I should get going...

586
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,870
I'm leaving!

587
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:05,519
I'm sorry.

588
00:48:08,755 --> 00:48:09,623
Jae-joon...

589
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,893
Should I call you Seong-hoon?

590
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:18,966
I only thought about the fact
that you lied to me.

591
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,635
I didn't think about the pain and hardship

592
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,239
that you must've gone through.

593
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:29,877
Are you forgiving me?

594
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:34,381
I'm the one who should
ask for forgiveness.

595
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:39,820
There's someone else
we must ask for forgiveness.

596
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:45,425
Dr Park.

597
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:51,999
Are you free tomorrow?

598
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,939
Tomorrow?

599
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:56,637
There are too many things

600
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:58,906
that we don't know
about Dr Park and Dr Han.

601
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,842
Dr Park and Dr Han?

602
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:09,049
What about Dr Park and Dr Han?

603
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:14,855
I just heard this
from someone named Mr Jang.

604
00:49:17,024 --> 00:49:18,525
I couldn't believe their story

605
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,461
at the beginning.

606
00:49:55,963 --> 00:49:57,965
Dr Park was always a cheerful person
in our eyes.

607
00:49:59,032 --> 00:49:59,967
But in reality,

608
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,669
he was dealing with the awful things
that happened in his past.

609
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:09,643
The same goes for Dr Han... No, Jae-hee.

610
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:13,847
Are you okay?

611
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:19,486
I'm so sorry for those two.

612
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,456
I'm so embarrassed for telling Dr Park

613
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:26,894
about my feelings without knowing
what they went through.

614
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:30,097
How ridiculous I must've looked to them!

615
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:34,668
I asked him to respond my feelings for him

616
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:38,405
without knowing anything
about their tragedy.

617
00:50:40,174 --> 00:50:41,408
I'm also embarrassed.

618
00:50:42,428 --> 00:50:45,531
I only considered Dr Park
to be young and skillful.

619
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:50,617
I never thought about how he acquired
those masterful skills.

620
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,592
Come with me.
There's someone you need to meet.

621
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:01,895
Someone to meet?

622
00:51:02,796 --> 00:51:03,697
The man.

623
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,669
Yes, the man.

624
00:51:09,303 --> 00:51:10,671
PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER

625
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:21,148
Why are you slapping my butt?

626
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:23,884
Because it calls spanking!

627
00:51:24,316 --> 00:51:25,219
Why?

628
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:27,120
I already gave your husband's prescription
yesterday.

629
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:29,089
You have guests.

630
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:30,123
Guests?

631
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:32,993
Ma'am!

632
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:34,528
Who are they?

633
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,741
Hello, quack.

634
00:51:55,749 --> 00:51:57,050
Do something already.

635
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:57,974
You're making me nervous.

636
00:51:58,065 --> 00:51:59,486
I saw you falling from there.

637
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:03,790
I thought you were dead.

638
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,831
You could've at least let me know
that you're alive, you little jerk.

639
00:52:20,741 --> 00:52:21,975
It hurts.

640
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:40,294
Didn't all that beating make you hungry?

641
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:41,695
Shut up!

642
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,698
Eat with me since you're here.

643
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,842
So what happened after you fell
from the bridge?

644
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,010
I couldn't figure that part out.

645
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:00,113
There was someone who helped me.

646
00:53:03,784 --> 00:53:05,385
Did you sleep well?

647
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,856
You look prettier after you sleep.

648
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:12,092
Get some rest.

649
00:53:29,576 --> 00:53:30,911
This is what you wanted.

650
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:49,763
Thank you.

651
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:57,104
It seems like your son gave you
a present before he left.

652
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:25,832
Open it.

653
00:54:38,312 --> 00:54:42,149
That's more suitable for you
than working at a law firm.

654
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,455
Where's Jae-hee?

655
00:54:50,257 --> 00:54:53,493
Jae-hee applied for refugee status
in China.

656
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:55,462
So she's in China right now?

657
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,795
Because of her dual identity,

658
00:55:29,029 --> 00:55:31,398
her refugee application wasn't
approved initially.

659
00:55:31,932 --> 00:55:35,669
Thankfully I have a friend who took
care of it for her just four months ago.

660
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:42,376
Once she got her refugee status,
she applied for asylum in Korea.

661
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:46,180
The reason why I came to Korea yesterday

662
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:50,617
is because Jae-hee will be here today.

663
00:56:11,872 --> 00:56:15,909
You said you don't believe
in destiny, right?

664
00:56:16,844 --> 00:56:17,874
No, I don't.

665
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,180
You still don't?

666
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:21,415
Now,

667
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:25,185
I do believe in destiny now.
