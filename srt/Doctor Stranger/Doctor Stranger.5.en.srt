1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,196
What are you doing?

3
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,531
Let go!

4
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,032
Stop it!

5
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,101
Let go!

6
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:35,569
Stop!

7
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,280
Let go!

8
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,953
Bring my mom back to life!

9
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,103
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:40,834
I just denied
the Prosecutors' Office's allegations.

11
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,370
When will I be summoned?

12
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:45,372
I guess it'll be in about two weeks.

13
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:47,875
Where are you now?

14
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,044
I'm going to see that woman.

15
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:04,848
Dr Han, a patient is here to see you!

16
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,068
How may I help you?

17
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,292
The resemblance is unbelievable.

18
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,298
Jae-hee!

19
00:03:55,943 --> 00:04:00,899
EPISODE 5

20
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,412
I'm Han Seung-hee.

21
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,816
I was in charge of Ms Kim Eun-hee
when she was at our branch.

22
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,887
I'm the one who transferred her
to the main hospital.

23
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,490
I heard she has passed away.

24
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,860
I'm sorry for your loss.

25
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,296
How do you have this?

26
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,083
When she first became my patient,
she asked me to move in.

27
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:22,122
The hospital was close by,
and she said she was lonely.

28
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,176
Was she lonely?

29
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,364
Go away!

30
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:35,169
Don't ever come see me or ever
acknowledge me even if I come see you!

31
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:40,837
Then, why did she do that to me?

32
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,029
You grew this much!

33
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,348
She bought these every year
on your birthday.

34
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:04,091
Happy 25th birthday my dear Soo-hyun.
I wish I could see you with this necklace.

35
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,760
Soo-hyun, my love, happy eighth birthday.

36
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,068
She cherished that the most.

37
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,701
How did she...?

38
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,772
I guess she's been observing you.

39
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,809
Then, why did she do it?

40
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,912
She always pushed me away.

41
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:04,284
She said you'll end up hating her
if she didn't push you away.

42
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:14,061
She thought you could only be happy by
living a glamorous life with your father.

43
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,464
That's not true.

44
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,534
She always said
that you're exactly like her.

45
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:25,072
Her desire for a glamorous life
led her to an illegitimate love affair.

46
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:27,274
Just like you.

47
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,345
That's not true.

48
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:35,825
That's not true.

49
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,852
I thought it would be all right
as long as you were happy.

50
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,221
As long as you're happy.

51
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,256
Mom...

52
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,427
I cried every day because I missed you.

53
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,634
I was always missing you... my daughter.

54
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:33,540
I am sorry... Mom.

55
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,779
We were sure it was an embolism,
so we injected a thrombolytic drug.

56
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,648
But the heart stopped
before the drug worked.

57
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,517
That was an unreasonable response.

58
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,188
Why didn't you consider hypovolemic shock
if you were using a thrombolytic drug?

59
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,524
The patient stopped bleeding.

60
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,334
It was just that her condition
was very bad.

61
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,393
Stop making excuses.

62
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,571
She had terminal lung cancer.

63
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,274
Shouldn't you have expected
that she'd be in a bad condition?

64
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,443
I think there is no risk-free surgery.

65
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:36,612
And I only operated
only because I understood that risk.

66
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,505
And that caused the patient to die.

67
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:40,741
Right?

68
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,928
I apologize for the death of the patient.

69
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,266
I sincerely apologize.

70
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,989
We're not looking for your apology.

71
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,958
We're here to talk about
the reason of her death

72
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,793
so that we can prevent it
from occurring again.

73
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,687
The surgeon tried his best,
and we all know the cause of her death.

74
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,622
Why don't we just move on?

75
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:30,558
Why did you operate?

76
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,731
It was clear that surgery
wasn't an option for her.

77
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,876
Was the surgery completely required?

78
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,035
The expected success rate was very low.
However...

79
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:44,371
What was your estimated success rate?

80
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,139
About five percent.

81
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,251
So you performed an irrational surgery?

82
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,277
I wanted to save her at all costs. And...

83
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,475
I have something to tell her.

84
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:01,655
I'm begging you.

85
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,658
Please save her.

86
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,563
I mean...

87
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,109
...it's a doctor's duty to try his best
even if there's only a one percent chance.

88
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,310
A doctor's duty?

89
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,203
Isn't it because you wanted to show off?

90
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,482
You didn't care much for the patient.

91
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,743
You just wanted to show off
your lousy surgical skills.

92
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,812
Something that brainless quack doctors
would do!

93
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:28,261
That's what you did.

94
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,774
Do you understand?

95
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,365
Don't you think that was, too much?

96
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,391
Be quiet!

97
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:53,116
A doctor who is supposed to save lives
murdered a patient.

98
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,989
Your arrogance murdered the patient.

99
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:01,357
That's too harsh, don't you think?

100
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,050
If not that, then why did you operate?

101
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,320
-That's because...
-Answer my question.

102
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,021
Why did you operate?

103
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:13,727
Fine. I did it for money.

104
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:21,874
You did it for money?

105
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,606
Did you really do it
because there was promise of payment?

106
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,652
Yes.

107
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,712
Did you really operate on her for money?

108
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,386
That's a doctor's duty?

109
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,390
Who taught you to go around
and collect money after surgery?

110
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,238
I know this isn't something
that I should be proud of.

111
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,273
So let's stop, okay?

112
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,752
I'm scared that I'll get fired!

113
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,188
Return to the podium.
I am not finished yet.

114
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,392
I'm done.

115
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,184
Go back.

116
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,155
What? You don't want to hear this?

117
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,727
Fine, leave.

118
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,330
But I'll just say one more thing.

119
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,367
You're not even a doctor.

120
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,041
I'm not even a doctor.

121
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,777
I think that's enough for today.

122
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:44,284
Honestly, in my opinion,
I hardly qualify to be a doctor.

123
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,798
Operating for money?

124
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,290
That's not what a doctor should do.

125
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:56,697
However, Chief, if that's the case,
then who are these people here?

126
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,300
Do they operate for free?
Without a salary?

127
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,514
Why did I operate?

128
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,782
I wanted to be a doctor.

129
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,353
Helping sick people is what a doctor does,
like you said!

130
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,288
Then why didn't you do it?

131
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,624
Because the success rate was low?

132
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:26,898
A doctor who only operates on patients
with high success rates?

133
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:29,763
The patient wanted to live,
and her family wanted to save her!

134
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,767
Should a doctor just let her die
because the success rate is low?

135
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:35,636
Tell me.

136
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:02,939
Hey, are you really out of your mind?

137
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,108
I must have been out of my mind
for a moment.

138
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,100
But I didn't say anything wrong.

139
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:10,045
The Chairman is planning on firing you.

140
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,315
You can't afford to turn
all the doctors against you!

141
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,583
You think so, my master?

142
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,017
What should I do now?

143
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,076
Don't you know?

144
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:18,612
Go upstairs and beg for forgiveness.

145
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,591
She did say she was her legal guardian.

146
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:22,557
Go!

147
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,484
He's probably in his office now.

148
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,928
Don't you think that was too harsh?

149
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:36,830
I only said what I had to say.

150
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,732
You were just venting your anger.

151
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:40,476
Venting my anger?

152
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,245
Because that's the surgery
you couldn't perform.

153
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,479
The patient died during surgery.

154
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,148
I wanted the surgery as her guardian.

155
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,573
Another guardian didn't approve!

156
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,500
I understand that you couldn't go
against the Chairman's decision.

157
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:56,250
But you also saw it.

158
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:59,867
Dr Park really tried his best.

159
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,424
My mom has passed away,
but I'm still very thankful to him.

160
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,595
But you're just venting your anger at him.

161
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:14,535
I really can't understand
why you're being like this.

162
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:34,855
I was wrong, Mr Chairman.

163
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:39,393
Mr Chairman,
Dr Park will be really good from now on.

164
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:41,728
Please forgive him this time.

165
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:44,761
I'm afraid it's too late
to ask for forgiveness.

166
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:51,205
I'm very sorry for not being able
to save the patient.

167
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,539
I apologize once again...

168
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,914
Do you think losing the patient
is your real fault?

169
00:17:56,777 --> 00:18:00,347
You should be apologizing
for going against my orders!

170
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,161
Since we haven't finished
the paperwork for your hiring,

171
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,954
I can fire you
without a committee meeting.

172
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,922
Get out of my hospital now.

173
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,770
I apologize for not following your orders.

174
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,572
It'll never happen again.

175
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:26,688
That's good.

176
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,275
Get out now.

177
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,244
That's my order.

178
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:33,780
And Professor Moon!

179
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,148
Yes, sir.

180
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,626
Be careful.

181
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm not a very patient person.

182
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:42,222
Let's go.

183
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,066
Yes.

184
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:47,694
Mr Chairman!

185
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,614
I heard he's your father.

186
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,061
I need to stay here somehow.

187
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,086
Can you help me?

188
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,793
Darn it!

189
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:22,764
Hoon!

190
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,442
What are you doing out here
not taking care of your mom?

191
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,302
Here, it's Mr Lim.

192
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,070
Mr Lim?

193
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:31,979
Hello?

194
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,975
Where are you, Dr Park?

195
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,010
Where do you think I am? At the hospital.

196
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,145
That girl...

197
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,346
Jae-hee?

198
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,514
I found her.

199
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:41,831
What?

200
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,432
Where is she?

201
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,799
You have those ripped checks, right?

202
00:19:58,732 --> 00:19:59,928
The checks?

203
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,509
I do. Where is Jae-hee?

204
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:15,549
If you want to know more,
meet me at your clinic with those checks.

205
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:35,748
-Is he here?
-No.

206
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,277
Where are you?

207
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,555
Mr Lim.

208
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:30,788
Mr Lim!

209
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,001
Mr Lim...

210
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:48,008
Mr Lim!

211
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:50,632
Mr Lim...

212
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,535
Mr Lim!

213
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:06,657
Please save me, Dr Park.

214
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,354
Don't speak.

215
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,151
Mr Lim!

216
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:19,806
Open the door.

217
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:26,980
What's going on?

218
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,089
-I'll call an ambulance.
-Okay. Wait for me outside.

219
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,235
Are you going to operate here?

220
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,025
A broken bone
penetrated his right heart chamber.

221
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:56,143
What?

222
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:57,787
Other arteries are okay.

223
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,347
You can't, Hoon!
Let's wait until the ambulance gets here.

224
00:23:00,438 --> 00:23:02,492
We don't have time!
He'll bleed himself to death!

225
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,745
How are you going to operate
in a place like this?

226
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:06,220
Take it out.

227
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,605
Pull.

228
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,116
Why is this suction machine so weak?

229
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,199
I can't see anything.

230
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,093
Are you sure you're doing it right?

231
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:38,051
Just trust me.

232
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:03,986
Can you really see it?

233
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:06,522
How could you stitch it in this situation?

234
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,516
It's not that I can see,
it's just that I know.

235
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,428
We're not done yet. Please focus.

236
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,826
Okay.

237
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,507
Let's go.

238
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:55,062
Hey, hey!

239
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,828
What about me?

240
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,666
Fine. I'll drive my own car.

241
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,894
A bone penetrated the heart chamber?

242
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,653
I took the bone out
and gave him first aid.

243
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:22,122
-Dr Park...
-His heart wall might have been damaged.

244
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:23,657
Get as much antibiotics as possible.

245
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,195
-Vitals?
-80/50, and pulse is 110.

246
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:30,867
-Call the other doctors and get IV ready.
-Got it.

247
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,566
Get an operating room ready.

248
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,744
You can't.
You're forbidden from operating.

249
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:37,137
Stop talking nonsense! I'll do it.
I have to save this man!

250
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:38,672
You can't operate by yourself!

251
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,888
Can you do it without an anesthesiologist?

252
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:44,978
You said you gave him first aid.
Leave it up to us now.

253
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:49,016
That girl. I found her.

254
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,020
Okay. I'll count on you.

255
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:55,976
Call Dr Keum and get an operating room.

256
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,236
Suction.

257
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,951
His heart walls are fine.

258
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:17,311
He did a lot more than just first aid.

259
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:19,580
-Who did it?
-Dr Park Hoon.

260
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:21,915
Wasn't he forbidden to operate?

261
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,752
I guess he isn't someone
who cares about such a thing.

262
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:30,257
It would be great if you could be
as aggressive as Dr Park!

263
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:36,463
Vitals?

264
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:39,900
They're good, very good.

265
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:41,435
Suction.

266
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:46,440
-How is it?
-There's nothing left to do.

267
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:49,009
His surgical ability is truly the best.

268
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,282
Will Mr Lim be okay?

269
00:26:57,651 --> 00:27:00,888
Do you think he really saw Jae-hee?

270
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,729
He said that he found her.

271
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,731
But...

272
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:13,634
We'll be able to find her.

273
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,614
We can find Jae-hee once he wakes up.

274
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:19,673
We can find her.

275
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:32,653
Juliette Binoche...

276
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,155
She's a famous French actress.

277
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:36,671
Is that so?

278
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:38,926
I don't know who she is.

279
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,938
All you need to do is look in the mirror.

280
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:45,441
Doctor, are you hitting on me?

281
00:27:45,532 --> 00:27:46,633
When does your shift end?

282
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:56,810
It looks great.

283
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,012
It's great, isn't it?

284
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:04,751
This moat is the first line of defense
against the enemy.

285
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:09,756
And this is the castle wall
that is invincible.

286
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,094
And this is the main castle
in which the lord lives in.

287
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:21,535
And the princess has the best view,
so she gets the top spot of the castle.

288
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,382
That's the perfect spot
for a princess' room!

289
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,775
But there is this knight
who's really good at fighting.

290
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:31,812
And he wants the castle.

291
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,375
Then, he needs to seduce the princess.

292
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:36,483
Excellent, Kim Chi-gyu!

293
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:42,155
In order to win the approval of the lord,
the knight must be a good fighter,

294
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:44,267
but he also needs to win
the heart of the princess.

295
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:47,236
If he can manage to do both,
the game is over.

296
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:49,329
However, this knight faces a dilemma.

297
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,664
What kind of dilemma?

298
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:56,904
He gets sad
every time he looks at the princess.

299
00:28:58,038 --> 00:28:59,139
He's in love!

300
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:03,210
-Love?
-The knight shouldn't do that.

301
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:06,480
If he wants the castle, falling in love
is a luxury he can't afford.

302
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:14,755
You're quite drunk!

303
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,984
-I'll get going first.
-Sure.

304
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:23,697
Are you really okay, Jae-joon?

305
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:26,466
Please take care of him!

306
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,277
But all you're doing
is venting your anger at him.

307
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:49,256
I really can't understand
why you're being like this.

308
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:07,341
Are you drunk?

309
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,849
-I need to go home.
-I'm sorry, Soo-hyun.

310
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:17,951
I couldn't go against
the Chairman's orders.

311
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,120
You were right.

312
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,289
I vented my anger at him.

313
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,407
You're very drunk, Jae-joon.
Go home and sleep.

314
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:27,094
I thought it was because of my pride.

315
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:31,665
Because Dr Park did something
that I couldn't do.

316
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,136
But that wasn't it.

317
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,805
-Then, why?
-I couldn't help.

318
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,275
I hated it when you tried to defend him.

319
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:43,644
I really hated it.

320
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,650
The fact that you were on his side
and not mine...

321
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:53,320
...I hated it.

322
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:56,023
Jae-joon...

323
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,163
It was only natural for you to defend him.

324
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:09,736
But I couldn't control my emotions.

325
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:33,360
Thank you for your honesty.

326
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:42,593
I'm sorry.

327
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:38,668
I'm sorry for being late.

328
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,536
I had an emergency operation.

329
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:41,662
You don't need to sit.

330
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,480
Sang-jin will be moving
to the Management and Policy Office.

331
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:06,053
Speak now if you want to say something.

332
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,193
I'll tell you tomorrow.

333
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,162
I said tell me now.

334
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:27,150
A male patient, age 67.

335
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:30,453
He was brought to the emergency room
due to a heart attack three months ago.

336
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:32,422
He's been experiencing severe fatigue.

337
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:34,515
Give him diuretic and run
a heart ultrasound.

338
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:37,751
It may lead to heart failure,
so pay attention.

339
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,192
May I help you?

340
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,928
Police. Jung-bu precinct.

341
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:54,668
I didn't know that girl
from last night was married.

342
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:56,779
I just took her home.

343
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,015
What is this bad premonition?

344
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:01,508
He's coming, coming, coming, for me!

345
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:06,947
Are you Dr Park Hoon?

346
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:12,753
Should we talk outside?

347
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:27,034
He'll regain consciousness very soon.

348
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,937
Were there any other witnesses?

349
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:32,439
Just me and Chang-yi.

350
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:06,840
Hoon!

351
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:09,576
Mr Lim is...

352
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,857
Where's the patient
who was operated yesterday?

353
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:25,003
I'm not sure.

354
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:29,705
Do you know if Mr Lim in Room 1105
is scheduled for anything today?

355
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:30,973
He is not scheduled for anything.

356
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:33,600
-Is he not there?
-How can you ask me that?

357
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:42,576
Maybe he walked out on his own because
of your great surgery, Dr Water Bottle!

358
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:44,385
What?

359
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,724
-Hoon!
-What?

360
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,284
I got a text message from Mr Lim.

361
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,329
I'm going to China.

362
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,390
Let's not see each other ever again,
you little brat!

363
00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:02,062
Why is this swindler not answering?

364
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,894
How's your health, Prime Minister Jang?

365
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:27,263
It's bearable, Mr President.

366
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:30,157
How's your selection process
for the surgery team going?

367
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:31,822
It's going well, sir.

368
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,828
I hope you choose the right team.

369
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:38,498
They'll be fixing the heart
of a very important man.

370
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:44,004
Oh, I called the Prosecutor General.

371
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:48,842
I told him there is no need to look back
into the primary race of many years ago.

372
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:55,849
Considering your bad health,
I suggested he should let this one slide.

373
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,352
For now.

374
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,740
That corrupt, old fart!

375
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:25,612
Now that he knows my weakness,
he wants me to be his yes man!

376
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:31,385
Okay.

377
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,256
I'll be his yes man for now.

378
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:44,398
Did you get anything
from Pyeongtaek Hospital?

379
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,315
What about Park Hoon?

380
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:53,874
Something unexpected has come up.

381
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,019
He got kicked out of the hospital.

382
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,978
What?

383
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,015
I asked him to perform the surgery.

384
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:05,027
If you want to punish someone, punish me.

385
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,286
Is that all you want to say?

386
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:11,291
You should've asked for forgiveness
before defending him.

387
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,129
You never disobeyed my orders before.

388
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,976
Even when you did wrong, you always
asked for forgiveness immediately.

389
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,102
And I forgave you every time.

390
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:26,949
You had your chance last night.

391
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,742
But you didn't say anything.

392
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:31,612
What's the reason?

393
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:40,696
Please forgive Dr Park.

394
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:42,256
I'm asking for the reason!

395
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:49,029
Yes, if someone calls looking for me,
you can give them my phone number.

396
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:59,612
-Is Jae-hee's name there?
-No.

397
00:39:00,774 --> 00:39:02,709
Do you think Mr Lim was mistaken?

398
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:04,685
He clearly said he found her.

399
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,914
You're the one who thinks he's a swindler!

400
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:08,749
But he was serious.

401
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,083
Don't you think so?

402
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:13,020
Everyone from North Korea goes through
the acclimation facility.

403
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:14,711
And they take your contact info!

404
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,624
Why do you keep following me
instead of taking care of your mother?

405
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:19,359
Because I'm concerned!

406
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,360
Why are you concerned?

407
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:33,149
You said you saw Jae-hee here
the other day, right?

408
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,107
I don't remember!

409
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:38,212
It was Jae-hee.

410
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:41,281
I said you can't!

411
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,392
-Just a minute!
-I said you can't!

412
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:52,935
It was last Thursday
around 3:00 or 4:00 PM.

413
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:55,162
Just the video footage
of the emergency room!

414
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:56,396
I'm sorry!

415
00:39:58,699 --> 00:39:59,695
Hoon!

416
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,035
You should stop now.

417
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:03,813
I'm very close to finding her,
why should I stop?

418
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,506
Mom says she saw her in North Korea.

419
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,024
Jae-hee...

420
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:13,480
There was this girl named Song Jae-hee...

421
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:17,518
...who came in after getting shot
while abroad two years ago.

422
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:24,333
She was on the verge of death,

423
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:31,398
yet she kept repeating, "Hoon, Hoon..."

424
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,403
Her fever's, too high.

425
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:39,072
Don't forget me...

426
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:42,596
Hoon...

427
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:44,686
Hoon...

428
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:50,833
After we reported her dire condition...

429
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:54,378
...they finally sent a doctor.

430
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:02,763
All the doctor did was declare her dead.

431
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,602
I'm so sorry, Dr Park.

432
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:13,140
I'm so sorry.

433
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:21,949
Jae-hee isn't dead. She's alive.

434
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:27,821
Your mom's mistaken.

435
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,624
-Jae-hee is alive.
-It's time to stop, Hoon.

436
00:41:30,715 --> 00:41:31,625
She says Jae-hee's dead!

437
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:33,790
Be quiet!

438
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:35,836
Hoon...

439
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:40,400
I'll know once I see
the surveillance tapes.

440
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:43,303
Then I can meet her.

441
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:45,047
Hoon!

442
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:46,431
Please stop!

443
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:55,716
I have a question for you, Chang-yi.

444
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:58,118
Dr Park.

445
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:00,120
Where's the guardian
of the patient in room 1104?

446
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,489
Dr Park?

447
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,058
Leave him alone.
Dr Water bottle got fired today.

448
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:06,536
Water bottle?

449
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:09,329
Is he the doctor who made an incision
without any bleeding?

450
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:13,567
But is that really possible?

451
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:16,579
You saw a lot of surgeries
in your last job, right?

452
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,256
It's possible if the surgeon
is very skilled.

453
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:20,140
But why would they fire
such a skilled surgeon?

454
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:22,209
Because he deserved it.

455
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,646
Please get a urine sample
from Mr Kang in room 1111.

456
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,025
And let me know the blood test results
for Mr Shin in room 1112.

457
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,050
Yes, doctor.

458
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,190
You seem very tired.

459
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:39,600
Are you okay?

460
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:42,805
I need to make money.

461
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,598
Especially now that I'm not alone anymore.

462
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:54,107
Does he have a lover in North Korea?

463
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,912
He came to this hospital to make money
needed to get her out.

464
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:01,715
I presume her name is Jae-hee.

465
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:03,750
Yes.

466
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:07,754
They almost escaped,
but she ended up getting caught again.

467
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:10,390
So she must still be in North Korea.

468
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:12,960
Apparently, she's dead.

469
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:19,333
But he's going crazy
over searching for a dead person!

470
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:22,603
Now I'm going crazy.

471
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,457
Can you really find Jae-hee
if you see the video?

472
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:35,545
Of course, I can.

473
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:39,620
Chang-yi said she died in North Korea.

474
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:42,122
Stop talking nonsense. Jae-hee's alive.
I saw her in person.

475
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:44,739
You could've mistaken someone else
for Jae-hee.

476
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,737
How could I mistake someone else
for Jae-hee?

477
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:49,415
It's been a while since you've seen her.

478
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:52,795
-Maybe you confused someone with...
-Confused?

479
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,269
Do you confuse your lover
with someone else?

480
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:57,480
Like your mother.

481
00:43:57,571 --> 00:44:00,807
It may have been a while, but can you
really confuse her with someone else?

482
00:44:03,877 --> 00:44:06,513
It was Jae-hee. I definitely saw Jae-hee.

483
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:08,348
Okay.

484
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,652
Let me help you. Come with me.

485
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:42,950
When did you say you saw her?

486
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:45,586
Last Thursday around 3:00 or 4:00 PM.

487
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,857
Near the emergency room, right?

488
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:54,337
Here.

489
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:55,329
That's you, right?

490
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:00,100
-What about the parking lot?
-That would be...

491
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:05,965
Is that her?

492
00:45:07,908 --> 00:45:09,320
Can you zoom in?

493
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:16,884
She looks like she works here.

494
00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:18,986
Any other footage?

495
00:45:19,077 --> 00:45:20,697
She went from the lobby
to the emergency room.

496
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:21,722
The lobby is further.

497
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:42,242
What do you think you're doing?

498
00:45:43,377 --> 00:45:44,687
This is trespassing.

499
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:46,213
We work here.

500
00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:48,882
He was fired.

501
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:54,188
Have fun at the police station.
Father will be very delighted.

502
00:45:54,955 --> 00:45:56,804
-For something trivial like this...
-Trivial?

503
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:05,098
Have you forgotten how you were crazy
about trivial things like this?

504
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:22,135
I'm sorry.

505
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:23,975
It's my fault.

506
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:28,722
But was that woman really Jae-hee?

507
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,106
I'm not sure.

508
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:33,663
I'm really not sure.

509
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:39,900
That girl...I found her.

510
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:42,436
She was declared dead.

511
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:49,243
Is Jae-hee a doctor?

512
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,947
That woman that you saw...

513
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:56,639
...she was wearing a doctor's coat, too.

514
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,456
We went to medical school together.

515
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,392
What was she like?

516
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:08,904
Jae-hee?

517
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:11,798
Yes, Jae-hee.

518
00:47:17,538 --> 00:47:18,805
She smiled a lot.

519
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:26,480
She smiled a lot.

520
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:35,183
She smiled a lot.

521
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,222
This is Han Seung-hee speaking.

522
00:48:42,313 --> 00:48:44,024
Park Hoon got kicked out of the hospital.

523
00:48:44,662 --> 00:48:45,599
I know.

524
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:47,403
That stupid...

525
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:50,931
A North Korean refugee came forward
to tell him that Song Jae-hee is dead.

526
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:55,035
At this rate, our plan will fail.

527
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:57,337
It already failed.

528
00:48:58,572 --> 00:48:59,949
We're going back to North Korea.

529
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,074
But we still have a chance...

530
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,158
There are a lot of people
who look alike in this world.

531
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:21,662
Maybe you mistook someone for Jae-hee.

532
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:26,567
Do you really think I made a mistake?

533
00:49:29,837 --> 00:49:34,241
Do you really think the Jae-hee that I saw
was someone else?

534
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:04,338
I'm not leaving by myself.

535
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:06,792
Soo-hyun!

536
00:50:20,821 --> 00:50:22,155
You're useless.

537
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:24,269
I apologize, Father.

538
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,795
Every hospital is fighting hard with each
other for the prime minister's surgery!

539
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:31,698
It's my fault, Father.

540
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:37,371
Stay out of my sight.

541
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:53,320
You really are like cancer in my life.

542
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,022
I'm honored.

543
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:57,333
Did you do this on purpose?

544
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:00,561
Did you want to screw me over
while pretending to look at your mom?

545
00:51:02,796 --> 00:51:04,373
I'm scared to see you even in my dreams.

546
00:51:04,464 --> 00:51:05,432
What do you mean?

547
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:06,976
Looking at my mom?

548
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,870
You were looking at the footage
of your mom's arrival at the hospital!

549
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:12,748
I'm Han Seung-hee.

550
00:51:13,607 --> 00:51:16,343
I was in charge of Ms Kim Eun-hee
when she was at the branch hospital.

551
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:24,545
Hoon...

552
00:52:27,887 --> 00:52:28,815
Hoon...

553
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:31,418
Hoon...

554
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:34,688
Hoon...

555
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:37,191
Hoon...

556
00:52:39,408 --> 00:52:40,427
Hoon...

557
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:22,481
-Why do you want to see Jae-hee's face?
-I need to check something.

558
00:53:48,362 --> 00:53:50,072
Why did you go to his clinic?

559
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:54,210
Song Jae-hee will be able to send
Park Hoon back to Myung-woo Hospital.

560
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:55,274
How?

561
00:53:56,136 --> 00:53:58,705
He already heard
that Song Jae-hee is dead.

562
00:53:58,796 --> 00:53:59,949
Don't you understand?

563
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,441
That's why I went to his clinic.

564
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:04,244
We must show him
that Song Jae-hee is alive.

565
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:13,153
Hoon...

566
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,422
Hoon...

567
00:54:18,376 --> 00:54:19,459
I'm Han Seung-hee.

568
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:23,497
Have you seen her?

569
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,049
You should've sent me
to Park Hoon first, Comrade.

570
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,842
How could you miss it?

571
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:36,443
You're ruining everything
for your revenge?

572
00:54:36,534 --> 00:54:37,635
Stop talking nonsense.

573
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:39,713
The mission is more important to me.

574
00:54:39,804 --> 00:54:41,758
Then I'll meet Park Hoon right now.

575
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:42,855
You can't.

576
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:46,119
Even if you meet him,
he can't go back to the hospital.

577
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:50,967
Oh Joon-gyu isn't that easy.

578
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:52,893
So are we just giving up on the mission?

579
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:55,729
This is all Park Hoon's fault.

580
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:59,233
That brat wreaked havoc everywhere!

581
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:04,213
She's the doctor who brought my mom
to the hospital.

582
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:05,639
You said you saw her the same day.

583
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:23,656
Yes.

584
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,459
That was Jae-hee.

585
00:55:42,364 --> 00:55:44,111
We won't accomplish the mission.

586
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:47,080
But it doesn't mean I can't get revenge.

587
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:48,907
Think rationally.

588
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:52,252
You're giving up the mission
for your lousy revenge?

589
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:53,420
Lousy revenge?

590
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:56,323
What do you know?

591
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:17,344
Where is Dr Han Seung-hee?

592
00:56:17,435 --> 00:56:19,279
We've been looking for her for hours.

593
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,112
-How come?
-That's what I'm saying.

594
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:22,691
This never happened before.

595
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:36,630
Kill me first then.

596
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:40,943
You don't think I will?

597
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:43,479
Only death awaits those
who couldn't complete their missions.

598
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,983
I am not afraid of death
that's given by my country.

599
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:51,311
I'm not afraid of death either,
I'm afraid of not completing the mission.

600
00:57:08,373 --> 00:57:09,240
Is she not answering?

601
00:57:12,366 --> 00:57:13,776
Let's go to my mom's house.

602
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:16,069
-Your mother's house?
-She was living there with her.

603
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,452
Okay.

604
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:22,409
Dr Oh!

605
00:57:44,348 --> 00:57:47,100
Dr Oh, what brings you here at this hour?

606
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:56,777
Jae-hee...

607
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:52,629
If she's your girlfriend,
that means she is a spy!

608
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,577
Are we going to Myung-woo tomorrow?

609
00:58:54,668 --> 00:58:55,645
Park Hoon will follow.

610
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:57,113
Because that's where Song Jae-hee is.

611
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:58,438
-Where are you?
-Mom's house.

612
00:58:58,529 --> 00:58:59,373
Alone?

613
00:58:59,464 --> 00:59:00,683
I guess this is why people drink.

614
00:59:00,774 --> 00:59:01,617
To see people they miss.

615
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:02,709
I told you to disappear.

616
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,645
Especially from Dr Oh.

617
00:59:04,912 --> 00:59:05,915
Jae-hee!

618
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,415
Long time no see.

619
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:09,650
You're looking for Jae-hee.

620
00:59:09,741 --> 00:59:11,718
She really does look like her.

621
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:13,496
You'll see something that you want soon.

622
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:15,664
Is there any way you can check
other than her face?

623
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:17,200
Like a scar on her body?

624
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:18,258
Park Hoon!
