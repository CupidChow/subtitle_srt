DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:55,291
EPISODE 10

3
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,197
Are you monitoring them?

4
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,242
Do I have any reason to monitor them?

5
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,502
It's time to start the second phase
of our plan.

6
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,104
Don't worry.

7
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,606
My government has already made its move.

8
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:26,041
By tomorrow morning,

9
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:27,915
South Koreans will shake in fear.

10
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,016
GOVERNMENT COMPLEX SEJONG

11
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,489
Is it true that North Korea
is conducting a nuclear test?

12
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,749
Is it true that it'll be much larger
in scale than the previous ones?

13
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,794
-Do you know the exact date?
-Please comment!

14
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,254
Why are they conducting a nuclear test
all of a sudden?

15
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,524
Prime Minister.

16
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,830
-What's going on?
-That's what I am saying.

17
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:27,083
In order to ensure the sovereignty
and security of our country,

18
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:33,614
we're preparing something
that has never been seen before!

19
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,784
This nuclear test will encourage
the spirit

20
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:41,622
of our people in the struggle

21
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:44,293
of building a strong nation together!

22
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,582
The Blue House is on the line,
Prime Minister.

23
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,669
Hello? This is Jang Seok-joo speaking.

24
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,804
What's going on here?

25
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,107
Why are they conducting a nuclear test
all of the sudden?

26
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,451
I'm sorry, sir.

27
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,076
This isn't something
I was expecting either.

28
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,454
Come right now.

29
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,113
I'll be there after the cabinet meeting.

30
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,714
I said come see me now!

31
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,757
We were talking about having a summit,
and now they're doing nuclear tests?

32
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,897
How dare they threaten us
with such a cheap trick?

33
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,341
I guess the North Koreans
are really in a rush.

34
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:36,844
I've never seen them move so fast.

35
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,303
What?

36
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,517
I thought it wasn't going to be bigger
than a missile launch.

37
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,222
If they're going to threaten us,
they should do it boldly.

38
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:51,148
I'm afraid it'll cause
unnecessary tension.

39
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:56,372
What if something like what happened
20 years ago happens again?

40
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,921
There is nothing to worry about.

41
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,767
North Korea has conducted
nuclear tests many times before,

42
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,003
and the U.S. didn't do anything.

43
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,572
It'll calm down after causing some noise.

44
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:14,524
North Korea's announcement of nuclear test
caused the stock market to crash.

45
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,784
However, nothing has changed
for most citizens in South Korea.

46
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:21,864
No instance of hoarding groceries
was reported so far,

47
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,125
but politicians are nervous
about the situation.

48
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,938
Some analysts are commenting

49
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,403
that the widespread lack
of security awareness is worrisome.

50
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,108
It tastes great when you eat it
with dried seaweed.

51
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,149
It's good.

52
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:00,259
-No.
-My dear, doctor!

53
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,162
Comrade Park Hoon.

54
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,433
Goodbye.

55
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,503
Jae-hee!

56
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,282
Jae-hee!

57
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,759
Jae-hee!

58
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,396
Jae-hee!

59
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,860
What's wrong?

60
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,477
Nothing...

61
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,077
-How dare you?
-Just hold on.

62
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,501
When did you first know?

63
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,003
When I saw you for the first time.

64
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,615
Really?

65
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,851
Where do you want to go?

66
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,462
I'll drop you off at the hospital.

67
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,563
The hospital?

68
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,790
We should go back. We must.

69
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,261
Are you saying that people will think

70
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:16,597
that you're Jae-hee if I don't
show up anymore, right?

71
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,900
I'm sorry, Hoon.

72
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,375
Hello?
This is Moon Hyung-wook speaking.

73
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,544
Hi, Hoon!

74
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,148
Okay. So you'll be late coming in?

75
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,560
I was operating until very early morning.

76
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,020
Okay, fine.
I'll give you a special pass today.

77
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,097
But there'll be a party later today.

78
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,894
So you must come in the afternoon!

79
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,323
Yes, I'll see you later.

80
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,790
Okay!

81
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:56,362
Happy?

82
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,334
-Let's go.
-Where?

83
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,284
Wherever.

84
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:05,179
Okay.

85
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,813
Wherever.

86
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:09,111
Hoon
Jae-hee

87
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,577
Okay.

88
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,188
-Why aren't you asking?
-Ask what?

89
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,067
Why I'm Han Seung-hee,
not Song Jae-hee.

90
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,969
And why I'm here.

91
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,940
-Do you want to tell me?
-I think I should.

92
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,185
Those things don't matter at all.

93
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,611
But they matter to me.

94
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,439
The only thing that matters to me
is that you're here with me.

95
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:22,854
Hoon...

96
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,719
I need to you to come with me.

97
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,226
-Get in.
-Are we going to the hospital?

98
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,794
Don't ask. Just get in.

99
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,535
Don't worry.

100
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,394
Hey, it's me.

101
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,663
Yeah, it's me.

102
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:04,300
I only want everything
to be the best, okay?

103
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,993
Don't worry about how much it'll cost.

104
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,432
What are you doing here?

105
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,769
This was originally my office.

106
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,048
I didn't like the decor in here.

107
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,807
So I've been thinking
about making some changes.

108
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,320
This is my office.

109
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,279
Please leave.

110
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:28,882
For now.

111
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,493
There will be
a departmental dinner tonight.

112
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,529
Why don't you join us?

113
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,088
I heard you'll be going
to the branch hospital.

114
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:50,270
It'll be my duty as your senior
to send you off properly.

115
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,306
See you later then.

116
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:22,769
-Any messages for me?
-None, sir.

117
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,882
The Chairman is not in.

118
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,874
There is a reason why I told you
not to come in here!

119
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,283
Get out!

120
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,670
-I won't make any excuses.
-I don't want to hear them either!

121
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,099
You said it was a simple procedure!

122
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,572
Then why did he fall into coma?

123
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,219
We did our best.

124
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:37,211
-What happened during surgery?
-I am sorry, ma'am.

125
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,022
It was already too late when he arrived.

126
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:44,794
He walked into this hospital
by himself when he got here!

127
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,720
Please say something!

128
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,756
Anyway, we did our best.

129
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,358
Let's go.

130
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,504
Bring my dad back!

131
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:55,929
Bring him back!

132
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,931
Bring my dad back!

133
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,301
Bring my dad back! Bring my dad back!

134
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:05,172
Bring my dad back! Bring my dad back!

135
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,808
Bring my dad back!

136
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:11,982
Bring my dad back!

137
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,681
Bring my dad back...

138
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:36,803
I lost this time.

139
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:38,572
This time?

140
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,487
There is no next time.
Didn't you know that?

141
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,856
You can make it happen, Mr Chairman.

142
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,849
It was my decision to do this
in one surgery.

143
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,617
Are you saying that I should
go back on my word?

144
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,585
You must.

145
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,594
It's not the right time
to care about your pride.

146
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:55,556
Dr Han!

147
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,893
If you want me to stay here,
you must make another chance for me.

148
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,637
Are you threatening me?

149
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,107
Are you going to hand off the future
of Myung-woo to Park Hoon?

150
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:06,433
I don't want to hand it
to someone like you either.

151
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:13,983
I gave orders to make a position
for you in the branch hospital.

152
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,809
Whether you quit or not, it's up to you!

153
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,143
Stop acting like a fool and follow me.

154
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,945
Where are you going?

155
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:55,315
Do you think Dr Han will stay at Myung-woo
if he's sent down to the branch hospital?

156
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:56,783
Of course, he'll quit.

157
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,194
That can't happen.

158
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,888
We must convince the Chairman
to let Dr Han stay.

159
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,766
-Why?
-Myung-woo needs someone like Dr Han.

160
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,526
Why do we need him?

161
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,561
And, you, Hyung-wook!

162
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,930
You shouldn't be too harsh on someone
younger than you!

163
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:13,433
I don't care for a person like him.
I don't like him. He's scary.

164
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:14,601
Follow me.

165
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:19,439
Geez, he is really...

166
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,279
Don't worry.

167
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:29,783
Father is just angry right now.
He won't send you to the branch hospital.

168
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,352
I don't need you to comfort me.

169
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:34,797
I have no intention of going
to the branch hospital.

170
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,991
It wouldn't be too bad if you think of it
as a break from here.

171
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,960
I'm not going anywhere.

172
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:41,828
My place is here.

173
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,263
Jae-joon...

174
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:48,144
Ever since I decided to do something,

175
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,170
I've never imagined myself
anywhere but here.

176
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:51,972
Do you know why?

177
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,442
Because there is something
I must do here.

178
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,365
I know you want to make Myung-woo
the best hospital in the world.

179
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,947
-But...
-The best...

180
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:05,552
I have to destroy this.

181
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,825
I built that castle
that was meant to be destroyed.

182
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,867
Yeah. I wanted to make this hospital
the best in the world.

183
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:25,081
But everything changed
once Park Hoon came into the picture.

184
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:27,283
You know this isn't because of Dr Park!

185
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,042
And even you went to him.

186
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,034
That destroyed me even more.

187
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,399
-Jae-joon...
-Why?

188
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,816
You wanted to work
in the Strategy Department.

189
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,361
Why are you acting like a doctor
all of a sudden?

190
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,419
Acting like a doctor?

191
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,322
Jae-joon...

192
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,924
Why did you stand in as his
first assistant?

193
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:45,826
There wasn't anyone else
who could do it other than me.

194
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,294
How could he operate
without a first assistant?

195
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:48,595
So you wanted to save the baby?

196
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,297
Don't be ridiculous.

197
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,457
You wanted to show it to me.
Because I chose Dr Keum over you.

198
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,302
"I can do it, too!"

199
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,471
Isn't that the reason
why you went to him?

200
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,607
And what's wrong with that?

201
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,448
What do you think makes it okay?

202
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,919
I lost because of such a stupid reason.

203
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,722
I lost to some random stranger!

204
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,388
How is that okay?

205
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,770
Now I know why you lost.

206
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,639
I'm very well aware of that, too.

207
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,217
So get out.

208
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:35,976
You lost because you
tried too hard to win.

209
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,477
Do you think that makes sense?

210
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,246
It was just a surgery to save the babies.

211
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,657
But you approached it like a game...

212
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,551
No, you only thought about winning.
That's why you lost!

213
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,264
You're the one
who acted like a doctor, not me.

214
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,299
That's why you were beaten
by a real doctor!

215
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,659
Park Hoon is a real doctor
who defeated you, a fake one!

216
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:54,962
Do you understand?

217
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,905
TRASH

218
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:22,064
At least Dr Keum won't go
to the Water Bottle to learn.

219
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,157
Why do you want to act like
a doctor all of a sudden?

220
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,644
I'm sorry.

221
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,587
Why don't you pick up your phone?

222
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,192
Father wants to see us...

223
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,580
Stop right there!

224
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,379
Dr Park?

225
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:57,184
Are you here, Dr Park?

226
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,410
Thanks for everything, Chang-yi.

227
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,335
Goodbye.

228
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:25,372
What do you mean?

229
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:37,985
Hey, Park Hoon!

230
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:43,824
-Hoon!
-Chang-yi...

231
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,693
Have you seen Hoon?

232
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:48,095
Did something happen?

233
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:49,963
He's driving me crazy!

234
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,999
Where on Earth is he going?

235
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,100
Going where?

236
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:16,699
Why are we here?

237
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,959
I don't want to know
why you're in South Korea.

238
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,838
But I know it's something dangerous.

239
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:22,772
Hoon...

240
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:25,246
And I know you can't avoid it here.

241
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:26,973
Are you going to...

242
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,103
I'll protect you.

243
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:31,467
Hoon!

244
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,359
I once smuggled myself out of here before.

245
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,448
I called this morning, and they said
there is a freighter leaving right now.

246
00:24:58,765 --> 00:24:59,833
We can't do this, Hoon.

247
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,069
We must go back.

248
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:05,365
-Why?
-We will never be able to escape.

249
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:08,375
Trust me.

250
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,119
I'll protect you.

251
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,020
Hoon...

252
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:11,954
Don't worry.

253
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,480
I asked a trustworthy person.

254
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:15,415
Dr Park!

255
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:18,318
Sir. Long time no see.

256
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:20,089
Is she the one?

257
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:23,433
-How about the ship?
-Everything is taken care of.

258
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:24,758
Let's go. The ship's leaving soon.

259
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:28,862
No, Hoon.

260
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,772
Look at me, Jae-hee.

261
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:45,812
Let's go.

262
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:56,623
Why is he not picking up his phone?

263
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:00,661
I told him to come in the afternoon!

264
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:02,029
That crazy little...

265
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,434
What is it?

266
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,114
Have you seen Dr Han?

267
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:12,840
Why are you looking for Dr Han here?

268
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:14,728
-She belongs on this team.
-I don't know.

269
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,757
The only thing I care about
right now is the party.

270
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:20,013
Where could she be?
She's not answering her phone.

271
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:22,549
She's not answering either?

272
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,596
Park Hoon has disappeared, Prime Minister.

273
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:38,432
Disappeared?

274
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,572
How about Han Seung-hee?

275
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:42,836
I am afraid they're together.

276
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:46,740
I wonder if they'll be able
to escape safely.

277
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:04,458
Run! Run away!

278
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:27,714
Hey, Park Hoon!

279
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,456
Long time no see.

280
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,033
Cha Jin-soo...

281
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,009
Do you want to leave?

282
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,581
I'll grant you your wish.

283
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:39,829
Why do you look so uncomfortable?
It'll just be a dinner.

284
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,356
I'm on call tonight.

285
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:44,491
I said I took care of all that!

286
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:46,951
What about you?

287
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:51,632
I don't care as long
as the gender ratio is favorable.

288
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:53,333
Opportunists!

289
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:57,704
I'm sure you're very well aware,
but there'll be a new head of cardiology.

290
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:01,808
I'm sure you'll make a wise decision.
Okay?

291
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,591
-Is Hoon here?
-Not yet.

292
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:10,325
Why is he not picking up his phone?

293
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,488
Hey, tell him to call me if you find him!

294
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:20,603
International credit rating agencies
are considering downgrading

295
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:23,697
South Korea's rating
due to the North's nuclear testing.

296
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:29,069
What are you doing?

297
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:30,804
What do I do, Mom?

298
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:33,307
Is something wrong?

299
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,276
Hoon disappeared all of a sudden.

300
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:39,112
Dr Park? Why?

301
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,814
I don't know why.

302
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:43,717
What if he was kidnapped
back to North Korea?

303
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,419
What are you talking about?

304
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,055
Why would they kidnap Dr Park?

305
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:50,339
Because there's something like that!

306
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,435
What do I do?

307
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:54,803
What if he's really kidnapped?

308
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:57,331
What do I do?

309
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:57,225
How does it feel to be back home?

310
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,793
Where is Jae-hee?

311
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:03,830
Where is Jae-hee?

312
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:17,783
Jae-hee, everything will be all right.

313
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:23,650
Stop it!

314
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,437
Stop it!

315
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:39,542
Stop it, you little punk!

316
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:41,034
I'll kill you!

317
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:52,246
Stop it!

318
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:01,154
Stop it!

319
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:05,910
It's all my fault!

320
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,518
I'll do anything you want! Please stop!

321
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:31,618
Don't worry, Jae-hee... I will...

322
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:49,770
Listen to me carefully.

323
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,843
First, you must operate
on Jang Seok-joo's heart.

324
00:32:57,177 --> 00:33:02,716
Second, nobody can find out
that Han Seung-hee is Song Jae-hee.

325
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:08,922
Third, always remember
that I'm watching you.

326
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:18,799
You're supposed to say, "Yes, sir!"

327
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,134
Dr Park.

328
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:24,605
Yes... sir.

329
00:33:25,691 --> 00:33:27,435
Yes, sir. Understood.

330
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:13,086
Good job.

331
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:17,491
I'm going back.

332
00:34:58,065 --> 00:35:01,368
Once people find out that they're
both missing, things will be bad.

333
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:02,918
You wasted too much time.

334
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:07,007
Don't you think it was all worth it?

335
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:09,719
Worth it?

336
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,228
I need to see what Song Jae-hee
means to him.

337
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:18,990
That means that we have full control
of the heart that he'll be operating on.

338
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:31,331
Why are they testing their nukes
if they agreed to have a summit?

339
00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:36,308
North Korea wants to have
the summit as soon as possible.

340
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:39,782
If you tell them you're still willing
to meet them,

341
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:42,376
I think this nuclear incident
will quiet down.

342
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:44,378
I can't do it in this situation.

343
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,790
I heard that North Korea
wants something in return.

344
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,125
Is that why?

345
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:51,952
They want two billion dollars
for meeting with me.

346
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:56,023
Two billion dollars is...
two trillion Won.

347
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,634
We can feed children

348
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:01,003
in underprivileged families
for 10 years with that money.

349
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:04,131
But that's only around
five percent of our defense budget.

350
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:07,910
It'll help secure peace
on the peninsula and votes for you...

351
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,703
Stop talking nonsense!

352
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:13,750
Don't you know that we'll have to pay up
every time they ask if we agree to this?

353
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:17,553
What about revealing this to the public
and polling voters for their opinion?

354
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:19,622
There are some things
that voters don't need to know.

355
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:24,818
The division of public opinion on whether
to give or not will only add to the chaos.

356
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:29,618
But a tense situation like this
is only hurting your popularity.

357
00:36:30,224 --> 00:36:33,660
Do you want me to waste taxpayers' money
to maintain my popularity?

358
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:53,580
How can you run a country
if you're that cheap, President Hong?

359
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,663
But peace that's bought with money
never lasts, Prime Minister.

360
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:03,023
Anything can be bought with money.

361
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,526
Don't you realize?

362
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:08,820
We live in an age
in which we can buy wars with money.

363
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,494
And that's why Korea needs a leader
who is well aware of that.

364
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:23,177
How's Park Hoon?

365
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,811
He went back to the hospital.

366
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:26,246
Keep an eye on him.

367
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,882
At this rate, the whole thing
might be over.

368
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:30,049
Yes, sir.

369
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:38,058
Okay.

370
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,195
Prime Minister.

371
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,259
Hoon!

372
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:16,330
Hoon! Hey, Park Hoon!

373
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,267
Hoon!

374
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:22,716
Hoon!

375
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:28,408
Hoon!

376
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:33,280
Hoon!

377
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:43,310
Hoon!

378
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:49,730
Jae-hee!

379
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:53,333
Jae-hee!

380
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:01,521
Why did you turn off your phone?

381
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,481
Jae-hee!

382
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,789
Do you know how much
I worried about you?

383
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,485
Hello?

384
00:39:28,902 --> 00:39:30,470
Hey, Dr Park!

385
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:31,647
Who is this?

386
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:33,874
Who else? It's the quack.

387
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:35,809
Hang up.

388
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,712
Why aren't you coming?
Everone is here.

389
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:41,715
Everyone?

390
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:44,284
Is Dr Han there?

391
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,053
Dr Han?

392
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:04,879
She's here.

393
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:18,218
You told me you were going somewhere.
Why were you sleeping in the car?

394
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,532
Is that Jae-hee's car?

395
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:24,625
That's an expensive car
to buy with her mission budget.

396
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:26,426
Be quiet.

397
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:27,794
What do you mean?

398
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:29,029
Jae-hee is a spy!

399
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,465
-Do you want me to shut up about it?
-She's not a spy!

400
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:34,234
If she's not a spy,
how can she be here right now?

401
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:35,302
Why did she change her name?

402
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:37,004
Didn't you say that you saw her
with the Prime Minister?

403
00:40:37,095 --> 00:40:38,372
Why would a spy be
with the Prime Minister?

404
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:39,921
Maybe he's a spy, too!

405
00:40:58,325 --> 00:40:59,193
What?

406
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:00,896
Don't ever show your face to me again.

407
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:02,588
Why not?

408
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,767
I am sick and tired of you.

409
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:10,247
Same for me. So get lost.

410
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,721
Hey!

411
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:39,199
You want another chance?

412
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:41,468
That's correct, Prime Minister.

413
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:44,638
I don't quite understand.

414
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,140
You graduated from Harvard.

415
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:50,043
I'm sure other hospitals besides
Myung-woo will be happy to hire you.

416
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,649
I'm not saying that Myung-woo
is a bad place.

417
00:41:56,316 --> 00:42:00,821
But I'm sure there are many place
where you can achieve your dreams.

418
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,390
It's because I want to win.

419
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,260
You want to win...

420
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,162
I am begging you, sir.

421
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,298
Please give me another chance.

422
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:18,505
I'm sorry, but it'll be awkward for me to
meddle with Myung-woo's internal affairs.

423
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,013
You've come all the way here.
You can finish your tea before you leave.

424
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:31,514
You made Myung-woo accept Park Hoon
after he was kicked out.

425
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,890
Why do you think that?

426
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:50,538
The Chairman is not someone who will
take back someone after kicking him out.

427
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:57,711
So it means that there is someone else
who changed the Chairman's mind.

428
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,357
You're very imaginative.

429
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:06,024
I won't ask why you did that.

430
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:12,367
I'm only asking to be given
the same chance that you gave Dr Park.

431
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:20,232
I am begging you, Prime Minister.

432
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:49,263
What an arrogant ass!
How dare he threaten me?

433
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:51,498
There is something you should see.

434
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,741
-What is this?
-It's about Dr Han Jae-joon.

435
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:57,771
I don't want to see it.

436
00:43:57,862 --> 00:44:00,761
Han Jae-joon isn't his real name.

437
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,164
Dr Park! Why are you so late?

438
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:00,808
Dr Park!

439
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:10,820
Dr Park!

440
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,250
Where are you going?

441
00:45:17,651 --> 00:45:19,061
You just got here, Dr Park!

442
00:45:19,152 --> 00:45:20,860
-Dr Park!
-Go get him!

443
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:23,966
-Let go of me!
-Come!

444
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,359
Where are we going?

445
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,310
Wherever.

446
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:30,631
Still don't know
after what we've been through?

447
00:45:30,722 --> 00:45:32,165
No, I don't.

448
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,401
Let's go inside.

449
00:45:34,492 --> 00:45:36,363
If those people find out...

450
00:45:36,913 --> 00:45:39,382
-We can leave now.
-We can't!

451
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:40,674
We can just go hide!

452
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:42,251
How will they find us in this big world?

453
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:43,501
They will.

454
00:45:44,178 --> 00:45:46,208
They'll find us no matter what.

455
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:49,058
Then let's go to the police.

456
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:50,250
Turn yourself in.

457
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:52,052
Do you think a prison cell
will be any safer?

458
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:53,663
At least you won't be killed!

459
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,678
The South Korean Prime Minister
is on their side!

460
00:45:57,556 --> 00:45:59,693
Nowhere on Earth is safe for us.

461
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:02,329
So let's go inside.

462
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:05,032
It might be dangerous if people see you.

463
00:46:07,668 --> 00:46:09,403
I didn't ask you to worry about me.

464
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:11,463
How can I not worry about you?

465
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:15,412
Jae-hee...

466
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,344
Please, let's go inside.

467
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:19,046
I am begging you, Hoon.

468
00:46:19,745 --> 00:46:20,872
I don't want to. Let's go.

469
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:24,218
We can run away together.

470
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:25,823
I can protect you.

471
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,361
Do you know how much I missed you?

472
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:39,718
Do you know how long I waited to see you?

473
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:43,403
Jae-hee...

474
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:46,507
And we just reunited after all that.

475
00:46:47,546 --> 00:46:48,942
Why aren't you listening to me?

476
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,337
I don't want to part from you again.

477
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:59,348
I don't want you to be in danger.

478
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:10,025
So you must listen to me, stupid!

479
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,701
Fine.

480
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,567
I'll do whatever you want.

481
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,248
What should we do?

482
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:30,517
Should we go inside and have fun?

483
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:35,223
U.S. Department of Homeland Security

484
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:41,299
-Is this all true?
-Yes, sir.

485
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:43,059
Everything has been verified

486
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,325
by the U.S. Immigration Services
and the adoption agency.

487
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,127
His real name is Lee Sung-hoon.

488
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:52,976
His father died due to malpractice
at Myung-woo 20 years ago.

489
00:48:54,314 --> 00:48:56,510
Then, by any chance...

490
00:48:56,601 --> 00:49:00,249
That malpractice suit for Park Cheol

491
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,113
was for Han Jae-joon's father.

492
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:20,494
Why did you let him in?

493
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:24,298
He begged me so much.

494
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:26,033
Send him away!

495
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:31,872
I am begging you, Mr Chairman.

496
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:36,310
You only continue to disappoint me.

497
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:41,038
At least you had some guts left
when you threatened to quit.

498
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:46,053
Please give me one more chance,
Mr Chairman.

499
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,762
Go.

500
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:53,402
Go!

501
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:55,471
I'm not leaving until you answer.

502
00:49:55,562 --> 00:49:59,012
Tell me why you killed my father.

503
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:00,977
Kill your father?

504
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:02,879
I'm a doctor who saves lives!

505
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,137
That's a lie!

506
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,306
You killed my father!

507
00:50:06,397 --> 00:50:07,908
What an unruly child!

508
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:10,944
Your dead father won't come back
even if you do this.

509
00:50:11,035 --> 00:50:12,079
Go away.

510
00:50:41,842 --> 00:50:44,344
This is all that brat Soo-hyun's fault.

511
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:47,014
Because she sided with Park Hoon.

512
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:49,416
You haven't done anything good.
So be quiet.

513
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,058
Hello?

514
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:00,247
What?

515
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:04,898
It's the Prime Minister's Office.

516
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:10,613
How may I help you, Prime Minister?

517
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:13,581
Dr Han Jae-joon stopped by
my office today.

518
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:15,251
That little punk...

519
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:19,179
Why don't you just give him
another chance?

520
00:51:19,646 --> 00:51:22,284
With all due respect,
I don't think you should

521
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:23,953
get involved with the hospital's affairs.

522
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:28,818
After all, this is about fixing my heart.

523
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,902
I already declared the winner
based on the last surgeries' results.

524
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:36,118
People change their minds
quite often these days.

525
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:40,100
I'm not a politician, Prime Minister.

526
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:42,536
That's a negative connotation,
isn't it, Mr Chairman?

527
00:51:42,627 --> 00:51:43,971
Do you think so?

528
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:48,452
Anyway, I do not wish to renege
on my decision again.

529
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:50,744
Okay.

530
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:52,412
Then how about this?

531
00:51:52,913 --> 00:51:55,449
I'll make a good excuse for you.

532
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:56,917
A good excuse?

533
00:51:57,008 --> 00:52:02,665
I'll help you to save face
while retaining your faithful dog.

534
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:07,261
Then, I'll assume that you agreed with me.

535
00:52:07,352 --> 00:52:09,392
I'll let you know of the plan soon.

536
00:52:10,512 --> 00:52:11,996
Good night.

537
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:46,867
They looked at Dr Han Seung-hee's
medical records?

538
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:50,437
Dr Moon blackmailed a staff member.

539
00:52:50,528 --> 00:52:52,561
You should've reported that to me!

540
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:56,327
Didn't you know
that leaking medical records is a crime?

541
00:52:56,777 --> 00:52:57,878
I'm sorry, sir.

542
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,640
It's just that Dr Choi said
he'll take care of it.

543
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,285
Dr Choi?

544
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,152
And Dr Han herself was willing
to let it slide.

545
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:07,788
I'm sorry nonetheless, sir.

546
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:13,836
Really?

547
00:53:13,927 --> 00:53:16,615
I'm scared that I'll be fired for this.

548
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:20,534
I think Park Hoon is the one
who's getting fired.

549
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,140
What are you still doing here?

550
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:44,052
-Should I tell him to come inside?
-No.

551
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:45,692
Why?

552
00:53:45,783 --> 00:53:48,304
We now have cause to kick Dr Moon
and Park Hoon out of the hospital.

553
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,665
I must break him.

554
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:54,234
Now that I got to look at him again, he
looks like he might bite his own master.

555
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:55,261
Dr Han?

556
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:01,513
If you want me to stay here,
you must make another chance for me.

557
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:06,326
I must teach him once and for all
to never rebel against me.

558
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:13,563
By the way, Father,
how did Prime Minister Jang know

559
00:54:13,654 --> 00:54:15,662
that Park Hoon
browsed through the medical records?

560
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:20,827
That's right.

561
00:54:22,062 --> 00:54:23,315
I see, sir.

562
00:54:37,077 --> 00:54:38,288
What was the call about?

563
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:40,403
The hospital.

564
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:42,449
Do they want you to come in?

565
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:43,959
No.

566
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,580
I'll get going then.

567
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,225
Why don't you stay a bit longer?

568
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:55,151
I thought your neighbor
was taking care of Seung-min, too.

569
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:57,064
I feel uncomfortable.

570
00:54:58,532 --> 00:55:02,685
Everyone looks sad except Dr Moon.

571
00:55:09,209 --> 00:55:12,054
-Go for it! Bring it on!
-Okay.

572
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:13,296
Great!

573
00:56:15,943 --> 00:56:18,444
Do you think the Chairman
will change his mind?

574
00:56:19,947 --> 00:56:21,081
He has to.

575
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:24,251
Then what about Park Hoon
and Han Jae-joon?

576
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:28,622
The score between them right now
is one to nothing.

577
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:46,394
I told you to go home.

578
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,712
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

579
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:53,492
Everything's my fault, Mr Chairman.

580
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:57,050
Please give me another chance.

581
00:57:00,187 --> 00:57:02,122
Why are you going to these lengths?

582
00:57:07,794 --> 00:57:09,427
You have no shame!

583
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:12,633
Your dead father won't come back
even if you do this.

584
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:13,700
Go home!

585
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,804
Why did you kill my father?

586
00:57:17,895 --> 00:57:22,058
I still have unfinished business
at Myung-woo.

587
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:24,378
Unfinished business?

588
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:25,612
Bring my dad back!

589
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:26,647
Yes, sir.

590
00:57:27,814 --> 00:57:29,859
I want to make Myung-woo
the best hospital in the world.

591
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,385
I'll make you pay for this!

592
00:57:31,476 --> 00:57:32,363
Get him away from me!

593
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,758
I don't want to lose Soo-hyun.

594
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:40,903
I'll seek revenge at any cost!

595
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:42,196
Please give me another chance.

596
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:47,276
If you give me another chance,
I'll give everything I have to serve you.

597
00:57:47,367 --> 00:57:49,445
I'll get revenge!

598
00:57:49,536 --> 00:57:52,201
So please give me another chance.

599
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:56,419
I am begging you!

600
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,344
Never forget!

601
00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:58,278
I, Han Jae-joon...

602
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:01,124
My father is Lee Do-sun,
and I'm Lee Sung-hoon!

603
00:58:01,215 --> 00:58:02,349
Never forget our names!

604
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:06,854
For Myung-woo...

605
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:09,489
Remember the person who will seek revenge!

606
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,523
...I would like to finish
my unfinished business.

607
00:58:12,392 --> 00:58:14,695
Please give me another chance,
Mr Chairman!

608
00:58:16,296 --> 00:58:17,231
Please...

609
00:58:19,466 --> 00:58:23,101
Please give me one more chance!
