1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:34,001
EPISODE 4

3
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:30,510
Jae-hee...

4
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,228
Why are you so late?

5
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,463
I was checking on patient Kim Eun-hee.

6
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,355
Here's your coffee.

7
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:39,709
Thanks.

8
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,578
Hoon!

9
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:04,391
That was Jae-hee. I'm sure.

10
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,526
You will understand when you get old.
Running like this can kill me!

11
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,133
You made this, didn't you?

12
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,205
So you know where Jae-hee is, don't you?

13
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,575
If I know where she is,
I would have told you already!

14
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,678
You're trying to swindle me! Where is she?

15
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,114
Are you sure you saw her?

16
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,224
I am sure!

17
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,685
You must have mistaken someone else
for her!

18
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,287
-What?
-Don't you think so?

19
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:36,557
Just one phone call will allow you
to find anyone in South Korea.

20
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,027
If Jae-hee is here,
why hasn't she reached out to you?

21
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:48,869
Did you get at least some of the money?

22
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,640
-Not yet.
-At least try to get the deposit first.

23
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:59,555
My contacts say that girl
is in some sort of special camp.

24
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,881
A special camp?

25
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,341
It sounds like a dreadful place.

26
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,720
They say it should be top priority
to get her out.

27
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,731
How much?

28
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,324
USD 50,000 just for that.

29
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,603
Good job.

30
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,304
Of course.

31
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:31,578
But isn't that girl in North Korea?

32
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,947
If I tell you, I'll have to kill you.

33
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,262
I don't care selling it at a loss.

34
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,185
Please get me the money
as soon as possible.

35
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,637
How much do you need right now?

36
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:03,310
She told me that you need the money
to find your girl.

37
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,650
I didn't tell him everything, Hoon.

38
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:14,354
You need money to rescue someone you love!

39
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,006
That's a great romance!

40
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:21,128
So many people become fugitives
because of loan sharks!

41
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,473
I have no more business with you.
So please leave.

42
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,932
I like romance.

43
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,467
-It's pure.
-I said, get out!

44
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,346
USD 10,000!

45
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,040
USD 20,000!

46
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:39,847
USD 30,000!

47
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,202
USD 40,000!

48
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,317
-USD 50,000!
-USD 50,000!

49
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,689
Tempted? It's simple.

50
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,725
Just come join my surgery team.

51
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,436
A surgery team?

52
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,528
The best surgery team

53
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:56,597
of the cardiothoracic surgery department
at Myung-woo!

54
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,099
-Myung-woo Hospital...
-You don't want it?

55
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,049
Hoon!

56
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,504
Forget it if you don't want to.

57
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,121
Awesome!

58
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,186
Very good.

59
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,349
Are you angry with me?

60
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,885
How can I not be?

61
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,121
I'm the chief, and a member
of my own staff is leaving without notice.

62
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:23,023
I was going to tell you first.

63
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:29,196
Fine, tell me why you want to leave
the cardiothoracic surgery department?

64
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:34,968
Am I interrupting your date?

65
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,871
Let's talk later.

66
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:44,645
Knocking before entering
is a common etiquette.

67
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,248
Do you still think this room
belongs to you?

68
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,784
You're filling empty positions.

69
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,061
We're about to review candidates.

70
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,122
Then, can I recommend someone, too?

71
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,524
Next candidate.

72
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,360
He graduated from Johns Hopkins
Medical School.

73
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,705
He's young,
but has a lot of clinical experience.

74
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,398
And he also has published many papers

75
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,410
in cardiothoracic journals
in the U.S. and in Europe.

76
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:11,071
I understand that the cardiothoracic
department is short on doctors,

77
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,116
but isn't the budget the real problem?

78
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,009
The Chairman said he'll see
what he can do.

79
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,446
Then, I guess you just hire someone
that you like, Dr Han.

80
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,647
We don't need this meeting.

81
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,550
Can I recommend someone
as former head of the department?

82
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,460
-Of course.
-Great.

83
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,541
When it comes to selecting
a cardiothoracic surgeon,

84
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,295
the most important criterion should be
the candidate's surgical skills.

85
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:48,175
Please enjoy the superior surgical skills
of my candidate.

86
00:06:57,146 --> 00:07:00,220
How can there be no bleeding
performing an incision?

87
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,855
The human body is symmetrical.

88
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,912
If a highly-experienced surgeon
cuts the exact middle of the chest,

89
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:08,462
it's possible to cause no bleeding.

90
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:13,135
Not only is he precise,
he's also very fast.

91
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,869
He's definitely a top surgeon.

92
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,371
I agree.

93
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,008
His skills make me want to work with him.

94
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,986
So we all agree that he has
the surgical skills, right?

95
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,689
But I'd like to learn more
about his resume.

96
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,216
You don't need his resume.
I brought him here personally!

97
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:32,586
Come in, Dr Park!

98
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:54,041
Hello, quack.

99
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,412
15TH DIRECTOR
Choi Byung-cheol

100
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:07,554
Director Choi!

101
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,434
I can't believe you're here.

102
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,793
It's been so long!

103
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,963
I guess it's been about six months,
Mr Chairman.

104
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:17,030
Please sit.

105
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:24,447
Can you just leave your post for six
months even if you're nearing retirement?

106
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,574
What have you been up to
without even telling me?

107
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,045
I'm preparing for the final chapter
of my life.

108
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,581
You're still young and healthy.
That's nonsense.

109
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:40,596
By the way, Mr Chairman, I heard
you're looking to hire new doctors.

110
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,423
Why? Do you want to recommend someone?

111
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,394
Didn't I warn you
not to come here ever again?

112
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,598
Well, I guess things just happened.

113
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,136
Which medical school did you go to,
if you don't mind me asking?

114
00:08:56,746 --> 00:09:00,541
The police's job is to catch thieves,
and the doctor's job is to heal patients.

115
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:03,052
Why is it so important to know
which medical school he went to?

116
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,606
This practice of preferential treatment
based on academia must end!

117
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:09,950
We're living in modern Korea,
21st century!

118
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,286
It's not that I am judging
based on his school.

119
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,256
Shouldn't we at least know where he
studied if we're going to work together?

120
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,345
Fine. Just tell them!

121
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,179
I graduated
from Pyeongyang Medical School.

122
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,972
Yes, Pyeongyang Med School...

123
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:38,512
North Korea? Pyeongyang?

124
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,961
A doctor from North Korea?

125
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,401
Did he say he's from North Korea?

126
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,202
Why don't we get out of here, too?

127
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:08,609
Dr Han, North Korean doctors
are doctors, too.

128
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,710
Don't you think so?

129
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,923
Professor Moon, may I ask whom he will be
operating on if he joins your team?

130
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,282
That'd be the prime minister...

131
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:23,245
The prime minister of South Korea will let
a North Korean refugee fix his heart?

132
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,910
You think that makes sense?

133
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:43,210
A North Korean refugee?

134
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,847
No sane patient would let a North Korean
refugee to operate on him!

135
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:52,019
Darn it.

136
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,127
My money!

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,104
This is all you get.
It should be enough for gas for your trip.

138
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:18,315
Are you actually picking it up?
Oh, my goodness.

139
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:23,086
You ran away alone to save your own ass,
and you want to save your love?

140
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:30,494
You're just some trash that's willing
to sell your soul for money! Money will...

141
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:32,996
That's right, I'll sell my soul for money.

142
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:35,065
I need it.

143
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,734
I can give my entire body
and soul for this.

144
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,636
Why? Can't I do that?

145
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:41,705
What's wrong with that?

146
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:53,216
If you want to make money,
start a business instead.

147
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,285
Where's your pride as a doctor?

148
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,962
My pride?

149
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,867
I guess pride is important to
a quack like you.

150
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,189
What?

151
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:08,465
A doctor's pride doesn't come
from this coat.

152
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:10,534
Do you understand, quack?

153
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:13,036
Are you done speaking?

154
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:47,270
Ta-da! To celebrate your new job.

155
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,743
Forget it. You can keep them.

156
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:17,610
So? Did you get the job?

157
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:20,637
Well, it didn't go so well.

158
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,175
Are you happy now?

159
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:39,575
Who is it?

160
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,391
It's me, Professor Moon.

161
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,063
I'm sorry, Mr Chairman.
I didn't know it was you.

162
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,765
Come see me.

163
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:54,204
Do you really want to hire Park Hoon?

164
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,840
He definitely has proven himself.

165
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,388
Do you have any openings on your team?

166
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:05,081
Yes, I'm sure he has a place for him.

167
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,256
This team will operate
on the prime minister's heart.

168
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,892
How can we include a North Korean refugee?

169
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:19,191
Then, how about your team, Professor Moon?

170
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:20,639
You're the one who brought him.

171
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,968
Mr Chairman, I did recommend him,
but I don't think I can anymore...

172
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:27,282
Fine. Both of you, listen.

173
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:29,940
I guess competition
always motivates everyone.

174
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:31,108
Competition?

175
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,852
The competition between Dr Han's team

176
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:36,308
and Professor Moon's team
to represent this hospital.

177
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:39,792
Mr Chairman, I'd like to remove myself
from the competition.

178
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,016
The judging will be simple.

179
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:43,720
A plus for every successful surgery,
and a minus for unsuccessful surgery.

180
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:45,173
What do you think?

181
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:46,968
Mr Chairman...

182
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,831
There will be a reward
for the winning team.

183
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:54,798
But I guess that also means
that the losers will face a penalty.

184
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,381
You think you can be my match?

185
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:23,527
Hey. Hyung-wook!

186
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,235
Byeong-cheol, what are you doing here?
What brings you here?

187
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:36,140
-You're still the same.
-Of course!

188
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:43,155
Take good care of your mother.

189
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,748
Should I move her to your clinic?

190
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:46,392
Have her stay here.

191
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:47,818
I'm getting out of my lease.

192
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:48,975
What?

193
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:58,028
That's your only source of income!

194
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:02,999
No, I veto this decision
as a partial investor!

195
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:07,938
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:09,739
But I really need some cash.

197
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:32,529
Why did you change your mind
all of a sudden?

198
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,639
Well...

199
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,867
Prime Minister Jang Seok-joo
owes one to Park Hoon?

200
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:40,837
Yes. You know that I was
his main physician, don't you?

201
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:42,381
Of course I do.

202
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:45,984
So just trust me
and do your best with him.

203
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:48,745
No specific reason.

204
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:52,449
I guess I'm just a generous person.

205
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,220
I mean, don't take it
if you don't want to.

206
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:04,995
In return, you must serve me
like your master. Okay?

207
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,064
-My master?
-Okay. That.

208
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:13,879
Let's make this clear.

209
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,816
You're not my master.
This is my master.

210
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:20,110
That's inappropriate!
That's my money after all.

211
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,713
Fine! My master. I'm at your service.

212
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:24,748
Prepare for war.

213
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:30,620
We're going to have a bloody war
against Han Jae-joon starting now.

214
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:34,137
Yes, tonight.

215
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:38,361
Call everyone
including third-year resident and up.

216
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:40,230
What about Dr Yang?

217
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:44,334
Forget him.

218
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:48,605
Dr Yang will be busy.

219
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:54,650
Let's put our past behind us
and start over, okay?

220
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:59,483
Dr Park!
Meet the first assistant on our...

221
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:04,955
I told him to stay here!
Where did he wander off to?

222
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,048
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

223
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:24,684
I'll pay once you get Jae-hee
out of that special camp.

224
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:27,310
I need to send them the money first
to get her out!

225
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:29,179
Get her out first and show me
the evidence.

226
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,914
Otherwise, there won't be a penny for you.

227
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:32,682
You are really...

228
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:33,940
MR MONEY

229
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:38,121
Don't you dare swindle me!
It could be a USD 50,000 job!

230
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:41,992
That little brat!

231
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,082
PATIENT TRANSFER CERTIFICATE

232
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:46,465
MYUNG-WOO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

233
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:52,016
What happened?

234
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,807
She came to my hospital last month.

235
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,610
I couldn't believe it
in the beginning either.

236
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,014
Does Soo-hyun know?

237
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:11,430
Do you have the blood test results
for the patient in room 1101?

238
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,023
They said it'll come in tomorrow.

239
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,825
Would you please tell them to hurry?

240
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,393
Hello, Ms Quack!

241
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:19,529
What are you doing here?

242
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:22,199
I'm trying to learn how quack doctors
write charts.

243
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:24,067
And why are you learning the charts?

244
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:25,836
I work here from today, quack.

245
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:27,013
Who said you can?

246
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:28,839
The boss told me, quack.

247
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:32,142
Pick up the phone.

248
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,485
-Dr Oh, cardiothoracic...
-Good job, quack!

249
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:48,558
What's wrong, quack?
Are your hands itching to strike?

250
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:53,497
No, but my feet are itching.

251
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,598
What?

252
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:09,412
That little...

253
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:19,589
The cancer that started in her lungs
has spread to her heart.

254
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,593
If we operate on her,
she might die of a hemorrhage.

255
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:26,472
She must be in a lot of pain.

256
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:29,900
We're giving her oxycodone,
but it's probably still very painful.

257
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:31,635
What about surgery?

258
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:35,972
It's so dangerous that we can't even
guess the chance of success.

259
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:41,987
He's totally uncontrollable!

260
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:44,757
There are many great doctors
other than him.

261
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:46,383
Please reconsider.

262
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:48,218
The decision has been made.

263
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:49,853
But...

264
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,128
I'm here, Dad!

265
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:03,133
My dear Dr Oh is here!

266
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,302
I'm busy. Let go of my hand!

267
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,138
No matter how busy you are,
you must receive my gift!

268
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,092
Do you like it?

269
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:33,296
Terminal lung cancer.

270
00:21:34,197 --> 00:21:35,398
A week tops?

271
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:38,902
Why aren't you saying anything?

272
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:41,404
Is it that touching?

273
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:44,641
This is all you can do?

274
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:45,976
All I can do?

275
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:49,913
She's your biological mother!
She only has a week to live!

276
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:50,947
So?

277
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,295
Did you expect me
to completely break down?

278
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:57,830
She's your mother!

279
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:03,102
I believe my mother is at a spa now
after a round of golf with friends.

280
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:05,028
That's my mother!

281
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,863
Well, I'm sorry, Mr Director.

282
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,710
I can only imagine all the hassle you
have gone through to get this woman here.

283
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,135
This... woman?

284
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:33,557
When did Kim Eun-hee
in room 1125 get here?

285
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:35,826
This morning.

286
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:37,890
Do you know who her guardian is?

287
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:39,863
Why are you asking me that?

288
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:42,499
She signed the Do Not Resuscitate order.

289
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:44,134
The DNR order?

290
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:46,618
By law, we can't perform CPR on her
once her heart stops.

291
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:49,673
So we will just let her die?

292
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,843
That's the reason why she signed it.

293
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:54,544
That doesn't make any sense.

294
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:56,880
She signed it a long time ago.

295
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:58,882
-Her guardian can...
-Don't do anything stupid.

296
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:32,215
Is this patient completely unconscious?

297
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,193
She wakes up occasionally...

298
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:35,218
Wake her up.

299
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:37,229
Right now?

300
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,822
I need to ask her a question.

301
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:40,924
Hurry up.

302
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:45,729
Ms Kim?

303
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:47,931
Ms Kim!

304
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,635
Mrs Kim?

305
00:24:15,525 --> 00:24:20,097
Mom, I graduated
from Myung-woo Medical School!

306
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,832
I also got licensed as a doctor.

307
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,534
I can make a lot of money now!

308
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:27,871
So I want to live with you...

309
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:33,877
Mom... I'm so tired of that family.

310
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:40,117
That will pass. Go home.

311
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:07,978
Dr Han, we want you to give a speech!

312
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:11,323
I thought this was only
for third-year residents and up!

313
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:13,016
Then, how did an anesthesiologist
like you,

314
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:14,894
Dr Eun, end up at a cardiology dinner?

315
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:17,387
Dr Han told me to come.

316
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:20,657
Thank you.

317
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,594
Then, give it up for Dr Han!

318
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:32,569
People will talk about me later
if I speak for too long.

319
00:25:34,704 --> 00:25:41,711
We are all brothers and sisters here.
It is my wish that we're family.

320
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,685
-The end.
-Short and sweet! Applause!

321
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:51,388
Now we have to toast!

322
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,768
Let's raise our glasses.

323
00:25:58,247 --> 00:25:59,229
Dr Oh...

324
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:06,236
I'm sorry.

325
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:09,448
For the cardiothoracic surgery department!

326
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,027
Cheers!

327
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:34,664
Code Blue, Cardiothoracic Department,
room 25, ward 11.

328
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:46,676
Get a defibrillator ready.

329
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:49,279
She signed the DNR order, doctor.

330
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,656
We can't just let her die like this!

331
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,616
Bring the defibrillator!

332
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,753
Where are you going all of a sudden?

333
00:26:57,254 --> 00:26:59,156
I'm sorry. Something came up.

334
00:26:59,348 --> 00:27:00,257
Where?

335
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,759
I need to go. I'm so sorry.

336
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:19,476
-One more time.
-But, doctor...

337
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:20,444
Hurry up!

338
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:29,252
Again.

339
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:50,674
Two hundred Joules.

340
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:53,603
She signed Do Not Resuscitate order.

341
00:29:20,197 --> 00:29:21,231
Dr Oh?

342
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:25,402
Is she dead?

343
00:29:28,105 --> 00:29:29,005
Oh, Ms Kim?

344
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:32,476
She's in the ICU now.

345
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,583
What is it?

346
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:15,673
What is it this time?

347
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:18,964
Didn't you know that she signed the DNR?

348
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:20,357
How can I just let her die?

349
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,192
The patient wanted to die!

350
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:23,994
She signed it a long time ago.

351
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,864
Maybe she wanted to die since then.

352
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,495
-What?
-Don't you know?

353
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:34,004
Terminal cancer patients must endure
unbearable pain even after

354
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:36,048
the limitless amounts of painkillers
we put in them.

355
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:38,041
That's why she signed
the order not to revive her!

356
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:43,180
But because of you, she must endure
the pain again because of you.

357
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:47,584
You may have a point.

358
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:50,663
But if she didn't have a desire to live,
my CPR wouldn't have worked anyway.

359
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:51,955
A desire to live?

360
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,359
She's barely breathing on life support.
What desire could she have?

361
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:12,409
What's the relationship
between the quack and Ms Kim?

362
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,077
The quack?

363
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,080
Nevermind.

364
00:31:18,014 --> 00:31:19,316
Would you like to try this?

365
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,348
MYUNG-WOO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

366
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,926
Pyeongtaek Myung-woo Hospital.
Han Seung-hee speaking.

367
00:32:41,498 --> 00:32:43,200
I'm going to the emergency room, Ms Hong.

368
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:46,269
How can I help you?

369
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:48,214
Is Dr Han Seung-hee still there?

370
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:49,506
Dr Han?

371
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:56,088
She just left the room.
May I take a message?

372
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:57,957
It's in regard to a patient
named Kim Eun-hee.

373
00:32:58,048 --> 00:32:59,272
Kim Eun-hee?

374
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:01,351
That lady?

375
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:05,956
-You know her?
-Of course. Her room was in my ward.

376
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:10,060
Then, do you know who made her bracelet?

377
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:44,895
Yes, the leather one. It's red.

378
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:46,530
That's probably not hers.

379
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:50,133
She wasn't fond of accessories,
so she never wore them.

380
00:33:54,337 --> 00:33:55,781
Then how about her legal guardian?

381
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:57,216
Legal guardian?

382
00:33:57,307 --> 00:34:00,410
I don't think she has any family.

383
00:34:02,512 --> 00:34:03,956
No guardian?

384
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:07,517
Yes, she was alone ever since
she was admitted here.

385
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:10,442
Why are you looking for her guardian?

386
00:34:33,376 --> 00:34:34,920
China has managed to become

387
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:38,181
a super power with its economy
and military powers.

388
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:41,249
Now it is going shoulder-to-shoulder
with the United States.

389
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,196
And Japan is trying to revise
their constitution

390
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:47,724
to expand the role of their defense force.

391
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:49,435
Understanding this geopolitical situation,

392
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:51,771
this strife with our brethren in the North
can't last forever.

393
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:54,765
Rumor has it that the president

394
00:34:54,856 --> 00:34:57,968
is secretly preparing
for a South-North summit.

395
00:34:58,059 --> 00:34:59,703
Is that so?

396
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:03,816
Then, every South Korean citizen,
regardless of their political affiliation,

397
00:35:03,907 --> 00:35:05,408
should be behind the effort unreservedly.

398
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:08,712
How about the bribery charges
from the last primary race?

399
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:10,781
I have never heard about it before.

400
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:13,895
Rumor has it that the Prosecutor's Office
has been looking into it quietly.

401
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:16,453
Really?

402
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:18,364
If the Prosecutor's Office
opens an inquiry,

403
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:21,408
everyone, including myself,
should comply with the office.

404
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:29,966
Please enjoy the rest of your dinner.
I'm afraid I must step out.

405
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:31,482
Enjoy.

406
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:43,380
Someone from
the Central Prosecutor's Office was here.

407
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:46,392
What do they want?

408
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:48,452
It's about the origin
of your primary campaign funds.

409
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:53,615
I wonder if he should have flipped
the table right after the primary.

410
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:58,204
So this is how he's going to treat me

411
00:35:58,295 --> 00:36:00,430
after giving me
a lousy prime minister position.

412
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:15,679
Is it true that you bribed someone?

413
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,647
We heard that the inquiry
was sent to you on paper.

414
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:19,015
Why did you come here in person?

415
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:20,584
Are you responsible for all of this?

416
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:21,785
Any comments?

417
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:29,235
I want to be clear that the prime minister
had nothing to do with this.

418
00:36:29,326 --> 00:36:33,597
I also promise to fully comply
with the investigation.

419
00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:36,576
Please elaborate.

420
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:53,826
Can we do this in the staff lounge?

421
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:55,961
We shouldn't, but that's what makes it
even more fun.

422
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:57,396
You don't want to do it?

423
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:58,422
Of course, I do.

424
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,372
Is it good?

425
00:37:06,463 --> 00:37:07,664
What's so good?

426
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,483
Dr Keum, you should've knocked first.

427
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:20,143
What kind of person are you?

428
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:22,679
Professor Moon is here!

429
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:26,850
Hey! Where is Park Hoon?

430
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:29,934
You don't know?

431
00:37:33,557 --> 00:37:34,767
Come!

432
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,027
Are you out of your mind?

433
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:38,995
Why are you operating a patient
who will die soon?

434
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:41,031
I'm not operating her now
when there's an emergency...

435
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:43,667
Is that patient your lost love?

436
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:47,246
Your reviving a DNR patient
is crazy enough.

437
00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:48,250
I won't allow it!

438
00:37:48,341 --> 00:37:50,474
She can live without the life support
if I succeed!

439
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:51,741
Are you a god?

440
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:53,477
How can you save a patient like this?

441
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:55,321
I want to save her.

442
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:56,313
Why?

443
00:37:59,316 --> 00:38:02,652
Fine. I don't know
why you want to do this.

444
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:05,498
But she's not in a condition
to survive such a big surgery.

445
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:06,890
She'll die on the operating table.

446
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:08,901
I'll save her.

447
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:11,228
-I need to ask her a question.
-Ask what?

448
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:14,498
I'll operate on her no matter what.

449
00:38:21,671 --> 00:38:23,440
So stubborn!

450
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:35,685
Is she the reason
you left early last night?

451
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:46,096
She's the same patient
that I saw with Mr Chairman.

452
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:48,064
The Chairman saw her?

453
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:50,367
He asked my opinion on operating on her.

454
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:53,136
What did you tell him?

455
00:38:55,906 --> 00:38:57,040
You can see for yourself.

456
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:02,345
I told him it's so dangerous,
we can't guess the chance of success.

457
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:05,816
But can you please operate on her?

458
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:09,886
Do you want me to give a point
to Professor Moon's team?

459
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:14,891
We're competing
against Professor Moon's team.

460
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:20,011
Who is she anyway?

461
00:39:22,232 --> 00:39:23,266
My mother.

462
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:28,271
She's my biological mother.

463
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,078
Scalpel.

464
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:02,739
Bovie.

465
00:40:10,547 --> 00:40:11,648
Metzenbaum scissors.

466
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:16,586
Cut and suction.

467
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:19,961
Metzenbaum scissors.

468
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,101
Again!

469
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:36,840
Scalpel.

470
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:40,877
I want to know why you brought her here.

471
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:44,681
I loved her and she gave birth to you.

472
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:46,983
I couldn't just ignore her.

473
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,753
You're only buying time.

474
00:40:51,922 --> 00:40:54,091
A week tops, apparently.

475
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:57,794
I want to be there for her
until her final moments.

476
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:02,299
I want to relieve her from pain.

477
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:07,304
I'm taking her off life support.
Please approve.

478
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:08,705
Soo-hyun!

479
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:10,707
Let me do it.

480
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,963
From now on, I'm not your mother.

481
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:36,967
That man right there is your father.

482
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:45,718
You must do everything you can
to win his acknowledgement.

483
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:47,545
-Mom...
-Be quiet!

484
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:51,581
Don't ever cry. Okay?

485
00:41:58,588 --> 00:41:59,571
Go!

486
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:02,401
Don't ever come see me,

487
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:04,494
or ever acknowledge me
even if I come to see you!

488
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:15,298
I'd like to operate on her.

489
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:17,601
Is it because of Soo-hyun?

490
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,438
I can't approve.

491
00:43:22,105 --> 00:43:24,574
I don't want to cause her any more pain.

492
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:25,776
Mr Chairman...

493
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:29,045
If the patient dies during surgery,

494
00:43:29,136 --> 00:43:30,790
it'll disgrace
our cardiothoracic department!

495
00:43:30,881 --> 00:43:31,774
But...

496
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:34,684
Don't forget that you're competing
against Dr Park.

497
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:03,914
Just one more time.

498
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:33,136
Mom...

499
00:46:07,104 --> 00:46:08,638
OH SOO-HYUN

500
00:47:04,127 --> 00:47:07,104
Please save my dear Jae-hee.

501
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:17,340
No, Jae-hee.

502
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:19,418
My dear doctor...

503
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:21,178
Comrade Park Hoon...

504
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:25,081
Goodbye.

505
00:47:27,884 --> 00:47:29,286
Jae-hee!

506
00:47:57,848 --> 00:47:58,903
Go away.

507
00:47:59,382 --> 00:48:01,218
I don't have energy
to pick fights with you.

508
00:48:01,618 --> 00:48:02,753
Can you operate?

509
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:07,491
I'm asking you if you can operate on her.

510
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:09,392
I want to.

511
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:11,128
But I can't.

512
00:48:12,162 --> 00:48:13,230
What do you mean?

513
00:48:14,231 --> 00:48:15,732
The chance of success is too low.

514
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,968
Are you saying that there's a chance?

515
00:48:19,002 --> 00:48:20,070
A very low one.

516
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,214
Even if the surgery succeeds,
she'll be in more pain as you said.

517
00:48:23,507 --> 00:48:27,244
I wanted to save her
because I have to ask her something.

518
00:48:29,158 --> 00:48:30,580
But I don't think I can.

519
00:48:31,047 --> 00:48:36,113
I'm not the nicest guy in the world,
but I really can't do this again.

520
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:38,121
You said she has a desire to live!

521
00:48:38,212 --> 00:48:40,824
It was my misjudgment. I'm sorry, quack.

522
00:48:41,758 --> 00:48:45,462
I don't need your apology.
Be responsible for your words.

523
00:49:03,046 --> 00:49:07,918
If you operate on her,
I'll pay you whatever you want.

524
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,947
-I can't.
-Please do it.

525
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,292
Who is this patient to you?

526
00:49:20,431 --> 00:49:21,535
My mother.

527
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:28,638
I have something to tell her.

528
00:49:32,195 --> 00:49:33,499
I'm begging you.

529
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:36,973
Please save her.

530
00:50:12,225 --> 00:50:13,550
You're wasting your time.

531
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:14,785
I still want to try.

532
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:16,595
I rejected Dr Han already.

533
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:18,088
Someone else is doing it.

534
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:19,256
Someone else?

535
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:31,601
Stop the surgery!

536
00:50:33,837 --> 00:50:35,201
I don't know who you are,

537
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:36,873
but this is the surgery
requested by her guardian.

538
00:50:36,964 --> 00:50:37,974
I'm her legal guardian, too!

539
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:44,915
And he's the chairman of this hospital.

540
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:49,553
If you don't stop now, you won't be able
to take your scalpel anymore!

541
00:51:01,932 --> 00:51:03,100
I'm sorry.

542
00:51:03,366 --> 00:51:05,135
I'm afraid the surgery fee
has already been paid.

543
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:39,536
Focus on saving the patient.

544
00:51:42,005 --> 00:51:42,839
Scalpel.

545
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,789
Mr Chairman. I told him to not do it.

546
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,884
Please know that I didn't order him!
That's the truth!

547
00:53:41,658 --> 00:53:43,326
Ephedrine. Oxygen saturation?

548
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:44,737
It's dropping from 60.

549
00:53:44,828 --> 00:53:46,897
Get the defibrillator. Quickly!

550
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:51,034
Charge 20 Joules.

551
00:53:54,237 --> 00:53:55,305
Charge 50 Joules.

552
00:54:11,855 --> 00:54:12,923
Defibrillator.

553
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:15,258
Fifty Joules!

554
00:54:15,892 --> 00:54:16,827
Again!

555
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,014
Why are you stopping?

556
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,525
The heart isn't beating yet.

557
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:56,299
What are you doing?

558
00:54:58,335 --> 00:55:00,312
Thank you, everyone.

559
00:55:00,403 --> 00:55:01,905
What do you mean?

560
00:55:01,996 --> 00:55:03,140
I'll finish up.

561
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:09,713
It's not over yet.

562
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:12,582
It's not over yet!

563
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:14,479
It's over.

564
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:18,288
It's... not over yet.

565
00:55:23,493 --> 00:55:24,695
I'm sorry.

566
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,801
What are you doing?

567
00:55:31,935 --> 00:55:33,036
Can't you see?

568
00:55:33,437 --> 00:55:34,438
Stop it.

569
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,107
-Stop it!
-Back off!

570
00:55:42,646 --> 00:55:44,253
I need to tell her something.

571
00:55:45,182 --> 00:55:47,384
I said I have something
I need to tell her.

572
00:56:13,977 --> 00:56:15,245
Why did you do it?

573
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:20,117
Why did you do it to me?

574
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,625
Why to me?

575
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:07,990
On May 13 at 02:00 AM,

576
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:11,435
the patient passed
during a tumor removal surgery.

577
00:57:14,491 --> 00:57:16,141
-She isn't dead yet!
-What are you doing?

578
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:17,607
Let go!

579
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:19,376
Stop it!

580
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,111
Let go!

581
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:22,546
Stop it!

582
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:33,216
Let go!

583
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:35,892
Bring my mom back to life!

584
00:57:37,783 --> 00:57:39,796
I said, bring my mom back to life!

585
00:57:42,432 --> 00:57:43,333
I'm sorry.

586
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:45,735
She has passed away.

587
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,505
I'm sorry.
