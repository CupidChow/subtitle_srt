1
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:09,278
Jae-hee got a kidney transplant
two years ago.

2
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,571
Kidney transplant?

3
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,910
Both of her kidneys were bad,

4
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,478
so she got one transplanted.

5
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,901
I'm so sorry.

6
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,478
Dr Oh...

7
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:49,436
I am here to apologize for
what my father did to you.

8
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,105
That's not something
you should apologize for.

9
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,442
Thanks for saying that.

10
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,114
Goodbye.

11
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,321
Wait a minute.

12
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,436
I have something to talk to you.

13
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,090
-Later.
-Listen...

14
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,158
Later!

15
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,328
I said later.

16
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,982
Why didn't you tell me that
Dr Han is Jae-hee?

17
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,717
I'm really sorry for not
being able to tell you earlier.

18
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,818
-However...
-Really sorry?

19
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,820
Do you really mean that?

20
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,155
-I have my reason.
-And what is that?

21
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,490
I can't tell you that.

22
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,192
Then, what is it that you can tell me?

23
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,334
When did you find out?

24
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,472
At the doctors' lounge.

25
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,883
Of course, at the doctors' lounge...

26
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,619
I also knew that
she had to hide her identity.

27
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,454
I figured she must have had a reason...

28
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,023
At least you could've told me.

29
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,758
Even if it was going to be later!

30
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,927
-To you?
-Yes, to me.

31
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,161
Why to you?

32
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,230
Do you really don't know why?

33
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,431
How can I know?

34
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,001
What a jerk!

35
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,485
EPISODE 16

36
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,720
Where is Dr Oh?

37
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,121
She left.

38
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,257
-Did you apologize to her?
-What apology?

39
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,126
-What have we done wrong?
-We lied to her.

40
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,561
We didn't do that on purpose.

41
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,230
However she's been nice to us.

42
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,931
Let's go together...

43
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:58,899
That's not necessary.

44
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:00,601
Hoon...

45
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,969
I said no.

46
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,797
-Dr Oh...
-Dr Han, no...

47
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,267
I was really surprised to find out
that you're Jae-hee.

48
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,204
I'm sorry. I had my reason...

49
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,187
It's fine.

50
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,774
I guess I am so insensitive, too.

51
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,376
I should have realized that
you two have been close.

52
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,545
Haven't I done anything stupid, have I?

53
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
Are you going somewhere?
I need to talk to you.

54
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,517
Kim Chi-gyu asked me

55
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,118
to replace him for ER
duty all of a sudden.

56
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,155
He's probably leaving
the post to pick up girls.

57
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,790
Dr Oh...

58
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,192
Let's talk later, okay?

59
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,170
Get a chest X-ray and
a blood test done for him.

60
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:03,123
Yes.

61
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,760
Please come see me once the test is done.

62
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:06,727
I see.

63
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,161
-Please follow me.
-Yes.

64
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,800
Dr Oh?

65
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:37,291
I wish this kind of thing will continue
to happen in the future.

66
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:38,725
What do you mean?

67
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:44,965
I'm just so happy and grateful that
you wanted to take over my shift!

68
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:45,908
I'm sure you know that.

69
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,267
Then, I'll take my leave.

70
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,739
Dr Park HOON

71
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,718
POWER OFF

72
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,225
Dr Oh, can you look at this?

73
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,998
I think there's an inflammation
around here...

74
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,557
HAN SEUNG-HEE

75
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,528
How's the quack doing? Is she okay?

76
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,365
If you're so worried,
why didn't you come with me?

77
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,133
Is she mad?

78
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,169
I'm not sure.

79
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,454
Why?

80
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,305
She says she's okay.

81
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,007
However she doesn't look like.

82
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:01,875
Put her on the line if she's there.

83
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,877
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

84
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,213
-She went to the hospital.
-The hospital?

85
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,049
I think she's trying to avoid me.

86
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,018
Geez,

87
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,320
it's not like we've done
something terrible!

88
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,656
Everything will be okay, right?

89
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,225
Don't worry.

90
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,194
I don't think she will report us
to the police station.

91
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,995
It's not that.

92
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,631
I'm just worried that
Dr Oh is heartbroken.

93
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,370
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

94
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,672
You should, too.

95
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:32,881
No.

96
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,834
Hey, quack.

97
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:09,276
Hmm?

98
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,254
Darn it.

99
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:30,964
-It seems like everything is okay.
-I see.

100
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,666
I think it's because of fatigue

101
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,568
from working around the clock
for many days.

102
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,937
So you should go home and rest up.

103
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:40,140
If similar symptoms occur again,
please come in.

104
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,224
I see.

105
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,945
-Thank you, doctor.
-Thank you.

106
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,584
I'm suffering here!

107
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,986
I said I want someone to examine me.

108
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,322
Why do you keep telling me to wait?

109
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,990
It's a small laceration.

110
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,059
So please wait a bit more.

111
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,129
Does this look small to you?

112
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,398
We must take care of
urgent patients first.

113
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,333
Do you really want to die?

114
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,335
I said this is urgent!

115
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:09,970
What are you doing?

116
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,338
Get your hand off.

117
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,622
Who the heck are you?

118
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,069
You can go.

119
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,243
Interesting!

120
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,378
Just wait.

121
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,648
There're many more urgent patients
than you here.

122
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,285
Then, why don't you
take care of me, Pretty doctor?

123
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,453
I told you to wait!

124
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,923
You should speak to your elders
with more respect!

125
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,003
Hey, do you think this is your bedroom?

126
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,638
Behave when you're in a hospital!

127
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,875
Does this girl really want to die?

128
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,012
It hurts a lot!

129
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,927
It must be because
your head is full of rocks.

130
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,017
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

131
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,455
You little brat...

132
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,988
What a barbarian!

133
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,422
Knock it off.

134
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,087
Do you think you're a badass?

135
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:14,835
What's going on with this mustache?

136
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,171
Do you think you're the Yakuza?

137
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,885
You should be quiet.

138
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,511
You should apologize to him.

139
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,646
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:27,848
Good luck.

141
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,433
I'll talk to you later.

142
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,923
-Take care.
-Goodbye.

143
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:44,722
Are you okay?

144
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,234
Why does it matter to you?

145
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:50,957
Wait.

146
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:54,885
Are you okay?

147
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,253
Why are you here?

148
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,856
I have something to talk to you.

149
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,208
Go ahead and speak.

150
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,562
I said speak.

151
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,239
You should learn to know
when it's okay to lash out.

152
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,278
Does it hurt a lot?

153
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,146
Would it not hurt
if you were in my place?

154
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,783
-So, you shouldn't have...
-If you were in my place,

155
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,987
wouldn't your feelings be hurt?

156
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:51,602
Tell me.

157
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,836
Why did you do this to me?

158
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,139
Why did you make me feel stupid?

159
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:02,943
Tell me.

160
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,712
What do you want me to do now?

161
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:18,992
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,070
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:49,957
Hey. What's up?

164
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:53,093
Is Dr Oh still not answering her phone?

165
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,474
I don't know.

166
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,066
Shouldn't you go see her?

167
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,770
The quack is a cool girl,
so she'll be okay.

168
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,007
Just talk to her when she gets home.

169
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:09,564
Okay.

170
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,625
Did you see it?

171
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,195
Did you see that he did that on purpose?

172
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,462
If not, don't say anything.

173
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:04,731
Don't gossip about something
you don't know!

174
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:16,777
I got rejected by Dr Park
after confessing my feelings for him.

175
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,779
Please don't do this to me.

176
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:25,152
I get very confused
every time you do this to me.

177
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,176
DELETE THIS FILE

178
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,120
DELETE

179
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,679
Mr Prime Minister, it's Han Seung-hee.

180
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,321
What?

181
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,853
You told him that
this is for the President?

182
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:09,590
-Yes.
-Are you out of your mind?

183
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,325
How could you tell him that?

184
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:15,329
Because that plan won't work anyway.

185
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,164
It's not your job to judge that!

186
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,534
It's not your job to say
whether it's right or wrong!

187
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,446
My plan was perfect.

188
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:34,381
If I kill his mother,

189
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,050
he'll release all his anger
on the operating table.

190
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,762
Just not on my heart,
but on the president's heart!

191
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:40,921
You're wrong.

192
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,557
No matter what you do,

193
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:48,629
all patients on the operating table
are equal to Park Hoon.

194
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:51,131
Patients that he should cure as a doctor.

195
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,304
Is that why you're hiding his mother?

196
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,142
No, no...

197
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,413
You didn't do this
because the plan is wrong.

198
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,515
You did it because it's his mother.

199
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,051
The mother of someone you love.

200
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:13,253
I won't deny that.

201
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,657
Do you think you can hide her forever?

202
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:21,228
Do you think I'm not capable
of finding her once I set my mind to it?

203
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:22,596
Then,

204
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,699
you'll have to give up

205
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,502
becoming president.

206
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,338
That's a cute threat.

207
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,011
However the next election is
only a couple of years away.

208
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,980
You'll need a big achievement like

209
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,918
the North South summit
to win the election.

210
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:51,325
Do you think that can be possible

211
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,193
without the help of my government?

212
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,137
I presume you didn't call this meeting
to just tease me.

213
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,373
Let's get to the main point.

214
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,210
Pick Han Jae-joon as the surgeon.

215
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,012
Quite boring.

216
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,150
I'll join Dr Han's team.

217
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,457
You join Han Jae-joon's team?

218
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:28,128
Dr Han is quite good enough
for the President's surgery.

219
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:32,766
So the President will agree to
let him operate

220
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,670
and the surgery will go perfectly.

221
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,607
Dr Han's role will end there.

222
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:44,478
From there, I'll take care of the rest.

223
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:53,587
All you wanted from the beginning
was the President in a coma.

224
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,192
It's a bit interesting.

225
00:20:58,892 --> 00:20:59,895
In return,

226
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:03,363
there's a condition.

227
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:04,898
A condition?

228
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,201
Please guarantee the safety of

229
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:09,937
Park Hoon and his mother.

230
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:13,907
What a romance.

231
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:19,847
However I'm not quite fond of Park Hoon.

232
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,585
Is there any reason why
I should agree to your condition, then?

233
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:25,896
Of course there is.

234
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,623
You can't have the President in a coma

235
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:33,126
without my help.

236
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,233
If he stays in coma,

237
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,701
he'll be considered unable to
be discharged his duties.

238
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:42,402
Once that happens,

239
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,938
the Prime Minister gets the power
only for 60 days.

240
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:48,785
It's not enough time to make
the North and South summit happen.

241
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:52,012
However if the President alternates
between being alert and being in coma...

242
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:58,285
You can extend the length of
your stay in power without any limit.

243
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,456
However, do you really need
to agree to her condition?

244
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,459
The surgery date that the President wants
is around the corner.

245
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,394
It'll be difficult to find
an anesthesiologist

246
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:10,364
who's as good as Han Seung-hee.

247
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,132
There're many good anesthesiologists...

248
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,835
We need someone who'll do as we say.

249
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:19,406
She also has a clear motivation.

250
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,342
That's true.

251
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,977
Park Hoon, that little...

252
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:27,147
It's probably one of very few things
that money can't buy.

253
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:28,849
Do you think so?

254
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:38,525
However I really don't like the fact
that Park Hoon is still alive.

255
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,768
Pyeongtaek Myung-woo Hospital

256
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:57,244
This is Han Jae-joon speaking.

257
00:22:58,512 --> 00:22:59,539
It's me.

258
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:03,350
I need to talk to you.

259
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:06,954
I have a surgery this morning.

260
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,122
I think you should postpone, Dr Han.

261
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,993
No, should I call you Dr Lee Seong-hoon?

262
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,313
Since when have you known this?

263
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:37,951
I think what's important is that

264
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,187
Chairman Oh still doesn't know this.

265
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,090
What do you want from me?

266
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,132
Nothing special.

267
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,361
I want you to operate on my heart.

268
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,357
What do you think?

269
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,064
The competition isn't over yet.

270
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:55,536
Park Hoon won't be able to show up
to the hospital for a while.

271
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:57,437
If the opponent doesn't show up,

272
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,540
wouldn't that make you the winner?

273
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:04,111
And that's why I'm asking you
to operate on my heart.

274
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:05,768
What do you think?

275
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:11,051
Chairman Oh will also be pleased
if you win.

276
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,788
Don't people call this irony?

277
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:18,425
In return,

278
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:21,495
I want you to change

279
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,698
one of your team members
with someone that I want.

280
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:26,900
My team member?

281
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,603
There's an anesthesiologist
named Han Seung-hee.

282
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:31,572
She is...

283
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:36,343
I know it's not a difficult request,
Dr Lee.

284
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:42,316
And after the surgery,
the patient's recovery...

285
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,919
no, my recovery should be
under her watch also.

286
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:49,968
I see.

287
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,627
In order to show my gratitude,

288
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:57,397
I got a present for you.

289
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:04,389
You saw how Jae Il Hospital
crumbled into nothing overnight.

290
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:08,208
This is something that will make

291
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:11,678
Chairman Oh crumble
into nothing overnight.

292
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:16,450
However you'll only get to open
the envelope

293
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,853
if you accept my condition.

294
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,072
What is it?

295
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:42,342
Why don't we get a blow?

296
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:09,436
It took a while for me to get here.

297
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:16,176
When you betrayed me and ran away,

298
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:20,614
I felt like I was bitten
by a dog that I raised.

299
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:27,221
This really hurt.

300
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,192
Ever since then,

301
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,995
I waited for my time to get revenge.

302
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,297
And I got my chance.

303
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,233
I was told to contact Jang Seok-joo,

304
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,969
the second strongest man in South Korea.

305
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:48,108
I pity you for relying on
such a guy for your life.

306
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,010
However

307
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,780
Jang Seok-joo has notified me that
he's removing you from the plan.

308
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,055
What?

309
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,853
What do you mean?

310
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:01,922
I couldn't believe it either.

311
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,358
Is he giving everything up?

312
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,094
However that isn't the case.

313
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:13,967
The mission continues without you.

314
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,637
What do you mean by without me?

315
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:21,175
Do you know that because of you,

316
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:24,344
everything that I worked for disappeared?

317
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:28,849
And I was on the verge of death

318
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,518
as I was transferred between labor camps.

319
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,354
However I persisted.

320
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:36,823
I told myself that as long as I'm alive,

321
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:39,893
I'll get my chance.

322
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,430
My chance to take revenge on Park Hoon.

323
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:54,341
And finally,

324
00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:57,845
the time has come.

325
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,735
Goodbye.

326
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,436
I never expected
to see you again like this.

327
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:19,014
Are you out of your mind?

328
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,395
What are you doing in broad daylight?

329
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:22,563
It was Han Seung-hee...

330
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,934
No, Song Jae-hee's request.

331
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,573
Listen to me carefully.

332
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,976
Song Jae-hee requested
the safety of you and your mom

333
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,079
for excluding you from the plan.

334
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,590
Then how about her?

335
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,249
She'll join Han Jae-joon's team.

336
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,652
That's impossible.

337
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,354
She said she'll do it with me.

338
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,125
Check it out yourself.

339
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:55,596
VOICEMAIL FROM HAN SEUNG-HEE

340
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,038
It's me, Hoon.

341
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:10,310
I'll take care of the surgery team.

342
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:15,616
So you should just wait it out
as they tell you to.

343
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:19,786
They'll also protect your mom.

344
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:24,454
By the way,

345
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,829
every moment of this past month
that I got to spend with you

346
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,733
was unforgettable for me.

347
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:35,869
Especially that time

348
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,540
when you hugged me in the call room.

349
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:41,975
I was so happy.

350
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,978
Even if I deny it...

351
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,514
Even if I don't tell you...

352
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:52,085
I could feel that you recognized me.

353
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:55,086
Hoon.

354
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:59,560
The reason why I'm doing this alone
is because of your mother.

355
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,763
If something happens to you
after you do the surgery,

356
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:05,465
no one will be able to take care of her.

357
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,203
So don't worry about me.

358
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,539
When you see your mother,

359
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,275
take good care of her.

360
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:18,145
I'll come to you

361
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:20,547
after finishing this job.

362
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:22,950
I promise you.

363
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,011
Hoon...

364
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:30,457
Please take care of yourself until then.

365
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,192
You must.

366
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:36,530
I'm sorry, Hoon.

367
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:43,704
I don't want you to go through
any more hardships.

368
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,159
I'll guarantee

369
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,196
the safety of you and your mother.

370
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,300
How can I trust you?

371
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,837
That's up to you.

372
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:19,907
However have you ever thought about it?

373
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,010
About who saved you

374
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:26,780
from Cha Jin-soo on the bridge
in Budapest?

375
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:44,231
And I also took care of your mom
for 20 years.

376
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,966
That was to threaten me.

377
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,835
That's partially true.

378
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:51,805
However do you think
I took care of your mom

379
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:55,342
to threaten you even when
you were in North Korea?

380
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:02,182
I assume you feel uneasy
about how Song Jae-hee will be in danger.

381
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,987
However she's a lot stronger
than you think.

382
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:12,559
You'll be her welcoming place
to return after she finishes the job.

383
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:16,230
That'll be a great morale booster for her.

384
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:23,971
It's your decision.

385
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,373
Whether to come with me

386
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,177
or to go against the Prime Minister's wish

387
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:35,082
and put you, your mother,
and Song Jae-hee in danger.

388
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:58,572
Hoon, he's really...

389
00:34:09,183 --> 00:34:10,984
Why is he not picking up his phone?

390
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:16,623
Hello?

391
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:18,525
Hello?

392
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:20,494
Are you looking for me?

393
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,731
You should stop frowning
with your beautiful face.

394
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:27,100
How about working with me tonight?

395
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:30,204
You're doing it again!

396
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,863
These...

397
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,450
You're doing it again!

398
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,990
Your parents worked so hard
to send you to the medical school,

399
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:52,326
however all you do these days
is chase after girls!

400
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:53,460
What are you doing here?

401
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:56,396
I told you I was coming for a check-up!

402
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,898
Yes, a checkup.

403
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,366
However aren't you being

404
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,468
too rude to your older brother?

405
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,340
If you want me to respect you
as an older brother,

406
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:08,141
you should start behaving like one.

407
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,944
-You idiot!
-Wait!

408
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:13,313
Just wear them, okay?

409
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,527
You're getting married?

410
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,865
He thinks we don't have to wait
any longer.

411
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,867
I know you're very busy these days.

412
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:35,802
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,381
Not at all.

414
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:39,840
Marriage is the most important thing
in life.

415
00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:43,010
It has to come before the surgery team.

416
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,516
Thank you so much, Chief.

417
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:53,420
So I was wondering...

418
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:56,790
It seems like I'll be quite busy
from now on...

419
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,058
We have a surgery

420
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,893
of Myocardial infarction patient
coming up.

421
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,729
I've asked another doctor to stand in
for me for that one...

422
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:06,867
However I don't think I'll have
enough time in general in the future.

423
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,570
Marriage can be very time consuming.

424
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:13,807
It sounds like you'll be quite busy.

425
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,710
Would it be okay if I switch you out
from my surgery team?

426
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,381
That'd be greatly appreciated.

427
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:25,252
The only other option is Dr Han.

428
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:26,954
Do you think she'll agree?

429
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:28,422
She belongs to the Water Bottle's team.

430
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:30,157
Who cares?

431
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,126
They stole
our first surgical assistant also.

432
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:35,662
I guess so.

433
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:37,998
Can you tell her first?

434
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:39,700
Sure, Chief.

435
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,240
I moved you to the branch hospital.

436
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:50,511
I'll call you back
once the prime minister's surgery is over.

437
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:54,882
Use that time to rest up
and clear your thoughts.

438
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:56,950
I'll think about it.

439
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,152
Think about it?

440
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:01,221
That won't be necessary. Just go.

441
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,190
Can you just let me handle it?

442
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:04,233
I can't!

443
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:06,393
Do as I say. It's all for you.

444
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,073
Did you call for me?

445
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,075
What on earth are you doing?

446
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:25,612
What did you do to Soo-hyun
so that she's thinking about other men?

447
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:28,248
How can you let her fall
for a punk like Park Hoon?

448
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:29,983
It has nothing to do with Jae-joon.

449
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,018
Of course it has something
to do with him!

450
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,086
You were going to be engaged!

451
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:34,454
That's all in the past.

452
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:39,226
Let me stay with her, Mr Chairman.

453
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:41,595
What do you mean?

454
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:43,730
Please leave her up to me.

455
00:37:43,797 --> 00:37:45,799
Jae-joon, I made it clear to you...

456
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:46,834
Be quiet!

457
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:49,603
So, what if I leave her up to you?

458
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:51,638
I'm not sending her anywhere.

459
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:54,341
Trust me.

460
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:55,809
I hope those aren't empty words.

461
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:57,845
You understand me, right?

462
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:00,622
Yes, sir.

463
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,784
I don't want to see you.

464
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:04,920
Get out, both of you.

465
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,121
Now!

466
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,436
I told you that you're not it.

467
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,470
I know.

468
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:24,671
Then, why are you doing this?

469
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:26,673
I'll also make it clear to you how I feel.
So listen carefully.

470
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,008
-Jae-joon...
-Listen.

471
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:37,384
From now on, please forgive me
for everything I do.

472
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:41,154
What are you talking
about all of a sudden?

473
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:45,092
And please never forget that
I loved you with all my heart.

474
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,361
No, you can forget it.

475
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:52,332
So I can live with the fact

476
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:54,501
that you like someone other than me.

477
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,673
However it just can't be Park Hoon. Okay?

478
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:10,017
An urgent patient in the ER, Chief.

479
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:17,257
How is the patient's status?

480
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,426
Myocardial infarction and septal rupture.

481
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,594
What did you say?

482
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:23,230
His condition is exactly the same
as the patient we're about to operate on.

483
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:31,095
Chief?

484
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:32,873
Move him to the operating room.

485
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,576
However you already have
a surgery scheduled.

486
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:36,877
Someone must do it.

487
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:40,180
Conduct a CT scan, echocardiogram,
and coronary angiography.

488
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:41,558
Rapidly.

489
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:49,289
-The final round?
-Yes.

490
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:51,056
Who are the patients?

491
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:59,733
The patient has myocardial infarction
and septal rupture.

492
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:01,583
This is the patient that

493
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,071
you were going to operate
on in the morning.

494
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:06,440
One more patient
just came in through the ER.

495
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:09,076
So we have two patients
with similar symptoms...

496
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:10,277
Yes.

497
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,112
It's a difficult surgery,

498
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:15,883
however it's also the first surgery
that Park Hoon did in this hospital.

499
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,920
Dr Park won't be coming in for a while.

500
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:21,321
What do you mean?

501
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:23,624
The Prime Minister's Office
notified me yesterday that

502
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:27,127
Dr Park won't be available for a while.

503
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,762
From the Prime Minister's Office?

504
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:30,015
Yes.

505
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:34,101
They want us to conclude
this competition soon.

506
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:37,604
So the Prime Minister's Office
called you directly?

507
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,775
They said they'll contact you soon also.

508
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:49,283
There is no one other than
Dr Park who can do this surgery.

509
00:40:51,218 --> 00:40:54,421
The patient might die if we do this.

510
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:58,992
I think it's more important to win,
Mr Chairman.

511
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:02,996
Now you realize
what the business is about.

512
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:17,945
CHAIRMAN

513
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:19,673
Yes, Mr Chairman.

514
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,483
Yes? I'll come right up.

515
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:30,090
The final round?

516
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,994
Yes. We should declare a winner soon.

517
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:35,280
Of course, sir.

518
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:36,496
When should we do it?

519
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:37,965
-Today.
-Today?

520
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:40,334
Yes. With this patient.

521
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:47,140
The patient has MI and septal rupture...

522
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:48,442
Why?

523
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,310
Honestly, this is the same surgery

524
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:56,316
Dr Park did when he first came
to this hospital.

525
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,467
So?

526
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,087
We're fine with it,

527
00:42:00,454 --> 00:42:03,123
however is Dr Han going to agree?

528
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:05,025
Dr Han has already agreed.

529
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:09,196
As you can see, it's an urgent case.
Hurry up.

530
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:10,797
Yes, sir.

531
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:12,097
Also...

532
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,437
The HR committee has decided
to let you practice again.

533
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:20,340
You didn't have to...

534
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:23,477
A doctor is a doctor
when he treats patients, right?

535
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,347
I came to realize this
while I couldn't practice.

536
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:30,751
I feel like I am an independent fighter.

537
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,954
Just like the heroes
of Korean independence...

538
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:37,324
I'm just joking, sir!

539
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:56,944
We'll win this round even

540
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,179
if Park Hoon uses one hand
to do the surgery!

541
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,415
We won! Hooray!

542
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,650
That's great.

543
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:08,222
Call Park Hoon and tell him
to go to the operating room right now.

544
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:15,028
And you should double check
the bone saw this time.

545
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,298
Yes, sir.

546
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:26,373
He's not answering.

547
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,709
What? Try again.

548
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:34,214
He's still not answering.

549
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:35,883
His phone was turned off.

550
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,150
What's happening?

551
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:38,952
Is he screening calls?

552
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:02,209
MONEY

553
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:39,185
Hey!

554
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:41,081
Long time no see.

555
00:44:41,148 --> 00:44:42,683
Do you know where Park Hoon is?

556
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:43,817
He's not here?

557
00:44:44,284 --> 00:44:45,452
That's why I'm looking for him!

558
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,354
I haven't been able to reach him
since yesterday.

559
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:48,755
I thought he was here.

560
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,291
Any possible place where he might be at?

561
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:53,360
I don't know.

562
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,696
He didn't come to work,
and he isn't picking up his phone!

563
00:44:56,129 --> 00:44:57,998
Where on earth is he?

564
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:00,167
There's less than an hour
until the surgery.

565
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:02,135
This is driving me crazy!

566
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:09,443
Dr Han, do you know where Park Hoon is?

567
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:10,777
He isn't answering his phone?

568
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:13,347
No, he isn't since yesterday.

569
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:16,250
Have you seen him here?

570
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:19,186
No, I haven't.

571
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:20,721
Are you sure?

572
00:45:22,322 --> 00:45:23,211
Yes.

573
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:29,696
Where is Hoon?

574
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:32,733
You know it, don't you?

575
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:36,203
Answer me!

576
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:49,116
I don't know where he is either.

577
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,651
If you don't know, who else knows?

578
00:45:51,385 --> 00:45:54,855
Didn't that man who was with you
do something bad to Hoon?

579
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:57,424
He will be fine.

580
00:45:57,524 --> 00:45:58,759
So, don't worry.

581
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:01,094
How can I not?

582
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:03,564
I don't know what you're up to.

583
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:05,499
However if something happens to Hoon,

584
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:07,401
I won't forgive you.

585
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:08,902
I'll report you to the police!

586
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:10,037
Chang-yi,

587
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:13,974
I understand how much
you're concerned about Hoon.

588
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:17,544
However I'm sure I worry
about him more than you do,

589
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,079
if anything happens.

590
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:24,551
I'm always grateful for your concerns.

591
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:27,654
However please don't do
anything right now.

592
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:32,759
That'll be the best for both you and Hoon.

593
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:41,401
Aren't you going into the surgery, Dr Oh?

594
00:46:41,492 --> 00:46:42,436
A surgery?

595
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:43,367
Yes,

596
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:46,607
actually the final round starts right now.
Nurse Min was called also.

597
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:48,609
Then, is Dr Park here?

598
00:46:49,176 --> 00:46:50,944
I'm not sure about that.

599
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:52,813
However Nurse Min was in a hurry.

600
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,615
So it might be an urgent patient.

601
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:05,125
Where is this guy?

602
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:07,594
This is driving me crazy!

603
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,498
-Dr Moon!
-Hey, quack...

604
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,767
No, I'm sorry, Dr Oh.

605
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,235
Is Dr Park not coming yet?

606
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:17,738
I'm still looking for him
because he's still not here!

607
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:19,406
I heard there's an urgent patient.

608
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:21,074
Yes, this will be the final round.

609
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:23,744
However where on earth is he?

610
00:47:31,752 --> 00:47:32,853
Hey, Park Hoon!

611
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:35,088
-Park Hoon!
-Dr Park!

612
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,624
Dr Park!

613
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,494
Park Hoon!

614
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:42,663
Dr Park!

615
00:47:44,498 --> 00:47:46,466
Hey, wake up!

616
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:52,172
He's not even here.

617
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:53,607
Then where is he?

618
00:47:58,979 --> 00:47:59,980
Is Park Hoon there?

619
00:48:00,113 --> 00:48:02,316
No, however things are a bit weird here.

620
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:03,450
What do you mean?

621
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,054
What's weirder than the fact
that Park Hoon isn't there?

622
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,927
However Chief,

623
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:19,233
Dr Eun is off today.
Who will be our anesthesiologist?

624
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:21,911
She'll be here soon.

625
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:22,889
Who?

626
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:40,921
Dr Han Seung-hee went
into Dr Han Jae-joon's operating room.

627
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:56,203
If Dr Park isn't there, you should do it.

628
00:48:57,638 --> 00:49:01,408
How can I do the surgery
without Park Hoon and Dr Han?

629
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:02,709
It's an urgent patient!

630
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,244
At this rate,
the patient will be in trouble.

631
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,813
Of course, that shouldn't happen.

632
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,382
That shouldn't happen!

633
00:49:19,693 --> 00:49:21,161
The anesthesia will begin shortly.

634
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:23,564
I look forward to your performance.

635
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:29,970
How do you know
Prime Minister Jang, Dr Han?

636
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:36,476
What do you mean?

637
00:49:36,677 --> 00:49:40,214
It sounded like Prime Minister
Jang knows you very well.

638
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:41,805
Is that so?

639
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:45,472
You really don't know him?

640
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:47,344
No.

641
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:52,108
However how did you find out
that he knows about me?

642
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,395
I just heard something like that.

643
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:56,997
Something like that...?

644
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,068
I'm curious all of a sudden.

645
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,672
Please tell me the story later.

646
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,508
I must fetch the drugs.

647
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:29,530
How about Park Hoon?

648
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:31,265
He's not here.

649
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:38,071
Okay, I'm going in.

650
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:57,624
Dr Han, how could you?

651
00:50:57,998 --> 00:50:58,959
Could what?

652
00:50:59,026 --> 00:51:01,295
You belong to Dr Park's team.

653
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:02,307
I used to.

654
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:04,398
I can't believe this.

655
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,634
Are you really Jae-hee?

656
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:10,838
I'm doing this because I'm Jae-hee.

657
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,239
What do you mean?

658
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:14,341
This is for Dr Park.

659
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:15,509
How does that make sense?

660
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:19,513
The Chairman will kick
Dr Park out if he loses this round.

661
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,483
The only way he can stay here is
by doing the prime minister's surgery.

662
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:24,785
This is his last chance.

663
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:27,487
Dr Oh,

664
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,556
even if he doesn't get picked
for the prime minister's surgery...

665
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:31,158
Even if he gets kicked out of here...

666
00:51:31,892 --> 00:51:33,360
He will come back.

667
00:51:34,528 --> 00:51:35,829
What do you mean?

668
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:38,699
Just as you heard.

669
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:43,604
Hoon will come back to
where you are right now.

670
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,018
I heard Dr Moon is operating.

671
00:51:59,928 --> 00:52:00,834
Yes.

672
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:02,523
You should try your best.

673
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:08,295
Since Dr Park isn't here,
your help will be crucial.

674
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:10,464
Are you saying...

675
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,803
No patient shall die during surgery
at the hospital that'll operate

676
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:18,906
on the prime minister.

677
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,085
Where's Dr Park?

678
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,087
Dr Moon is operating.

679
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,064
Jung-Han,

680
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:47,401
if something like
the last time happens again,

681
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:49,770
I won't forgive you again.

682
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:54,141
Please don't do anything shameful anymore

683
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,509
in front of your son.

684
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:56,710
Don't worry.

685
00:52:58,045 --> 00:52:59,413
I'll do my best.

686
00:53:16,063 --> 00:53:16,979
Scalpel.

687
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:24,469
Scalpel.

688
00:53:30,777 --> 00:53:31,705
Dr Moon?

689
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,482
Yes? Let's start.

690
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:45,020
Bovie.

691
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:47,060
Dr Han will win.

692
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:48,395
You don't need to see it.

693
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:51,365
Dr Han is the best!

694
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:19,993
She's good.

695
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:24,231
Get more epinephrine now!

696
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:37,367
Please...

697
00:54:48,722 --> 00:54:49,723
It's back.

698
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:51,792
Blood pressure is also okay.

699
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:14,314
Hold it straight!

700
00:55:15,606 --> 00:55:16,517
Maintain blood pressure!

701
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:17,637
Yes, sir.

702
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:19,921
Suction!

703
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:33,567
Do something!

704
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:42,142
They might kill the patient!

705
00:55:45,212 --> 00:55:47,814
Oh Joon-gyu must be happy
without knowing the truth.

706
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:54,821
He has no idea what'll happen
once Han Jae-joon wins.

707
00:56:03,297 --> 00:56:04,765
I don't think we need to see any further.

708
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:24,616
Tell Dr Han to go to room number two
as soon as he's done.

709
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:26,460
Why?

710
00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:28,488
Do you want the media to report
that a patient died in surgery

711
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:29,574
in our hospital?

712
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:30,958
Then, how about the competition?

713
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:33,026
Are you that stupid?

714
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,995
Dr Han will save both of them.

715
00:56:35,195 --> 00:56:37,631
I see...

716
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,181
Maintain the blood pressure!

717
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:55,249
I'm trying.

718
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,085
Why can't I see it?

719
00:57:02,823 --> 00:57:04,758
Dr Han is done with his surgery.
Should we call him?

720
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:13,800
Dr Moon...

721
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:18,926
Call him.

722
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:20,340
We must save the patient.

723
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:21,808
Call Dr Han.

724
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:23,343
Hurry up!

725
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:33,413
Okay.

726
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,781
I'll be right there.

727
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,035
Do something.

728
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:51,772
Why isn't Han Jae-joon coming yet?

729
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:00,389
Dr Han!

730
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:03,450
Come quickly!

731
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:14,340
Dr Park...

732
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:23,570
What's all this mess, Master?

733
00:58:24,037 --> 00:58:24,946
Park Hoon...

734
00:58:35,415 --> 00:58:37,484
Change of players!
