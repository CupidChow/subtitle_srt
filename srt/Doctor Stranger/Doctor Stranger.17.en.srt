1
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,163
Do something.

2
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,634
Why isn't Han Jae-joon coming yet?

3
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:42,580
Dr Han!

4
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,512
Come quickly!

5
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,436
Dr Park...

6
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,698
What's all this mess, Master?

7
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,500
Park Hoon...

8
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,373
Change of players!

9
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,728
Isn't that Dr Park?

10
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,029
He's here!

11
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,231
That's really him!

12
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,599
-Really?
-Where is he?

13
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:53,790
Needle holder.

14
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,781
Forcep.

15
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,606
We made it.

16
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,608
The patient is alive.

17
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,144
It's not done yet. Stay focused.

18
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,282
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,103
Why are you coming back?

20
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,573
Did Dr Moon solve the problem?

21
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,452
No.

22
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,245
Park Hoon is here.

23
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,221
EPISODE 17

24
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,322
It's for Dr Yang.

25
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,834
This is Yang Jung-han speaking.

26
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:24,538
Hopefully, you haven't forgotten
what I said.

27
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,740
Park Hoon shouldn't win this round.

28
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,709
Make him lose at all cost!

29
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,788
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,540
This heart is one big mess.

31
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,341
The bones are severely damaged.

32
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,210
I know. Every part of this heart
is damaged.

33
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,646
What are we going to do?
This is a mess.

34
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,247
Don't you know what to do?

35
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,516
I'll stitch it up very fast and pretty.

36
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:13,520
Let's start with an atrial septal rupture.

37
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,897
I can't see because of that.

38
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,900
I'm sorry. I was trying to help.

39
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,205
Please keep going.

40
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,114
Get out of here.

41
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,417
My patience has run out.

42
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,655
Master, be my first surgical assistant.

43
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,856
Why me?

44
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,091
Hurry up and change!

45
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,354
Cut.

46
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,117
Pump, off.

47
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,357
Anesthesiologist, what are you doing?

48
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,701
The vital signs are too instable!

49
00:05:58,792 --> 00:05:59,793
It's too dangerous.

50
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,794
Stay focused.

51
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,796
You need an anesthesiologist
who specializes in heart surgeries.

52
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,841
Let me do it.

53
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,474
Let me adopt you so you can be my son!

54
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,577
My mom won't be pleased.

55
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,779
Do you mind if I ask you to finish up?

56
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,023
No.

57
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:35,984
Dr Park...

58
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,492
How can you smile?

59
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,362
I'm already here.
To smile will be better than to cry.

60
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,002
Hoon...

61
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,399
That's enough.

62
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,968
Why did you come? I told you not to!

63
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,538
I promised that I won't let you go
into any operating room alone.

64
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,373
Do you have any idea what that
operating room means?

65
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,008
Yes, I know it is dangerous.

66
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,807
That's why we must do it together.

67
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,180
It's still not too late. Go away.

68
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,948
I'm not going anywhere without you.

69
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,717
Go! Please.

70
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,854
Don't be like that
if you really care about me.

71
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:19,293
I hated you when you let go of my hand
at that bridge in Budapest.

72
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,462
The time that I spent without you
was so miserable.

73
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,401
I hated myself for not jumping
into the river with you.

74
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,069
So, don't be like that again.

75
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,895
I'll win the last round at any cost.

76
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,345
So let's do it together.

77
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,015
We'll form the surgery team
following your original plan...

78
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:43,717
And we'll go
into the operating room together.

79
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:47,087
I'll win so you can meet the president.

80
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,292
And Han Jae-joon is a good doctor.

81
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,063
I can't ruin him by getting him
involved in a conspiracy.

82
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,865
It's not the time for you to worry
about someone else.

83
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,334
I guess I have a lot to worry about too.

84
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:01,702
So would you help me

85
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:03,904
so I won't have to worry about
one of them at least?

86
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,581
Which one?

87
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,085
My mom...

88
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,863
I am begging you.

89
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,105
Yes.

90
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,037
Park Hoon came back.

91
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,842
But he's still out of our plan.

92
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,581
Dr Han and I will do the surgery.

93
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,229
Should I put this in the washing machine?

94
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,433
Hoon!

95
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,941
How's mom?

96
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,977
Whose mom?

97
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,448
Mom...

98
00:11:58,585 --> 00:11:59,853
Are you home, Hoon?

99
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,236
Where have you been?

100
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,839
I was looking for you.

101
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,076
I'm sorry, Hoon.

102
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,612
I'm very sorry.

103
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,782
Not at all.

104
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,318
It was my fault.

105
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,293
Who are you?

106
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,598
It's me, Hoon.

107
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,238
My Hoon is only eight years old.

108
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,974
I'm sorry.

109
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,859
I'm very sorry.

110
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:04,885
I only thought that you
abandoned me.

111
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,287
So I was always resentful.

112
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,226
I had no idea you had become like this.

113
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,266
I'm sorry, Mom.

114
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:45,058
Should I keep taking care of her?

115
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:46,994
Please do so.

116
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,395
I'm scared.

117
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,065
Not of your mother.

118
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,534
But if Jae-hee wants to hide her here,

119
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,136
that means someone is looking for her.

120
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,506
That's why I am asking you
whom we trust the most in this world.

121
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,475
Stop with your nonsense.

122
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,576
Maybe the second most then?

123
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,144
Are you in the mood to joke about this?

124
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,306
Quite so, yes.

125
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,250
Please take care of her. Bye.

126
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,829
I'm surprised that
you came to visit in person.

127
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:26,700
I thought you said Park Hoon
wouldn't be available for a while.

128
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,170
Yes, I did.

129
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,706
Never mind. What is it then?

130
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,508
It's your surgery.

131
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,944
You can get it
from whomever you want.

132
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,646
Why do you keep going back and forth?

133
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:44,342
We're considering removing ourselves
from this surgery entirely.

134
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,653
The heart that will be operated on

135
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:49,957
isn't mine.

136
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,393
It belongs to my boss,

137
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,562
but not me.

138
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,732
Are you saying...?

139
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,336
Yes, it belongs to the President.

140
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,106
Then why didn't you...

141
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:10,811
The President's health is
a matter of national security.

142
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,881
His approval rating is very low right now.

143
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,983
His health problem will make it
even worse.

144
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,087
Then once the surgery is done...

145
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,391
Yes, you'll receive all
the promised grants.

146
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:29,596
Along with the title
of the President's hospital.

147
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,540
I thought it was all over!

148
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:44,077
It was probably because
you haven't done it in a while.

149
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:48,415
Why did Park Hoon tell me to replace you?

150
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,852
I guess he figured that
you'll be a lot better than me.

151
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,423
You also left the room entirely
the other day.

152
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,891
The same day
when Park Hoon got his hand injured.

153
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,529
By the way, what happens to
this competition now?

154
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:03,854
The competition?

155
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,332
It's a tie, right?

156
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,035
Of course!

157
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,741
The Chairman isn't back yet.

158
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,643
I'll call you when he's back.

159
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:20,677
Dr Han!

160
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,119
We've tied, right?

161
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,990
Right or wrong?

162
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,895
The Chairman will decide.

163
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:42,503
Your facial expression says that we tied!

164
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,578
Sir.

165
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,920
This is mitral valve stenosis.

166
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,422
I also see light calcification
of the valve.

167
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,325
Yes. That'll be the patient
for the final round.

168
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,294
Isn't this too simple?

169
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,463
All we need to do is insert
an artificial valve.

170
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,055
What?

171
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,702
Yours is even easier!

172
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,774
We'll decide the winner

173
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:23,310
by who finishes first,
like the one with the twins.

174
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:24,444
We'll also consider recovery.

175
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,680
This is not fair, Mr Chairman!

176
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:30,184
Our patient is a male in his 40s,
but his patient is a female in her 20s.

177
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:34,221
The difficulty of our patient is higher
because of the calcification!

178
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,455
If you don't want it, say it now.

179
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:36,623
Of course I don't want it!

180
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,992
Then we can finish the competition
and declare Dr Han as the winner.

181
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:43,297
Mr Chairman...

182
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,632
The Prime Minister wants us to hurry.

183
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,134
We can't be hung up on
this competition forever.

184
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,902
-However...
-However what?

185
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:52,239
Speak.

186
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:14,361
We'll do it.

187
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:15,896
What?

188
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:16,893
Should I not?

189
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,307
Hey!

190
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,967
This competition has never been
in our favor anyway.

191
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,402
But he's being so obviously partial
with this one!

192
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,271
I'll win. So don't worry.

193
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:25,873
-Really?
-Yes.

194
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,875
But I need to rearrange the team first.

195
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:29,510
Tell me now.

196
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,912
What is going on?

197
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:35,849
I told you before that I won't forgive you

198
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,419
if you behave suspiciously again
in the operating room.

199
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:43,524
How did I behave suspiciously?

200
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,958
Are you going to keep lying?

201
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:49,872
Fine.

202
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,966
Please don't come into my surgeries
from now on.

203
00:18:58,605 --> 00:18:59,612
Dr Park...

204
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,913
It wasn't just about the money.

205
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,583
I hate your arrogance.

206
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,719
Jung-han!

207
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,456
You have no idea
how much effort will be necessary

208
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,060
for common people like me
to survive in this world.

209
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:23,096
Those checks you threw at me
as the patient's surgery fees...

210
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:25,265
Dr Moon gave them to you, didn't he?

211
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,937
That money is something that
you can get anytime.

212
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,674
But I have to work a few months
to get that money.

213
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,810
Or do something despicable.

214
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:40,814
Jung-han...

215
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,984
I've done many despicable things too.

216
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,188
I know how they'll come back at you
and make you regret your decisions.

217
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:50,757
That's why I want you to leave my team.

218
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,363
And you're not a common person.

219
00:19:57,431 --> 00:20:00,467
People are willing to leave
their lives up to you

220
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,870
only because you're wearing
that white coat.

221
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:09,309
We shouldn't disappoint
those people anymore, Dr Yang.

222
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:22,789
Dr Park is right.

223
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:29,963
Jung-han, you'll lose everything
if you stay here.

224
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:37,237
Just do the surgery.

225
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,873
Would the Prime Minister
accept the result?

226
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,508
Don't worry about that.

227
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:44,889
Yes, sir.

228
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,550
Once you get picked
as the Prime Minister's surgeon...

229
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,553
I want you to take over some
of my responsibilities.

230
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,823
I'm telling you now because
you'll win the competition no matter what.

231
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:00,694
How can I...?

232
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:05,732
Sang-jin will also help you. Don't worry.

233
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,396
Just wait and see!

234
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,423
I'll get my revenge on you at all cost!

235
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,226
I will!

236
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:45,572
I'm almost there.

237
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,174
Almost...

238
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,242
LAWSUIT

239
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,911
Do you have some time?

240
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,080
What do you want?

241
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,450
Too bad it ended in a tie.

242
00:21:58,752 --> 00:21:59,987
Are you here just to tell me that?

243
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:01,655
Not really.

244
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,491
Let's get to the point.

245
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:09,062
I want you to forfeit.

246
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:15,169
When I told you to forfeit,
I did it with money at least.

247
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,004
Your career depends on it.

248
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,172
I thought you might cherish that
more than money.

249
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,073
You keep saying incomprehensible things.

250
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,843
Please understand that
I'm not at liberty to speak freely.

251
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,672
My answer is no.

252
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,525
Are you happy now?

253
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:38,492
When I tell you to forfeit,
I'm really doing it for you.

254
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:39,760
Please trust me.

255
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,828
If you care about me that much,
you should forfeit.

256
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:45,699
Can't you just say yes to my request?

257
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:50,637
There's a lot of sketchy business
involved in the prime minister's surgery.

258
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,143
As sketchy as your father?

259
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,846
What does that have to do with anything?

260
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,481
Let's just call it a chain reaction.

261
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,519
Please leave if you're done.

262
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,957
It sounds like you're interested
in my father.

263
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,458
How did you find out?

264
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:12,559
Find out what?

265
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:13,694
How he went to North Korea.

266
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:17,164
I have never told you that.

267
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:24,571
I have a friend named Lee Seong-hoon,
whom I met at Harvard.

268
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,057
How do you have this?

269
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:50,197
It was he who asked me to find out
what happened to Park Cheol.

270
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:55,102
He abandoned my friend's family

271
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,604
because he chased after the fame
of treating the North Korean leader...

272
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,676
My friend would like to pay back
when he finds him again.

273
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,181
I'm afraid your friend is mistaken.

274
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:08,782
Mistaken?

275
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,951
My father didn't go to North Korea
for fame.

276
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,886
To stop a war, no...

277
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:16,190
He went because he was deceived
by Oh Joon-gyu and Jang Seok-joo.

278
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:17,191
Don't lie!

279
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:24,198
Do you think my friend will believe
your faulty excuse?

280
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,767
I'd like to talk to him
because I want him to believe me.

281
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:30,204
Dr Choi even went to America
just to find that guy.

282
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,639
I haven't talked to him in a while either.

283
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:45,786
Hey, quack.

284
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,901
Where are you running away to?

285
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:09,843
Where are you running away to?

286
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,681
Why I would be running away?

287
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:17,951
Then, why are you walking so fast?

288
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:24,324
When did I walk so fast?

289
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,762
I ran out of breath
just to catch up to you!

290
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:31,326
What is it?

291
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:33,166
Do you have anything to tell me?

292
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:34,713
Nothing.

293
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,003
Then, let me tell you something.

294
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,672
First, I'm very sorry.

295
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:43,210
Second, you don't need to worry
about your father.

296
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,878
It's not like it was you who did that.

297
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:50,424
Third, do you still massage
your scalp these days?

298
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:52,653
Don't do that.

299
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,088
Why not?

300
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:56,623
What the heck are you trying to do?

301
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,592
I just want us to get along from now on.

302
00:25:58,659 --> 00:25:59,793
Do you really think that's possible?

303
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,961
Of course!

304
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:01,995
Stop it!

305
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,564
We can get along!

306
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:55,148
I can pretend as if there's no trouble
between us,

307
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:59,119
so your father doesn't get angry.

308
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:03,490
But no Park Hoon.

309
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,959
I know.

310
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,160
And how could you behave like just now?

311
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,830
It was just his attempt to be friendly.

312
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,267
He only has Jae-hee.

313
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:18,438
I'm also forgetting my feelings for him,

314
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,674
so you don't have to worry
about me so much.

315
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:41,061
I was so befuddled that day.

316
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:42,896
And I wasn't sure if I could take it.

317
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:45,933
And honestly, I was embarrassed.

318
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:48,535
I'm sorry for hiding it from you.

319
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:49,670
Then tell me.

320
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:52,406
Dr Han, no, Jae-hee...

321
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:54,741
Are you from North Korea?

322
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:58,579
Is there any other reason for you

323
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:00,347
to operate on the Prime Minister
with Dr Park?

324
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:02,616
-Dr Oh...
-If that's the case,

325
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:05,319
I won't let that happen even if it's you.

326
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,688
Don't do anything that will put
Dr Park in danger.

327
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,958
I did meet Hoon in North Korea.

328
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:13,026
But to be precise,

329
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,761
I'm a Korean-Japanese.

330
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:19,233
After separating from Hoon,
I was sent to Japan.

331
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,235
I was treated in a hospital in Japan,

332
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,604
and finished my medical school there, too.

333
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:26,540
Then, why did you act as if you didn't
know him when you saw him?

334
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:28,942
Honestly,

335
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,778
I didn't have the courage to meet him.

336
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:33,280
What do you mean?

337
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:35,415
You're Dr Park's only love.

338
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,451
You saw my kidney scan, right?

339
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:39,253
Yes.

340
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:43,390
That kidney is my father's.

341
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:50,831
And Hoon's the one
who performed the transplant.

342
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,735
He did it to save me,

343
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:58,338
but he also killed my father.

344
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:00,807
So I wasn't sure

345
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:02,743
if I could love him

346
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,112
like before after reuniting
with him again.

347
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,081
But Dr Park still loves you dearly.

348
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:09,283
That's what I had hoped for.

349
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,818
But sometimes I feel like
his feelings toward me

350
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,556
are based on guilt and duty.

351
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:19,126
Especially when I see him with you.

352
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:20,894
No, I...

353
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,696
I'm going back to Japan soon.

354
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,307
Back to Japan?

355
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:25,406
Hoon...

356
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:32,439
No, Dr Park likes you.

357
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:36,276
He likes you purely,

358
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:39,012
without any sense of guilt and duty.

359
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:40,447
What do you mean?

360
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:43,517
If Hoon didn't cause my father to die

361
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,287
and if he hadn't been involved
with your father in the past,

362
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:51,124
he'd choose you over me.

363
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:52,850
That's not true.

364
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:55,128
You're the only one to him.

365
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,999
Just wait a bit after I return to Japan.

366
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:01,902
When you wait next to him,

367
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:05,639
you'll come to realize his feelings.

368
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,189
You used to work at a restaurant, right?

369
00:30:22,756 --> 00:30:23,957
Yes.

370
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:25,802
But why?

371
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,861
That's all I need.

372
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,936
Didn't you say that you used to work
at a restaurant?

373
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:39,239
I only saw how they made food.

374
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,608
I was in charge of delivery.

375
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,881
Help yourself anyway, Mom.

376
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:55,589
I told you. She only eats porridge.

377
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,958
Do you think this looks appetizing?

378
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,228
I really tried hard to make these.
Are you really going to be like that?

379
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,912
What should I do?

380
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:15,242
-Eat.
-Eat?

381
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,292
Bon appetite.

382
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,850
Do we still not have the blood test
result for Ms Kim Min-joo?

383
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,552
We do. I raised a ruckus to get it.

384
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:06,587
Good job!

385
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:08,088
Hi, everyone!

386
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:09,389
Hi, quack!

387
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:15,495
Just wait a bit after I return to Japan.

388
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:17,598
When you wait next to him,

389
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,068
you'll come to realize his feelings.

390
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:26,106
Did you guys have fight again?

391
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:29,243
At least you can say hello back, Dr Oh.

392
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:31,678
Stop calling me a quack.

393
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,615
My patients actually think I'm a quack.

394
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,184
I'm sorry, quack. Oops...

395
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,721
It's become a habit.

396
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,022
So, quack...

397
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:44,525
Geez...

398
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,895
Never mind.

399
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:50,297
I forgive you because
I'm the bigger person here.

400
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:58,272
We need to do something.

401
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,877
I don't feel comfortable to be
so informal like before.

402
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:05,646
Please be mindful.

403
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,448
I just want to be friendly.

404
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:10,450
That won't happen overnight.

405
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:18,058
Geez.

406
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:24,765
You like that girl, don't you?

407
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:26,500
So what's going on between you?

408
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,801
Are you hitting on her?

409
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:30,170
-Who are you?
-Me?

410
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:33,040
I'm the fiery stick of Eungamdong!

411
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:34,027
What?

412
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:35,843
What did you say is on fire?

413
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,846
That's right!

414
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,646
Just an innocent patient
who wants to move on from her past.

415
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:43,584
Everyone has a past that
they want to hide, you know.

416
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,956
You shouldn't be out here.

417
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:51,558
You should go back to your room.

418
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,096
Good luck, Tall guy!

419
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:00,067
Who's that weirdo?

420
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:02,469
Who...

421
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:05,506
Why did you tell Mom that story?

422
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,608
Because it was necessary!

423
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,177
What's wrong with the girl
that delivers water?

424
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:11,778
It's not about her.

425
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:14,548
It's about you hitting on every woman
in the world!

426
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,316
You used to be a player too!

427
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,685
But I'm done with that life now.

428
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:20,320
Don't you know that
I'm getting married next month?

429
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:25,025
Does your fiance know
how many men got involved in your life?

430
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:26,727
You have a whole story!

431
00:35:27,694 --> 00:35:32,383
This boy is restarting a fire
on this stick.

432
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:33,367
"This boy"?

433
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:34,968
Is that how you talk
to your older brother?

434
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:36,737
Then you should behave like one!

435
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,672
You!

436
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:40,007
Come here!

437
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:42,209
You're in a hospital!

438
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,848
-Hey!
-You're in a hospital!

439
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:51,885
Live righteously. Okay?

440
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:56,590
Chief!

441
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,033
What are you doing with a patient?

442
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,236
She is a patient, but...

443
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:12,873
Hello, I'm this punk doctor's sister.

444
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:16,743
You're one good-looking man!

445
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:19,313
That's nasty!

446
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:20,447
You little...

447
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:25,519
-A mitral valve surgery?
-Yes.

448
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,889
You have mitral valve stenosis.

449
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:30,390
Mitral Stenosis.

450
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:33,237
Yes.

451
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:34,728
If untreated,

452
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:37,965
it'll cause left artery aneurysm
and atrial fibrillation.

453
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:40,267
So that means my left heart chamber
will cause abnormal heartbeats.

454
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:41,268
How do you know that?

455
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,402
Are you preparing for medical school?

456
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:45,772
Everyone knows it except you.

457
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:49,810
Your shortness of breath and dizziness are

458
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,079
because the left heart chamber doesn't
get enough blood.

459
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,414
It's now experiencing
a left ventricular failure.

460
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:55,716
That's enough.

461
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,085
Is there any other way to treat it
than surgery?

462
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,721
No medication?

463
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,092
You must get a surgery.

464
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,561
-Please explain it to her in detail.
-Sure.

465
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:10,821
Take care.

466
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,835
What was that?

467
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:16,170
Are you really preparing
for medical school?

468
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,704
Just visit 10 different hospitals.

469
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:19,473
You'll come to memorize it.

470
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,941
Why have you visited 10 hospitals?

471
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,876
Because I don't want the surgery!

472
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:46,433
Long story short,

473
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,936
your heart has four chambers
that blood flows through.

474
00:37:49,203 --> 00:37:51,972
There's a wall
between the left and right chambers.

475
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,708
And there's a door
between the top and bottom chambers.

476
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:59,046
So the wall is septum,
and the door is mitral valve, right?

477
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:00,347
You're quite knowledgeable.

478
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,684
I did my homework to know
more about my disease.

479
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:06,954
Then, it's easier for you to understand.

480
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:09,723
For your heart, one of the doors
is broken.

481
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,124
When that happens,

482
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:14,061
your upper left chamber expands
because the blood cannot flow correctly,

483
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,395
then puts a lot of pressure on your heart.

484
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:18,031
It gets dangerous because
the heart will start beating abnormally.

485
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,402
The surgery is about replacing that door.

486
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,405
It's not a difficult procedure,
so you don't have to worry.

487
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,000
I see.

488
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:28,617
Get some rest.

489
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:34,982
Hey, Tall guy.

490
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,484
Hey, stick!

491
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,386
Why are you bringing up my past?

492
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:41,889
You're good at explaining it.

493
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,223
It's easy to understand.

494
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:44,758
I am flattered.

495
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,427
Can I ask you a question?

496
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:48,884
What is it?

497
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:55,602
So you're saying that
there's no treatment other than surgery?

498
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:59,973
Yes. It's something that must be
operated on.

499
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:01,770
Are you happy?

500
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:04,478
Do you know Han Jae-joon?

501
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:05,913
I heard he's the Chief
who went to Harvard.

502
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,948
-Why?
-Is he trustworthy?

503
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,684
He's good at what he does.

504
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,687
Final question.

505
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:16,757
Is there really no other treatment?

506
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,026
None.

507
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:21,391
Are you sure?

508
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,730
Why? Are you scared of the surgery?

509
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,299
That's a part of it,

510
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:27,000
but I'm getting married next month.

511
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,436
I have met my soul mate.

512
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,339
You may laugh at me for saying this,

513
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:35,142
but even our heartbeats are the same.

514
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:40,247
You want to see? Look.

515
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:52,123
Quite pretty.

516
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:57,965
All these photos look pretty similar,
but different.

517
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:01,101
Do you know how long it took me
to pick the prettiest ones?

518
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:02,836
No idea.

519
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,107
I really want to be happy with him.

520
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:11,411
Live with him happily ever after,
with kids and everything.

521
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:15,883
I heard I can't get pregnant
once I get the surgery!

522
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:20,587
That's not always the case.

523
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,956
But it does get a lot more difficult.

524
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:28,195
He says he doesn't need kids
as long as we're happy together.

525
00:40:28,328 --> 00:40:30,130
But I really want kids!

526
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:32,966
I already bought baby clothes!

527
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,843
These are for our junior.

528
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,046
So do you think I'm dying
to get the surgery?

529
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:48,348
Of course not.

530
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,517
But you must get it.

531
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:01,828
That door...

532
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,464
Let me see that door.

533
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:05,866
What door?

534
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,534
That door of the upper left chamber.

535
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,236
The one that has to be fixed.

536
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:10,838
Why?

537
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:13,874
I'm so angry that I want to curse at it!

538
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:19,746
Name?

539
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:21,815
Kim Ah-young.

540
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:23,183
Pretty name, right?

541
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,018
Kim Ah-young...

542
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,493
Where is that lousy door?

543
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:35,392
Here.

544
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:45,172
Hey, because of you,
my dream got shattered!

545
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,541
So I'll shatter you into pieces too!

546
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:55,182
Thanks. I feel better now.

547
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,435
Wait.

548
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:24,645
Did you see it?

549
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:26,446
See what?

550
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,116
Her aortic valve and vascular muscle.

551
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:36,190
I saw that she has Marfan's syndrome.

552
00:42:37,157 --> 00:42:38,859
-So?
-So?

553
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:42,496
You can wait and operate
on the whole thing.

554
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:44,331
You don't have to operate right now.

555
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:46,600
Her mitral valve has gotten
narrowed so much.

556
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,335
It requires surgery.

557
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:49,469
Can't you see?

558
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:53,140
It isn't fatal yet as long as she doesn't
do any extreme exercise.

559
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,275
And she's getting married soon.

560
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:56,910
She'll need warfarin to undergo surgery,

561
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:58,579
but that can ruin her chance
of getting pregnant.

562
00:42:58,922 --> 00:42:59,847
So?

563
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,081
I'm saying you can delay...

564
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:03,250
Are you trying to make me forfeit?

565
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:08,422
Once she's pregnant,
her aortic aneurysm will only speed up.

566
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,991
If that turns into an aortic dissection
which will cause veins to explode,

567
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:12,359
she'll die.

568
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:13,827
It's not that bad yet.

569
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:15,529
So you want to leave her life to luck?

570
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,297
You know the surgery can wait!

571
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:19,399
She can get married and have kids.

572
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,702
If she's strong, she can last
more than 10 years.

573
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,971
The patient's life can
be completely different!

574
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:25,606
It doesn't matter what happens later,

575
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:27,140
as long as she becomes healthy
after surgery.

576
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:29,243
We must think about the patient's life
after surgery if possible.

577
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:30,268
You can do that.

578
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:32,279
I'm operating on this patient.

579
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,681
Is it because of the competition?

580
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:36,383
Then we'll call this a tie.

581
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,519
There's no tie!
This is the last round!

582
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,727
If you really want to be that good,
we can switch patients.

583
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:49,630
-What?
-We can switch patients.

584
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,067
You don't want to, do you?

585
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:56,069
Because you'll lose if there's no surgery.

586
00:43:58,071 --> 00:43:59,239
Let me know if your mind changes.

587
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,241
I'll gladly change patients.

588
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:12,961
Is it true?

589
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:17,724
I heard everything.
Is it true what you said?

590
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:20,427
-Why?
-Well...

591
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:24,331
Kim Ah-young is my sister.

592
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,162
Is it true?

593
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:30,971
At least according to my judgment,

594
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,706
it's true.

595
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,673
So, you don't want to operate?

596
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:42,683
That's not it.

597
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,286
I just want to hear your opinion.

598
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:47,721
The surgery is a must.

599
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:50,390
The valve has gotten very narrow.
It'll significantly affect her daily life.

600
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:51,920
Of course.

601
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:54,528
That girl apparently went to
every hospital

602
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:57,197
she could because
she wanted to avoid surgery.

603
00:44:57,264 --> 00:45:00,467
She's afraid that it might affect
her marriage next month.

604
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:03,203
And she's afraid that she might not
get pregnant because of the surgery.

605
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:10,143
Even the most tomboyish girls
are women after all, I guess.

606
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:15,115
You may leave if you're done.

607
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:26,493
But the Water Bottle says
the surgery won't be necessary...

608
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:28,829
Are you really a punk?

609
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,097
Pardon?

610
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:31,331
What are the symptoms of mitral stenosis?

611
00:45:32,677 --> 00:45:33,634
What are they?

612
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:37,137
That's...

613
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:38,238
Shortness of breath...

614
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:41,175
Abnormal heartbeat, shortness of breath,

615
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:43,744
Chest pain, hemoptysis, possible stroke...

616
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:47,514
You never said it's that serious.

617
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:48,982
Then when will it get serious?

618
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:50,884
-I beg your pardon?
-Will it get worse after warnings?

619
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:53,787
The surgery is necessary because
we never know when it'll get worse.

620
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:02,162
Are you perhaps doing this
because of the competition?

621
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,666
She got the same diagnosis
from other hospitals.

622
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:07,935
My diagnosis is the same.

623
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:10,037
Her mitral stenosis must be fixed.

624
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:13,240
I got it. Thank you.

625
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:17,544
Pregnancy is not impossible
even after the surgery.

626
00:46:19,746 --> 00:46:23,016
Your sister will be able to live
her desired life.

627
00:46:24,017 --> 00:46:26,053
That's the judgment that
I made as her surgeon.

628
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:29,823
You should think carefully

629
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:34,795
whether to trust my judgment
or the Water Bottle's.

630
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:53,013
I heard she has Marfan's syndrome.

631
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:54,515
Who told you?

632
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,416
Who else? Kim Chi-gyu told me.

633
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,852
He's been going around asking everyone.

634
00:47:02,856 --> 00:47:05,025
This is an opportunity from God.
You know that, right?

635
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:06,960
What do you mean by opportunity
from God?

636
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:11,465
You should just tell his sister that
it's okay to get the surgery later!

637
00:47:11,798 --> 00:47:14,568
Then discharge, competition over.
Victory for us!

638
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:17,638
She's Dr Han's patient.
So you should keep quiet.

639
00:47:17,704 --> 00:47:18,608
I already told her.

640
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:28,899
She's here.

641
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:30,056
Hey, Tall guy.

642
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,352
Is it really okay for me to not
get the surgery?

643
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:35,089
Tell me.

644
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,794
Tell me,
or I'll put a hole through your skull!

645
00:47:43,096 --> 00:47:44,131
In my opinion, yes.

646
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:47,868
You can wait until aortic aneurysm
appears then get the surgery together.

647
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:49,203
Shut up, Water Bottle!

648
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:52,172
You heard him too.

649
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:53,841
I don't need the surgery.

650
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:55,642
I can go home.

651
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:57,811
I said you have to get it!

652
00:47:57,878 --> 00:47:59,680
He says it's not necessary!

653
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:00,747
Just based on his words?

654
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:02,149
He's a doctor.

655
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:03,650
How can you trust this punk?

656
00:48:03,984 --> 00:48:05,319
Do you know where he went
for medical school?

657
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:07,321
He went school in Pyeongyang!

658
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:08,284
So what?

659
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,123
He's still a doctor.

660
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:14,628
Even the Chief who went to Harvard
says you need to get the surgery.

661
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,263
And you went to other hospitals too!

662
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,732
And they all told you that you need
to get the surgery!

663
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:21,768
So I should get the surgery?

664
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:24,771
I did my homework too!

665
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,176
Once I get the surgery,
it'll be nearly impossible to conceive.

666
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:35,782
Even if I get pregnant,
I might be forced to give my baby up!

667
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:39,953
Dr Han says it's not impossible.

668
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:41,622
You can conceive if you try.

669
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:46,894
Why do I have to try for something
that everyone else just gets easily?

670
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:52,633
I just want to live as other people.

671
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,602
If I listen to that tall guy
and get the surgery later,

672
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,571
I can do that.

673
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:01,742
So tell me.

674
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,311
I'll do what you tell me to.

675
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:11,985
I'll do as you say.

676
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:19,626
Should I get the surgery?

677
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:24,498
Should I not?

678
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:28,402
Tell me, Chi-gyu, what should I do?

679
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:30,571
Get it.

680
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:37,744
Get the surgery.

681
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:23,924
Anything you want me to keep for you?

682
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:30,764
Please answer the phone if it rings.

683
00:50:32,299 --> 00:50:34,101
I told him to cancel the ceremony.

684
00:50:35,002 --> 00:50:36,068
Okay.

685
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:46,613
Let's go.

686
00:51:05,632 --> 00:51:08,502
What if they tie again?

687
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,805
The hospital will decide.

688
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:13,554
Decide whom?

689
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:17,244
That'd be up to their chairman.

690
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:29,289
I'll look forward to your
skillful performance.

691
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:32,515
What's wrong?

692
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:33,594
Is something the matter?

693
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:35,963
I'm going into Dr Han's surgery.

694
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:37,497
What are you talking about?

695
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,168
You really don't know?

696
00:51:43,036 --> 00:51:46,173
Just think about what you did to me.

697
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,642
What I did to you?
You need to explain.

698
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,577
Let's talk after the surgery.

699
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,053
What are you doing?
We must get ready.

700
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,122
Why is Dr Han going in there?

701
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:03,991
She did that the last time too!

702
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,393
Don't worry about her and focus
on the surgery!

703
00:52:06,727 --> 00:52:10,264
I'll get her back at all cost
once we win the competition.

704
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:11,798
Hurry up.

705
00:53:06,787 --> 00:53:07,721
You can wait outside, Chi-gyu.

706
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:09,122
May I?

707
00:53:09,213 --> 00:53:10,157
Sure.

708
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:19,790
Jae-joon,

709
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:24,905
please take good care of her.

710
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:26,621
Of course.

711
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:35,916
Tell them we're ready.

712
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:50,797
It all should've been over
after the twins' surgery!

713
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,506
Just think about what you did to me.

714
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:28,435
The ceremony is canceled, Ah-young.

715
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,038
They're ready.

716
00:55:15,182 --> 00:55:16,683
Please take care of the vital signs.

717
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:17,714
Yes.

718
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:23,323
Please stay focused, Master.

719
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,692
I'm a bit nervous for our last round!

720
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:32,833
Hey, Water Bottle...

721
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:38,906
I told Ah-young's fiance to not
cancel the ceremony.

722
00:55:40,307 --> 00:55:44,845
Dr Han told you that
he'll switch patients if you want.

723
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:46,914
What are you doing, Kim Chi-gyu?

724
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:52,085
Please let my Ah-young
to live as others do.

725
00:55:54,254 --> 00:55:55,389
Hey, Water Bottle!

726
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:56,623
Get out of here!

727
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:58,055
Hey.

728
00:55:58,926 --> 00:56:02,863
Please help me do the right thing
for her as her older brother this once.

729
00:56:05,065 --> 00:56:07,034
What are you doing?
Get him out of here!

730
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:09,065
Hey.

731
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,106
Wait a moment! Hey, Water Bottle!

732
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:16,510
Wait! Water Bottle!

733
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:22,082
Park Hoon, if you listen to him,
it's game over.

734
00:56:22,149 --> 00:56:23,317
We'll lose!

735
00:56:41,328 --> 00:56:42,288
Scalpel.

736
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:52,813
Grab your scalpel!

737
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:10,998
Don't ever...

738
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,737
forget...

739
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:20,941
the fact...

740
00:57:21,508 --> 00:57:23,944
that you're a doctor.

741
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:26,780
I'll win the last round at any cost.

742
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:28,048
So let's do it together.

743
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:31,852
We'll form the surgery team
following your original plan...

744
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:33,587
And we'll go
into the operating room together.

745
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,072
What's going on?

746
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:09,056
What are you doing, Dr Park?

747
00:58:10,224 --> 00:58:11,126
Geez.

748
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:12,626
What is it?

749
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:14,628
What is he doing?

750
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:30,677
What do you want?

751
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:32,225
What do you think I want?
