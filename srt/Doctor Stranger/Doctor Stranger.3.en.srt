1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,500
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,966
Is this the girl?

3
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,777
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:49,249 --> 00:01:10,657
Hoon... Jae-hee. Jae-hee.

5
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,104
Jae-hee.

6
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,190
EPISODE 3

7
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,282
Is she the right one?

8
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,997
When can you bring her?

9
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,960
Well, that...

10
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,371
Only this stuff knows when.

11
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,606
How much will it be?

12
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,709
She might be a bit expensive.

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,941
How much?

14
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:17,330
-USD 500,000.
-What?

15
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:19,182
They said this girl
is in a labor camp now.

16
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,507
That is why she's expensive.

17
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:22,709
A labor camp?

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,579
So you need to work harder
to make the money!

19
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:30,259
Isn't it easy for doctor like you
to make money in this country?

20
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,397
These are the candidate hospitals
for your heart surgery.

21
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,138
MYUNG-WOO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

22
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:59,721
CHAIRMAN: DR OH JOON-GYU

23
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:05,085
Forgive me for having kept you waiting.

24
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,133
What happened to that patient earlier?

25
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,068
We're Myung-woo University Hospital.

26
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,736
Do I need to say more?

27
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,429
Mr Chairman, I think I've seen
Professor Han from somewhere else before.

28
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,067
That young professor?

29
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,310
I haven't seen him before.

30
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,579
I vaguely remember an article about

31
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,573
the youngest Asian associate professor
at Harvard Medical School.

32
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,143
-Mr Chairman. Could he be...?
-You're right.

33
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,222
Not only was he the youngest
associate professor at Harvard,

34
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,083
he also performed over 1,000 heart
surgeries without any failure.

35
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,119
Come in.

36
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,238
Let me introduce

37
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,766
our new head of cardiologic surgery
at Myung-woo University Hospital.

38
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,722
I'm Han Jae-joon.

39
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,550
I'm the one who picked you
out of that low-tier medical school.

40
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,843
Is this how you repay my generosity?

41
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,278
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,548
I missed it because I couldn't see
the position of the OM branch.

43
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,491
Be quiet!

44
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,860
I lost my position all because of you.

45
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,922
My prospect of becoming the director
of this hospital is in jeopardy!

46
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,191
-I am sorry.
-Get out of here!

47
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,328
Tomorrow is your last day
at this hospital.

48
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,730
Do you understand? Get out!

49
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,020
Do you have to go? You're off today.

50
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,813
I want to see the patients
that I operated on.

51
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:16,259
There is a reason why the hospital
gives doctors a day off.

52
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,951
I think you should rest today.

53
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,888
I'll take you on a nice date
on my next day off.

54
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,623
There's something I need to tell you.

55
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,296
Tell me later. Okay?

56
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,598
Okay, then.

57
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,602
Go on in.

58
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,892
Professor!

59
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,237
You can call me Jae-joon
in the staff lounge.

60
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,796
Okay, Jae-joon...

61
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,042
Aren't you off today?

62
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,217
Just stopping by.

63
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,371
-Go back to sleep.
-Yes, Professor.

64
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,517
Do you want to die?

65
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,076
I got it, Jae-joon.

66
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,187
Good.

67
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,415
Good night!

68
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,232
Professor Han is so cool!

69
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,359
Is that something you should
say under my blanket?

70
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,693
Don't you think so?

71
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,730
"I said you can call me Jae-joon
in the staff lounge."

72
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,468
Don't get your hopes up, Dr Eun.
He is taken.

73
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,471
Who? Dr Oh?

74
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,244
Don't you think I'm better than her,
honestly?

75
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:26,914
Stop talking nonsense.
Shall we continue, Dr Eun?

76
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,116
Your ears are pretty.

77
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,088
Shall we?

78
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,755
Let's resume your physical exam!

79
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,037
It helps me improve my concentration.

80
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:55,885
And since it's delicate, I think
it's good practice for us surgeons.

81
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:01,315
I operated on Dr Moon's patient...
as you had instructed.

82
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:09,165
An assistant professor position
next year...

83
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,156
See that mounted knight
in front of the castle?

84
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,564
I think that knight is you, Dr Yang.

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,335
You will have the position.

86
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:27,241
It's the duty of a lord
to reward his knights well.

87
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,723
What a piece of garbage!

88
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,528
Hoon...

89
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,406
Hoon...

90
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,199
Hoon...

91
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,376
Stop watching it! I'm right here.

92
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,648
Sorry.

93
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,728
You made half a million USD
in this clinic?

94
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,832
I almost died making that money.

95
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,437
What a shame to waste that money!
Don't you think?

96
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,126
A waste? Nonsense. Let's eat.

97
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,812
Ouch! It's hot!

98
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,379
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

99
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,692
It goes well with seaweed.

100
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,238
It's delicious.

101
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,407
You should eat, too.

102
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,509
Hoon...

103
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,518
What a car.

104
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:26,920
Welcome back, Sang-jin.

105
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:27,921
Sang-jin?

106
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:32,793
You're an illegitimate child of my father.
Don't call me by my name.

107
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:34,303
Then, what should I call you?

108
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,829
You don't have to call me anything.

109
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,283
Where's the key?

110
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,122
Keep the car.

111
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,433
You little brat!

112
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,610
Where is Soo-hyun's seat?

113
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,855
This is our family meeting.

114
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,414
Why do we need a seat for her?

115
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:30,250
What are you waiting for?

116
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,787
Stop.

117
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,257
What is your job?

118
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:41,170
-I am the director of a branch.
-How did you become a director?

119
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,405
Mom told me to be the director.

120
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,139
-Get up.
-Excuse me?

121
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,466
Didn't you hear me?

122
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,351
You must know how a hospital runs
if you want to run a hospital.

123
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:05,928
What are you talking about?

124
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,231
Who is running the hospital
other than Sang-jin?

125
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,767
Soo-hyun wants to learn. And I allowed it.

126
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:14,437
Honey, Sang-jin is your son.

127
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,396
It doesn't matter.
I don't need anyone who's useless.

128
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,767
-Start your report.
-Yes, Chairman.

129
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:27,174
I'll begin the presentation
with the financial status of the hospital.

130
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,119
Myung-woo University Hospital?

131
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,580
Yes. You will receive a per diem.
Deliver bottles in the afternoon.

132
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,016
Forget it. Why would I go there?

133
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,786
I heard it'll cost USD 500,000
to get her out.

134
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,491
It's not like you'll pay me
USD 500,000 for this job!

135
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:46,326
Many a little makes a mickle.
Don't you know?

136
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,669
I'm not interested in that,
look for someone else.

137
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,895
Let me go sightseeing with my mother.

138
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,010
I said I don't want to!

139
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,469
-Get out of my way!
-Please?

140
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,258
Hello, ma'am.

141
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,013
I'm on my way to the hospital.

142
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,682
Where are you taking her?

143
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,562
Mom, do you want to see
Gyeongbokgung Palace?

144
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,729
Sure!

145
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,309
Chang Yi, was that guy Park Hoon?

146
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,579
-Yes, why?
-The name sounds familiar.

147
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,038
It's a common name.

148
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,734
Taxi!

149
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:45,165
MYUNG-WOO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

150
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,683
15TH DIRECTOR
Choi Byeong-cheol

151
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,810
Hello, Mr Choi!

152
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:36,470
Hoon, you want to go see your father,
don't you?

153
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,781
Yes, Mr Choi.

154
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,141
Then, come with me.

155
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,512
15TH DIRECTOR
Choi Byeong-cheol

156
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:59,435
Geez, I don't know who did this,
but it's very well done.

157
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,604
If he didn't do this,
you would've lost your finger!

158
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:02,905
Really?

159
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,299
You might end up
losing that finger forever.

160
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,645
Let's get an X-ray first. Nurse Lee!

161
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,013
Just a minute please.

162
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,307
She always needs a minute.
Hurry! She needs an X-ray.

163
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,045
Once you leave this room
and pass two doors,

164
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:17,778
you'll see a blue line on the floor.

165
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:20,632
If you follow the blue line,
you'll get to the radiology department.

166
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,188
Hey, 50 cents.

167
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,464
What did you say was the heads?

168
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,733
Who are you?

169
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,914
I'm the idiot who got swindled
by this smart, little girl.

170
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,173
It's your fault for being naive.

171
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,843
Don't you run out of breath
when you sleep?

172
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,757
Excuse me.

173
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,585
I'm fine.

174
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:02,145
-Where are you headed to?
-The radiology department.

175
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm going there, too!

176
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,035
But I feel like I am totally lost.

177
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,728
This hospital is pretty complicated.

178
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,031
Where's the radiology department?

179
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,653
Let's go.

180
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:41,962
What's this nonsense?

181
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,711
Excuse me, nurse.
Where is the radiology department?

182
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,054
Can you see the blue line?
Follow that blue line.

183
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:53,182
We ended up here after following it.

184
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,443
Don't follow this one.
Follow that blue line.

185
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,850
Let's go.

186
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,920
Wait for me.

187
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,264
Darn it.

188
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:03,669
My back...

189
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,398
-Excuse me?
-Where's the radiology department?

190
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,103
You can follow that blue line.

191
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:20,670
We made a full circle following that!

192
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,474
Not that blue line,
follow the middle one.

193
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:24,932
Shouldn't you post
some kind of sign for that?

194
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,235
Can't you read?

195
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:31,972
Shouldn't the sign be bigger?

196
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:35,943
She said it's that way.

197
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,882
Geez, darn it.

198
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:50,324
DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY

199
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,034
Fifty cents!

200
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:30,364
Sir, make sure you get
a medical check-up, too!

201
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,835
I... I need to replace the bottle.

202
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:40,049
-What's going on?
-A bus and truck collision.

203
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,011
-Lots of casualties.
-But why call all of us?

204
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:45,288
-All general surgeons are at a conference.
-Why did it have to be today?

205
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:47,347
-How many patients?
-Fifteen just at our hospital.

206
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,131
-Are they here?
-They're a couple of minutes away.

207
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:58,091
Make sure we have enough beds and get
as much blood cells as possible.

208
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:01,085
Call radiologists, orthopedists,
and neurosurgeons.

209
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,229
Yes, sir.

210
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,052
Now it's our turn.

211
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,214
-Ma'am...
-Please make way...

212
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,525
Ah, did you get your X-ray?

213
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,360
Yes, but...

214
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,795
Then, can you wait a moment?

215
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:27,730
I'll have the doctor
look at it right away.

216
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,624
But... it's not for me.

217
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,436
Can you take a look at my father?

218
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,828
What's wrong with your father?

219
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,532
He has had difficulty breathing
the past couple of days.

220
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:42,536
He ran out of breath
on our way to get X-Rays, too.

221
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:45,281
Really? Just a minute.

222
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:46,435
Doctor?

223
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:15,278
He keeps losing consciousness.

224
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,647
Sir, what's your name?

225
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:18,992
Sir?

226
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:23,402
-Cardiac arrest. CPR!
-Yes, sir.

227
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:24,887
Give me an ampoule.

228
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:32,519
Take him inside.

229
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,796
Blood pressure is 80/40. Pulse is 85.

230
00:22:42,887 --> 00:22:44,637
The patient claims that he's okay, but...

231
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,014
Check if the femoral artery is damaged.

232
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:54,308
Blood pressure is 95/50, pulse 60.

233
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:00,590
Femoral open fracture
with pelvic fracture.

234
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:01,548
CT Scan.

235
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:03,016
-Wrap wound and get saline.
-Yes, sir.

236
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:05,252
Check for retroperitoneum hemorrhage
during the CT scan.

237
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,262
Yes, sir.

238
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,254
Let's move.

239
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,678
-Is he conscious?
-Barely.

240
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:26,840
Start monitoring the incoming patients.

241
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:28,286
Yes, sir.

242
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,188
Prepare for irrigation.

243
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:42,980
IRRIGATION
WASHING OF WOUNDS

244
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:45,807
Forceps.

245
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:56,570
CPR! CPR!

246
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,382
Are you okay, Dad?

247
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,385
Yeah...

248
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,226
-My father is...
-I'm sorry.

249
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:13,395
Dr Min.

250
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:17,593
What's the matter?

251
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,229
We said we're sick first.
Why aren't we getting treated?

252
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,156
Hospital policy states that patients
from ambulances come first.

253
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:27,343
Let's see... Jeong-min, you have
a little fracture on your finger.

254
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:29,972
The first aid was helpful.
You'll get better soon.

255
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,398
Can you please see my father?

256
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:32,900
Your father?

257
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,663
How are you feeling, sir?

258
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:40,249
-Dr Oh, please come here!
-Okay.

259
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,210
He keeps running out of breath
since two nights ago.

260
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,779
He couldn't even sleep last night!

261
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,423
Do you take any medication regularly?

262
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:52,419
He takes something for blood pressure
and something for his weak stomach.

263
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,991
His back started to ache some days ago,
so he put on some pain relief patches.

264
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,774
What is she doing?

265
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,629
Pneumothorax...?

266
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:04,998
Please take a deep breath, sir.

267
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:08,602
It's not pneumothorax.

268
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,060
-How about his heart?
-What?

269
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:15,040
-Are you his family?
-Well, nope.

270
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,779
-Dr Oh!
-Okay!

271
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:21,097
-Dr Kim!
-Yes?

272
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:22,959
Do X-ray and blood test for this patient.

273
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,026
Got it.

274
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:25,881
Please finish up for me.

275
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,389
-Can you stand up?
-Yes.

276
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,136
Take that elevator and get off
on the third floor,

277
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:34,240
you'll see a green line...

278
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:38,274
Take him there yourself instead
of blabbering about green and blue lines!

279
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:39,466
I guess. Sure.

280
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:40,801
Please get up.

281
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,898
How long has his ankle
been swollen like this?

282
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:03,891
It's my first time seeing it.

283
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:05,935
Does he urinate often?

284
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:08,069
He rarely goes to the bathroom.

285
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,622
-His high blood pressure...
-Mister.

286
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:13,600
What are you doing?

287
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:16,603
I think his condition is getting worse.

288
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:18,581
Are you a doctor?

289
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:21,875
Yes and no, I guess.

290
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:24,316
Dad!

291
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,213
Are you okay?

292
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:31,513
Dr Oh told me to get his X-ray.

293
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:32,819
He's not breathing.

294
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,692
Here! Please come here!

295
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:58,378
What are you doing!

296
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:01,190
-Intubation! Quickly!
-It's cardiac arrest. Do CPR!

297
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,226
Who are you to tell me what to do?

298
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,357
I said it's cardiac arrest!

299
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:06,386
Call the emergency room. Hurry!

300
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,393
Check his heart.

301
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,804
What's wrong with his heart?

302
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,396
Why can't I hear anything?

303
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:18,941
Please bring a defibrillator.

304
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,765
-Massage!
-Massage what?

305
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:23,136
You call yourself a doctor, scum? CPR!

306
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:35,816
Charge 200 joules.

307
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:38,880
-What are you doing right now?
-Back off!

308
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:42,623
One more time!

309
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,854
The heartbeat is back for now.
But he has MI and heart failure.

310
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:53,142
He needs surgery right now.

311
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,530
Get an operation room ready.

312
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:55,969
But who would be the surgeon?

313
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,611
Clear!

314
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:09,416
One more time. Clear!

315
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,921
-Prepare for surgery right now.
-Yes, sir.

316
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:18,468
Yes?

317
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,137
Chief, we have a patient
who needs urgent heart surgery.

318
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:22,129
Status?

319
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,507
Dr Oh wanted to do some blood test,

320
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,609
but now he has myocardial infarction
and heart failure.

321
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,701
Heart failure?

322
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,647
Dr Oh!

323
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:33,607
What's with the patient
you sent for a blood test?

324
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:37,978
First, do coronary angioplasty
and echocardiogram,

325
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:39,622
prepare an operation room
and call Dr Eun.

326
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,591
Huh? Are you not coming?

327
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:42,816
Calm down!

328
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:46,197
I'll be there after an amputation patient.

329
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,926
I said I understood.

330
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:15,324
-Who's performing the surgery?
-Dr Han said he's coming.

331
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:16,459
Dr Han?

332
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,418
His amputation patient's condition
is very serious.

333
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:19,896
But will this patient hold out?

334
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:21,488
I thought he had MI and septal rupture.

335
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:23,290
He just had cardiac arrest out there.

336
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:24,934
Another cardiac arrest might finish him.

337
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:26,020
What?

338
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,400
Please pick up, Chief.

339
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:59,560
If you don't do something soon,
he will expire.

340
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,530
EXPIRE
DEATH

341
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:02,996
Should I call Dr Moon?

342
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,498
I guess you should.

343
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:07,704
What do they mean by "expire"?

344
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,005
Professor Moon!

345
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,675
I can't do it!

346
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:17,578
Don't you know that I'm suspended?

347
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,218
Hey, if that patient dies,
it'll be Han Jae-joon's fault.

348
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:25,552
It would be the responsibility
of the new head of cardiology!

349
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:27,020
Get lost!

350
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:31,992
Professor Moon!

351
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:37,865
This patient's struck by bad luck.

352
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:40,200
Dr Eun, please help me.

353
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:41,878
I want to die! Please help.

354
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:43,837
I'd like to,
but this is out of my control.

355
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:45,106
Dr Eun!

356
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:53,180
"Expire." That's a bad word, isn't it?

357
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:56,283
It's not a good word.

358
00:31:57,784 --> 00:31:59,353
Please do it for him, mister.

359
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:03,900
If I act recklessly, I'll lose my license.

360
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,559
I still need to make a lot of money.

361
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:08,729
Please, mister.

362
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:19,239
I'm not being arrogant or anything,
but I'm a bit expensive.

363
00:32:37,824 --> 00:32:39,326
Would this be enough?

364
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:45,265
Of course not.

365
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:06,353
I want to be with my dad.

366
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,947
-What is this?
-It's an empty water bottle.

367
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:38,952
Get rid of it.

368
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,290
Where's the delivery guy?

369
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:48,795
I'm losing my mind here.

370
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:50,163
Where is he?

371
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,169
Look, Dr Han is here.

372
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:09,043
From now on...

373
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:12,853
...never forget...

374
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:21,595
...that you're a doctor.

375
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:25,899
Darn it, Father!

376
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:35,676
If the patient dies,
it'll be Han Jae-joon's fault!

377
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:05,515
I'll start CABG and sepal rupture repair.

378
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:06,482
Wait a second.

379
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:08,008
Are you Dr Han?

380
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:11,580
Dr Han?

381
00:35:12,082 --> 00:35:12,980
Scalpel.

382
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:16,126
Wait! Hold the scalpel...

383
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:17,165
Stop!

384
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,592
Bovie.

385
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:38,881
What's going on?
Are you operating on a corpse?

386
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,650
Why is there no blood?

387
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,543
I've never seen this before either,
Professor Moon!

388
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,754
Great work, Dr Han.

389
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:08,111
I need to see one more patient,
can you go to operating room no 1?

390
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:09,145
Operating room no 1?

391
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:12,021
The patient that you sent to get
a blood test had a myocardial infarction.

392
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,481
SURGEON
Han Jae-joon

393
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:35,550
-What's going on?
-Dr Oh.

394
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:39,733
Hey, scum, hold tight.

395
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,604
May I ask who you are, doctor?

396
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,005
Bigger forceps please.

397
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,018
-Who are you?
-Back off!

398
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,110
I'm asking who you are.

399
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:51,697
-Me?
-Yes, you.

400
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:53,923
I'm a doctor. Satisfied?

401
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,449
Cut.

402
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,755
Unless you're going to operate,
just stay quiet.

403
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:04,191
Dr Eun. Stop the operation now.

404
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:10,239
Okay, if you're going to take over,
I can back off.

405
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,965
I don't care as long as the patient lives.

406
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:14,710
The sepal rupture repair is done.

407
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:15,802
Just do the CABG now.

408
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:19,015
I'm afraid this is beyond
your capabilities.

409
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,016
Dr Eun.

410
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,141
Calm down.

411
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,061
He's not Dr Han.

412
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,612
But I think we can trust him.

413
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:28,291
I can't let a complete stranger
perform surgery!

414
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:29,759
We need to save the patient first.

415
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,192
Revealing his identity comes later.

416
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,252
Sound good?

417
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:35,022
Shall we continue?

418
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:38,446
Gauze.

419
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:48,352
Security?

420
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:50,494
Yes, speaking.

421
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,608
-Yes?
-Just a moment please.

422
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:35,015
He's finished already?

423
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:36,350
Very fast, right?

424
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:39,019
I don't know who he is,
but he was amazing.

425
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:54,668
Excuse me, doctor.

426
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:03,177
Excuse me, doctor!

427
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,163
Where is he?

428
00:39:14,254 --> 00:39:15,556
Start pressing buttons!

429
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,138
Dad!

430
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:41,248
Don't worry. He'll be okay.

431
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:44,386
Do you want to come with us?

432
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:52,326
Who was that doctor?

433
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:55,095
I don't know.

434
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,606
How can you not know?

435
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:58,432
You said he was with the patient
the whole time!

436
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,534
That's true.

437
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:02,236
Check his heart!

438
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:07,274
No.

439
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:17,260
I must have lost my mind.
What was I thinking?

440
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:19,439
For what glory did I dare
to perform that surgery?

441
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:23,123
My money!

442
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:45,212
You must be mistaken.

443
00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:47,681
How can a water delivery guy
perform such a surgery?

444
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,350
I swear he was holding a water bottle!

445
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:51,885
Really?

446
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,257
But his skills mean that he's done
open-heart surgery hundreds of times.

447
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:07,610
Awesome!

448
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:09,345
Getting slapped after saving a life.

449
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:11,848
It's an act of murder for
a non-doctor to perform a surgery.

450
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:14,250
-Don't you know that?
-I said I'm a doctor.

451
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:15,635
How can you be a doctor?

452
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,653
I guess I'm not a doctor after all.

453
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:20,347
But you can't say you're a doctor either.

454
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:22,423
-What?
-You ran away from a patient.

455
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:28,755
Do you know what people like us
are called?

456
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:30,569
Quack.

457
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:32,626
Serious ones, too.

458
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:33,977
Got it?

459
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:40,234
Really?

460
00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:45,739
What's going on?

461
00:41:46,306 --> 00:41:51,178
Dr Oh, I see torsades de pointes
and increasing pulmonary artery pressure.

462
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:54,081
What's going on?

463
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:55,415
Hello, Dr Keum.

464
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:57,384
Hello.

465
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,563
What's going on?

466
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:02,823
He's the patient
that the water bottle guy operated on.

467
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,091
Water bottle guy?

468
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,936
Your patient is in critical condition now.

469
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,038
Call the police now.

470
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,675
-What are the symptoms?
-Why do you need to know?

471
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:25,012
Torsades de pointes
and increasing pulmonary artery pressure?

472
00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:28,782
Geez, you really are a quack.

473
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,918
Tell them to inject magnesium.

474
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:32,895
Inject 20 milligrams of magnesium.

475
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:33,936
Yes, sir.

476
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:46,300
Yes, Dr Han ordered the same thing.

477
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,569
His general condition
was weak to begin with,

478
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,704
so he had trouble with electrolytes
post-surgery.

479
00:42:53,173 --> 00:42:55,042
This is a rare case.

480
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,244
But I guess a quack like you
would never know.

481
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:00,857
Let me talk to Dr Han.

482
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:02,692
You don't need to ask him.

483
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,252
Is the patient okay, Jae-joon?

484
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:07,688
Yes, he's stable now.

485
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,612
Let me go!

486
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:25,239
-Let me go!
-Where do you think you're going?

487
00:43:27,135 --> 00:43:29,585
I need to go deliver water bottles!

488
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:31,078
Chang-yi is going to kill me!

489
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:37,784
I don't know how you guessed it correctly,
but this isn't the end.

490
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:42,122
-Why?
-Because you did something wrong.

491
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:46,827
What did I do wrong?

492
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:48,981
Even if you have a license...

493
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:53,433
...you must get permission in advance
when operating at another hospital.

494
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:55,578
That's because it was an emergency.

495
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:58,572
Your license can be suspended for it.

496
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:01,708
I'm in trouble now.

497
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:12,052
You've been licensed for two years.

498
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,590
What medical school did you go to?

499
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:20,002
I went to a medical school. Satisfied?

500
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:21,495
Fortunately, the patient is stable.

501
00:44:22,462 --> 00:44:26,133
But I don't want you to show up
to this hospital ever again.

502
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:29,469
I guess you have real doctors here, too.

503
00:44:30,496 --> 00:44:33,040
Don't worry.
I don't want to come back here either.

504
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:35,676
I almost forgot.

505
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:40,940
My money.

506
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:44,117
The surgery fee that
you took away from me!

507
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:45,085
What fee?

508
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:50,757
Fine, I'll consider this a robbery.

509
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,017
Good day.

510
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:02,779
Are you really letting him go like this?

511
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,605
We almost lost that patient.

512
00:45:04,938 --> 00:45:08,951
If this got out, we'd be acknowledging
that we're short on doctors.

513
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,210
It's true, but...

514
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:12,955
What did he mean by surgery fee?

515
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,114
I don't know.

516
00:45:39,973 --> 00:45:42,509
I got slapped and robbed today.
My life sucks!

517
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,341
Hoon!

518
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,215
I told you
that I didn't want to come here!

519
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,318
Did something happen?

520
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:53,954
Forget it.

521
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,291
Thanks for coming anyway.

522
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,295
-I'm leaving.
-You can't!

523
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:02,362
I'm here because my mom said she's dizzy.

524
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:05,832
Why did you come here when you have me?

525
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:09,870
You! Stop!

526
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:14,341
They just said I can go!
Are you playing with me?

527
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:17,211
Call me. I won't let this one go!

528
00:46:17,744 --> 00:46:19,746
Stop him!

529
00:46:19,836 --> 00:46:21,836
Wait a moment! Stop!

530
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:23,984
Water bottle! Hey!

531
00:46:31,758 --> 00:46:33,160
Excuse me, ma'am.

532
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,648
I'm number 760!

533
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:00,721
Hey! Stop!

534
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:04,716
Stop!

535
00:47:05,097 --> 00:47:06,909
Stop! Stop!

536
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:09,788
Stop! Stop!

537
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:32,286
LEE CHANG-YI

538
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,464
Get here. Right now.

539
00:47:34,555 --> 00:47:36,199
Hey, I just...

540
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,949
If you don't come here right now,
I'm dumping the water into the sewer!

541
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,661
-Calm down and just listen!
-Be quiet!

542
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,030
Geez, my life sucks.

543
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,174
GARIBONG CLINIC

544
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,577
My car is really fast!

545
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:19,509
Who the heck are you?

546
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:23,132
I'm Moon Hyung-wook
from Myung-woo University Hospital.

547
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:35,992
Open the door! I need to talk to you!

548
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,218
I'm done talking with you guys! Get lost!

549
00:48:39,286 --> 00:48:41,164
I think there's a misunderstanding.

550
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:44,124
I'm not here to bother you!

551
00:48:50,697 --> 00:48:53,200
I'm here to give you a chance!

552
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:55,302
Open the door!

553
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:57,269
Who are you?

554
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:06,869
Hoon!

555
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,394
What's a Myung-woo doctor doing here?

556
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:24,731
I had a hellish time thanks to you!

557
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:27,043
Let's talk without violence! It hurts!

558
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:29,146
Per diem isn't going to cut it.
Give me a week's worth.

559
00:49:29,237 --> 00:49:31,555
That's not important.
Let me see Jae-hee's face again.

560
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:33,915
Why?

561
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:37,609
Hoon...

562
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:41,715
-Why?
-Hoon, I think I saw her today.

563
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,185
Now you're lying to me?

564
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:48,055
I'm serious! I saw her at the hospital.

565
00:49:48,755 --> 00:49:49,796
What?

566
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:08,375
I need to go to your hospital.

567
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,345
Really?

568
00:50:13,914 --> 00:50:15,330
You need more doctors?

569
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:17,117
We have a shortage.

570
00:50:17,584 --> 00:50:22,022
But less than 20 residents applied
for cardiology nationwide this year.

571
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:26,093
And only our hospital can afford to get
new cardiology residents every year.

572
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:32,099
I came to this hospital because you said
you want to make it the best in the world.

573
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,402
If we're striving to become
the world's best,

574
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,471
we shouldn't be hindered
by our domestic limitations.

575
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:40,107
I guess we do need someone

576
00:50:40,198 --> 00:50:43,076
since Dr Oh is moving
to the Management and Policy Office.

577
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:48,724
Fine. I'll take care of the budget.

578
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:50,517
Find me someone good.

579
00:51:03,597 --> 00:51:04,565
Do you know?

580
00:51:04,965 --> 00:51:08,569
Your daughter gave me a very nice car.

581
00:51:09,203 --> 00:51:12,039
So I also have a gift for her.

582
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:13,874
Do you want to see?

583
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:17,277
It's you.

584
00:51:18,612 --> 00:51:21,615
So you can't die until you see her.

585
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:23,149
Okay?

586
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:34,394
-Management and Policy Office?
-It's not confirmed yet.

587
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:36,606
The Chairman never mentions anything
that's not confirmed.

588
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:37,581
Jae-joon...

589
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:43,637
Hey! Dr Oh!

590
00:51:58,886 --> 00:52:01,829
-What brings you here?
-Nothing much.

591
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:05,334
I wanted to repay your kindness
with a gift.

592
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,536
Give and take.

593
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:07,895
Let's just pretend that I got it.

594
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:09,472
Thanks.

595
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:11,164
Pay attention when your elder is speaking!

596
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,744
The gift that I want to give to you is...

597
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:17,146
If you want to keep your position
as the director of the branch,

598
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:18,372
don't mess with me.

599
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:20,007
What?

600
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:24,545
You still don't know why I wanted to move
to the Planning and Evaluation Office?

601
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:27,185
You little brat...

602
00:52:35,522 --> 00:52:37,991
Fine. Just wait.

603
00:52:38,725 --> 00:52:42,196
I have your gift
that will completely crush your ego!

604
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:50,103
Now that you moved to the main branch,
you must get well soon.

605
00:52:50,737 --> 00:52:55,326
You said you wanted to have this, right?

606
00:52:59,112 --> 00:53:01,448
Please don't lose it, okay?

607
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:40,402
Come to the back.

608
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,699
-Did you do it?
-Pardon?

609
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,626
I told you to call Dr Song Jae-hee!

610
00:53:46,717 --> 00:53:48,095
Dr Song? Right!

611
00:53:48,562 --> 00:53:51,131
-Where is she right now?
-She's at the pharmacy.

612
00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:52,099
The pharmacy.

613
00:53:55,035 --> 00:53:56,132
Let's go.

614
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:03,410
Where's the pharmacy?

615
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:27,467
SONG JAE-HEE, M.D.

616
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,285
Who are you?

617
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:56,964
Hey, water bottle guy.

618
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:01,668
Who is Song Jae-hee?

619
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:03,904
That's me. Can I help you?

620
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:15,816
Please hurry.

621
00:55:15,907 --> 00:55:17,451
Yes. Just a minute, doctor.

622
00:55:19,479 --> 00:55:21,722
Hoon, the doctor that I saw...

623
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,260
You are Dr Park, right?

624
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:29,930
Since you're here anyway,
let's go have a chat in my office.

625
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:32,533
It seems like you're looking for someone.

626
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:34,310
I can help you with that!

627
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:36,345
You said you know her name,
and you have a picture.

628
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:38,872
I can spend some money
and hire an investigator!

629
00:55:39,342 --> 00:55:40,407
Do you have that much money?

630
00:55:40,498 --> 00:55:43,147
Me? Of course!

631
00:55:43,463 --> 00:55:45,979
I've been head of cardiology
for many years!

632
00:55:46,446 --> 00:55:48,715
-Can you give me USD 500,000?
-Half a million USD?

633
00:55:50,984 --> 00:55:52,462
If money is the issue, we can negotiate.

634
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:54,964
-I can't pay you right now, but...
-I need it right now.

635
00:55:55,055 --> 00:55:57,090
Half a million USD is not a small amount!

636
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,128
If you can't give me that money right now,
stop bothering me!

637
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:03,964
Let's talk it out.

638
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:32,460
Jae-hee...

639
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,523
Don't run. Please don't run.

640
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,394
Jae-hee.

641
00:57:09,796 --> 00:57:10,755
Jae-hee!

642
00:57:16,703 --> 00:57:17,638
Jae-hee!

643
00:58:16,196 --> 00:58:17,431
Is Jae-hee really in North Korea?

644
00:58:17,522 --> 00:58:18,632
Then who did I see?

645
00:58:18,723 --> 00:58:21,377
It's easy. Just come work on my team.

646
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:23,070
I graduated from
Pyeongyang Medical School.

647
00:58:23,136 --> 00:58:24,304
Pyeongyang? North Korea?

648
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:26,315
Our team will operate
on the prime minster.

649
00:58:26,406 --> 00:58:27,407
And put a refugee in there?

650
00:58:27,474 --> 00:58:30,119
Like my gift?
Terminal lung cancer. A week tops?

651
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,278
Are you a god?

652
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:32,855
How can you save a patient like this?

653
00:58:32,946 --> 00:58:33,814
I want to save her.

654
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:35,315
I'd like to operate.

655
00:58:35,406 --> 00:58:38,528
If the patient dies during surgery,
it'd disgrace the cardiology department!

656
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:39,520
I don't need an apology.

657
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:40,630
Keep your promise.

658
00:58:40,721 --> 00:58:42,231
Who is she?

659
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:44,124
I need to tell her something.
