DOCTOR STRANGER

00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:31,019
EPISODE 11

3
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:04,031
I'd like to make Myung-woo
the best hospital in the world.

4
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:05,732
I'll make you pay for this!

5
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:14,550
I don't want to lose Soo-hyun.

6
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,787
I will have my revenge on you
at all costs!

7
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,112
Please give me another chance.

8
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:20,757
If you give me another chance,

9
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:24,204
I'll give everything I have to serve you.

10
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,204
Please give me another chance...

11
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:44,805
...to settle my unfinished business
at Myung-woo, Mr Chairman!

12
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,174
Please...

13
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,280
Please give me one more chance! Please!

14
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,429
I'll give you one more chance.

15
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,834
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

16
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,836
I'm doing this for Soo-hyun.

17
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:23,477
It turns out Park Hoon committed
a very serious crime.

18
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,374
He browsed through someone's
medical records without permission.

19
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,321
This will give you another chance
to compete against him.

20
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,411
RESTRICTED FILE
Employment Medical Records

21
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,984
I sang "Coming of Age Ceremony" again.

22
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:16,463
Drink up!

23
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:38,318
Hi.

24
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,833
Pretty! You're so pretty!

25
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,426
Your back must be hurting a lot!

26
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,095
Here. Let me help you.

27
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,442
HAN JAE-JOON

28
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:04,720
Hi, Jae-joon.

29
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,013
I heard everyone drank a lot.

30
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,748
Not really.

31
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,884
Did Dr Oh get home safely?

32
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,021
Yes.

33
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,228
I'll be in later today. Bye.

34
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:33,183
Oh, my God!

35
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:35,375
Get away from me!

36
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:39,947
Why are you touching me
with your dirty hands?

37
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,962
Make yourselves at home!

38
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,464
Be quiet! You're getting heavier!

39
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,737
-Just bring her in!
-Just come in!

40
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,005
Be careful!

41
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,242
Geez!

42
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,793
Do you think the Water Bottle
and Dr Oh...?

43
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,120
What the heck happened?

44
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,578
Oh, my God!

45
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,532
What is this?

46
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:15,209
Why are you all in your underwear?

47
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:16,836
Get out!

48
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,032
Geez, I have a burning sensation
in my stomach.

49
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,499
Why on Earth is everyone here?

50
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,079
Wasn't it you who wouldn't let us leave?
This girl...

51
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,106
-Me?
-Yes, you!

52
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:53,890
Why did you bring her here?

53
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,170
Where do you think you're going?

54
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,088
I'll make sure to kill you
if you leave early!

55
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,590
I'm Oh Soo-hyun!

56
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:10,531
Just get out!

57
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,066
Out! Hurry up!

58
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:14,277
You're done here!

59
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:17,104
Okay, let's go!

60
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,739
Where is this guy?

61
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,147
Let's go, Chi-gyu!

62
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,593
-Who are you?
-I was told to start moving today.

63
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,919
What are you talking about?

64
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:34,955
Dr Han!

65
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,563
What are you all doing here?

66
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,265
What are you doing here, Dr Han?

67
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,770
I signed the lease for this house.

68
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,138
You did?

69
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,473
I signed the lease, too!

70
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,111
I'm so sorry.

71
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,314
I clearly told her
that the house was leased,

72
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:01,748
but I think she made a mistake.

73
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,517
You could have notified us sooner.

74
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,795
It turns out I signed the lease after you.

75
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,530
So I'll move my stuff out soon.

76
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,831
Will you really be okay?

77
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,567
It didn't seem like
any good apartments were available

78
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:22,035
when I was looking around.

79
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,272
That place was perfect
because it's near the hospital.

80
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:26,540
But I have no other choice.

81
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,946
What about this?

82
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,926
You can stay with me
until you find a place.

83
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,962
-No. I don't want to be a burden.
-Not at all.

84
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,389
I also stayed at your mom's place
for a while.

85
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,502
Would you really be okay with that?

86
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,997
Of course.
I don't like being alone anyway.

87
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:51,665
Thank you.

88
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,334
I'll try to find a place
as soon as possible.

89
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,250
What are you doing?

90
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,987
-What do you mean?
-Why are you going to live with the quack?

91
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:15,454
Only until she finds a new place.

92
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,691
Don't get others involved.

93
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,829
Are you worried about Dr Oh?

94
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,997
What are you talking about?

95
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,638
Hey! That hurts!

96
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,907
-Does it hurt?
-Let go!

97
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,044
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

98
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,413
What did you do?

99
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,582
-You seriously don't know?
-What?

100
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:51,925
Dear Father...

101
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,064
Just one more drink!

102
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,971
The quack was so drunk,
so I carried her on my back.

103
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,306
You're the one who told me to go party.

104
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,574
Were you the only one there?

105
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,051
Okay, okay.

106
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,410
I'll tell someone else
to carry her next time. Okay?

107
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,320
Okay.

108
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,386
What's wrong with your face?
You used to smile a lot.

109
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:22,898
The situation we're in right now
isn't appropriate for smiles.

110
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,266
This girl... she's dead.

111
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,337
Hey, quack!

112
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,979
Can you stop calling me quack?

113
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,848
Okay, I'll say it quietly.

114
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,326
Why do you leave your hair
all over the place?

115
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,228
Why are you carrying around
someone's hair?

116
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,863
-Are you a pervert?
-What?

117
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,665
This is yours! Look!

118
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,658
-What are you talking about?
-What?

119
00:10:58,097 --> 00:11:00,627
If I took care of you, you could've been
nice enough to remove the evidence.

120
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,196
-Are you losing your hair already?
-Hey...

121
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,732
Just one more drink!

122
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,970
Things like that happen.

123
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:13,307
Pressing your scalp like this
will help to prevent baldness!

124
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,375
Do it in your spare time!

125
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,810
I always hated your permed hair!

126
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:19,388
You won't be able
to get married if you go bald.

127
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,466
Will you take care of me
if I can't get married?

128
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,808
I'm sorry for my harsh words.
I apologize on behalf of my mouth.

129
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,277
Truck keys.

130
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,416
The truck is safely parked in the lot.

131
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,518
Okay.

132
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,822
-I have a favor to ask.
-You want me to be quiet?

133
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,800
Okay?

134
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,175
Why would I shut my mouth
if it's made to talk?

135
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,165
May I have a few minutes of your time?

136
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,736
You surprised me!

137
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,981
Dr Oh!

138
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,341
Are you living with Dr Han?

139
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,710
I think so for now.

140
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,780
Two beauties under the same roof!
Can I come over?

141
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,356
I assume you found a place already.

142
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,604
I was going to tell you soon.

143
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:45,098
Why do you want to move out
all of a sudden?

144
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,467
I figured it would be okay.

145
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:57,077
Honestly, I was doing everything
I could to win your heart.

146
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:01,160
So I figured I must always be...

147
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,618
...where you could see me
and do what you wanted me to do.

148
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,990
But I've come to realize
that even if I don't do all that...

149
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,893
...your heart will always be with me.

150
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,095
What a sweet talker you are!

151
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,566
Then I'll assume I have your blessing.

152
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:23,570
-Thank you, Dad.
-I have one condition.

153
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,308
Get engaged to Dr Han.

154
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:33,046
What?

155
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,352
I heard you're sending Jae-joon
to the branch hospital.

156
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,421
How can I send away
such a good potential son-in-law?

157
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,072
Perhaps you're my soul mate?

158
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,609
Shall we match our heartbeats
to see if we're soul mates?

159
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,861
-What's wrong?
-Just stay still.

160
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,891
The best of three?

161
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,283
What are you talking about?

162
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:44,418
It's simple.

163
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,790
We'll have two more surgeries
to decide who gets to represent Myung-woo.

164
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,326
Are you kidding me?

165
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,595
We already agreed
that it'll be just one surgery.

166
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,973
-What else can there be?
-Things have changed.

167
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,432
I haven't changed.

168
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,836
I have no intention of puting patients
at stake for a lousy competition again.

169
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,185
If you don't want to compete,

170
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,721
you can take that money and let me perform
the Prime Minister's surgery.

171
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,125
This is quite tempting.

172
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:27,977
But no thanks.

173
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,901
I heard that it'll be expensive
to bring your girlfriend here.

174
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,980
I thought the reason you wanted to do the
surgery was because you needed the money.

175
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,873
I really don't get this.

176
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,042
Professor Moon does the same thing.

177
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,412
Do MDs get paid that much
to spend money left and right like this?

178
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,190
It's not because we have
a lot of money.

179
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,616
It's just that there's something
more important.

180
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,328
Are you talking about
the Prime Minister's surgery?

181
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,453
Sure.

182
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:57,891
Why is it so important to you?

183
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:00,160
Because Mr Chairman wants it.

184
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,095
That's it?

185
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,832
Everyone has a different values in life.

186
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,168
You live for that person in North Korea.

187
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,672
And I live to be the best
at this hospital.

188
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,144
This isn't chump change for me either.

189
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:21,215
However, I'm offering you this
because what I want to do...

190
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,252
...is more important than money.

191
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:30,666
So in other words,
you want to suck up to the Chairman

192
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,301
so that you can manage
the hospital one day?

193
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,828
What? Is that wrong?

194
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,464
Not at all.
My master is the same way.

195
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,502
Then, do we have a deal?

196
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,978
I'm sorry. But I can't agree to this.

197
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:52,846
Why not?

198
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:04,791
Was my reason not good enough for you?

199
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:09,530
It's not that your motivation
isn't good enough for me.

200
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:14,201
I agree that everyone
has a different reason to live.

201
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:19,840
But I also have my own reason
to open the Prime Minister's chest.

202
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,823
I'm sorry.

203
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,312
Dr Park.

204
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,593
It'll be better idea if you took my offer.

205
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,072
It feels like you're threatening me.

206
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,834
-I need more time with Jae-joon.
-There will be enough time.

207
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,437
Dr Han can't get married
until the Prime Minister's surgery.

208
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,074
I thought Dr Park was chosen for that?

209
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,479
-Dr Park won, didn't he?
-He did.

210
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,283
This is for your own good.

211
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,786
You should do as I say.

212
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:11,859
I never perceived you to be like this,
but there is something shady about you.

213
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,394
I'm asking you once again.

214
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:18,065
Please let me do
the Prime Minister's surgery.

215
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,069
No.

216
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,304
You'll regret it.

217
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,374
How scary! Goodbye.

218
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:30,611
Dr Park...

219
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,190
Call the police.

220
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:48,896
This is so beautiful!

221
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,932
MOON HYUNG-WOOK
HEAD OF CARDIOLOGY

222
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,701
We have one more, don't we?

223
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,809
MOON HYUNG-WOOK
HEAD OF MYUNG-WOO

224
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,714
Aren't you putting the cart
before the horse?

225
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:09,850
What do you mean?
Do you know how old I am?

226
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,786
This sounds great.

227
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,956
This is my fate! Destiny!

228
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,258
Don't you agree?

229
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,395
Excuse me, sir.

230
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,935
-Are you Dr Park Hoon?
-That's me.

231
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,147
I'm a police officer.

232
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,940
Will you please come with us?

233
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,944
There has been a report
that you leaked medical records.

234
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,051
It won't be long. I promise!

235
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,741
I didn't do it!

236
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,434
It wasn't me!

237
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:02,979
Him! Right there!

238
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,082
He's the one who ripped the envelope
and looked at the records!

239
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:08,709
I didn't do anything wrong!

240
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,881
Look! He's leaving!

241
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:16,626
Is this what you meant by regret?

242
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,719
-Are you regretting it now?
-Maybe.

243
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,255
But you'll never get what you want.

244
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,756
I think I'll get what I want.

245
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:27,361
Because there are more important things
to me than finding a girl.

246
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,482
Let go of me!

247
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:49,917
Mr Chairman!

248
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,921
Mr Chairman!
I really didn't do it!

249
00:20:54,012 --> 00:20:55,698
I swear!

250
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,759
I didn't look at anything!

251
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,603
Let go of me!

252
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:05,232
I won't go!

253
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:08,001
Please, Mr Chairman!

254
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:09,937
Let go! It wasn't me!

255
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,119
Are we going to jail like this?

256
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,322
Why aren't they handcuffing us?

257
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,501
-Is this your first time in a police car?
-Of course!

258
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:34,237
Why would a righteous citizen like me
ever ride a police car?

259
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:35,571
There's nothing to worry about.

260
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,497
It's not like we'll be arrested
right away.

261
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,699
How do you know?

262
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,003
It's nothing to brag about, but I have
some experience with the law.

263
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:46,082
Do you have a criminal record, too?

264
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:49,977
You only need to know three things
in a situation like this.

265
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,521
What three things?

266
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,413
"One, run. Two, no. Three, con!"

267
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:56,092
"One, run. Two, no. Three, con"?
What is that?

268
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,752
One, run. You try to run away first.

269
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:09,263
One, run is not in play here.

270
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:10,831
Then what's two, no?

271
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:12,833
We just keep saying no.

272
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,601
Deny everything at all costs.

273
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,647
No, I didn't do it.
I never did such a thing.

274
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,949
But he said you did it earlier.

275
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,608
No, I never said such a thing!

276
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:23,586
I don't recall at all!

277
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,546
Right? Did you hear me saying that?

278
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,049
They'll bring the ripped envelope
as evidence soon.

279
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:32,553
And the head of HR
who witnessed it is also coming.

280
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:37,157
What's our last resort, three, con?

281
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:50,246
I'm sorry, detective.

282
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:52,906
I'll confess.

283
00:22:55,242 --> 00:22:56,977
It's true that I did it.

284
00:22:57,644 --> 00:23:02,225
But I only did it because he told me to!

285
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:03,559
Hey!

286
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,819
I'm like his servant!

287
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:10,333
You can confirm this with others.
I call him my master!

288
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:11,892
Hey!

289
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:15,295
-Master!
-What's wrong with you?

290
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,498
I'm sorry, Master.
But you should have respected the law!

291
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:21,235
Hey!

292
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:25,548
Master is bad!

293
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,184
This is driving me crazy!

294
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,210
Hey!

295
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:49,105
There will be an artery stenosis surgery
in an hour. Get ready.

296
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:52,575
You knew that someone turned Dr Park in
to the police?

297
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:56,603
I convinced the Chairman
to report this to the police.

298
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,038
You did?

299
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,983
Dr Park did something he should not have.

300
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:03,777
Dr Park is desperate to find his lover.

301
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,946
It happened only because Dr Han
looks like his girlfriend.

302
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:09,683
-Was this really necessary?
-No private emotion can justify a crime!

303
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:13,253
Why did you do it?
Because you lost the competition?

304
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,491
I really don't understand.

305
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:19,826
The Jae-joon that I knew wasn't like this!

306
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,966
Then what about the Soo-hyun
I used to know?

307
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,067
Why did I call the police?

308
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:29,779
Yes, I'm angry that I lost.

309
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,705
But the real thing that I can't deal with
is the fact that...

310
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,975
...you're always thinking about him.

311
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,486
Are you being jealous?

312
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,154
You've turned me into such a petty person!

313
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,080
You're greatly mistaken.

314
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:42,749
He has no room for me in his heart.

315
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:45,261
To him, Jae-hee is the only person
in his life!

316
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:47,321
Does that make you angry?

317
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:51,592
-Because there is no room for you?
-Jae-joon...

318
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,178
Please come back, Soo-hyun.

319
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:13,847
Come back to my team.

320
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,584
I mean... come back to me.

321
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:23,034
I want to. I'm serious.

322
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,561
But you're preventing me.

323
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,264
You keep pushing me away.

324
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:46,747
Dr Han!

325
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:48,348
Do you have a minute?

326
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:49,583
Did something happen?

327
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,218
Come with me to the police station.

328
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:52,553
The police station? Why?

329
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,155
Dr Park was arrested.

330
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,358
You're the victim, Dr Han.

331
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:01,562
That's true...

332
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:04,898
Can you please come and help him?
So that he can be released?

333
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,785
Why do I have to hide?

334
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:27,588
That's right. This will be the end
for the Water Bottle!

335
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,323
I looked it up on the Internet.

336
00:26:29,414 --> 00:26:30,991
The sentence can be
up to three years in jail!

337
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,026
What are you talking about?

338
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:35,404
Did something happen to Hoon?

339
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:37,028
Hey, Tomboy.

340
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:41,802
Hoon is at the police station right now.

341
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,546
Hoon? Why?

342
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:46,783
Because he was being arrogant
about his skills!

343
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:49,076
This is great
because I don't want to see him again.

344
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:53,347
I really want him to spend
as much time as possible in jail!

345
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:55,649
Are you finished talking?

346
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:03,466
If you say something stupid
like that again,

347
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:05,859
I'll make sure to teach you a lesson!

348
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,800
Girls can be like that. Don't worry.

349
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:18,180
Hey...

350
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,874
...how can you do this to me?

351
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:22,910
When did I ever tell you to do it?

352
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:26,180
You did it even though I told you not to!

353
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,148
You little brat!

354
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,586
Dr Han! Great timing.

355
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:35,189
Tell me something.

356
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:38,592
Did I order anyone to look
at your medical records?

357
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,527
No, right?

358
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,230
You did order me, Master.

359
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:47,968
I am going crazy!
Do you want to die?

360
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:50,204
The medical records were hers.

361
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,406
Can we close the case
if she doesn't press charges?

362
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:56,009
We can't close the case until the person
who reported it tells us to.

363
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,144
Here he comes.

364
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:02,992
Hey, you!

365
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,251
Traitor!

366
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:17,130
Dr Han. Is this really
how you want to play?

367
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:21,577
This is the result of refusing my offer.

368
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:22,536
What offer?

369
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,748
About the Prime Minister's surgery.

370
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,916
What are you talking about?

371
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:30,444
We won!

372
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:32,355
You may have won the competition,

373
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,715
but now you're about
to lose your licenses.

374
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:41,248
How can you operate
on the Prime Minister without a license?

375
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,141
So... what do you want?

376
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,027
I'll recognize your victory
from the last one.

377
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,718
But I want this to be
the best of three surgeries.

378
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,200
Us, one. You, zero?

379
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:57,713
Okay, we can agree to that.

380
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:59,339
So please get me out of here.

381
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:03,043
I'll suffocate to death if I stay
at a place like this for a long time!

382
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:05,979
What about you, Dr Park?

383
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:10,417
I already said no.

384
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:15,889
You can decide the patients
for the second round if you accept.

385
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,827
This is my final offer.

386
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:23,304
Hey!

387
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:25,432
Tell him you accept!

388
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,646
Darn it...

389
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,517
Fine.

390
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:45,786
Let's do it!

391
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:03,470
Jae-joon, talk to me for a second.

392
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:07,140
Where is he going?

393
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,676
Hey! Stop right there!

394
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,918
You don't think this is cheating!

395
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:21,063
Cheating? How?

396
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,965
You're doing this to nullify the results!

397
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:24,458
I thought you'd thank me.

398
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:28,462
If we strictly follow the rules,
those two will end up in jail.

399
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,631
Then I don't even have to compete again.

400
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,514
But I gave them a chance
because we work at the same hospital.

401
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:34,968
Is that so unfair?

402
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:42,819
Get in. I'll take you to the hospital.

403
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,087
No, thanks.

404
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,245
I'll get a cab.

405
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,270
Can I ask you something?

406
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,494
What?

407
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,878
Why do you want me to operate
on Jang Seok-joo?

408
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,615
I'll tell you later.

409
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,927
For now, let's just do
as Cha Jin-soo tells us to.

410
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:26,720
He won't let us go either way.

411
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:29,135
Please trust me.

412
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:34,728
I want to protect you.

413
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:36,697
How?

414
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:40,901
I have a plan.

415
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:43,012
A plan?

416
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:47,641
Yeah. A plan
that will let us stay together.

417
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:54,181
A plan that will let us live happily
without being watched by anyone.

418
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,823
And in order for that plan to work,
you must operate on the Prime Minister.

419
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:08,291
Okay.

420
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,064
I'll do whatever you want.

421
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:13,433
Thanks.

422
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,080
In return, I have a favor to ask.

423
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,714
What is it?

424
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,174
Smile for me.

425
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:26,747
A bigger one, please.

426
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:36,657
A bigger one!

427
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:49,240
Hoon!

428
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,612
-You go in first.
-Okay.

429
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:03,259
Are you okay?
Why were you at the police station?

430
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,194
Everything is okay now.
So don't worry.

431
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:06,119
Are you sure?

432
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,259
What happened to your face?
You looked fine this morning.

433
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:14,661
Make-up is required by my new job.

434
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,030
Why are you hiding your face?

435
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:18,832
Let's see...

436
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,267
You look pretty.

437
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,145
Really?

438
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,347
You're old enough to be married now.

439
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:27,040
If I stand in front of a car like this,
they'll pay me 200 dollars!

440
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:28,684
I'm also wearing something fancy inside.

441
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:31,011
-Do you want to see?
-Later, okay?

442
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:32,145
Bye.

443
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,951
But it's so pretty...

444
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,125
What are you looking at,
you pervert?

445
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:38,011
You almost killed someone at a hospital!
Are you kidding me?

446
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:51,658
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay. Thanks.

447
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:59,032
Honey!

448
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,568
Hi, Jae-cheol!

449
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,337
How's your leg?

450
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:05,005
I said you didn't have to come.

451
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:06,582
How are you feeling?

452
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:08,275
I'm okay.

453
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:10,043
Why are you sweating so much?

454
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,114
I have an appointment with the doctor.

455
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:17,160
I missed you, my son.

456
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:19,353
The doctor says
that he's made great progress.

457
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:25,412
Honey?

458
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,629
-Honey!
-Mom!

459
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,066
Honey!

460
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:34,268
Let me examine her.

461
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,738
-I'm a doctor at this hospital.
-Sure.

462
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,293
I need some help here. Quickly!

463
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,373
-Prepare for pericardiocentesis. Hurry.
-Step aside!

464
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:13,574
She's my patient.

465
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:16,358
-Please move aside.
-Her heart can stop at any minute.

466
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,489
-You must perform pericardiocentesis.
-I said she's my patient.

467
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,248
There should be no distinction
between departments!

468
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:22,182
What's going on?

469
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:25,519
Bring her out quickly.

470
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,742
Please get out of the way!

471
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:34,337
What's wrong with those people?

472
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:35,705
Did they do something wrong?

473
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:36,859
Follow me.

474
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,804
You're the son of Park Cheol, right?

475
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,616
Do you know why your father

476
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,842
had to deal with a tough situation
20 years ago?

477
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:52,255
How could I not know?

478
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:53,180
That's right.

479
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:56,692
It's because he volunteered to be
a witness for a malpractice suit.

480
00:36:56,783 --> 00:37:03,023
What do you think would have happened
if the case went on?

481
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,104
I assume it would've turned
this place into a dump.

482
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:09,963
You're right.

483
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:13,810
Myung-woo would have never
recovered from the shock,

484
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,537
and probably would have remained
as a small local hospital.

485
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:20,249
But are you aware
that this hospital saved thousands

486
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,177
of people in the last two decades?

487
00:37:23,802 --> 00:37:26,889
What would have happened to those people
if Myung-woo didn't existed?

488
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,882
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

489
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:31,961
Doctors save patients, not hospitals.

490
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:33,987
Do doctors treat patients
with their bare hands?

491
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:39,936
From scalpels
to expensive MRI machines,

492
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:42,071
don't you know that doctors
can't treat patients

493
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:43,864
without the hospital's support?

494
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:46,375
And where did you get the money
to buy those things? From the sky?

495
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:50,103
No. You buy them with the money
paid by the patients who come here.

496
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:54,917
Do you think there are doctors
out there who think like that?

497
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:57,653
Patients want doctors who think like that.

498
00:37:57,744 --> 00:38:00,857
That's why my father
volunteered to be the witness.

499
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:04,718
And what happened to your father
who really wanted to be a witness?

500
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:10,123
Don't be arrogant because you're good.

501
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,926
There is something
that kids like you forget.

502
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,632
Old people like me did not spend
our years just hanging around.

503
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:30,820
Doctor!

504
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:32,646
What happened to my wife?

505
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:39,262
Other doctors are examining her.

506
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:42,990
Are you the family of Ms Lee Gyu-eun?

507
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:44,567
Is my mom okay?

508
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:47,236
Yes. I came to tell you
that she just woke up.

509
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,729
Please follow me.

510
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:02,785
The best of three?

511
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:06,480
He'll choose the one who wins twice.

512
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:09,449
Is that the reason
why you caused such a fuss?

513
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,351
Does it matter who gets the job?

514
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:14,288
I thought you were okay
as long as you got the money.

515
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:19,293
How can I trust Han Jae-joon
to move forward with the mission?

516
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:25,999
Then just pray for Park Hoon to win.

517
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:34,141
Good.

518
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:36,519
Things are getting more
and more interesting.

519
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,744
Don't you agree?

520
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:41,548
Do you want to make a bet with me?

521
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,717
For the second round?

522
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:47,020
Will it be Park Hoon or Han Jae-joon?

523
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:49,065
What do you think?

524
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,692
Me? Han Jae-joon, of course.

525
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:56,663
Every competition needs a final round.
That makes it the most interesting.

526
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:08,575
-Is she feeling better?
-Yes, doctor.

527
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:22,975
It's not something that's serious.
You don't need to worry.

528
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,825
Thank you.

529
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:40,742
Why are you looking at the chart
of an internal medicine patient?

530
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:42,910
I saw her in the E.R. today.

531
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:45,846
They put stents into all three
of her arteries.

532
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:49,703
-Do you see bleeding here?
-There's bleeding? Where?

533
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:52,286
Right here. Can't you see?

534
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:54,021
I can't really see.

535
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:55,322
Take a good look!

536
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,257
The bleeding is causing cardiac tamponade.

537
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:01,562
You should have come into my office

538
00:41:01,653 --> 00:41:04,006
as soon as you got here
instead of having a chat here!

539
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:05,399
I thought we broke up.

540
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,310
The mood back there was kind of...

541
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:09,069
Just be quiet and follow me.

542
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,347
We need a strategy to compete!

543
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:12,472
A strategy!

544
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:13,707
Okay, let's go.

545
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,721
Let's never forget that we
almost went to jail because of you.

546
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:29,690
But we're not in jail now.

547
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:33,794
Okay. Let's just enjoy this.

548
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:38,599
Those who work hard can never beat
those who enjoy the work.

549
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:43,379
We have the lead! We have an advantage.

550
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,339
All we need is another win.

551
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:57,951
Pay attention.

552
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:01,522
Should we ask
for "surgery in the dark" this time?

553
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:05,092
You do it so well, like some magician!

554
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,393
You close your eyes...

555
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:11,031
...then you just do it!

556
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:17,104
He's so quick!

557
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,942
The doctors in internal medicine
are not explaining things to you?

558
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:25,512
Yes. That's why I'm here.

559
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:28,348
Did they really do something wrong?

560
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,487
You see an artery here, right?

561
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:38,825
You've probably never seen this before.

562
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:45,741
This red thing right here
supplies the heart with nutrients.

563
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:49,036
But your wife's arteries narrowed,
so steel tubes were put in to expand it.

564
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:52,348
You mean stents?

565
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:55,576
Yes. Here, here, and here.
Three of them.

566
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:58,478
But now, the stents are causing bleeding.

567
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:01,870
And blood from that pressured the heart,
which caused your wife to collapse.

568
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:05,252
Doctor, then is this something
that can be...

569
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:09,323
...one of those malpractice situations?

570
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,595
I'm not sure yet.

571
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:19,099
The doctors in internal medicine told me
that the bleeding will stop naturally.

572
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:23,337
Do you agree, doctor?

573
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:26,240
I really hope so.

574
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:28,709
But if the bleeding increases,
things might get tricky.

575
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:32,546
Once the bleeding increases, there will be
a pool of blood in the pericardium.

576
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:34,781
That might pressure the heart
and shock it...

577
00:43:35,415 --> 00:43:37,251
...which will put the patient in danger.

578
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:39,486
In danger?

579
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:43,023
Yes. Something like the stopping
of the heart.

580
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:50,133
Just a minute!

581
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:58,539
What?

582
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:09,416
-Charge 200 joules!
-Yes!

583
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:12,586
One more!

584
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:33,841
What happened?

585
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:36,276
-Why are you here?
-Doctor...

586
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:38,454
She's okay now.

587
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:41,481
The bleeding momentarily increased,
which led to shock.

588
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:45,695
She isn't bleeding that much now,
so it'll heal naturally.

589
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,387
Don't worry!

590
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:08,985
Do you want me to operate on her?

591
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:10,711
I am begging you, doctor.

592
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,282
They won't let that happen.

593
00:45:21,255 --> 00:45:22,489
You'll do it, right?

594
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:32,799
Okay. Let me get
my master's permission first.

595
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,201
Your master?

596
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:35,836
Something like that.

597
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:46,513
I said you can't operate.

598
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:51,394
He only wants to do it
because the family wants it...

599
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:53,687
The bleeding will stop naturally.

600
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,497
That won't happen.

601
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:58,058
You're that brat who was hanging out
in emergency room, right?

602
00:45:58,149 --> 00:45:59,279
I'll operate.

603
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,140
-Otherwise, it might be very dangerous...
-Dangerous?

604
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:02,839
A surgery would be more
dangerous right now!

605
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:03,897
And if I operate anyway?

606
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,870
You know that sneaking a patient away from
another department is punishable, right?

607
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:11,414
Of course, I do.

608
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:13,173
It can be grounds for dismissal.

609
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,142
If you want another job, you can try it!

610
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:17,086
Of course not! We won't do it!

611
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:22,049
And you must remember that the patient
is internal medicine's responsibility.

612
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:26,520
So don't try to get involved in it. Okay?

613
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:32,492
Don't...

614
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:36,163
I must do it anyway.

615
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:38,232
You're out of your mind.

616
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:41,368
He said you'll be fired
if you sneak their patient out!

617
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:43,303
Why will I be fired
when I'll be saving a patient?

618
00:46:43,394 --> 00:46:46,949
If this gets sent up to the HR department,
that can be grounds for dismissal!

619
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,719
So you're just going to ignore
a patient at risk?

620
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,779
Turning away from many right things
and pretending to not know...

621
00:46:53,354 --> 00:46:54,657
...what you know, that's part of life.

622
00:46:54,748 --> 00:46:57,050
If a doctor does that, people die, Master.

623
00:46:58,185 --> 00:46:59,920
We'll die first!

624
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:04,801
It's just malpractice that can be fixed!
That's why I want to operate!

625
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:07,528
Why do you have to operate
on another department's patient?

626
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,338
Her family wants it!

627
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:11,398
Then get the department's permission!

628
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:12,833
But they won't allow it!

629
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:13,967
Then don't do it!

630
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:20,400
I don't want to talk with you anymore.
I'll get going.

631
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:24,978
That guy...

632
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,238
Darn it...

633
00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:55,843
It's quite hot here.

634
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:00,514
How did it go?
Did you get your master's permission?

635
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:04,305
No.

636
00:48:06,086 --> 00:48:08,722
Then does that mean
my mom can't get the surgery?

637
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:15,295
It's all my fault.

638
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:18,532
Mom is like that because of me.

639
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:23,913
Yes, this is 1295 Yangjae Road.
Apartment 03-1102.

640
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:26,206
My mom just collapsed! Please hurry up!

641
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:28,876
Mom, are you okay?

642
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:41,855
Are you okay, Mom?

643
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:47,461
Mom!

644
00:48:48,495 --> 00:48:52,366
I couldn't do anything
even though she was in so much pain.

645
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:58,172
Only if my legs were okay...

646
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:03,777
Don't beat yourself up.

647
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:05,746
Her life was saved
because you called quickly.

648
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,682
I'm a bad son.

649
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:10,350
The worst.

650
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:18,091
I'm an even worse son by that standard.

651
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:28,869
What do you mean?

652
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:32,873
Anyway, you should neither think
nor say things like that.

653
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:34,975
And your mom will make a full recovery.

654
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,978
How? She'll be in danger
if she doesn't get the surgery.

655
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:49,489
You want me to help your surgery?

656
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,134
That's right.

657
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:53,669
Right now, I only see
one spot that's bleeding.

658
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,096
But anything can happen
once I open the chest.

659
00:49:56,763 --> 00:49:57,965
It's malpractice.

660
00:49:58,465 --> 00:49:59,842
Something like that.

661
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:03,303
Can you do this
without the their permission?

662
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:06,406
We can't just ignore a patient at risk.

663
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:10,344
So?

664
00:50:10,911 --> 00:50:13,847
Okay. I'll help.

665
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:16,683
Thank you, Dr Han.

666
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:27,270
Hello, Dr Park.

667
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,196
How was the police station?

668
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:32,699
Where is Nurse Min?

669
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:40,016
Nurse Min, I need your help.

670
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:40,941
What?

671
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:45,012
Dr Park!

672
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:49,850
You know this will cause
a lot of trouble once they find out.

673
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:52,586
That's why I'm asking for your help.

674
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:57,090
Myung-woo is a good place to work.

675
00:50:57,925 --> 00:50:59,493
What if I get fired?

676
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:02,863
Can't you just say
that you were forced by me to help?

677
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:08,335
Nurse Min, you'll help, right? Please?

678
00:51:09,536 --> 00:51:11,805
I do owe you one from the last surgery.

679
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:13,707
Fine.

680
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:16,810
Thank you!

681
00:51:17,711 --> 00:51:19,880
Dr Park, what are you doing?

682
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:21,682
I'm sorry.

683
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:25,352
But please pick someone
other than Dr Yang...

684
00:51:26,153 --> 00:51:28,097
...to be your first surgical assistant.

685
00:51:28,188 --> 00:51:29,523
A different first assistant?

686
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:35,863
Why can't I see it?

687
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:38,398
Because you're a quack.

688
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:44,013
Aren't you going to give me
anything to show your gratitude?

689
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,916
What? Is there anything you feel like now?

690
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:49,543
I don't want anything, but there's
something I want to do with you.

691
00:51:49,634 --> 00:51:50,677
To do with me?

692
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:54,915
Stop it.

693
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:56,726
Why?

694
00:51:56,817 --> 00:51:58,452
Don't you dare fool around again.

695
00:51:59,052 --> 00:52:01,855
Who says I'm fooling around
in such a serious situation?

696
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:08,695
Let me borrow your hand.

697
00:52:10,597 --> 00:52:12,032
I need your help for a surgery.

698
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:15,007
-A surgery?
-Yes.

699
00:52:15,736 --> 00:52:16,703
What surgery?

700
00:52:17,777 --> 00:52:19,023
That patient.

701
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,809
Please save her, doctor.

702
00:52:48,629 --> 00:52:49,496
Let's go.

703
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:13,503
She's an internal medicine patient.
Do you have their permission?

704
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:14,595
No.

705
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:18,875
Are you out of your mind?

706
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:20,634
If you're scared, you can leave now.

707
00:53:20,725 --> 00:53:22,478
It's not about being scared.

708
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:24,805
It's a given to ask for permission!

709
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:28,308
Who needs the permission from jerks
who are ignoring their own patient?

710
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:29,300
Hey, Dr Park...

711
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:34,624
You definitely talk too much!

712
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:35,949
Are you going to do it or not?

713
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:40,287
Hurry.

714
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:44,057
Is she really going to be
in danger if we don't operate?

715
00:53:44,658 --> 00:53:45,559
I already told you.

716
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,661
Okay.

717
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:04,987
What happened to the patient here?

718
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,414
Someone took her to the operating room.

719
00:54:07,614 --> 00:54:09,349
What? Operating room?

720
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:18,192
Would you please state your name
and date of birth?

721
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:20,303
Lee Gyu-eun.

722
00:54:20,394 --> 00:54:22,863
November 15, 1969.

723
00:54:46,357 --> 00:54:47,671
You doing an off-pump
coronary artery bypass?

724
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:48,853
Yes.

725
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:51,725
The pump has to be off
if we want to minimize the bleeding.

726
00:54:52,526 --> 00:54:53,636
Okay.

727
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:54,795
Stay focused.

728
00:55:06,673 --> 00:55:09,051
Is there another
cardiology surgery this afternoon?

729
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:11,111
This is the last patient.

730
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:17,751
The Water Bottle and Dr Oh
are going into the room next to ours.

731
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:20,220
What?

732
00:55:22,556 --> 00:55:24,958
-Do the suction correctly.
-Yes, Chief.

733
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:27,665
We're almost finished.

734
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:30,129
Dr Eun.

735
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:32,799
-Check the vitals.
-Yes, Chief.

736
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:40,040
This guy is going to cause a disaster!

737
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:42,309
It's me.

738
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,279
Which room is Dr Park's surgery?

739
00:55:52,486 --> 00:55:53,787
Hey, Moon Hyung-wook!

740
00:55:57,991 --> 00:55:59,335
Moon Hyung-wook.

741
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:00,527
Do you want to die?

742
00:56:00,618 --> 00:56:02,305
I really had no idea!

743
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:03,897
I'm serious.

744
00:56:06,038 --> 00:56:08,730
OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEE AWARD PROPOSAL

745
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,075
This is Oh Joon-gyu.

746
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:18,412
What?

747
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:25,928
-Thanks anyway.
-For what?

748
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:27,788
This surgery might cause us
a lot of trouble.

749
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,890
Are you worried about me?

750
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,894
I'm just concerned
about our team in general.

751
00:56:34,966 --> 00:56:35,863
Our team?

752
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,101
It's not too late, right?

753
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,073
You must have lost your mind recently.

754
00:56:46,974 --> 00:56:49,877
-What do you think you're doing?
-What do you think I'm doing?

755
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:53,280
You little...

756
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:56,550
You can't operate if I do this, right?

757
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:10,330
You little punk.

758
00:57:10,664 --> 00:57:13,700
Why are you trying to operate
on my patient without permission?

759
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:17,313
What are you doing?
Move the patient to the ward!

760
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:19,907
-Yes, sir.
-Let me ask you a favor.

761
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:21,575
What favor?

762
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:24,511
If the patient experiences one more shock,
that'll be really dangerous, so...

763
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:30,660
I've seen hundreds more patients
than you've seen so far.

764
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:33,053
Be quiet and stop being arrogant!

765
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:36,532
Don't you think this is too much, Dr Cho?

766
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,701
Oh Soo-hyun, shut your mouth.

767
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,736
Those are quite harsh words, sir!

768
00:57:40,827 --> 00:57:42,696
Who do you think you're talking to?

769
00:57:42,787 --> 00:57:45,180
What are you doing in front
of the operating room?

770
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:47,768
Dr Han.

771
00:57:47,868 --> 00:57:50,404
Is this how you train your doctors?

772
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:56,410
Do you train your doctors
by beating them up?

773
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:58,688
-What?
-You should stop.

774
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,380
Let go of me!

775
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:03,517
-We didn't do anything yet.
-Go away.

776
00:58:25,804 --> 00:58:26,806
Are you okay?

777
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:32,145
What the hell is happening?

778
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:35,582
I found the patient.

779
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:40,153
For our second round.

780
00:58:42,631 --> 00:58:44,995
I found the patient for our second round.
