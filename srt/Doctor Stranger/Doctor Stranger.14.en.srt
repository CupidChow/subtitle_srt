1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:05,502
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,261
But he is your son, too!

3
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,398
I want to forget everything related
to you including both you and Hoon.

4
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,732
Honey...

5
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,927
Please don't call me ever again.

6
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,004
MOTHER: 001-1-949-2419-25

7
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,221
Hello?

8
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:29,756
Hello?

9
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,094
Hello?

10
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,932
Is this... Hoon?

11
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,207
Yes.

12
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,240
This is Hoon.

13
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,917
Oh, my goodness!

14
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,713
I can't believe this.

15
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,183
I didn't expect you would really call.

16
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,519
How is my mom doing?

17
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:05,259
Your mom went to get you
in Korea 20 years ago.

18
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:12,533
She was worried if her number changed,
you might not be able to reach her.

19
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,604
So she told me to never change
this number.

20
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,573
Thank God!

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,176
Why didn't you call sooner?

22
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,949
She told me...

23
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,119
...to tell you something...

24
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,788
...if you ever called.

25
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:42,629
She wants you to know that she's sorry,
and that it was all her fault.

26
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,604
It's my fault.

28
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,774
I didn't know...

29
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,812
...what you were going through.

30
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:03,317
But don't forget that...

31
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,955
...I love you more than anyone...

32
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,158
in this world.

33
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,995
I'm sorry, son.

34
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,403
I'll come get you.

35
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,642
Please take care of yourself until then.

36
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,212
I don't know your son,
but I'm very envious of him.

37
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,892
I'm sure you'll see him again.

38
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,885
So you must take care of yourself, too.

39
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,604
Mom...

40
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,782
I'm sorry, son.

41
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,993
Mom...

42
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,322
-Hello?
-It's me.

43
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:52,726
Did you see your mom?

44
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,667
What did you do to my mother?

45
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,769
Well...

46
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,106
What did you do to my mother?

47
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,944
We didn't do anything.

48
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,146
But just remember...

49
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,583
...that we're capable of doing anything.

50
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,863
Do you have time to do this right now?

51
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,723
Shouldn't you go see your mother?

52
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,460
Hello?

53
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:41,708
It'll be such a touching reunion
for you and your mom.

54
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:50,017
EPISODE 14

55
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,248
Park Hoon is heading there right now.

56
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,484
Okay.

57
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,995
We need to get her blood sample.

58
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,496
Let's go.

59
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,927
Please stay out here.

60
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,153
Would you please leave the door open?

61
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:01,555
Sure.

62
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,941
Nothing noteworthy is happening.

63
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,945
Yes.

64
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,757
Where is Ms Lee Mi-sook?

65
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,626
She just left.

66
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,473
Have you seen a female patient
holding a doll?

67
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,543
I think she was going outside.

68
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,254
She is not in her room.

69
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,746
She went to get her blood sample.

70
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,260
Excuse me.

71
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,061
The patient who just came
for the blood sample...

72
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,822
-The one with a doll?
-She just left.

73
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,625
-Where did she go? She isn't in her room.
-That's strange.

74
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,094
Her guardian was also asking
the same thing.

75
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,263
Her guardian?

76
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,773
We're searching for her
everywhere in the hospital.

77
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,068
Okay.

78
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,117
You can't go inside.

79
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,128
I'm here to see Dr Han Seung-hee.

80
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,321
She's in surgery right now.

81
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,859
What?

82
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,731
Did you say Lee Mi-sook disappeared?

83
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,066
I'm sorry, sir.

84
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:27,434
I don't want your apology!

85
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:31,305
Without her, we won't be able
to control Park Hoon!

86
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,410
Wasn't it Park Hoon who snuck her out?

87
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,978
I don't think that's the case.

88
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:38,912
Then what is it?

89
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:42,182
An insane woman just ran away
all by herself?

90
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,418
We're searching the premises.

91
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,485
Once we find her...

92
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,514
It's Park Hoon, Prime Minister.

93
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,192
What's going on?

94
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,162
Chang-yi, listen carefully.

95
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,301
She is Hoon's mother.

96
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,281
I'll tell you everything later.

97
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,707
Would you please let her
stay here for a while?

98
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,277
Does Hoon know?

99
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,879
She'll be in danger if Hoon knows.

100
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,857
I think you're more dangerous.

101
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,216
Chang-yi...

102
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:51,018
I know who you are.

103
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,954
I saw you making threats
to kill people with guns, too!

104
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:57,090
Those people are trying to use her.

105
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:01,261
Once they find out that she's gone,
the first person they'll go to is Hoon.

106
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,932
What would happen
if Hoon met her right now?

107
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,203
I am begging you.

108
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,706
This is both for Hoon and his mom.

109
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,742
You can't tell this to anyone.

110
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,583
I'm sorry to have you involved
in a matter like this.

111
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:29,790
But you know you're the only one
that Hoon can trust.

112
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:39,333
We searched everywhere outside.

113
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:43,170
We're continuing to look inside,
but I don't think she's here.

114
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,239
-Keep looking.
-Yes, sir.

115
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,564
Park Hoon's mother disappeared?

116
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,748
I am speechless.

117
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,446
I'm not sure if I can rely on you
at critical moments.

118
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,154
If you had us to take care of her,
this would not have happened.

119
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,228
Did you do this?

120
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,100
Why would we do such a thing?

121
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,442
Don't judge by yourself
whether my decision is right or wrong.

122
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,828
Park Hoon's mother disappeared.

123
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:43,940
Was it you?

124
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,375
I thought she was being watched
by Jang Seok-joo's people.

125
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,370
The only people who know she's here
are us and them.

126
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,374
Did you do it?

127
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,986
I was in surgery.

128
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,712
Do you think I had time to do it?

129
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,816
You have the motivation though
because she's Park Hoon's mother.

130
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,785
Why don't you go inside
and look for yourself?

131
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:08,616
Okay, I just hope that you're not
the one who did it.

132
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,557
But if you did it...

133
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,727
...both of you will die by my hands.

134
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,639
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

135
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,977
You shouldn't leave your post
during surgery.

136
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:31,621
I'm sorry.

137
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:34,490
I'll fill in for you the next time
you have an emergency.

138
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,550
Of course.
It's all about give-and-take.

139
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:41,755
PARK HOON

140
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,828
POWER OFF

141
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:50,364
You have reached the voice mailbox...

142
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,843
Where does the Prime Minister live?

143
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:05,779
I've been paid to take you.

144
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,129
Hoon...

145
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:27,853
Are you the one who sent the taxi?

146
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,538
Your mom is safe.

147
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,121
Did you know all along?

148
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,244
Did you know that my mom
was in Korea all along?

149
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,792
Yes.

150
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,093
Why didn't you tell me?

151
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,720
-I didn't know where she was.
-Do you think that makes sense?

152
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:50,439
Jang Seok-joo hid her whereabouts,
even from us.

153
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,626
He couldn't trust me.

154
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,232
You're all in the same boat.

155
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:01,511
You all even met up together.
What was there to not trust?

156
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,670
Jang Seok-joo doubted my identity
in the beginning.

157
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:05,448
What?

158
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,574
Once, he saw no scar on my stomach...

159
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,577
...he believed that I'm not Song Jae-hee.

160
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:15,682
I had several surgeries
before coming here.

161
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:19,635
Once, he believed
that I was here as an agent

162
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:22,389
who was trained to lure you.

163
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:25,467
He told me everything about the project.

164
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,071
Have you ever thought
that I would doubt your identity?

165
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,264
Never.

166
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:36,803
I thought you would recognize me...

167
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,207
...even if my face changed.

168
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,825
Your mom is in a safe place.

169
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,684
I know it's hard, but please be patient.

170
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,061
Stop talking nonsense!

171
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,547
Tell me where my mom is.

172
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:55,222
I can't.

173
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,934
Why? Why not?

174
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,626
I told you that I have a plan.

175
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:04,765
Once it goes as planned,
I can protect you and your mother.

176
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:10,680
So please trust me and wait
until that happens.

177
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:12,906
How can I trust you if there is no proof?

178
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,976
I don't know if you really have my mom.

179
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:19,012
I don't know what you're planning.
How can I trust you?

180
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,324
-Hoon...
-I can't trust you.

181
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:25,853
No... I'm not even sure
if you're Jae-hee or not.

182
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,028
I don't care about any of your plans.

183
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,832
I'm going to meet Jang Seok-joo right now.

184
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,503
Then I'll tell him that I'll go public
with this if he doesn't give my mom back.

185
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:44,304
Do you think he'll leave you alone then?

186
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,608
I don't care even if he kills me.

187
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,112
What will happen to your mom if you die?

188
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:59,086
She lost her mind after suffering
for 20 years in guilt.

189
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,462
That's why I must meet her.

190
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,432
I need to tell her that I'm sorry...

191
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:18,879
...and that it was my fault, too.

192
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:26,013
Please trust me this once.
I am begging you.

193
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:31,952
I want to protect you and your mom.

194
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,155
Just give me one month.

195
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:39,026
Everything will be over in a month.

196
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:41,984
Please.

197
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:44,788
I am begging you.

198
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,834
What you want to hear...

199
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,837
...is in here.

200
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:32,412
What is this?

201
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,249
This is Myung-woo.

202
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,718
This is Min Kook.

203
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,254
And Jae Il.

204
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,321
Among these...

205
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:47,094
...Min Kook was out
the moment I selected it.

206
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:53,942
Once you kick out Jae Il
with what's in that envelope...

207
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:57,571
...the only option left
would be Myung-woo.

208
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:05,646
If that happens, please bring back
Park Hoon to your hospital.

209
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,184
The competition must go on.

210
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,137
Yes, Mr Chairman.

211
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,340
You know some reporters, right?

212
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,075
Jae Il University Hospital,

213
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,154
which was chosen to perform
the Prime Minister's surgery,

214
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:43,392
has been accepting bribes
from medical equipment companies,

215
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,986
according to the Prosecutors' Office.

216
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:56,163
I am afraid that Min Kook Hospital
should be the one to operate on my heart.

217
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,767
Let's go with Myung-woo.

218
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:17,126
What a sly old man!

219
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,019
He should've chosen Myung-woo
from the beginning!

220
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,123
Did you find Lee Mi-sook?

221
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,659
Not yet, sir.

222
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,363
Do you think Cha Jin-soo did it?

223
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,066
I think it's Han Seung-hee who did it.

224
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,968
Why would she?

225
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:39,406
I think she's... Song Jae-hee.

226
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:40,874
What are you talking about?

227
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:43,821
I saw no scars on her stomach
with my own eyes!

228
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:47,781
Don't you think it makes more sense...

229
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,227
...to think that she snuck Lee Mi-sook out
to protect her

230
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,720
...since she's Park Hoon's mom?

231
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:03,697
Jae Il University Hospital
is automatically disqualified.

232
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,767
You can be useful sometimes.

233
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,769
I've been always like this, Mr Chairman.

234
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,674
What is our next step?

235
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:14,875
For what?

236
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:18,312
Shouldn't we resume the competition?

237
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,581
-With Park Hoon?
-Yes, sir.

238
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,338
I thought you were off today?

239
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,113
I am afraid I was too harsh last night.

240
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:57,384
-Are you going to Dr Park's place?
-Yes.

241
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:00,120
I don't want to throw it away.

242
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,733
So I will give him this leftover curry.

243
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:04,892
Curry...

244
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:08,538
Can you wait here for a minute?

245
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,796
Why?

246
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,033
He may love curry, but it might be
too much to have it at every meal.

247
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,257
Tell him you'll make him
more curry next time.

248
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:32,886
Did you minor in culinary art
or something at the university?

249
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,821
You can say that.

250
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,124
Thanks. I'll be sure to give these to him.

251
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,195
I'm here to listen to your apology.

252
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,590
-My apology?
-Yeah.

253
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,169
Apologize for what you said
to me last night.

254
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:26,302
-I meant it. Why should I apologize?
-Are you really going to be like this?

255
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,311
Hey, quack.

256
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,182
Do you really like me?

257
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,251
What?

258
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,487
Aren't you here to see me
using the apology as an excuse?

259
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:44,258
I am speechless.

260
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:49,806
If that's not the case, then leave.
I'm not in the mood to hang out with you.

261
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:51,798
-I don't want to hang out with you.
-Just go.

262
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,100
Don't get any weird ideas!

263
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:57,137
Dr Han is the one who pitied you enough
to pack you food.

264
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:59,973
I figured I'll get my apology
while dropping it off.

265
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,304
-Dr Han?
-Yes, Dr Han.

266
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:08,048
Why did she make all this food
and put me in an awkward spot?

267
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:12,419
Okay. I'm sorry.

268
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,356
I'm sorry.

269
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm also sorry for last night.

270
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,161
So leave now.

271
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:26,233
I was also impolite last night.

272
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:31,114
There shouldn't be any misunderstanding
between you and Jae-joon.

273
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,673
You also shouldn't come here anymore.

274
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:46,887
Take it back. I won't eat this.

275
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,121
Why?

276
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:50,424
Dr Han put in a lot of effort
making this.

277
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:52,860
I said I won't eat it.

278
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:14,915
Do you really like me?

279
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,218
Do you think I'm out of my mind?
Why would I like you?

280
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:24,992
That's so disgusting!

281
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:54,154
I told you to leave.

282
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:00,761
Hey.

283
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:02,663
What's up?

284
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:04,765
I am begging you.

285
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,901
What would happen
if Hoon meets her right now?

286
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:10,771
You can't tell this to anyone.

287
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:15,542
What is it?

288
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,345
You said you'll help with delivery!

289
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:21,715
-Did I?
-If not you, who else?

290
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,785
Just wait.

291
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,722
How's your mom doing?

292
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:31,058
What? What mom?

293
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:32,793
I heard she was discharged yesterday.

294
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:34,461
You should get her some good food.

295
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,464
Why are you worried about my mom?

296
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,466
What's wrong with you
this early in the morning?

297
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,504
Excuse me.

298
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:47,241
Is this office open today?

299
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:48,375
Of course.

300
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:51,512
-Are you ill?
-Yes, my chest...

301
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,681
Are you okay?

302
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:57,351
Bring him in.

303
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:08,295
You want a prescription
for angina pectoris?

304
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:12,041
I passed out once
when I stopped taking it.

305
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,734
That could've been very dangerous.

306
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:17,580
The blood clot from your coronary artery
went to clog your brain's blood vessels.

307
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,039
It's fortunate that it was a small one.

308
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,391
If it were a big one,
you would be bedridden right now.

309
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,845
Will you take a deep breath?

310
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:34,130
I went to a big hospital
for a prescription,

311
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,756
but they told me to have surgery.

312
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,425
I don't have money for that.

313
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,260
Which hospital?

314
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,596
Myung-woo University Hospital.

315
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,133
I could've seen you there.

316
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,203
Would you please lie down?

317
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:09,990
Sir, I do think you need surgery.

318
00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:14,328
I don't have the money for surgery.

319
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:17,306
This can be very dangerous if you don't.

320
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:20,400
Please just give me a prescription
for angina pectoris.

321
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,769
This isn't something that can be
taken care of with just medication.

322
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:29,543
Then at least take a prescription...

323
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:31,612
Hi.

324
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,351
Competition again?

325
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:39,912
I thought the other hospital was chosen?

326
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:41,330
Who do you think I am?

327
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:43,023
I'm Moon Hyung-wook!

328
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,392
Do you think I would just wait
and see during a crisis like this?

329
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:47,060
I took care of it.

330
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:48,829
Forget it.

331
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,169
I can't even use that.

332
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:06,313
I'm not interested in the money.
Dr Han can be Myung-woo's representative.

333
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,184
Dr Han can't accomplish
my father's dying wish.

334
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:11,718
Hey, Master... No.

335
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:14,621
You can tell your father
that I'm sorry, too.

336
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:15,689
Hoon!

337
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:19,202
Huh? That man...

338
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,127
Do you know him?

339
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,696
Of course, I do!

340
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,898
He's a patient of Dr Yang's.

341
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:27,744
He came in for a surgery, but didn't
have one because he has no money.

342
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:28,902
Start the truck, Chang-yi.

343
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:29,803
Where are we going?

344
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:31,705
Let's save him.

345
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,536
Let's go to Myung-woo Hospital.

346
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:52,108
I knew this guy would be back.

347
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,394
How could you discharge
a patient like that?

348
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:55,829
He couldn't stay
because he didn't have money.

349
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,698
Even though the patient is in danger?

350
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,339
Hey, Tomboy.

351
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,182
Why don't we go see a movie later?

352
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:18,318
Does a perverted punk like you
ever worry about life?

353
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:20,196
I do worry about life.

354
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:23,023
Life is quite difficult for me, too...

355
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:46,780
If he doesn't have the money,
he can't have surgery.

356
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:50,651
I'll pay for hospital bills.
Please start the admission process.

357
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,945
You said a month, right?

358
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:35,429
Was Myung-woo been definitely chosen
to operate on the Prime Minister?

359
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:36,711
That's right.

360
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:44,705
Dr Park Hoon is here, Mr Chairman.

361
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:46,707
Send him in.

362
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:09,630
Big news!

363
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:13,075
Stop making a fuss and go check
vital signs for rooms 3 and 9.

364
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,170
Listen! The Water Bottle is back.

365
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,306
-Really?
-Yes.

366
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,910
What are you talking about?

367
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,554
It's 1-0, not 1-1!

368
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:26,914
It's fine.

369
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:28,558
Let's start at 1-1.

370
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:29,759
Hey!

371
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,396
You said it'll be a loss
if we operate on the last patient.

372
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:35,731
Since it was a necessary surgery,
someone had to do it anyway.

373
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,066
Hey, you!

374
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:38,158
Let him finish.

375
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:40,427
Of course, sir.

376
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:43,931
So I'm willing to consider
that surgery as a loss.

377
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:50,904
In other words, there will be
only one surgery left.

378
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:55,175
I feel like I'm being pitied.
I don't like that.

379
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:59,713
Let's just say that it's my way
of paying respects to a good doctor.

380
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,749
So another final round?

381
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,053
But like the last time,
all expenses are on the hospital.

382
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,630
Male patient, age 45.

383
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:21,902
He came into the emergency room
two weeks ago.

384
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:24,213
The blood vessels in his brain
were clogged by blood clots.

385
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:26,139
I see signs of myocardial infarction.

386
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:29,109
As you can see, we need to work
on the coronary artery,

387
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,712
mitral valve, and left atrium.

388
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:33,890
Is he going to be the patient
for this round?

389
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:36,116
It's more than just a coincidence.

390
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,125
Female patient, age 53.

391
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:51,398
Similarly, she was admitted
because of her cerebral infraction.

392
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,912
She had a myocardial infarction
for a while,

393
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:58,572
causing an atrial fibrosis.

394
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,309
As you can see, we'll need
to remove her mitral valve.

395
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,487
Overall, she's in a bad shape.

396
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:05,712
What are you going to do?

397
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:09,783
I have a heart donor,
so I'm going for transplantation.

398
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:13,987
But for you, it might take a while
until you get a heart donor.

399
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:17,257
That's the reason why
I wanted to do this round.

400
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,639
You're going to attach
a ventricular assist device?

401
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,876
Do you know how much that costs?
It costs more than 100,000 dollars!

402
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:29,203
And he's the one who ran away
because he has no money!

403
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,104
That's why I wanted to do this round.

404
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:32,381
What?

405
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:36,443
VAD is mainly used to act as a heart
until a donor is available.

406
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,111
But it has been significantly improved.

407
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:40,814
The patient will be able to live
a normal life for a while

408
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,716
after applying for a donor.

409
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,986
And the cost will be covered
by the hospital.

410
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,321
End of discussion.

411
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:52,726
The surgery itself will also be simpler
and less dangerous than transplantation.

412
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:55,963
You can insist that we won
after the surgery, Master.

413
00:34:57,331 --> 00:35:00,901
It's been a while since I've heard
anything more pleasant coming from you!

414
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:08,509
He's going for a VAD?
It'll be quite expensive.

415
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:11,211
Park Hoon is being smart.

416
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:15,458
I think this round will end in a tie.

417
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:18,961
No, he won't be able to attach
a VAD to the patient.

418
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:21,922
I thought the hospital is paying
for the surgery?

419
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:23,824
The cost is not the problem.

420
00:35:25,926 --> 00:35:28,762
Does he suffer from coagulopathy?

421
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:30,230
Correct.

422
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:32,633
The patient can not get
neither transplantation nor VAD.

423
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,169
He'll die even if God performs
the surgery.

424
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:37,404
Then this round will end...

425
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:42,943
You need to remember something, Dr Han.

426
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:49,850
I only forgave you after the last surgery
for what you did to my daughter.

427
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:56,757
I haven't forgiven you
for going directly against my orders.

428
00:35:58,859 --> 00:35:59,793
Do you know?

429
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:03,372
Dr Moon helped me greatly

430
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:07,935
to get Myung-woo selected
for the Prime Minister's surgery.

431
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:11,805
Your position is not only upward.

432
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,975
You're very close to fall to the bottom.
Are you aware?

433
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,744
I am aware.

434
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:20,080
And you're still joking around
with Park Hoon?

435
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:23,750
How can you be smiling at that stranger,

436
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:25,552
who you should've kicked out
a long time ago?

437
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:27,821
I'm sorry, sir.

438
00:36:27,912 --> 00:36:33,293
Just remember that this competition isn't
something you do with your buddy for fun.

439
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,762
Everything you have
is on this competition!

440
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:39,299
I'll remember, Mr Chairman.

441
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,302
You must win at all costs.

442
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,272
That's the only way
for you to get Myung-woo.

443
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:49,209
If not, you'll lose everything...

444
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,146
...including Soo-hyun, who you love.

445
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,422
Professor Park Cheol did go
to North Korea 20 years ago.

446
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:05,125
Do you know why?

447
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,603
I heard he went to perform a surgery
on their political leader.

448
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:08,996
Their political leader?

449
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:13,867
Apparently, Professor Park was treated
very well after a successful surgery.

450
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:19,749
And he was so assuring
about testifying for us.

451
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,747
And also...

452
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,609
...he has a son.

453
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,223
-I know.
-You know?

454
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:35,322
It's not much, but as promised.

455
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,359
This is not the compensation I wanted.

456
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:43,463
I wanted you to get drunk...

457
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,692
...with me like we did at Harvard.

458
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:49,036
That'll be enough for me.

459
00:37:52,446 --> 00:37:53,581
Cheers.

460
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:07,354
Open the door, Professor!

461
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:10,357
-Please answer!
-Sung-hoon!

462
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:12,602
Mom! Are you okay?

463
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:15,838
What's wrong?

464
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,664
Wake up!

465
00:38:58,472 --> 00:39:01,375
Park Cheol... Park Hoon...

466
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:05,946
Are you the son of that Park Cheol?

467
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:17,457
Dr Park!

468
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,303
Hey, quack.

469
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:21,929
Come in. I have something to give you.

470
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,631
-I have nothing to get from you.
-Just come!

471
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:28,936
What is this?

472
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:30,838
It's your coat.

473
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,339
Mine?

474
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:39,847
Congratulations on coming back.

475
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,715
There is nothing to congratulate.

476
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:47,855
Hey, quack.

477
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:50,190
Why are you making that face?

478
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:52,025
What's wrong with my face?

479
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:53,927
Never mind.

480
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,346
Is this the coat that I threw away
in a trash can?

481
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:04,471
Is it?

482
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:05,639
Does it smell bad?

483
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,041
Why don't you smell it then?

484
00:40:08,132 --> 00:40:10,077
It doesn't smell!

485
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:12,212
I only smell my perfume.

486
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:16,183
Come on.

487
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:26,059
You look best in white coats.

488
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:38,805
Doctor...

489
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:41,742
Are you up?

490
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:45,913
What happened?

491
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,049
The surgery is tomorrow.
So just rest up for now.

492
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,418
I said I can't pay for it!

493
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:58,835
Please calm down. You don't need
to worry about the hospital bills.

494
00:40:58,926 --> 00:40:59,960
Excuse me?

495
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:07,034
The surgery is about
attaching this to your heart.

496
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,269
This costs over 100,000 dollars.

497
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:10,871
Once you have this,

498
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:13,540
you can live comfortably
until a heart donor becomes available.

499
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:16,376
Everything will be paid for
by the hospital.

500
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,679
So don't worry.

501
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:24,184
Thank you...

502
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,124
-Father.
-Are you okay?

503
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,361
Yes. I'm okay.

504
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:37,831
Don't worry about anything, honey.

505
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:48,909
I'm okay.

506
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:02,322
Did you want to see me?

507
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,093
You said you had a plan.

508
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,296
And that's why I can't see my mom.

509
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:13,700
Tell me what it is.

510
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:15,435
You said you would wait.

511
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:17,037
I can't.

512
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:21,141
I can't wait an hour longer,
let alone a month.

513
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,276
I can't tell you.

514
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,454
Tell me.

515
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:35,889
What's your plan?

516
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:37,090
I can't tell you.

517
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:38,125
What's the reason?

518
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,237
Why can't you tell me?

519
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:43,030
Because it'll put you in a danger!

520
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:45,265
Stop talking nonsense!

521
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:49,412
Hoon, all you need to do is trust me
and stay a good doctor.

522
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:51,738
-Then, I can save you and your mom...
-A good doctor?

523
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,974
Is that what you want?

524
00:42:58,111 --> 00:42:59,969
What are you doing?
You have surgery tomorrow!

525
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:01,691
Tell me.

526
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:03,719
Otherwise, I won't be able
to hold a scalpel ever again.

527
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,894
Don't do it.

528
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,019
Tell me!

529
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:11,825
Meeting the President is my plan.

530
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,628
Are you happy now?

531
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,371
How are you going to meet the President?

532
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:29,142
The Prime Minister's surgery team
is actually for the President.

533
00:43:29,877 --> 00:43:31,879
So once I'm on the surgery team,
I can meet him.

534
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:39,186
We're operating on the President?

535
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:41,931
Then, why are they saying
that it's for the Prime Minister?

536
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:43,991
The President's illness is top secret.

537
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,126
He wants to hide it, too.

538
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,737
Why would he hide his illness?

539
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:50,097
Who would listen to someone
who's about to die?

540
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:53,476
That will make even a President powerless.

541
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:54,968
Then, what is Jang Seok-joo doing?

542
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,038
Why does he want me to be on the team?

543
00:43:58,505 --> 00:44:00,207
Because he wants to kill the President!

544
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:04,278
Because he thinks that once he holds me
and your mom as hostages,

545
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,647
you'll do anything he orders you.

546
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:23,397
If the President dies,
the Prime Minister takes over.

547
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:26,099
That's what Jang Seok-joo wants.

548
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,935
Is that your plan?

549
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:30,847
Killing someone as Jang Seok-joo wishes?

550
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:34,383
He doesn't want to kill
the President right now.

551
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:36,076
He wants the President to stay in coma.

552
00:44:36,577 --> 00:44:40,614
That way, he can hold onto power
as long as he wishes.

553
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:47,521
I thought I'll get a chance to meet
the President by myself then.

554
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,985
If you promise to save us, I'll save you.

555
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,621
You stupid girl,
do you think it'll succeed?

556
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:22,956
If not, I'll die.

557
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:27,928
But at least there's hope
that we might live.

558
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:37,013
Why didn't you tell me earlier
about something so dangerous?

559
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:38,739
I figured you didn't have to know.

560
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,841
I'm the surgeon on the team!
How can I not know?

561
00:45:40,932 --> 00:45:42,442
Dr Han can do the surgery.

562
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:46,513
I'm going to ask Jang Seok-joo
to take you out and put Dr Han in.

563
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:49,183
If not, I won't do as he says.

564
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,295
There're many skilled anesthesiologists.

565
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:53,987
Why does it have to be you?

566
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:56,623
Because I love you!

567
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:03,030
Because if they threaten to kill you,
I must do as they say.

568
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:11,271
I didn't tell you because I thought
you didn't have to be involved anymore.

569
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:16,210
So please forget everything
I just told you.

570
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:21,348
And it's okay to lose the competition now.

571
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:27,354
You must stay on the path to be
the good doctor that you always wanted.

572
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:30,791
Please.

573
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:03,090
Is this a gift for me?

574
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:14,541
It's pretty.

575
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:21,675
Everyone is attracted to something
new and fresh.

576
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:23,911
Like that bag.

577
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:29,449
I think Dr Park is just like that bag.

578
00:47:31,317 --> 00:47:33,482
I think you just briefly tried him on,
like that shoulder bag.

579
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:37,257
I can't take anything more than that.

580
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:54,007
Everyone is attracted to something
new and fresh.

581
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,782
Like that bag.

582
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,380
You use it.

583
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:21,568
It won't take long.

584
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:35,082
Anything I should know?

585
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:37,946
Nothing, sir.

586
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:40,287
Let's take him to the operating room then.

587
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,025
I'm sorry about yesterday.

588
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,428
You haven't forgotten my request, right?

589
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:26,166
You don't need to worry about things
like competitions anymore.

590
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:29,636
You know what?

591
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:32,472
Now I want to win this competition.

592
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:38,278
I won't let you go
into any operating room alone.

593
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:41,121
-Hoon...
-Don't worry.

594
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:44,518
This competition is about saving
the patient anyway.

595
00:49:51,043 --> 00:49:55,312
Mr Chairman, it might be hard
to decide who wins.

596
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:59,776
They both are very capable
of these surgeries.

597
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:02,945
How about we decide the winner
by whoever finishes first?

598
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:04,805
Time isn't important in these surgeries.

599
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,317
We'll decide the winner
by whoever is successful.

600
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:10,592
What if they're both successful?

601
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:15,215
Well, I haven't thought about it.

602
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:16,850
I think you should.

603
00:50:34,902 --> 00:50:36,637
How about an assistant professorship
at the branch hospital?

604
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:42,943
He can't find out that the patient
suffers from coagulopathy.

605
00:50:43,034 --> 00:50:45,979
And you can't let him
have a successful surgery.

606
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,722
I hope you understand what I'm saying.

607
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:06,333
Have you finished the pre-surgery checks?

608
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:07,634
Yes.

609
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:10,070
Nothing notable.

610
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:12,372
Dr Han.

611
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:15,576
You should run the important ones again.
You never know.

612
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:18,612
Should I?

613
00:51:30,257 --> 00:51:31,792
I saw that you had a great father.

614
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,875
I'm talking about Professor Park Cheol.

615
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:41,001
I heard he went to North Korea
for a very important surgery.

616
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,204
How did you find out?

617
00:51:44,295 --> 00:51:45,205
How was it?

618
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,443
I assume life was comfortable up there
since he saved their leader.

619
00:51:51,712 --> 00:51:55,382
I guess that's how you graduated
from Pyeongyang Medical School.

620
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:58,519
You're being weirdly sarcastic.

621
00:51:59,086 --> 00:51:59,953
Is something wrong?

622
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:01,955
Nothing.

623
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,191
Good luck with your surgery.

624
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,171
Hey, quack.

625
00:52:17,905 --> 00:52:18,972
Good luck!

626
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:27,080
What's the matter with everyone today?

627
00:52:51,104 --> 00:52:52,673
What's going on?

628
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,396
I think there's a problem.

629
00:52:58,145 --> 00:52:59,522
Let me see.

630
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:01,224
Isn't that a problem?

631
00:53:01,315 --> 00:53:02,749
Isn't it coagulopathy?

632
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,651
Is Park Hoon going to cause an incident?

633
00:53:04,742 --> 00:53:06,143
That's what I am saying.

634
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:20,843
What happened?

635
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:22,145
The patient suffers from coagulopathy.

636
00:53:22,236 --> 00:53:25,715
I'm sorry.
It seems like I forgot to run that test.

637
00:53:25,806 --> 00:53:26,916
Dr Yang!

638
00:53:27,007 --> 00:53:28,451
I'm sorry, Dr Park.

639
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:30,711
-Platelet count?
-It's 50,000.

640
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:33,647
We can't do the surgery like this.

641
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,921
You should cancel.

642
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:43,332
Surgery is the only way for him to live.
You know that.

643
00:53:43,423 --> 00:53:47,637
We can use neither heparin nor wafarin
to a patient with coagulopathy.

644
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:49,071
That means he'll die.

645
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:51,723
His heart will stop anyway
if we don't do anything.

646
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:57,404
What is happening?

647
00:53:58,005 --> 00:54:00,183
Why is there a disorder all of a sudden?

648
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:02,876
Why is this not working?

649
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,980
Even the elevator is making
my life harder!

650
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:11,318
Room No 2 is a mess.

651
00:54:11,985 --> 00:54:13,053
What's the matter?

652
00:54:14,054 --> 00:54:15,923
Their patient suffers from coagulopathy.

653
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:18,692
Average platelet count
is around 300,000 to 400,000.

654
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:20,327
But their patient has 50,000.

655
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,573
That means they can't attach the VAD.

656
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:24,841
Then it's over.

657
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,134
Dr Han wins.

658
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:29,970
Stop talking nonsense.

659
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:32,639
Let's get ready.

660
00:54:50,724 --> 00:54:53,093
-Disconnect the patient and move him.
-Just wait.

661
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:54,962
There's no need to wait.

662
00:54:55,262 --> 00:54:56,797
I said just wait!

663
00:54:57,731 --> 00:54:59,566
Dr Park will make the decisions.

664
00:55:02,336 --> 00:55:03,337
Dr Park?

665
00:55:06,106 --> 00:55:09,309
If the patient doesn't want wafarin,
we must do a surgery that doesn't use it.

666
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,080
We'll perform the Saver procedure.

667
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:25,067
They're going with the Saver procedure.

668
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:26,169
What is that?

669
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,628
That is...

670
00:55:28,462 --> 00:55:30,063
Imagine this is a heart.

671
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:33,734
The surgeon will cut
the outside layer of the heart.

672
00:55:33,825 --> 00:55:39,816
Then, he'll take out
the dead tissues like this.

673
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:42,276
To discard,
discard it with your beautiful mouth.

674
00:55:43,043 --> 00:55:46,280
Then he'll stitch up
the outer layer again.

675
00:55:47,915 --> 00:55:50,413
-It sounds simple.
-Simple?

676
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,795
This surgery isn't practiced anymore.

677
00:55:52,886 --> 00:55:55,389
-Not practiced anymore?
-Yes.

678
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:01,061
The success rate is significantly low,
so no one dares to do it.

679
00:56:01,295 --> 00:56:06,042
Especially if the size of the dead tissue
is large like that patient's.

680
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:08,535
And the Water Bottle wants to do it?

681
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:13,040
Let's zoom in.

682
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:20,280
-The surgery has begun!
-Yes.

683
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:49,543
Let me talk to him!

684
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:51,678
Forget it.

685
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,092
Hey!

686
00:56:56,183 --> 00:56:58,519
Who do you think you are to dare
to attempt that procedure?

687
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:04,600
Even the Saver procedure
will need heparin.

688
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:06,569
We won't be able to stop
the bleeding once it starts.

689
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,529
All we have to do is to have
extra blood platelets

690
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,097
and be extremely careful.

691
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:12,966
The dead tissue is more than 40 percent.

692
00:57:13,057 --> 00:57:15,211
That's the upper limit
of the Saver procedure.

693
00:57:15,302 --> 00:57:16,203
Are you happy now?

694
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:20,707
The family won't allow it.

695
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:26,480
If we operate
without the family's consent...

696
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:29,416
...there's no way out of this.

697
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:36,123
His blood pressure is dropping!

698
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:39,988
Let's begin.

699
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:42,396
Please get ready.

700
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:45,299
Dr Park...

701
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:47,067
The patient will die
even if we abort right now.

702
00:57:47,158 --> 00:57:49,378
We need the family's consent!

703
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,205
No consent will be necessary
if the patient dies!

704
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,284
What are you doing?

705
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:23,470
Prepare for shock.

706
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:27,808
If you see any bleeding, let me know.

707
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:50,497
Let's start the Saver procedure.

708
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:52,933
Scalpel.
