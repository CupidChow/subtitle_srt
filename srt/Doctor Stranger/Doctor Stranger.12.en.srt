1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,236
Why are you trying to operate
on my patient without my permission?

3
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,741
What are you doing?
Move the patient to the ward!

4
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,818
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,544
Let me ask you a favor.

6
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,279
What favor?

7
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,447
If she gets one more shock,
that'll be really dangerous...

8
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,297
I've seen many hundred times more patients
than you've seen so far.

9
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,632
Who do you think you're talking to?

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,060
Don't you think this is too much, Dr Cho?

11
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:02,129
Oh Soo-hyun, shut your mouth.

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,964
Those are quite harsh words, sir!

13
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:06,242
Who do you think you're talking to?

14
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,376
What are you doing in front
of the operating room?

15
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,740
Dr Han, is this how you train
your doctors?

16
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,847
Do you train your doctors
by beating them up?

17
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,125
-What?
-You should stop.

18
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,283
Let go of me!

19
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,284
We didn't do anything yet.

20
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:28,300
-Let go of me, you little brat!
-That's enough.

21
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:46,907
Are you okay?

22
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,312
What the hell is happening?

23
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,949
I found the patient.

24
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,320
For our second round.

25
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:05,192
I found the patient for our second round.

26
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:28,882
EPISODE 12

27
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:39,826
Take a look.

28
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,231
You made this fuss because of her?

29
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:49,803
What do you think it is?

30
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,606
There's bleeding on
the right coronary artery near the stents.

31
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,043
Is that why you wanted to operate on her?

32
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,690
That kind of bleeding isn't that bad.
It might stop naturally,

33
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,950
unless she has a cardiac tamponade.
Don't worry about...

34
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,718
What if she did have a cardiac tamponade?

35
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,063
If a cardiac tamponade happened,

36
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,089
it means the bleeding
probably won't stop naturally.

37
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,459
I'm saying her bleeding isn't something
that can be stopped by medication.

38
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,804
The internal medicine department
will make that decision.

39
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,530
Why don't we make the decision this time?

40
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,902
I hope you remember that you told me
to pick the patient for round two.

41
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,473
So I want this patient
for our second round.

42
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,453
So do I win if I operate on her?

43
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,445
Of course.

44
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,481
You win if you operate
and save the patient.

45
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,183
Okay.

46
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,640
Dr Han?

47
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:42,990
Let's go.

48
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,570
This whole competition wasn't a bad idea.
Maybe we can do 100 rounds!

49
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,450
If Dr Han operates, you lose!

50
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,676
It doesn't matter
as long as the patient lives.

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,111
Dr Park!

52
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,648
Don't worry! Even if I lose this round,
the competition will still be tied.

53
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,950
I can just win the last round, right?

54
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,603
Bye.

55
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,395
Do you think you can do it?

56
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,806
I have no other choice.

57
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,500
The patient might die
if we don't do anything.

58
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,878
The internal medicine department
won't be happy.

59
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,537
I can ask the Chairman directly.

60
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,473
If I tell him that this is because of...

61
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,176
...complications from the first surgery,
he'll allow it.

62
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:38,979
But...

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,549
...what if there's a problem
with this patient?

64
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,652
-What problem?
-This could be a malpractice case.

65
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:51,391
What if the internal medicine
really screwed up her surgery?

66
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,041
-What year of residency is he?
-He's a third year resident, sir.

67
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,411
The stent procedure is very difficult,
and you let a third year perform it?

68
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:12,713
I'm sorry, Mr Chairman.

69
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,650
-Leave us.
-I'm sorry.

70
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,943
What should we do, Mr Chairman?

71
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,624
This might evolve into a malpractice suit

72
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:26,260
if her family finds out
that a resident performed it.

73
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,373
Tell him to not say anything to anyone
and send him to the branch hospital.

74
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,698
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,144
-The family doesn't know yet, right?
-No, sir.

76
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,236
How about the patient?

77
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:40,174
She's bleeding a bit,
but it'll stop naturally soon.

78
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,542
I hope so.

79
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,145
Otherwise, everything will be over
for all of us!

80
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:51,485
Hey, Jae-cheol!

81
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,696
What is this?

82
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,956
It's a hairpin. Let me help you with this.

83
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,130
-How do I look?
-It's really pretty!

84
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,808
Thank you.

85
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,801
You need to hurry and get better
so that I can, too.

86
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,336
Okay.

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,008
I want to forget everything
related to you.

88
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,377
-Both you and Hoon...
-Honey...

89
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:18,632
I'm sick and tired of it all!

90
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,886
Doctor!

91
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:36,038
Hi. How's your mom doing?

92
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,036
She's okay. Why didn't you operate on her?

93
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,605
Something unexpected came up.
But she'll have surgery soon.

94
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:45,806
Will you operate?

95
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:51,078
It could be me, or the chief
of the cardiology department.

96
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,656
-The chief?
-Yes.

97
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,781
His name is Han Jae-joon.

98
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,026
He's not the nicest guy,
but he is good at what he does.

99
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,785
I like you better.

100
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,526
It seems like you're close with your mom.

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,961
Of course. She's my mother.

102
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,964
Your mother...

103
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,617
This is Kim Tae-sool.

104
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,120
Prime Minister Jang is looking for you.

105
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,055
Tell him I'm out.

106
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,491
Where should I tell him you are?

107
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,093
Tell him that I'm delivering a doll.

108
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,762
He'll understand.

109
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:18,799
Is that you, Hoon?

110
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,741
So you don't have a mother?

111
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,410
I don't have a mom like yours.

112
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,979
What do you mean?

113
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,381
You don't want to know.

114
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,449
Your dad is here.

115
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,285
Dad!

116
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:24,707
You surprised me!

117
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,999
You made a smart move.

118
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,143
What do you mean?

119
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,504
I heard you gave Han Jae-joon
an awesome patient!

120
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,006
Patients are just patients.

121
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,741
Awesome isn't the right word
to describe them.

122
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,478
That patient might end up
in a malpractice suit.

123
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,316
The internal medicine department
really screwed up this time.

124
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:46,753
They let a third year resident
perform the stent procedure!

125
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:53,827
I'm sorry, Dr Han.

126
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,029
I can't tell you any more than this.

127
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,433
Tell me just one more thing, Dr Kim.

128
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,438
Did you operate on her?

129
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,715
A resident performing surgery without
consent is a classic malpractice case!

130
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,850
That's not what I want to hear.

131
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,962
-Why?
-What if Dr Han changes his mind?

132
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,222
Why are you worried about it?

133
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,292
If he doesn't do this,
we'll be the winner!

134
00:10:25,383 --> 00:10:29,196
I sometimes really have doubts
about you.

135
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,465
-About what?
-Are you really a doctor?

136
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,075
Am I a patient then?

137
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,434
Sometimes you act like one.

138
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,546
An especially serious one, too.

139
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,906
It's you who are a patient, not me!
Damn it!

140
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:42,075
So you chose a patient
for the second round?

141
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,324
Yes, sir.

142
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,756
Dr Park suggested, and I accepted.

143
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,482
Really?

144
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,018
Let's take a look.

145
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:07,100
The rules are simple. If I succeed, I win.

146
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,172
You can't operate on this patient.

147
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,685
If I don't, Dr Park will operate
on the Prime Minister.

148
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,058
You still can't do it.

149
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,881
Are you worried about a malpractice suit?

150
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:23,617
Have you known all along?

151
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,853
And you still want to operate on her?

152
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,387
If that's the problem, I can tell them

153
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,056
there was a small mistake
during the surgery.

154
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,525
Do you think the family
will be that naive?

155
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,361
-Let me explain it to them.
-Explain?

156
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,997
That's not what you need.
You might have to threaten them.

157
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,334
I never heard of someone giving up
a malpractice suit for an explanation.

158
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:44,137
But if we don't do anything,
the patient might die.

159
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,008
Many patients die from complications.

160
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,710
If I operate, we can save her.

161
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:54,481
We can't just let her die
because we're afraid of a lawsuit.

162
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,216
Internal medicine department
will heal her!

163
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:57,150
Mr Chairman!

164
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,817
Don't you know that there are some things
that are better left untouched?

165
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,172
Once people find out that we let
a third year resident perform surgery,

166
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:12,442
we'll have to give up
operating on the Prime Minister!

167
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:17,070
If we admit our wrongdoing and explain it
to the family, we can prevent the lawsuit.

168
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:18,172
Be quiet!

169
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,731
You kneeled down in front of me
and said you'll do whatever I said.

170
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,746
Have you already forgotten?

171
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,283
Why are you so interested in this patient?

172
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,389
I'm sorry, Mr Chairman.

173
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,393
-But as a doctor...
-As a doctor?

174
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,030
As a doctor, you think this is unethical?

175
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,075
Fine.

176
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,603
If you want it that badly,
she'll be the patient for round two.

177
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,610
Yes, Mr Chairman.

178
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:58,712
Excuse me?

179
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,914
Right now, in your room?

180
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:05,719
Yes, we'll be right there.

181
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,889
-Let's go.
-Why me?

182
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,258
The Chairman wants to see you!

183
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,493
I don't want to see him.

184
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,331
Stop complaining and follow me! Hurry up!

185
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,208
I called you here
to talk about the second round.

186
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,612
Yes, I believe these two
already decided on everything.

187
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:32,746
I'm aware!

188
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,015
Follow me.

189
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,735
I assume everyone knows
about this patient.

190
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:59,013
-Is it 0-1, right now?
-Yes, Mr Chairman.

191
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:04,444
Let's make this patient for round two
as you wish.

192
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,049
Instead, there will be a different way
to decide the winner.

193
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,652
The one who succeeds
in the surgery wins, right?

194
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:14,980
No, the one who doesn't operate
on her is the winner.

195
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:17,967
Excuse me?

196
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,794
The one who operates on her will lose.
Understand?

197
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,688
I believe you lost once already, Dr Han.

198
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:31,114
If you operate on this patient,
that's another loss for you.

199
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,496
That would end the competition.

200
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,710
You'll be done then, Dr Han. Understand?

201
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,113
You have until tomorrow to decide.

202
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:44,051
If you both decide not to operate,
I'll pick another patient later on.

203
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:53,660
Are you going to do it?

204
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,163
Let's choose a different patient.

205
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,798
You're going to wait it out?

206
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,600
Even though we know how ill she is?

207
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,404
Then I'll operate on her.
But can you lend me your quack?

208
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,407
I'm afraid it won't be an easy surgery.

209
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,096
Hey, doctor!

210
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:36,103
I'll do the surgery for your mom.
So just be patient.

211
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,638
Really?

212
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,175
I just need to put my team together again.

213
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,045
What is it this time?

214
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,383
Don't worry, okay?

215
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,784
Yes, doctor!

216
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,265
-Let go!
-Take it off.

217
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:04,498
What are you doing?

218
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,602
Leave the hospital now.
Take a day off tomorrow.

219
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:09,803
A day off?

220
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:13,340
Actually, stay home until I call you.
Just relax.

221
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,017
This won't do anything, master.

222
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,276
You can't!

223
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:21,181
The moment you operate on her
is when our relationship ends!

224
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,650
Then I have nothing to lose.

225
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:24,785
Don't you need money?

226
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,763
Don't you want your girlfriend here?

227
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,822
That's true though.

228
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,291
There'll be one more round
even if I lose this!

229
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,759
Over my dead body!

230
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,997
Go home! Now!

231
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:43,079
You'll only do Han Jae-joon a favor
if you operate on that patient!

232
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,272
I am sure the patient's family
will be happy.

233
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:48,159
We're in a bloody war!
We can't worry about the patient's family.

234
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,877
This is a hospital! We must care!

235
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,155
We can't worry about them
because this is a hospital.

236
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:56,492
If there's a malpractice suit,
that will be the end of this hospital!

237
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,718
Master!

238
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,954
Just be quiet and follow me.
I'm sending you home.

239
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,600
Who are these people?
Get out of my way!

240
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,569
Come with me.

241
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,728
Taxi!

242
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,533
You must stay at home
until I call you, okay?

243
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,700
Okay? You...

244
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,403
Who are you?

245
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,441
Where did he go? Damn it!

246
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,046
Jae-hee!

247
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,448
How does your schedule look today,
Dr Han?

248
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:29,983
Dr Park...

249
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,671
What? Did something happen?

250
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,328
He's so funny!

251
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,466
Hello, Park Hoon.

252
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,504
Dr Park, your classmate is hilarious!

253
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,241
-My classmate?
-Have you forgotten already?

254
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,487
At the health research center
for our dear leader!

255
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,581
We spent countless hours
in our academic struggle.

256
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,616
"Academic struggle," he says!

257
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:09,356
-Let's get out of here.
-Sure. Shall we rejoice our reunion?

258
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:15,362
Sorry, but what do North Korean
call miniskirts again?

259
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:17,931
"Shortened dress."

260
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:19,533
Shortened dress! Funny!

261
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,151
-Why did you show up at the hospital?
-Me?

262
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:41,130
Of course, I showed up to cheer you up.

263
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,724
I don't think it's a wise thing
to show your ugly face everywhere.

264
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,994
I wouldn't have showed up
if you were doing fine.

265
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,071
What are you talking about?

266
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:54,801
I heard whoever operates
on that woman will lose this round.

267
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,004
Even I lose this time,
I still have one more chance.

268
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,606
Yes, the competition will be tied.

269
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,545
That'll only make the final round
more interesting.

270
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,079
So...

271
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,483
I am not here to see interesting things.

272
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,319
I came here to achieve a mission.

273
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:14,188
A mission?

274
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,825
A mission that's worth 100 times more
than what you ruined two years ago.

275
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,791
Is it about earning cash
for the regime again?

276
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,064
How is that related
to the Prime Minister's surgery?

277
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,601
You'll eventually understand
when the time comes.

278
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:36,210
Just know that my government
is deeply interested in this mission.

279
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,788
Is that why they dragged
a failure like you into this mission?

280
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:44,017
That failure brought
Song Jae-hee all the way here.

281
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,787
The love of your life.

282
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,723
So the same operative
can take her away at any time.

283
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:53,861
Dead or alive.

284
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:57,030
You would've killed her already
if you were going to.

285
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,699
But I haven't.

286
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:06,240
I can even show you the generosity
of my regime if you want.

287
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,351
Your generosity?

288
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,611
I can set you two free.

289
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,947
Just the thought of it must be exciting.

290
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,084
Living with the love of your life...

291
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,457
...without worrying about anything.

292
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,126
There'll be no reason to hide
from anything.

293
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,597
And I won't appear in front of you
ever again.

294
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:36,603
I can even give you enough money
to live the rest of your life in comfort.

295
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:39,740
As long as the mission succeeds.

296
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,111
Remember this.

297
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:51,218
If the mission is accomplished,
you and Song Jae-hee can be happy.

298
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:18,712
Dr Han.

299
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:24,647
Can you see?

300
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:31,358
This hospital has overcome so many crises
to get to where it is today.

301
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:36,830
Some of those crises
were malpractice lawsuits.

302
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:43,470
But I never allowed any lawsuit
that would hurt this hospital.

303
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:48,675
And that's why I'm still the chairman.

304
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,714
And you're my choice to be
the heir of this hospital.

305
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:56,649
I'm sorry for giving you
all these troubles.

306
00:21:58,185 --> 00:21:59,453
The second round is coming up.

307
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:03,357
You can pick two patients
that you're confident with.

308
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,691
So you have nothing to worry about.

309
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:06,527
But you must remember that to be

310
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:10,397
the owner of this hospital, you must be
something more than just a doctor.

311
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:57,153
They say it'll be a simple surgery.
So you don't need to worry too much.

312
00:22:57,244 --> 00:23:00,356
But it's still a surgery.
How can we not worry?

313
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,783
You could've waited
until I was more grown up!

314
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:04,327
Why?

315
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:06,696
Have you forgotten already?

316
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,622
I told you that I'll become a doctor!

317
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:10,924
That's right!

318
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,537
It doesn't matter!

319
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:19,233
You can get better this time, then get
sick again once I become a doctor!

320
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,336
Do you want your dad to be sick?

321
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,805
Why does it matter?
I'll cure him no matter what!

322
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,140
Okay.

323
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,953
I'll make sure to be sick later,
so become a great doctor, Sung-hoon!

324
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:32,579
Promise me!

325
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,115
-Understand?
-Okay, Dad.

326
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,382
Never forget.

327
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:43,499
My father is Lee Do-sun,
and I'm Lee Sung-hoon.

328
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,992
Never forget our names.

329
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:48,161
Remember the person
who will take revenge on you!

330
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,019
If you operate on this patient,
that's another loss for you.

331
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,612
That will be enough to end
the competition.

332
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,681
You'll be finished then, Dr Han.

333
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,891
I must make this choice
in order to destroy the castle.

334
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:54,320
I'm sorry, ma'am.

335
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:08,108
Is my mom okay?

336
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:09,805
Your mom?

337
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,929
Are you asleep, Mom?

338
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:33,467
She's asleep every time I come here.

339
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:37,437
Do you want me to get
a nurse to wake her up?

340
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:39,106
No.

341
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:43,710
At home, she couldn't sleep well
because of pain.

342
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:52,719
What's your name?

343
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:55,322
My name is Jae-cheol.

344
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:57,257
Jae-cheol...

345
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,395
Is your name Han Jae-joon?

346
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:04,839
No.

347
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,076
Then what is it?

348
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:18,946
Do you know Dr Park Hoon?

349
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:20,623
I do.

350
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:22,850
He talked about you.

351
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:25,085
Dr Park talked about me?

352
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:29,957
He said Dr Han Jae-joon is a very
skilled doctor who is also very nice.

353
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:32,593
There is no way he said that.

354
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:36,330
He did say you're not the nicest guy.

355
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:38,932
But it's true that he said
you're a skilled doctor!

356
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,974
Dr Park said he'll operate
on Mom tomorrow.

357
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:52,346
But would you please operate on her
if Dr Park can't do it tomorrow?

358
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,818
If Dr Park promised you,
he will do the surgery.

359
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,420
I think so, too.

360
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:03,724
But he couldn't do it earlier today.

361
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:10,497
If Dr Park can't do it, please do
the surgery for my mom, doctor.

362
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:14,668
Hey, Jae-cheol.

363
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:18,472
You'll do it, right?

364
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,874
Okay, I'll consider it.

365
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,769
Dr Han isn't going to operate, is he?

366
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:50,737
I think so.

367
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,508
I'm just worried about Dr Park.

368
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,276
What's wrong with him?

369
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,745
He'll probably try to save the patient.

370
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:02,549
Has he asked for your help again
with the surgery?

371
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,184
No, not yet.

372
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,253
Will you help him if he asks?

373
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:07,855
I don't know.

374
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:11,024
Has he asked you to be
his first assistant yet?

375
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:13,536
You know he calls me a quack!

376
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:15,429
But I heard he asked you earlier today.

377
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:20,100
That's probably because he had
to do the surgery in secret.

378
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:26,773
Lend me your hand.

379
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:32,379
He's such a prankster.

380
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:36,859
He massaged my scalp and told me

381
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,287
I'm going bald because he found
my hair somewhere!

382
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,469
I've never met someone like him before.

383
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:55,500
Sometimes, he acts like an adult,
but sometimes, he's just a kid.

384
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,739
He's unpredictable.

385
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:02,342
It sounds like you like him.

386
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,087
Huh?

387
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:06,947
You can't stop smiling
when you talk about him.

388
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:08,448
Not at all!

389
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:13,485
Every time I think about his face,
I want to punch it!

390
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:14,621
Like this!

391
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,790
So, no.

392
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:32,942
Seoul's real estate prices
increased a small amount

393
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:37,337
since January, but it is now on the
decline as it fell by 0.03 percent in May.

394
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,744
How can this country be so calm
when our enemy is doing nuclear tests?

395
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,680
I'm afraid this one is a failure, sir.

396
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:48,882
A failure?

397
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:53,921
Then should I ask them to shoot some
cannonballs to get this country riled up?

398
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,701
Those two competitors at Myung-woo?

399
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:02,963
It'll either be decided today,
or we'll have to wait a bit longer.

400
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:08,311
If they have to do a competition,
I want them to fight until they drop.

401
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:10,204
That'll be good for business.

402
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,909
We must get prepared, too,
as our competitors are dueling.

403
00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:17,344
Yes, sir.

404
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,620
Many things have changed
in the last 20 years.

405
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,089
Our citizens have learned to maintain
their calm...

406
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:32,392
...even when North Korea
threatens us with nuclear tests.

407
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:36,463
It's probably just because
they don't show it.

408
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:42,044
Foreign war correspondents are still here,

409
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:45,272
and many of our foreign investors
are taking their money elsewhere.

410
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,242
We've already accrued
more financial damage

411
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,925
than what North Korea asked us to give.

412
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:55,916
It seems like you enjoy crises.

413
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:58,151
I'm sorry, sir.

414
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:01,255
It's just that I think
we should prepare for the worst.

415
00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:04,191
We just need to give them
a reason to meet with you.

416
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:16,103
These are the candidates
for my heart surgery.

417
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,974
The head of this hospital used to be
your main physician, right?

418
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:22,676
Yes, sir. He used to be.

419
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:26,346
Which one do you like the most?

420
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:28,015
Me?

421
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,517
It'll be your heart after all.

422
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:36,123
I like Min Kook Hospital the most.

423
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,768
I love you.

424
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,479
Just practicing!

425
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,605
Geez, isn't he nuts?

426
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:12,726
How may I help you?

427
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:14,637
I picked it up on the street.

428
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:15,729
When are you off?

429
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,266
We can do Japanese, Chinese,
Korean, North Korean...

430
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:25,439
You have a great body.

431
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:42,923
And you have great stupidity.

432
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,267
She's quite unique, as predicted.

433
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:01,708
Hey, hey!

434
00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:04,611
I guess you don't know who I am.

435
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:07,714
I'm the kind of guy
who does one-shot, one-kill...

436
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:15,756
We're in public!

437
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:18,058
VICTORY TAEKWONDO

438
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,671
I know you very well, you pervert!

439
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:39,112
This really hurts.
Mister, can you help me?

440
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:45,519
Hey.

441
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,242
-You surprised me!
-What are you doing here?

442
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:49,623
How's your mom doing?

443
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:51,291
She's fine.

444
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:52,960
What's that?

445
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,863
I made some breakfast for you.

446
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:00,300
I'm pretty hungry! What good timing!

447
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:10,777
Bye!

448
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,725
You're going to operate on the patient?

449
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:16,706
Yes.

450
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:19,495
Your hand is okay now, right?

451
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:21,355
Yes, it's okay now.

452
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:23,123
When are you going to do it?

453
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:25,325
As soon as we have a scrub nurse
and an anesthesiologist.

454
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,794
Are you going to ask
Nurse Min to be the scrub nurse?

455
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:29,162
Yes, why?

456
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,799
I think she has an afternoon shift today.

457
00:35:34,868 --> 00:35:36,770
I'll ask around.
Why don't we go with someone else?

458
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:41,575
-Okay, sure. Please ask around.
-Yes.

459
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:55,923
Dr Park is going to operate
on a patient from internal medicine?

460
00:35:56,014 --> 00:35:57,724
You must help him, Dr Yang.

461
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:00,482
I know that anyone who operates
on her will lose the second round.

462
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:02,696
Is that why?

463
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,499
You can think whatever you want.

464
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:11,071
Please help him to have a successful
surgery since he's doing it anyway.

465
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,199
Yes, sir.

466
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,280
Have some tea, honey.

467
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,254
Can you change your shift
to an afternoon one tomorrow?

468
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:35,495
Dr Han!

469
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,866
-Do you have surgery?
-I have one later.

470
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:40,067
When will that be over?

471
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,102
It's a simple one,
so it shouldn't take too long.

472
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,106
Call me when you're done.
We're doing an off-pump CABG.

473
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,942
Are you going to operate on the patient?

474
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:51,239
-Of course.
-But...

475
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,081
I'll still have a chance to win
even after this.

476
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,486
-Is he aware of it too?
-Cha Jin-soo?

477
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:02,089
It doesn't matter.

478
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:12,599
You can't do this.

479
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:16,270
I understand where you're coming from,
but I can't just watch and do nothing.

480
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,739
You promised me that you'll do
whatever I tell you.

481
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:21,642
Let's just do whatever he tells us to do.

482
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,511
I made a promise with the family
that I'll operate.

483
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:25,987
Hoon...

484
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:28,916
I can't disappoint them.

485
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,451
Hey, Park Hoon.

486
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:34,855
Then how about me?

487
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:38,759
I believe I told you
there shouldn't be a final round.

488
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,161
If she dies, this might become
a malpractice suit.

489
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:44,531
Then the hospital will be disqualified
from doing the Prime Minister's surgery.

490
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,476
Would that be okay?

491
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,135
That's not something
you should worry about.

492
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:50,037
I am begging you.

493
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:53,207
I'll do whatever it takes
to win the third round.

494
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:56,677
So please let me operate on the patient.

495
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:09,599
What are you doing?

496
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,193
Repeat after me. "I'll do whatever
Cha Jin-soo tells me to do."

497
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:20,501
-Don't do it.
-That's not what I want to hear.

498
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:22,603
Say it.

499
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:38,986
I... will do whatever
Cha Jin-soo tells me to do.

500
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:45,792
One more time.

501
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:49,830
I'll do whatever Cha Jin-soo
tells me to do.

502
00:38:55,602 --> 00:38:56,999
That's right.

503
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,907
You'll do whatever I tell you to do.

504
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:15,956
Are you okay?

505
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:17,891
I'm sorry.

506
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:20,060
It's all my fault.

507
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,167
Doctor!

508
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:02,102
Mom!

509
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:26,550
Doctor!

510
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:30,026
What happened, doctor?

511
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:32,842
We're still trying to figure out
the exact reason.

512
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:37,638
It could genetic or perhaps
an allergic reaction to a medication.

513
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,043
Could it be that there was a mistake
during the surgery, doctor?

514
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,680
We perform the stent procedure
more than 1,000 times every year.

515
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:49,659
Our failure rate is less than one percent,

516
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,229
and those patients usually show
different symptoms than your wife.

517
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,232
I don't know what you heard,

518
00:40:56,323 --> 00:41:01,995
but this kind of doubt
isn't good for you both.

519
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,932
I'm sorry, doctor.

520
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,902
-What is going on?
-That's none of your business.

521
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:13,774
Her heart keeps stopping
because of the cardiac tamponade.

522
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:15,375
We'll take care of her. Get lost!

523
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:31,501
Doctor!

524
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:32,860
Don't worry. I...

525
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:46,340
You'll do the surgery for my mom, right?

526
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:50,344
Doctor?

527
00:41:57,818 --> 00:41:59,019
What's wrong, doctor?

528
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:08,362
Doctor!

529
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:09,796
Doctor!

530
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:15,402
Doctor!

531
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:22,743
-Are you okay?
-Doctor...

532
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,328
Doctor!

533
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:43,657
Doctor!

534
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:55,685
When is Dr Park doing the surgery?

535
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:57,778
It was actually cancelled.

536
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:00,948
-Why?
-I don't know.

537
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:07,354
Do you think the patient will be okay?

538
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:09,857
Why are you asking?

539
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:12,192
Her heart just stopped
because of the cardiac tamponade.

540
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,342
Doctor!

541
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:30,920
Jae-cheol...

542
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,479
Dr Park won't do it.

543
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:36,083
Please do the surgery for my mom.

544
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,287
You said you'll do it
if Dr Park can't do it!

545
00:43:50,163 --> 00:43:51,098
Doctor!

546
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:55,611
Please save my mom, doctor!

547
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:56,803
Please save my mom, doctor!

548
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:00,841
Bring my dad back!

549
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:05,913
Bring my dad back!

550
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:10,638
Please save my mom, doctor!

551
00:44:12,252 --> 00:44:13,954
Please save my mom, doctor!

552
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:19,193
Please save my mom, doctor!

553
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,240
You said you would do it!

554
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:11,092
-I can't do it.
-Why not?

555
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,062
I can't do it.

556
00:45:14,457 --> 00:45:16,483
-I can't.
-You can do it.

557
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:19,987
-You still have a chance after this!
-I said I can't do it.

558
00:45:20,078 --> 00:45:21,642
You promised the kid
that you would do it!

559
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:23,497
Then why aren't you doing it?

560
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:26,293
You're a doctor.

561
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:29,129
You must keep your promise with patients.

562
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,168
For a split second, I just pretended
to be a doctor for a split second.

563
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,404
I'm not a doctor.

564
00:45:37,495 --> 00:45:38,372
Stop talking nonsense.

565
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:41,341
The patient might die.

566
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:44,611
-Do you want to win that badly?
-I have no choice.

567
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,282
That's why I'm not a doctor.

568
00:45:48,753 --> 00:45:50,017
You bastard!

569
00:45:57,357 --> 00:46:00,561
I thought you were a doctor.

570
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:02,729
I thought you're different from me.

571
00:46:09,736 --> 00:46:11,271
Assemble the team.

572
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,932
Are you saying you're going to operate
on an internal medicine patient?

573
00:46:30,023 --> 00:46:34,303
As all of you are aware,
the Chairman opposes this surgery.

574
00:46:34,394 --> 00:46:35,262
That's what I mean.

575
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,508
If someone wants out, speak now.

576
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:41,802
I'm not even sure what'll happen
to me after the surgery.

577
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:48,809
I still haven't finished my residency,
so let me go this time.

578
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:53,380
I want to ask one thing.

579
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,151
Will you be responsible for us
if we all get fired after this?

580
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:06,960
I'll do my best.

581
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:17,471
Fine, I'm in.

582
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:28,215
I'll do it, too, Chief.

583
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:30,350
Me too.

584
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:34,454
Fine, all we have to do is finish
before the Chairman finds out.

585
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,323
Is that even possible?

586
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:38,701
Let's get ready then.

587
00:47:55,676 --> 00:47:56,610
Doctor!

588
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:00,314
You're going to do the surgery, right?

589
00:48:03,784 --> 00:48:06,253
I never doubted you.

590
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:24,338
Is Dr Han operating on your wife?

591
00:48:25,093 --> 00:48:26,006
Yes.

592
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:52,147
Hooray!

593
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,102
It's over!

594
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:57,271
What do you mean?

595
00:48:57,362 --> 00:49:00,140
Han Jae-joon is going to operate
on that internal medicine patient!

596
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,110
We won! 2-0!

597
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:20,761
This will be my last surgery here.

598
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:23,197
Are you going to be okay?

599
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:25,866
My father won't let this slide.

600
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:35,642
There are many things I can't tell you,
but there is one sure thing.

601
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,172
My feelings for you.

602
00:49:42,234 --> 00:49:43,573
Those are real.

603
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:30,363
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

604
00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:34,668
Are you here for my mom?

605
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:40,340
Please take good care of my mom, doctor.

606
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:43,946
I'm sorry.

607
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,259
I'm still on your team, right?

608
00:51:00,316 --> 00:51:01,392
Yeah.

609
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:12,048
-What do you mean?
-Yes, Mr Chairman.

610
00:51:12,784 --> 00:51:18,245
How can you rely on someone like Dr Han
if he can't understand you?

611
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:20,347
That little...

612
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:48,697
Dr Oh...

613
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:58,085
That's okay. This is your place, Dr Keum.

614
00:52:05,058 --> 00:52:05,993
Is everyone ready?

615
00:52:11,164 --> 00:52:11,999
Scalpel.

616
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:41,604
Mr Chairman.

617
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:42,963
I'm aware. So be quiet!

618
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:48,635
I didn't do it!

619
00:53:28,242 --> 00:53:30,420
Chief, the Chairman is here.

620
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:32,379
Focus on the surgery.

621
00:53:32,913 --> 00:53:34,669
-But, Chief...
-Hurry up!

622
00:53:41,355 --> 00:53:42,497
Put Dr Han on the phone!

623
00:53:47,361 --> 00:53:48,896
Stop it right now!

624
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:02,852
Once the surgery is over, I'll tell
the family the truth and apologize.

625
00:54:02,943 --> 00:54:04,011
Be quiet!

626
00:54:04,102 --> 00:54:06,079
Dr Han, get out of there right now!

627
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:08,051
He shouldn't.

628
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:12,519
I'll forgive everything if you leave now.
Now!

629
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,055
I'll get out once the surgery is over.

630
00:54:15,155 --> 00:54:17,491
Once the surgery is over? Okay.

631
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,593
Everyone in there, listen carefully.

632
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,571
Get out of there right now.

633
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:24,698
Otherwise, I'll make you spend the rest
of your career in the middle of nowhere!

634
00:54:28,802 --> 00:54:31,781
-What are you scared of, Mr Chairman?
-You be quiet!

635
00:54:31,872 --> 00:54:36,486
If we tell the truth and apologize,
a lawsuit will not happen.

636
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:38,888
Such fantasy has never happened
in real life before.

637
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,915
That's because
we have never apologized sincerely.

638
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,762
We're so focused on our money
and prestige,

639
00:54:45,853 --> 00:54:49,832
we have ignored the people
who lost their parents and kids.

640
00:54:49,923 --> 00:54:51,334
I said be quiet!

641
00:54:51,425 --> 00:54:55,562
I'll show you that you're wrong.

642
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:00,934
Dr Han!

643
00:55:15,182 --> 00:55:16,416
Stay focused. Let's continue.

644
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:19,052
Keep going, Dr Keum.

645
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,488
Stay focused!

646
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,344
Section.

647
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:38,405
Chief...

648
00:55:38,496 --> 00:55:39,749
Let's stop the bleeding first.

649
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,774
Suction.

650
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,422
Please take care of her, doctor.

651
00:56:03,297 --> 00:56:06,375
If this ends in a table death,
call for a disciplinary committee meeting.

652
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:08,035
What would be the meeting about?

653
00:56:08,126 --> 00:56:11,114
He snuck out a patient from another
department without permission!

654
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:14,575
Then should it be about
his disobeying your orders?

655
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:17,144
And have the legal department
prepare for a lawsuit.

656
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:20,245
-A lawsuit?
-That's right.

657
00:56:20,775 --> 00:56:22,883
Have them tell the truth as he wishes.

658
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:27,964
The truth will be that Han Jae-joon
killed the patient during surgery!

659
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,958
All the blame goes to him! Understand?

660
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:32,092
Yes, Mr Chairman.

661
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:40,634
You should look before you step.

662
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:46,073
-Where are you going?
-You don't want to know.

663
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:55,349
-We need more blood.
-More blood please!

664
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,027
Suction!

665
00:56:58,118 --> 00:57:00,654
-How are the vitals?
-They're falling.

666
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:05,526
-Have you found it?
-I can't see, Chief.

667
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:06,955
Calm down.

668
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:09,429
-But Chief...
-I said calm down!

669
00:57:13,066 --> 00:57:14,067
Keum Bong-hyun...

670
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:54,875
Please let me in.

671
00:58:14,394 --> 00:58:16,839
Why does everyone look like
you did something wrong?

672
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,032
You haven't done anything wrong.
So chin up.

673
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:23,670
The people who should be ashamed
are all up there.

674
00:58:23,761 --> 00:58:24,605
Look.

675
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:45,259
You should be proud.

676
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:49,730
You're the only real doctors
in this hospital.
