1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,631
The tension in the Korean peninsula
initiated by North Korea's withdrawal

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,967
from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
has increased by North Korean Chairman

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,836
Kim Il-sung's disappearance.

5
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,070
EPISODE 1

6
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,539
Where did I put it?

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,575
I found it!

8
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:46,079
Where should we go, my smiley friend?

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,309
"Legal complaint."

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,768
"Plaintiff, Park Cheol."

11
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,966
"Named defendant, Myung-woo Hospital?"

12
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:03,823
What's a lawsuit, Dad?

13
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,905
I'm going to school, Dad.

14
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:18,861
I'm going to school, Dad.

15
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,492
Is this the residence
of Professor Park Cheol?

16
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,971
That's my father.

17
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:35,929
Is he inside?

18
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:38,293
Dad.

19
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,806
Are you Professor Park Cheol?

20
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,882
My name is Jang Seok-joo.

21
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,741
I'm from
the National Assembly Defense Committee.

22
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,901
I never doubted Myung-Woo Hospital's
capabilities,

23
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,340
but I didn't expect it to hire
a congressman to stop medical lawsuits.

24
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,064
Today's trial won't take place.

25
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:15,769
Yes?

26
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,471
Hello, Mr Choi.

27
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,816
I'll be in court on time.

28
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,419
The trial has been adjourned?

29
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,791
I asked Minister of Justice to postpone it
because of a national security crisis.

30
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,495
It's just a medical malpractice lawsuit.

31
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,530
How is it related to national security?

32
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:39,165
The government is expecting war
on the Korean peninsula in a few days.

33
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,904
It's a tank!

34
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,142
You look so handsome, Mister!

35
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:02,883
Look at those wheels!

36
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,152
Look! Helicopters!

37
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,532
A war will begin with the Americans
bombing North Korea.

38
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,813
U.S. Naval warships including nuclear
aircraft carrier USS George Washington,

39
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,925
and nuclear submarines are waiting
to start bombing North Korea.

40
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,011
Why would the U.S. bomb North Korea?

41
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,596
To be more accurate, they're bombing
the Yeongbyeon Nuclear Power Plant.

42
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,681
The U.S. plans to destroy it

43
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:37,627
to stop North Korea
from developing nuclear arsenal.

44
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:42,398
But once the bombing starts,
North Korea will retaliate in full force.

45
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,514
And once they do, a full-scale war
will break out between the two Koreas.

46
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,845
What's the reason?

47
00:03:55,936 --> 00:04:00,081
I'm just a cardiac surgeon
who only knows how to fix hearts.

48
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,952
Why are you telling me all of this?

49
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:07,466
You're the only one who can stop the war,
Professor Park.

50
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,967
I'm home from school!

51
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:47,988
Dad!

52
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,092
I look forward to hearing from you.

53
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,614
You didn't go to the hospital?

54
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,016
Can you have lunch before you go? Please?

55
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,953
I'll be home late today,
just eat the food that's in the fridge.

56
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,411
Look!

57
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:23,557
Please form a line, ma'am! Order, order!

58
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,297
Hey, help me keep them in order!

59
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:34,083
I guess they're selling
something really delicious, Dad.

60
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,114
According to industry spokesmen,

61
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:42,609
the sale of ramen spiked tenfold today.

62
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,756
More than 50 million ramen packs
have been sold in the last three days.

63
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,710
Let's eat.

64
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:51,648
I saw a lot of tanks and soldiers
on my way to school.

65
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,564
Can't we just go to America
if a war breaks out?

66
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:58,625
Mom is... in America.

67
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,794
War isn't something
that breaks out that easily.

68
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:03,063
Seoul isn't far from here.

69
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,309
It will turn into a sea of fire
when war begins!

70
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,712
You won't be able to survive either!

71
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,682
That's an inappropriate comment...

72
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,608
Do you think we will just let it happen?

73
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,332
You have to be very careful about this.

74
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:19,046
Are you declaring war on us right now?

75
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:22,183
I said you declared war
on us first with your actions.

76
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:23,417
Are you paying attention?

77
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,940
Are you falling asleep?

78
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:34,358
What?

79
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:37,591
An unidentified vessel?

80
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,357
What's happening?

81
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,969
Is something out there?

82
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,118
There is a serious stricture
of coronary arteries.

83
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,746
At this rate,
he won't survive more than a month.

84
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,339
What does this have to do with anything?

85
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,210
We can stop the war
if you save that heart.

86
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,121
Fine.

87
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,364
Then, please bring the patient
to my hospital.

88
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,817
He can't come here.

89
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,864
You must go to him.

90
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,289
Where would that be?

91
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,069
In North Korea.

92
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,143
Are you saying that this is...

93
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,199
That's right.

94
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:51,404
That's the heart of Kim Il-sung.

95
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:56,176
If he dies now, North Korea will fall
into an abyss of chaos.

96
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,580
Americans are waiting until that moment.
They think it's the best time to strike.

97
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,052
Mother 001-1-949-2419-25

98
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,498
Just listen to me.

99
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,735
I said I can't tell you why.

100
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:24,337
I'm getting married soon.

101
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:26,514
How can you expect me to take care of him?

102
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,103
I know it's a difficult favor to ask.

103
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:30,319
But he is your son, too!

104
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,778
You were always like that.

105
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:33,914
You only think about yourself.

106
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,526
I want to forget everything
in connection to you.

107
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,656
Both you and Hoon.

108
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:39,887
-Listen...
-I'm so sick and tired of you.

109
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,523
Please don't call me ever again.

110
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:36,033
Mr Choi will be here
when you're back from school.

111
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:40,256
Go stay with him for a couple of days.
Mom will come get you soon.

112
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,151
I want to stay with you, Dad.

113
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:43,375
Just do as I say.

114
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:49,574
But Mom... hates me.

115
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:58,999
Dad!

116
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:02,632
Dad!

117
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,759
Dad!

118
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,749
I'm going to school, Dad.

119
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,675
Hoon!

120
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:53,620
Hoon!

121
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:32,368
These are the most recent reports
of war simulations by the United States.

122
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,294
Is it true that you sent
a doctor up to North Korea?

123
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,306
Yes. It was to stop the American
bombardment before it starts.

124
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:44,941
And one doctor will do that?

125
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,800
Please explain.

126
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:52,081
The American bombardment will begin
when Kim Il-sung dies from heart problems.

127
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:57,520
The U.S. thinks the best time to strike
is when they are without a leader.

128
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,622
Then, the reason why
you sent the doctor to...

129
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:00,957
Yes.

130
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,793
I sent him to save Kim Il-sung's heart.

131
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,321
THE CHAIRMAN'S PALACE, PYEONGYANG

132
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:32,825
Once the bombardment begins,
North Korea will immediately retaliate

133
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,458
to attack the American military
facilities in South Korea.

134
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,352
But what's more important is

135
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,538
that our nuclear plants are also targets.

136
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,560
If any of our nuclear plants are hit,

137
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:49,763
a nuclear explosion 100,000 times stronger
than the Hiroshima bombing will occur.

138
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,735
Even if we end up winning the war...

139
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:59,339
...a third of South Korea territory
won't be habitable for the next 200 years.

140
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,937
His heart stopped!

141
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,528
-CPR!
-Bring the kit!

142
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,114
Epinephrine, ampoule three!

143
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,283
You must save him no matter what,
Dr Park.

144
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:55,929
Hoon...

145
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,849
Congressman Jang?

146
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:24,658
The Americans approved bombardment.

147
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,660
What?

148
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:28,829
Mr President.

149
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:38,821
-What's happening, Congressman Jang?
-Don't you know how urgent this is?

150
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:46,135
Why won't you do this for me?

151
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,991
What will happen to my brother?

152
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:53,596
1994

153
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,255
U.S. EMBASSY, SEOUL

154
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,563
Get the pump ready.

155
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:37,637
It's ready, Doctor.

156
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,109
Ready to restore.

157
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,793
Defibrillator.

158
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:51,660
Transplant.

159
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,436
Hey! What are you doing here? Hey!

160
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,714
Hey! Stop them! Hey! Stop them!

161
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:34,403
Ambassador Brady,
stop the operation right now!

162
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:35,567
We are all gonna die!

163
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,657
Before it happens, we are all gonna die!

164
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:51,309
The operation has stopped.

165
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,873
Let's finish up.

166
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,030
Stay focused until the very end.

167
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:47,170
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter,
who is visiting Pyeongyang to meet

168
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:51,007
with Kim Il-sung, persuaded Kim Il-sung
to promise to temporarily halt

169
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,886
the North's nuclear program.

170
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:56,527
It is now believed that the worst
of the Korean crisis is over.

171
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:02,892
Difficult times give birth to a hero,
and that hero rules the world.

172
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,387
Congressman Jang!
I knew that you would do it.

173
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:13,595
Congratulations!

174
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,871
You did it!

175
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:16,832
I'm flattered.

176
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,241
What's that?

177
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,943
I saw my father doing this.

178
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:11,687
He did it after healing someone's wound.

179
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,211
Do you want to become a doctor?

180
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:18,619
Yes. I think it's a great thing
to save a person from death.

181
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,654
I think that would be amazing.

182
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:31,899
My name is Song Jae-hee.

183
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:34,501
What's yours?

184
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:45,445
Hoon, we should go.

185
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:56,557
Just a moment, Dad.

186
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,505
My name is Hoon. Park Hoon.

187
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,334
We're going to a strange country,

188
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:35,799
the hideout of Satan
where Nina is held prisoner.

189
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:42,202
Dad, that's a weird looking truck.

190
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,709
Dad, aren't we going home?

191
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:25,946
I don't think we'll be able to go home.

192
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:27,381
Why not?

193
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:53,540
We don't need two heroes in Korea.
They don't need anyone else but me.

194
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,840
He's the hero who saved Korea!

195
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:03,619
Jang Seok-joo!

196
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,856
Jang Seok-joo!

197
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,974
Jang Seok-joo for President!

198
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,846
What happened to my son, Hoon?

199
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:17,403
What happened to my son?

200
00:23:17,494 --> 00:23:20,197
What happened to my Hoon?

201
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:25,145
What happened to my dear son, Hoon?
What happened to my dear son, Hoon?

202
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:39,620
Hello, everyone!

203
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:42,114
My name is Jang Seok-joo.

204
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:50,373
Jang Seok-joo!

205
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:14,621
Those South Koreans are
really cold-blooded.

206
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:22,162
As of now, Professor Park Cheol
of South Korea is dead.

207
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:29,670
From now on you'll live as a proud citizen
of our dear leader, Comrade Park.

208
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,999
Sorry, the cassette tape got loose.

209
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:12,855
What do you think?

210
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,715
It's amazing, isn't it?

211
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,627
Everyone knows this song in South Korea.

212
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:20,563
So the intelligence department teaches

213
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:23,857
this song to all our spies
before they're sent down there!

214
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:26,293
The song is called "Tell Me."

215
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:27,804
How much is the tape?

216
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:28,908
Two dollars.

217
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:38,022
Let me buy one.

218
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:39,830
Run!

219
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:41,610
Campus police is coming!

220
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:48,861
Geez, those little brats!

221
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:45,973
Jae-hee...

222
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:11,908
I can feel your heartbeat.

223
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:14,444
I'm scared to death right now.
Just stay quiet.

224
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:17,401
You know what'll happen
if they get you, right?

225
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:19,916
It's destiny.

226
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,917
Are you going to continue
to talk that nonsense?

227
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:31,158
Apparently, everyone's heartbeat
is different.

228
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,221
Just like how there aren't two people
with the same face.

229
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:42,317
Listen to mine.

230
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,698
But mine's same as yours, don't you think?

231
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:09,639
That's why we are destined to be together.

232
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:17,886
I made a decision.

233
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:21,181
I made a decision, too.

234
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:23,953
Huh? Ouch! Jae-hee!

235
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:27,202
Just a moment! Song Jae-hee!

236
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:29,543
I'm going to tell your father everything.

237
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,554
How can you do this
to the man of your destiny?

238
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:33,750
The man I'm destined to be with? Whatever!

239
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,818
What are you doing?
Put me down right now!

240
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:55,745
I'm aware that your parents
are not fond of me.

241
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,980
But they can't do anything
to alter destiny.

242
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,574
Will you marry me?

243
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,485
Where did you get this?

244
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,610
It's pretty, isn't it?

245
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:06,689
I risked my life selling
South Korean tapes, so I could buy this.

246
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,524
You must have lost your mind.

247
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,726
You risked your life
for something like this?

248
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:13,296
That's why you should marry me
as soon as possible.

249
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,788
Forget it.

250
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:25,561
We'll get married, okay?

251
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:28,731
Okay. I'll marry you.

252
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:30,761
Maybe in 100 years?

253
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:33,850
Hey!

254
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:36,853
Song Jae-hee, don't you think
this is too much?

255
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:41,502
Darn...

256
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,852
You didn't come to my class.

257
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:50,390
What were you doing?

258
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:52,659
I'm sorry, Father.

259
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,709
What would you do if I disappeared
all of a sudden?

260
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,587
That's easy.

261
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,613
I'd search the whole world and find you.

262
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:49,008
-Really?
-Of course.

263
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,285
My dad wants to see you.

264
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:52,681
Really?

265
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:54,488
Yes. He wants you to come
for dinner tonight.

266
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:57,057
But be careful.

267
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,759
My father is a very scary man.

268
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,272
It's fine. I like scary men.

269
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,542
-Dress up!
-Of course!

270
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:38,611
Dressing up that much isn't necessary
when you're going to see patients.

271
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,536
Are we going to a pro bono clinic today?

272
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,583
Let's go. We might be late.

273
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:49,452
Father, can I skip today?

274
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:52,846
-No.
-Just today. Please?

275
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:55,124
Think about the patients
who are waiting for us.

276
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,150
If you still want to skip,
then you may do so.

277
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,064
There won't be too many patients today,
right?

278
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:02,612
There weren't that many last time.

279
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:29,358
It's not an easy task to screen
for disease without proper equipment.

280
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:33,729
To be a doctor in a place where even
a basic X-ray machine doesn't exist,

281
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,282
you must learn how to screen
for disease without equipment.

282
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,327
The inflammation on the wall layer
of his heart must be sucked out.

283
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,805
Otherwise, it will cause
serious complications.

284
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:46,400
My clinical training began two months ago.
What if I stab the wrong place?

285
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,105
I assume you read a lot of books
on anatomy.

286
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:56,210
Remember those pictures in your head
and feel them with your hands.

287
00:32:57,144 --> 00:33:03,483
Those feelings in your hands will often
show you more than machines.

288
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:45,259
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, I am.

289
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,262
Please, go on in.

290
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:58,964
I'll finish up the rest.

291
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:01,074
Shall we go inside?

292
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,446
Jae-hee! Jae-hee!

293
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:47,387
Jae-hee!

294
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:57,412
Hoon!

295
00:34:57,503 --> 00:34:58,665
Jae-hee!

296
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:06,039
Jae-hee! Jae-hee!

297
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:23,895
What's going on?

298
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:41,367
Jae-hee.

299
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:42,542
I'm scared.

300
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:46,213
Why? What's wrong?

301
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:51,652
Where on earth is she?

302
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:27,254
Hold on.

303
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:33,227
Wait! What are you doing?

304
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,972
Please don't forget me! Okay?

305
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:38,235
-Just wait!
-Hoon!

306
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,543
What are you doing to her?

307
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:41,502
Hoon!

308
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:45,216
Hoon!

309
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:46,468
What are you doing to her?

310
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,153
Hoon!

311
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,689
Jae-hee...

312
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,036
Her family came from Japan.

313
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,396
It seems like the girl's father
has been purged.

314
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,709
Jae-hee didn't do anything wrong.

315
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:59,756
For political crimes,
collective punishment applies.

316
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:01,048
I will find her!

317
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:02,983
They might suspect you, too.

318
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,117
Just forget it.

319
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,186
She's the reason why I appreciate my life.

320
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,389
She's the only person
who helped me to find my dream!

321
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,968
Who is Dr Park Hoon?

322
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:02,876
Who is it?

323
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:15,756
I wasn't trying to escape.

324
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,424
My father is very sick!

325
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,670
Are you Comrade Park Hoon?

326
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:36,176
You're all grown up!

327
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:42,182
The purpose of this research center is
to maintain the health of our dear leader.

328
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:47,087
Therefore, now you'll never be able
to go outside again.

329
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:52,826
I'm sure you just saw what will happen
if you try to escape.

330
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:58,932
I never said I'd come here.

331
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:05,472
It's the decision of the Party.

332
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:11,856
Then, if I study hard here,
will I be the doctor to our dear leader?

333
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:13,881
In a way, yes.

334
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:15,792
What do you mean?

335
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:21,588
Whether you become his doctor or become
a guinea pig is entirely up to you.

336
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:28,145
5 YEARS LATER

337
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,776
Where were you this time?

338
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,301
Nowhere special.

339
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:43,880
I feel suffocated inside these buildings.

340
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:46,473
Do you know that you'll be executed
if you leave without permission?

341
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:49,676
Your medical talents
won't protect you from everything.

342
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:51,912
If you stick your nose up too high,
it might get broken.

343
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:55,382
My nose is naturally big.

344
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:57,651
Don't you think so, Comrade?

345
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:00,153
You need to do
a myocardial infarction surgery.

346
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:02,155
Get ready.

347
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:06,927
Hoon.

348
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:10,964
Father?

349
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:17,046
Unauthorized people aren't allowed here.
How did you get in?

350
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:19,873
I heard you often leave the sites
without permission.

351
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:27,981
Yes. I'm combing through every prison
and labor camp out there.

352
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:33,053
Are you still searching for Jae-hee?

353
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:34,097
Of course.

354
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:35,189
You should stop.

355
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,679
You might put yourself in danger.

356
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:39,626
Stay out of this, Father.

357
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:41,962
Hoon!

358
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:54,050
This research center's purpose is
to maintain the health of our dear leader.

359
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:57,072
The quality of the manpower here
is the best in our country.

360
00:42:57,973 --> 00:43:01,624
For our doctors' clinical experiences,

361
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:06,787
we're bringing most of the country's
heart patients here.

362
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:10,757
Please take a look.

363
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:18,131
They're performing an off-pump bypass.

364
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:20,019
Off-pump bypass.

365
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:34,882
Pause the surgery.

366
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:41,455
He says that if you stop now,
the heart muscle will start dying.

367
00:43:41,546 --> 00:43:43,490
Tell him the electricity
will come back before that

368
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:44,791
and take the guests outside.

369
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,270
I think the doctor is going to continue.

370
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:48,529
Stop the surgery!

371
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,964
How can sew a tiny vein
if he can't even see anything?

372
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:54,010
I've done this thousands of times.

373
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:55,455
What do you mean I can't see?

374
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:21,195
Cut.

375
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:43,150
He says the surgeon is amazing.

376
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:49,990
Please finish up for me.

377
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:01,435
That was a very impressive surgery,
Dr Park.

378
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:05,973
All the clinical training for the past
five years wasn't for nothing, was it?

379
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,376
But don't you think it's funny?

380
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:10,310
What is it?

381
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:13,426
How can the best research center
in the country lose electricity?

382
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,249
Especially during a surgery.

383
00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:21,722
What's there to worry about
if we have you, Dr Park?

384
00:45:28,762 --> 00:45:30,308
Is this person even alive?

385
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:31,365
So far, yes.

386
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:34,134
Where is this patient from?
The condition is terrible...

387
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:35,531
Special Supervision Prison No. 6.

388
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:38,272
A secret prison for political criminals.

389
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,585
The herbal medicine department will run
some experiments with herbs on him,

390
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:44,956
we'll run some experiments
on organ transplant and tumors.

391
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,047
I can't do it.

392
00:45:47,138 --> 00:45:48,482
He came in with his daughter,

393
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:51,260
see if you can use her organs
to make this guy live.

394
00:45:51,351 --> 00:45:53,830
There won't be a transplant rejection
as they're related.

395
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,659
You want me to kill the daughter
to save the father?

396
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:59,602
You need to impress
those Europeans once more.

397
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:03,997
We need their approval to get free medical
machines worth millions of dollars.

398
00:46:04,088 --> 00:46:05,675
Didn't I just say I can't do it?

399
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,880
-Just do as I say!
-The daughter will die.

400
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:10,137
What will you tell the father later?

401
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:14,308
They'll all die when they return
to the prison anyway.

402
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:18,878
I can't do it, tell someone else to do it.

403
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,501
Don't be so arrogant.

404
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:33,636
You've done worse things here before.

405
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,148
That's why I can't do it anymore.

406
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:41,578
Park Hoon!

407
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:54,915
Doctor, when is the surgery?

408
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:56,559
What surgery?

409
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,336
She's from the Special Supervision Prison.

410
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:00,687
I won't do it.

411
00:47:36,623 --> 00:47:39,502
My name is Song Jae-hee.
What's yours?

412
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:00,502
Please save her.

413
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,095
I don't care if I live.

414
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:07,479
But please save my Jae-hee.

415
00:49:16,223 --> 00:49:18,292
The organs are heavily damaged.

416
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,194
Especially the kidneys.

417
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,629
They seem to belong to a girl,
she must be having a tough time.

418
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:31,805
One of the kidneys of the male patient
is also damaged.

419
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,209
But I think he has a chance to live.

420
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,145
What if I transplant the man's kidney
to the girl?

421
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,049
That means the man will die.

422
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,766
-I can save the girl.
-No, you can't.

423
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,555
That's not what a doctor does.

424
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:51,658
Then what does a doctor do?

425
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:53,193
Are you really asking me?

426
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:55,517
Do you know what I did here
for the past five years?

427
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:59,308
I opened the chests of perfectly
healthy people countless times.

428
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:02,503
I transplanted organs even though
it was obvious that rejection will occur.

429
00:50:02,594 --> 00:50:04,747
I applied thousands of unverified
synthetic grafts.

430
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:07,156
A countless number of people died
because of me, a doctor.

431
00:50:07,932 --> 00:50:10,244
Then... What should a doctor do, Father?

432
00:50:11,812 --> 00:50:14,681
You probably think that a doctor
never murders people.

433
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:16,083
Hoon.

434
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:19,152
You're wrong!

435
00:50:19,243 --> 00:50:21,455
This is a world in which
even doctors murder people.

436
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:28,529
Is it that bad if I want to murder
someone to save the love of my life?

437
00:50:31,921 --> 00:50:34,034
Tell me what's so wrong about that.

438
00:50:49,183 --> 00:50:51,919
Could it be that this girl is...

439
00:52:22,993 --> 00:52:24,281
Scalpel.

440
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:26,904
I thought it was supposed to be the man?

441
00:52:31,585 --> 00:52:33,487
The procedure would be easier
to show on a female.

442
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:45,566
They've agreed to provide
free medical equipment.

443
00:52:49,603 --> 00:52:50,604
Really?

444
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:57,344
You may begin.

445
00:53:04,151 --> 00:53:05,319
He has one condition though.

446
00:53:10,678 --> 00:53:14,828
He wishes to show Dr Park's skills
to doctors in other countries.

447
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:24,638
You want me to go all the way to Budapest?

448
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:27,508
Just for four or five days.

449
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:32,179
I can't leave my post.

450
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:40,720
Dr Park, they'll only give us
the equipment if you go.

451
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:47,961
I need to keep track
of the progress of my patient.

452
00:53:49,763 --> 00:53:53,333
Is this really how you want to play?

453
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:28,202
Don't worry, Jae-hee.
I will never lose you again.

454
00:54:58,932 --> 00:54:59,818
Hoon.

455
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,245
Father.

456
00:55:02,336 --> 00:55:03,788
I've been waiting forever.

457
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:06,840
What are you doing here so late?

458
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,877
Do you even have a permit right now?

459
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:12,446
I need to talk to you.

460
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:15,616
You'll be in trouble if they find out.
Go before the power comes back.

461
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,985
Go to Budapest.

462
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:22,322
I know one of the doctors
who were on the delegation.

463
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:25,102
So the reason they asked me
to go to Budapest is...

464
00:55:25,193 --> 00:55:27,002
I got the final confirmation today.

465
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:30,497
This will be your last chance
to escape here.

466
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:36,579
I'm sorry. I can't go without Jae-hee.

467
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,016
She'll go with you, too.

468
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:43,110
I'm fully aware what she means to you.

469
00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:45,546
Father.

470
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:48,782
When you leave tomorrow,
we'll never see each other again.

471
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:53,387
I wish you a life full of happiness
with that girl.

472
00:55:54,988 --> 00:55:56,223
What about you, Father?

473
00:55:57,424 --> 00:55:59,359
Don't worry about me.

474
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:03,263
Father!

475
00:56:14,741 --> 00:56:15,609
Father.

476
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:18,812
I'm sorry.

477
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:24,918
I can't go.

478
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:26,662
Why not?

479
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:28,121
Because of me?

480
00:56:29,323 --> 00:56:31,091
I'll protect Jae-hee no matter what.

481
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:32,092
Hoon.

482
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,161
Let's go. I'll show you the way.

483
00:56:47,174 --> 00:56:49,176
There is a secret exit
at the end of the tunnel.

484
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,979
That's the passage I used
when I needed to get out.

485
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:56,583
You must reconsider.

486
00:56:57,317 --> 00:56:59,853
This is the last chance
to escape from here.

487
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:03,357
You should leave now.
The power will be back on any minute.

488
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:09,029
Hoon.

489
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:17,137
Goodbye, Father.

490
00:57:50,737 --> 00:57:51,905
Father.

491
00:58:07,006 --> 00:58:09,089
Father! Father!

492
00:58:11,853 --> 00:58:13,179
Father! Father!

493
00:58:25,156 --> 00:58:26,737
No! No, you can't.

494
00:59:03,704 --> 00:59:05,157
Father!
