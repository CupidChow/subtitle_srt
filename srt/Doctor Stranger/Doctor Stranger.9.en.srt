1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,506
DOCTOR STRANGER

2
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,765
-What?
-Something strange is going on here.

3
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,402
Is Dr Han okay?

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,775
Why did you want to see us?

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,849
We changed our plans.

6
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,517
Changed?

7
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,052
That's right.

8
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,990
We want Han Jae-joon to operate
on the Prime Minister.

9
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,302
Hoon!

10
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,304
What's going on?

11
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,172
That woman who looks like Jae-hee...

12
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,108
You mean Dr Han Seung-hee!

13
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,549
I think they're going to kill her!

14
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,638
Dr Oh.

15
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,247
Where on Earth is he going?

16
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,681
EPISODE 9

17
00:01:54,772 --> 00:01:56,216
-Dr Park!
-Let go of me!

18
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:57,551
Where are you going?

19
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:00,096
I have to go! Let go of me!

20
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,121
Where?

21
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,223
Where are you going, leaving the baby?

22
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:04,725
I am begging you. Please let me go.

23
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:26,079
Chief, something weird is going on.

24
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:29,917
I said let go of me!

25
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,852
Look!

26
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,300
I don't know where you're going.
But what will happen to the baby then?

27
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,439
What will happen?

28
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,380
We must save the babies.

29
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:02,983
Can you come?

30
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,018
We will save the baby.

31
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,270
What do you mean by using Han Jae-joon?

32
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,608
Exactly as you heard, Han Jae-joon
will operate on the Prime Minister.

33
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,444
Is that the reason why you asked me
to join Dr Han's team?

34
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,737
But you refused to follow my orders.

35
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,115
Our original plan was for me
to join the Park Hoon's team.

36
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,341
The plan has changed.

37
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,081
Then, I guess further conversation
won't be necessary.

38
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,455
Let me ask you one thing.

39
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:46,293
Has my government agreed
to what you're doing right now?

40
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:52,032
We don't need their agreement.
We only follow our will.

41
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,270
Do you think we're a joke?

42
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,440
Drop the gun!

43
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,239
Where on Earth were you going?

44
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,498
Just get ready for the surgery.

45
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,566
Where is Dr Han?

46
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,070
She'll be here.

47
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,312
-Dr Choi!
-Yes, sir

48
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,680
How do we decide on the winner?

49
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,450
The biggest factor will be
if the surgery was successful or not.

50
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,537
And if they both succeed?

51
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:46,220
The climax of this surgery will be

52
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:51,859
when the surgeons stop
the bypass machine to make the arteries.

53
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,496
Doesn't that mean that the babies
will die from a lack of oxygen?

54
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,908
If we keep their body temperatures
around 18 degrees,

55
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,977
they'll be okay for 45 minutes.

56
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,413
-But that's the best case scenario.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,808
The less time it takes to make the artery,
the better the result will be.

58
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:11,778
So it all depends on who makes
the artery first within 45 minutes.

59
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:12,913
That's right.

60
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:19,219
The winner will probably be
the surgeon who finishes first.

61
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,624
What's the result of the last ABGA?

62
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:00,227
50/40. Luckily, it hasn't gone down.

63
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:01,859
That's a relief.

64
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,070
Hey, why isn't Dr Han here yet?

65
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,510
Shouldn't you get
another anesthesiologist?

66
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,880
Dr Han will be here.

67
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,787
Can you put those down?

68
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,657
Will it be Park Hoon or Han Jae-joon?

69
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:06,827
It was going to be Han Jae-joon.

70
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,698
But I changed my mind
after looking at you.

71
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,202
I have a question for you.

72
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,070
What is it?

73
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:22,075
Are you Song Jae-hee
or Han Seung-hee?

74
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:31,385
I can only trust you
if I know your true identity.

75
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,365
A surgical scar?

76
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:19,960
That's right.

77
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:24,738
You can always attach another kidney.
But you can't hide a scar.

78
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,673
Are you curious?

79
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:33,647
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I've never seen her naked.

80
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,913
Does that answer your question?

81
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,421
I really take pity on Park Hoon!

82
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,296
Fine, I'll give Park Hoon a chance.

83
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:28,335
But don't forget this.
I only need one surgeon.

84
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:44,017
-Is the competition at 10:00?
-Yes, sir.

85
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:08,542
If Park Hoon loses,
your dead body will lie next to his.

86
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:29,696
Why isn't it starting?

87
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:58,659
I think tonight will be a long night
for Park Hoon and Han Jae-joon.

88
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,662
Park Hoon will win.

89
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,265
I hope so.
Otherwise, he'll die by your hands.

90
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,747
There's a little bit inside of me
that wishes for Park Hoon's victory.

91
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,406
Let alone Park Hoon...

92
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,887
I wouldn't feel too good about it
if Han Seung-hee is found dead.

93
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:18,979
Don't worry.

94
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,649
I don't leave any dead bodies behind.

95
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:44,204
Darn it! What's going on?

96
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,508
PARK HOON

97
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,244
Why isn't he picking up the phone,
Park Hoon?

98
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,789
Why does this person keep calling him?

99
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,661
-Hello?
-Why didn't you answer?

100
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:08,978
Who is this?

101
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,031
Isn't this Hoon?

102
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,434
The Water Bottle... no.
Dr Park is in the operating room.

103
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,270
Who the heck are you?

104
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,267
Don't try to know much.
Stop calling me then!

105
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:26,280
Why are you putting your coat on?
We haven't even started!

106
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,481
Forget it.

107
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,816
I guess I'll go watch the surgeries.

108
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:33,954
We have some time until they start.
Wait, it's 10:00. Let's go.

109
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,171
-Dr Choi.
-Yes, sir.

110
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,415
It's 10:00.

111
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,732
Our anesthesiologist hasn't arrived yet.

112
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:51,905
You may begin.

113
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,707
Dr Choi!

114
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,550
Is everyone ready?

115
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,255
Dr Eun, please.

116
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,259
I'll begin the anesthesia.

117
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:16,296
Ketamine has been infused,
and two ml of atracurium we injected.

118
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,851
Why aren't you starting?

119
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,786
My anesthesiologist isn't here yet.

120
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:41,688
Then get another anesthesiologist!

121
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,290
Hey, Park Hoon!

122
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,530
-What happened to Dr Han?
-She'll be here.

123
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:00,274
That little ass!

124
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,318
Where's the chief's operating room?

125
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,710
-Next door.
-That's what I meant.

126
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,257
By the way, why are you here, Dr Oh?

127
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,195
-Can you just leave?
-Best of luck, Water Bottle!

128
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,268
Hey, Kim Chi-gyu!

129
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,607
Dr Han.

130
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:54,494
I'll give Park Hoon a chance.
I only need one surgeon.

131
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:59,266
If Park Hoon loses,
your dead body will lie next to his.

132
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:23,247
I'll begin the anesthesia.
Two ml of atracurium will be injected.

133
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,338
-At this rate, we might lose.
-If that's what you're thinking, leave.

134
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,975
This is just a regular surgery
to help a sick baby.

135
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,025
You may begin.

136
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,226
Well done.

137
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:01,795
Scalpel.

138
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,902
Dr Eun is very skilled.

139
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,819
Of course.

140
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,274
She was the best anesthesiologist
at this hospital until recently.

141
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:16,090
Until recently?

142
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,744
Yes.

143
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,047
Until Dr Han arrived.

144
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,551
You may begin.

145
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,499
Scalpel.

146
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:28,956
Just focus on the baby.

147
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,664
Han Seung-hee?

148
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,104
Did they already finish anesthesia?

149
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:45,439
Be quiet and watch.

150
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:51,745
Dr Park started late,
but he already caught up.

151
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,933
Mr Chairman, look at them.

152
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,806
These are the surgeons who will be
the pillars of cardiology in Korea!

153
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,622
I guess the competition is underway now.

154
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,726
I'm curious.

155
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,764
Who will be my surgeon?

156
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,417
This is the climax.

157
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,261
-Temperature?
-Eighteen degrees.

158
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:15,829
The climax?

159
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,564
So...

160
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:21,024
...once they stop the bypass machine,

161
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,605
they only have 45 minutes
to make the artery.

162
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,173
Pump off.

163
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,824
They must finish
before that goes to zero.

164
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:37,217
Otherwise, the babies will die.

165
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,069
He really caught up a lot
by shortening the anesthesia.

166
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:59,473
I think their experienced scrub nurse
helped, too.

167
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,047
Suction!

168
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,222
Look here.

169
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:17,824
Okay.

170
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:19,753
Hey, quack!

171
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:24,157
The vein ripped!

172
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,731
Stitch it.

173
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:40,741
We're running out of time.
You must stitch it now.

174
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,416
That quack!

175
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,332
We really don't have time.
You need to stitch it, Dr Park.

176
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:08,702
Look at the baby instead of me.

177
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:13,941
Look at the baby!

178
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,982
Stitch it.

179
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:19,947
Dr Park, you must do it.
We don't have time!

180
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:21,048
You do it, Dr Park.

181
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,818
We're running out of time,
and I can't do this.

182
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,186
We practiced earlier.

183
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:34,895
Do it.
Do you want to be called a quack forever?

184
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,194
Hurry up!

185
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,049
You must do it, we don't have time!

186
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,922
-Be quiet.
-Dr Park!

187
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,397
There's nothing special about Dr Oh

188
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:13,376
other than the fact
that she's the daughter of the Chairman.

189
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,269
I'm afraid this isn't something
you're capable of.

190
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,471
Give your first assistant position
to Dr Keum.

191
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:21,108
If it's a quack who tries hard like you,
I think it'll be possible.

192
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:25,045
Your hands are perfect
for a cardiac surgeon.

193
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:29,183
Fine, quack.

194
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:32,219
Give it to me.

195
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,054
Pump on.

196
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,068
It's over.

197
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:46,493
Han Jae-joon won.

198
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:24,298
We won, Chief.

199
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:37,177
Cut.

200
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,180
Pump on.

201
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,827
I'm sorry.

202
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,964
-Because of me...
-Because of you, the baby lives.

203
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,503
We lost.

204
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,204
It doesn't matter.

205
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:57,791
-Dr Han...
-Later.

206
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:11,405
Mr Chairman. Congratulations, sir.

207
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:12,439
Thank you.

208
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,742
I'm sure you'll soon have something
to celebrate, too.

209
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,713
Those surgeries weren't something
you can see every day, Mr Chairman.

210
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,951
It was the last surgery for Park Hoon.

211
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:36,230
That surgery showed us
why we must keep Dr Park here.

212
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:39,132
Yes, I agree that he's a great surgeon.

213
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,137
But I can't be in the same building
with him.

214
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:48,742
It's your dream to make this hospital
the best in the world.

215
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:51,812
And Dr Park and Dr Han will make
that dream come true.

216
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:55,482
Dr Han alone is enough
to achieve that dream.

217
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:57,084
Mr Chairman...

218
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:20,174
I'll have something to celebrate soon?

219
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:28,248
Congratulations, Professor.

220
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:34,597
Congratulations in advance of your
new position at the branch hospital.

221
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,523
You little ass!

222
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:40,561
You tried so hard so far...

223
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,949
...but now
that I won't see you ever again...

224
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:50,444
-...tears of joy are blurring my eyes!
-What?

225
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:54,965
What did you just say?

226
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:05,962
I heard the women doctors at the branch
hospital are all very beautiful!

227
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:09,065
You'll need a lot of flowers there.
I'll send you some.

228
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,017
You little jerk!

229
00:28:15,323 --> 00:28:22,102
I hope you'll regain your strength
and stamina at the branch hospital.

230
00:28:22,193 --> 00:28:23,504
I wish you the best, sir!

231
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,706
What a sweet talker you are!

232
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:29,530
You deserve this!

233
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:32,012
Come here right now! Come here!

234
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:39,395
Professor Moon, did the Chairman
leave already?

235
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:44,424
Oh Soo-hyun, you know
that we lost because of you, right?

236
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,103
I'm sorry, Professor Moon.

237
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:50,097
At least you have a good heart.

238
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:56,203
So please tell your father
not to send me to the branch hospital.

239
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,081
The branch hospital?

240
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:03,343
Mr Chairman told me that I'll have
something to celebrate soon.

241
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:07,181
We're already short on staff.
He won't send you to the branch hospital.

242
00:29:07,272 --> 00:29:09,219
Yes.

243
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:15,720
So please just use your good heart
to convince him, okay?

244
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:22,538
Tell him I'm willing to give everything
I have to this hospital!

245
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:26,904
I think that's something
you should tell him in person.

246
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,211
How did I become so low
that I'm begging her?

247
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,816
Park Hoon...

248
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:48,622
-Park Hoon...
-Let go of me.

249
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:50,967
Why did you lose?

250
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,759
Why does it matter? We saved the babies.

251
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,837
But now I'll die!

252
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,618
No one's dying. It's okay. Goodbye.

253
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:58,732
Hey!

254
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:03,679
Everyone will die! Hey!

255
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,141
Everyone will die! Hey!

256
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:13,480
What a mess!

257
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:26,994
Well done, Dr Han.

258
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:28,529
Please keep an eye on the baby.

259
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,117
Where are you going?

260
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:38,805
That was a close one, Dr Park.

261
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:39,973
Where is Dr Han?

262
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:41,808
She just left.

263
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:56,595
Hoon!

264
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,731
Is she Jae-hee?

265
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:13,407
-Listen to me carefully.
-You listen to me first...

266
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:14,529
Listen!

267
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:19,246
You can't tell anyone else what you saw.

268
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:20,981
-But...
-Answer me.

269
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:23,650
Okay.

270
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,419
But just tell me one thing.

271
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,856
-What?
-Is she really Jae-hee?

272
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,996
I saw guns, too. Is she a spy?

273
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,199
That's why no one can know about this.

274
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,484
Hoon...

275
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:43,494
Give me the key to the truck and stay
with your mom. I'll call later.

276
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:53,447
Hoon, you'll be okay, right?

277
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:55,516
Thanks.

278
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,559
I'll execute Park Hoon.

279
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,829
You won't survive either, Comrade.

280
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,430
Didn't I mention this before?

281
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,767
The only thing I'm afraid of
is not completing the mission.

282
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:16,036
And we failed.

283
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:26,947
Jae-hee...

284
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:49,670
Jae-hee...

285
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:09,465
The Party will decide
the success or failure of the mission.

286
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,260
You have no right to make that judgment!

287
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:13,727
Your excuse is pathetic.

288
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:16,597
Are you afraid of death?

289
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:20,100
-We still have a chance.
-We had a chance.

290
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,803
But he blew it.

291
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:21,728
Not in an operating room!

292
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:22,729
That's what I was saying.

293
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:24,207
Hey, Water Bottle.

294
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:27,877
Cheer up. You did well, too.
It was just that the Chief did so well.

295
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,531
So cheer up!

296
00:34:29,622 --> 00:34:31,004
It's okay. Let's go.

297
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:39,379
Hello.

298
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:58,608
Thanks for your hard work.

299
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,434
You did well, too, Chief.

300
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,645
It was a single round competition, right?

301
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,773
-How's Dr Oh?
-She's not answering her phone.

302
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:12,980
I really didn't expect Dr Oh to go
to the Water Bottle's team.

303
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:17,217
We won thanks to her.

304
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,132
-Excuse me?
-The Water Bottle almost caught up to us

305
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:25,158
when Dr Oh fumbled
and delayed the surgery.

306
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:29,129
Dr Eun...

307
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:35,435
The Chairman wants to see you, Dr Han.

308
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:36,885
Okay.

309
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:44,178
It's very late.
You should go home and rest.

310
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,914
How could you help Park Hoon?

311
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:50,617
Everyone got what they wanted in the end.

312
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:55,155
The babies are alive,
and you and Jae-joon won.

313
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:56,666
How can you say such a thing?

314
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:58,768
What if your relationship
with Dr Han sours?

315
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,971
Are you concerned for me?
Because I might break up with him?

316
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:03,539
I'm just concerned for myself.

317
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,399
I don't want to lose
a perfectly good son-in-law.

318
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:10,537
Why? Don't you like him anymore?

319
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:13,970
I like him.
Not as much as I like you though.

320
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:16,877
So you should take good care of him.

321
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:21,548
-I want to move out of the house, Father.
-What?

322
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,292
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

323
00:36:23,383 --> 00:36:25,385
I'll explain the reason later.

324
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:28,622
Soo-hyun!

325
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,292
Thank you, Father.

326
00:36:43,378 --> 00:36:44,514
Soo-hyun...

327
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:46,874
You should go in. He's waiting for you.

328
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:50,644
-Do you have some time?
-Later.

329
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:55,482
Congratulations anyway, Jae-joon.

330
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:08,935
113

331
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:16,003
Please press one to report
espionage activities.

332
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,910
What are you doing, Chang-yi?

333
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:24,253
Dr Oh!

334
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:27,071
-Why are you so surprised?
-It's nothing.

335
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:30,083
Have you seen Dr Park anywhere?

336
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,794
I don't know where he is.

337
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:34,197
His line is still busy.
Where on Earth could he be?

338
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:37,858
If you see him, please tell him
to give me a call.

339
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:53,941
Dr Han!

340
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,670
Dr Keum...

341
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:06,987
Have you seen Dr Park?

342
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,190
No.

343
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:13,493
-Great job today.
-Thanks.

344
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:19,499
Dr Oh looks happy.

345
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:23,570
Forget Dr Oh.

346
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:26,416
You became first assistant
on the team thanks to me.

347
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:27,975
How are you going to repay me?

348
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:30,444
What do you mean?

349
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,053
Let's start by taking this weekend off.

350
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:45,158
What do you want to do
with the weekend off?

351
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:51,665
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of everything.

352
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:02,409
Please leave a message...

353
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:05,479
Dr Park!

354
00:39:06,483 --> 00:39:07,681
Have you seen Dr Han?

355
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:10,117
I just saw her around the ward...

356
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:13,854
-Are you busy?
-Why?

357
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:15,589
I have something to tell you.

358
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,857
Later.

359
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,214
What should I do now, Byeong-cheol?

360
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:34,441
Stop crying and go find Hoon.

361
00:39:34,532 --> 00:39:37,220
Why are you looking for him?
It's all over!

362
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:39,146
You should be responsible for all this!

363
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:42,458
I recommended him because you told me to!

364
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,284
What do I do now?

365
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,386
I won't be able to fulfill
my father's last wish.

366
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,288
-Where are you?
-Listen to me carefully.

367
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,266
You must leave the hospital now.

368
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:25,459
-Where are you?
-Didn't you hear me?

369
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,336
You must leave the hospital immediately!

370
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,562
I'm asking where you are!

371
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,854
Jae-hee...

372
00:41:24,184 --> 00:41:25,185
Stop!

373
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:32,860
It can't end like this.

374
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,438
-Jae-hee...
-I said stop!

375
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:50,477
There's still a chance.

376
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:39,426
Code blue. Code blue. ICU, code blue.

377
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:12,292
I know you had no other choice.

378
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:14,595
But you should've convinced her.

379
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:16,196
You let her go to the other team?

380
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:18,532
I'm sorry, Mr Chairman.

381
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:23,146
Please take care of Soo-hyun.

382
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:25,272
She may pretend to be strong,
but she's very soft.

383
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:27,556
Yes, sir.

384
00:43:29,176 --> 00:43:30,377
Daughters always cause headaches.

385
00:43:30,468 --> 00:43:32,646
Please take her soon
so I can stop worrying.

386
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:43,924
Code blue. Code blue. ICU, code blue.

387
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,281
What happened?

388
00:43:58,372 --> 00:43:59,715
The blood pressure suddenly dropped.

389
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,517
I'm asking what happened!

390
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:03,086
The PVR has fallen.

391
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:06,389
You must do the surgery again and fix
the shunt to decrease the blood flow.

392
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,724
That can't be possible.
I checked everything!

393
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,184
How could he be in shock right now?

394
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:11,818
Whose patient is it?

395
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:14,154
Is it Dr Han's patient? Right?

396
00:44:16,623 --> 00:44:17,858
What's going on?

397
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,495
I'll tell you what's going on.
We must do the surgery again now.

398
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:25,399
Nurse Min, let's move him
to the operating room.

399
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,267
-Yes, sir.
-Hold it.

400
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,138
-You're leaving the baby here?
-He's my patient!

401
00:44:34,641 --> 00:44:37,311
I'll take care of him.

402
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:45,853
I'm sorry, Chief.

403
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:48,121
Move him to the operating room.

404
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:01,468
What happened?

405
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:05,639
What is this? Did we win?

406
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,845
Hooray!

407
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:18,619
Hooray!

408
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:21,688
What, Byeong-cheol?

409
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:23,690
What are you doing
in the middle of the ICU?

410
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:25,735
I was overcome with joy.

411
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:28,295
We must go see the Chairman right now.

412
00:45:28,386 --> 00:45:29,463
The Chairman?

413
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:33,342
Dr Han may have finished first,
but now there has been an accident.

414
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:35,853
So we must make sure who won!

415
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,838
Winning or losing isn't important
right now.

416
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:41,150
The reason why I agreed to this
was to have both Dr Han

417
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:44,520
and Dr Park to learn something
about being a doctor from this.

418
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,939
Winning is more important
than my life right now.

419
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,916
Let's go see the Chairman right now.

420
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:02,058
Cut.

421
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,169
I'll finish up, Chief.

422
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:11,104
I'll do it. You can leave.

423
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:25,485
Forceps.

424
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:28,856
Needle holder.

425
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,039
What happened?

426
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,760
-Get out.
-Jae-joon...

427
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:49,843
Get out!

428
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:40,694
Yes! We won! We won for sure!

429
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:44,631
Han Jae-joon is finished!

430
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:47,234
Hey, punk! Stop!

431
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:51,438
Turn back around.

432
00:47:54,842 --> 00:47:55,742
Hello, Chief!

433
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:57,945
Chief?

434
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,827
Go down and say,
"The branch hospital is..."

435
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:08,840
The branch hospital is...

436
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:12,009
Come up and say,
"Meant for Han Jae-joon!"

437
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,393
Meant for Han Jae-joon!

438
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,749
Repeat.

439
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,007
The branch hospital
is meant fo Han Jae-joon!

440
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:19,199
Auto pilot!

441
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:25,472
The branch hospital is meant
for Han Jae-joon!

442
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,475
Should I go to the branch hospital, Chief?

443
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:29,776
Hurry up!

444
00:48:30,944 --> 00:48:34,248
The branch hospital is meant
for Han Jae-joon!

445
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:37,951
Make sure you do it correctly!

446
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:40,420
And don't slow down!

447
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:47,427
The branch hospital is meant
for Han Jae-joon!

448
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:52,699
Han Jae-joon lost?

449
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:53,667
Yes, sir.

450
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:57,971
The baby that he operated on almost died.

451
00:48:58,172 --> 00:48:59,773
What a fool!

452
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:08,982
Then I guess Park Hoon
is our choice again?

453
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:54,561
-Park Hoon won.
-I know.

454
00:49:54,652 --> 00:49:57,264
Your recklessness almost
destroyed everything, Comrade!

455
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,870
-Recklessness?
-Park Hoon could've died!

456
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:06,373
You dared to tell him to run away!

457
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:10,277
You're the one
who shouldn't act recklessly.

458
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:15,282
I'm always watching you.

459
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:21,755
I'm the one who decides
whether or not to kill him.

460
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:27,561
It's the same with you, Han Seung-hee.

461
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:35,202
Where are we going?

462
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:42,576
How did the surgery go?

463
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:45,579
Well.

464
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,582
-Have you seen Dr Han?
-She probably went home.

465
00:51:30,824 --> 00:51:33,560
Hey, Park Hoon! Where are you going?

466
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:36,697
We must go celebrate our victory!

467
00:51:36,797 --> 00:51:38,031
You can celebrate on your own.

468
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,934
Hey Hoon, I love you.

469
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,338
I love you!

470
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:48,175
I love you!

471
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:33,556
GARIBONG CLINIC

472
00:53:29,653 --> 00:53:30,777
Hoon...

473
00:53:35,649 --> 00:53:36,817
Hoon...

474
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:54,216
Hoon...

475
00:54:07,246 --> 00:54:08,248
Hoon...

476
00:56:14,182 --> 00:56:15,213
Hoon...

477
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:25,819
Stop watching that.
I'm here!

478
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:27,054
Yeah. I'm sorry.

479
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,279
It tastes good when you eat it
with seaweed.

480
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:26,346
Let's see...

481
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:39,168
It's good.

482
00:57:39,259 --> 00:57:40,127
Is it?

483
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,575
Is it good?

484
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:13,060
Jae-hee...

485
00:58:24,938 --> 00:58:25,806
Jae-hee!

486
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:29,376
Jae-hee!

487
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:57,571
DOCTOR STRANGER

488
00:58:57,662 --> 00:58:59,282
What's important is that you're here.

489
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:00,941
-This is my place.
-Jae-joon!

490
00:59:01,032 --> 00:59:02,676
Because I need to do something
in this seat.

491
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,778
Thanks for everything so far, Chang-yi.
Goodbye.

492
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:06,213
He's driving me crazy!

493
00:59:06,304 --> 00:59:08,148
Where on Earth is he going?

494
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:09,683
-Hoon.
-I'll protect you.

495
00:59:09,774 --> 00:59:11,451
Park Hoon has disappeared, Prime Minister.

496
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:13,187
I wonder if he'll escape in one piece.

497
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:16,599
Give me one more chance,
as you did for Park Hoon.

498
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,358
How does it feel to be home?

499
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:21,228
Where is Jae-hee?
