1
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:51,762
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:53,092
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:54,373
(Child actors filmed in safety.)

4
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,173
(Episode 6)

5
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:44,512
Say you'll do it.

6
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:46,182
Do what?

7
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:49,123
Gun or bomb, say you'll make it.

8
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:53,123
You learned nothing during the ten-day beating.

9
00:01:55,222 --> 00:01:57,162
You met with a psychiatrist...

10
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:58,932
before coming here, didn't you?

11
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:01,862
I bet you said...

12
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:03,502
you were beaten as a kid.

13
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:06,632
That's why they're doing this to you.

14
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:11,002
They're using your greatest weakness to tame you.

15
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:17,112
Next time, just do it.

16
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:20,513
Whoever dies when your bomb goes off,

17
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:22,052
don't even care.

18
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:25,022
Don't even consider being responsible for the outcome.

19
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:27,323
Worry about yourself.

20
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,192
How old...

21
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,203
are you?

22
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:41,602
Are you the senior here?

23
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:44,343
Such ranks don't exist here.

24
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:47,642
We're all on our own.

25
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,012
Ro Um.

26
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:21,643
Han Moo Young.

27
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:23,912
Turn yourself in.

28
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:25,313
Two.

29
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:28,623
One.

30
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:32,053
We're coming in!

31
00:03:34,123 --> 00:03:36,492
This is insane. I'm done for.

32
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:38,493
Na Sa. Shut down.

33
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,333
My darn life.

34
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:45,632
The basement and this room's separate, right?

35
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,433
There's a generator.

36
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:49,243
What? Yes.

37
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:51,512
Turn off the whole system.

38
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:55,482
- What? - Cut the power.

39
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,053
Then all the equipment...

40
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:00,252
Everything. Do it now.

41
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:17,873
- Na Sa. - Yes?

42
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:20,803
As of right now, I'm your lawyer.

43
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,601
What's your real name?

44
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:23,743
Na Su Ho.

45
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:26,512
From now on, you only speak through me.

46
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,743
You'll remain silent, okay?

47
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:30,243
Okay.

48
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:36,023
Calm down. Count to ten out loud.

49
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:38,452
One.

50
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,352
Two.

51
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,493
Three.

52
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:57,912
Ro Um.

53
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:00,524
What's going on? The connection with Na Sa has been lost.

54
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,042
Do you have the footage?

55
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,713
Are you outside now?

56
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:07,583
Make a backup and wait for me.

57
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:13,523
Remember Sim Kyung Hwa?

58
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:18,463
Oh, yes.

59
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:21,403
Yes, that woman.

60
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:24,133
I bet you just thought she was an extra.

61
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:33,692
You're barking up the wrong tree.

62
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,312
You need to blackmail Park Jong Gu if money is what you're after.

63
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:41,721
You run a waste management company.

64
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:43,383
Why not get rid of your husband first?

65
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:49,122
I don't want to dirty my own hands. That's why.

66
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:52,133
Do you know a lot about Park Jong Gu?

67
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,963
Or do you know about me?

68
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:09,041
I got married with nothing but a cutlery set.

69
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:12,682
His family financed this business.

70
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,883
And I worked like a dog to grow the company.

71
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,893
But my so-called husband spends my hard-earned money...

72
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:20,452
like water,

73
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:24,763
yet my in-laws always treat him like a king,

74
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,193
while I'm always...

75
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,862
nothing but a slave.

76
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:33,202
I felt indebted to them, so I put up with them...

77
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:36,041
without knowing that I'd have to do it for 20 years.

78
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,573
- My gosh. - I saw all sorts of things.

79
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:41,783
Affairs?

80
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,013
I'd be grateful if he didn't molest anyone.

81
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:49,221
Do you know how many female employees...

82
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,283
I had to settle with when we were still newlyweds?

83
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,893
All he did in the office was cause such trouble,

84
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,592
so I gave him pocket money and told him to go out,

85
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:58,292
and he started gambling.

86
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,379
But now that I've lived with him for this long, I honestly don't know.

87
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:04,062
That pathetic jerk...

88
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:08,443
and me, who's still with him. We're like two peas in a pod.

89
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,412
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

90
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:16,512
My point is, taking him down is like...

91
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:18,482
spitting on my own face.

92
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:23,182
Isn't it a risk worth taking...

93
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:24,681
for the sake of your own life?

94
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:26,499
But what will you use to take him down for good?

95
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:27,653
Park Jong Gu.

96
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:30,463
I'll put him behind bars.

97
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,763
I've never seen anyone serve a jail sentence for gambling.

98
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:37,732
Right, that's how the law is.

99
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:42,301
Starting a gambling den,

100
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,042
embezzlement, and fraud.

101
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:48,124
I'd say that's enough to make his trial more interesting.

102
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:52,713
Just stop giving him money once he starts betting more,

103
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:54,212
so he'll touch the company's money.

104
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,351
A few weeks later, he'll be accused...

105
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,722
of opening the gambling den through his acquaintance.

106
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,693
And he'll be arrested at the scene.

107
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,432
She'll take the bait.

108
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:17,143
All her life, she's been a mere supporting character.

109
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:19,742
I am giving her a lead role.

110
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,362
Yes.

111
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:40,333
I deliberately misled them.

112
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:45,033
Even Han Moo Young is pulling his petty tricks. Why can't I do it?

113
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,802
Now, let me tell you the truth.

114
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:51,172
Not about Park Jong Gu.

115
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,472
I'll tell you what I was really after.

116
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:00,753
Na Sa and Mr. Han aren't picking up.

117
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:05,552
She made sure I wouldn't be at the auto shop.

118
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,352
There's definitely something else.

119
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:09,662
Was there anything you heard?

120
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:13,893
Hey, don't worry. The boys are still there, you know.

121
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:15,232
What's the use?

122
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:18,702
The equipment is disconnected, so we can't see the cards anymore.

123
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:21,842
Oh, my.

124
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,003
Thank you.

125
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:28,042
Let's change it up a little.

126
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:29,912
Sure, let's do that.

127
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:33,082
- How about we play Sutda? - Sounds good.

128
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,192
Attorney Han Moo Young?

129
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:42,822
Mr. Ko Yo Han?

130
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:44,862
Officer Ko.

131
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:45,863
What are you doing here?

132
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:49,503
That is what I want to ask.

133
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:53,733
What is a lawyer doing here?

134
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:56,442
Edit the footage so Park Jong Gu is clearly visible.

135
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,613
What happened?

136
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:00,412
Where's Mr. Han?

137
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:06,113
I asked you what happened.

138
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:13,023
The police came.

139
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:14,623
Then how did you...

140
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:19,432
You called the cops, didn't you?

141
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:22,802
Why is it...

142
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,733
that you're always seen...

143
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,003
with the ex-cons in this area, Mr. Han?

144
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,042
Officer Ko, it's...

145
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:37,642
May we help you? This is private property.

146
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:39,911
We received a call about a private gambling den here.

147
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:40,952
Where?

148
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:42,783
In the basement.

149
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,092
- Who called it in? - Are you the owner?

150
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,922
I'm his attorney.

151
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,392
You're mistaken.

152
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:51,863
There's no basement here.

153
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:55,103
Well, we shall search the place and find out if that's the case.

154
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,202
May we check your IDs? Both of you.

155
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,072
Gosh, no way.

156
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:07,342
The boys are there too. And what about Na Sa?

157
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,383
- We're back. - Hi.

158
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:17,682
You guys...

159
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:21,023
Oh, sorry it took us a while. We went to grab some food.

160
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:24,363
Well, you guys left because you were done with all the setup.

161
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:27,892
But why are you here?

162
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:29,701
We were told someone else would play in his place.

163
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,431
That's why we ate together.

164
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:32,801
What? Who?

165
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:36,373
Oh. Mr. Han said so.

166
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:37,503
What?

167
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:46,312
What on earth is happening?

168
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:50,623
Then who's that?

169
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,792
No idea.

170
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:02,133
Hold it. Let me do it.

171
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:04,003
Sure, go for it.

172
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:11,742
Don't you feel hot?

173
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,342
Mr. Ko, what brings you here?

174
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:19,582
You said you were his attorney. Shouldn't you know why I'm here?

175
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:22,322
I'm Su Ho's probation officer.

176
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,123
You know that your client is an ex-con, right?

177
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:31,493
Was it around this time last year?

178
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,792
Yes, it's been about a year.

179
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:37,201
He was arrested red-handed for habitual gambling...

180
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:38,903
based on Article 246 of the Penal Code.

181
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,273
And he was sentenced to two years of probation.

182
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:44,302
However...

183
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:49,441
I didn't hear from him at all for about a month,

184
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,681
and he ignored all my calls and texts.

185
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:54,512
Only loan sharks were seen visiting this auto shop.

186
00:12:54,513 --> 00:12:56,783
It's been closed for a long time.

187
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,752
Then I received a call that somebody opened...

188
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:03,392
a private gambling den at this auto shop,

189
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:07,033
so I came here with the local patrol team.

190
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,123
Are you sure there's no basement here?

191
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,042
And you really didn't gamble?

192
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:23,912
Then why did you hire a lawyer?

193
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,712
I was giving him advice on some legal matters.

194
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:29,483
But it's so dark out here.

195
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:33,322
You were doing a consultation with no lights?

196
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:37,922
There is no basement here.

197
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,162
May we search the place?

198
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:42,802
Sure.

199
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:47,932
Su Ho.

200
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:49,643
Can you not talk?

201
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:51,442
Well...

202
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:31,643
Hey.

203
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,422
He's winning.

204
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,853
He keeps on winning.

205
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:47,332
You're right.

206
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,603
But he wasn't winning earlier.

207
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:17,692
I'm sorry about that.

208
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:21,091
I finally got one.

209
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,133
Wait.

210
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:32,773
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,912
Hold on.

212
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:40,113
Are you swindling me?

213
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,452
(Attorney, Defendant)

214
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:01,603
Who is that?

215
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:05,712
Who is that punk?

216
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,342
You haven't caught sight of gambling,

217
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:10,942
nor are you justified to make an arrest without a warrant.

218
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:13,451
You've already damaged the property,

219
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:15,492
and you've searched the place for over ten minutes.

220
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:17,552
Do you need more time?

221
00:16:18,123 --> 00:16:19,792
Not time. We need evidence.

222
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:22,922
What's that?

223
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:33,973
What is that down there?

224
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:45,412
I'll tell you why you got such a call.

225
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:48,452
Do you know anything?

226
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,883
I'll tell you where the real gambling house is.

227
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:53,653
Where is it?

228
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:57,162
Mr. Na Su Ho has nothing to do with the gambling house.

229
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:00,369
We must arrest an illegal gambler caught in the act by the law.

230
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:02,702
If we can arrest the offender from your tip,

231
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,462
you'll be an informant,

232
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:07,572
given that we're able to arrest the offender this instant.

233
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:10,841
Enter the convenience store at the Janggubeol Intersection,

234
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:14,012
you'll find an underground passage connected...

235
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:16,013
to Hansiso Village Building A below their storage.

236
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,812
That's the house that Mr. Na found.

237
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:20,513
And I found out about it.

238
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:23,081
I don't know who tipped you off today,

239
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:24,562
but it must have been to get revenge.

240
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:29,863
This is Patrol 12 of Dolma Patrol Division.

241
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:31,362
We have information...

242
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:33,932
of convention gambling at an illegally remodelled building.

243
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:36,232
You'll find the entrance at Janggubeol Intersection...

244
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,561
Considering they have an underground passage,

245
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:38,562
it must be a huge case.

246
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,943
We'll have to bring you in for a witness interview.

247
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,273
Hansiso Village Building A...

248
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,113
We might need backup.

249
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:48,913
Please alert other stations nearby.

250
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:51,612
Darn it.

251
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:55,453
Is it done?

252
00:17:57,622 --> 00:17:58,693
Hello?

253
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:00,392
It's over.

254
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,663
He took all the betting money.

255
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,592
I'll call you back.

256
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:20,642
They've found the secret passage.

257
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:23,542
One of our men will call you for a witness interview.

258
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:25,081
You may come alone...

259
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:26,612
or with an attorney.

260
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:30,723
This is Patrol 12.

261
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:33,253
We're leaving Dolma 2-80.

262
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:34,993
We'll see you back at the station.

263
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:45,362
Anything else you want to ask?

264
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:48,572
This may seem like a strange coincidence,

265
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,072
but there's one more person on probation...

266
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:55,342
between you and me other than Mr. Na.

267
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,953
Well, she's a client of yours, isn't she?

268
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:03,821
I would look past it thinking it's a small world,

269
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:05,023
but my job...

270
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:07,552
makes me curious.

271
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:12,693
How are Na Su Ho and Lee Ro Um related?

272
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:15,332
I wonder.

273
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:18,362
I'll see you again...

274
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,173
at an unfamiliar place.

275
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:39,292
(Attorney Han Moo Young)

276
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:45,862
We need to talk.

277
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,003
I'll go to your place tomorrow morning.

278
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:00,572
Thank you for that.

279
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,713
Anything for you, Mr. Han.

280
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:59,003
(Seoyoung Studio)

281
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:15,283
I've thought all night...

282
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,983
about what you wanted.

283
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:20,792
Pushing away a lawyer who gets on your nerves,

284
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:24,062
or testing that lawyer?

285
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:27,791
Now that I've wrapped things up,

286
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,362
have I passed your test?

287
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,673
Or was I just too dull?

288
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:36,173
Perhaps you were simply trying to get rid of me.

289
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:42,713
You like the truth.

290
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:45,082
I merely showed you that.

291
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:47,652
This line of work isn't for a lawyer.

292
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:50,082
I told you that I had an illness.

293
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:52,652
I'm not a regular lawyer.

294
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:54,622
I'm a terrible one.

295
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:27,892
Ms. Lee Ro Um?

296
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,723
- That's me. - What's going on?

297
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:33,733
You're arrested without a warrant for inciting murder.

298
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:35,463
Just a moment.

299
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:37,602
Inciting murder on who?

300
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:39,871
Mr. Ye Chung Sik was...

301
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,102
murdered in prison last night.

302
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:44,341
And the perpetrator confessed that he was ordered...

303
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:45,712
by Ms. Lee.

304
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:46,842
Please step away.

305
00:22:47,072 --> 00:22:48,513
Mr. Ye Chung Sik is dead?

306
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,243
We'll talk details at the station.

307
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:55,352
What are your grounds other than his confession?

308
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:58,223
Who are you?

309
00:22:58,683 --> 00:22:59,993
I'm Ms. Lee's attorney.

310
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:02,923
Then, you must be aware of obstruction of justice.

311
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:06,962
Lee Ro Um is arrested for inciting murder.

312
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:09,202
According to Article 200 of the Criminal Procedure Act,

313
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:12,162
we have the right to detain her for up to 48 hours.

314
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:14,301
- What's the time of arrest? - It's 8:28am.

315
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:16,801
The time is 8:28am. I notified you of the exact time.

316
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:17,902
You're under arrest.

317
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,913
You have the right to an attorney,

318
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:23,112
but you seem to know that.

319
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:24,782
You have the right to remain silent,

320
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:25,912
and you have the right to request a review...

321
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:27,113
of the legality of the arrest.

322
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:31,783
If Ms. Lee asks for a lawyer,

323
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:35,523
we will give you a call immediately.

324
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:38,292
Take her away.

325
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:06,954
It happened last night.

326
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:12,994
The killer used a sharpened toothbrush.

327
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,233
Confession or not, with all the witnesses,

328
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:21,694
I don't think he even cared.

329
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:24,964
As soon as he was arrested, he gave up Lee Ro Um.

330
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:26,733
He said he could prove...

331
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:29,804
how she ordered the kill if he were allowed to see her.

332
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:37,783
If it were a contract killing, why would he give up his client...

333
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:38,984
as soon as he was arrested?

334
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,053
I think they'll grant his wish.

335
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,585
They'll be cross-examined tomorrow.

336
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:49,764
To be honest, I didn't think Lee Ro Um would live a quiet life.

337
00:24:50,264 --> 00:24:53,565
What I didn't expect was your appearance.

338
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,135
Weren't you done since the damage suit was dropped?

339
00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:03,744
Why are you still defending her?

340
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:08,075
Is it that weird for a lawyer to defend a client?

341
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:11,415
You don't know what Lee Ro Um is like.

342
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:16,625
Doesn't that go for you as well?

343
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:23,825
I'll be in touch.

344
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:41,714
Na Sa.

345
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,544
Don't talk to me.

346
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:45,815
Let it go.

347
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:48,915
I said don't talk to me.

348
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:52,155
I really didn't say anything.

349
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,224
Then I guess it was Da Jung.

350
00:25:56,964 --> 00:26:00,635
How was I to know Jang Kyung Ja was still funding you?

351
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:02,165
Darn it.

352
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:06,504
It was just business, okay?

353
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:09,405
Didn't you spend her money too?

354
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:11,074
We provide our skills,

355
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:12,773
and they pay us accordingly!

356
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:15,014
Ro Um got paid as well!

357
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:18,345
Darn it. I've had enough.

358
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,983
Who does Ro Um think she is?

359
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:22,685
Why is she so selfish?

360
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:26,523
Let's be honest. We've been a gang for ten years.

361
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:28,793
Did she ever respect us?

362
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:32,194
Did she ever share with us what she was thinking?

363
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:33,794
Forget it.

364
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:37,203
We shouldn't have listened to her in the first place.

365
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:39,174
You know how freaky she is.

366
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:40,905
She always was, even as a kid.

367
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:43,973
And then she was in prison for ten years.

368
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:45,773
I bet she came out even worse than before.

369
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:47,944
Isn't that why she did something like this?

370
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:52,314
You two should consider parting ways with her for good.

371
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:54,983
Whatever the reason, Ro Um was going to...

372
00:26:54,984 --> 00:26:56,585
let me go down, and that's a fact!

373
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:58,154
Darn it.

374
00:26:58,155 --> 00:27:01,095
And all because I spent some money?

375
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,895
How could she do this to me?

376
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,665
We did worse.

377
00:27:09,264 --> 00:27:11,635
We betrayed her first.

(Attorney Han Moo Young)

379
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:29,753
Hello, Mr. Han.

380
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:31,954
(Dajung Comic Books)

381
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:41,635
Come in.

382
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:58,415
Not long ago, I visited Ye Chung Sik.

383
00:27:58,845 --> 00:27:59,953
What did he say?

384
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:03,085
He didn't seem to know how he was arrested.

385
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:07,155
He said he made a deal with Jeokmok and was betrayed.

386
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:09,095
We got him arrested.

387
00:28:09,994 --> 00:28:12,264
He struck up a deal to get paid in prison,

388
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,234
but there's no way Jeokmok would do what he wants.

389
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,964
He'll have felt utterly cornered once the payments stopped.

390
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:21,234
He'll have thought he might get offed,

391
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:22,435
and he was right.

392
00:28:25,274 --> 00:28:27,943
Hong Chang Ki. Before Jeokmok went bankrupt,

393
00:28:27,944 --> 00:28:29,815
he was the director's chauffeur.

394
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:32,115
He lost everything in the stock market...

395
00:28:32,214 --> 00:28:34,355
and vanished after defaulting on his loans.

396
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:36,684
He was arrested for fraud in 2021...

397
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:38,405
and was in prison for a little over a year.

398
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:42,723
- He's a ghost. - A "ghost?"

399
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:44,964
That's what Jeokmok calls their disposable workers.

400
00:28:45,194 --> 00:28:47,835
They pick people who have hit rock bottom.

401
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,034
Their known weaknesses make them easy to manipulate.

402
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,065
Having nothing to lose makes them bold,

403
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,704
and more than anything, they're easily swayed by money.

404
00:28:56,474 --> 00:28:58,304
Like in the Geumseong murders?

405
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,315
Yes, like that.

406
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:03,914
How do you think they got Ro Um involved?

407
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:06,115
An Chae Hong was Jeokmok's director.

408
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,714
People think he committed suicide,

409
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:11,223
but Ro Um thinks he was murdered...

410
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:12,724
for knowing the chairman's identity.

411
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,553
That's why they hired Hong Chang Ki who used to...

412
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,024
work for An Chae Hong.

413
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:19,895
They could say his payment was from her to kill Ye Chung Sik.

414
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:22,234
Is the chairman behind this too?

415
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:25,303
How do you know that?

416
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,734
Ye Chung Sik said...

417
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:30,105
the chairman called that day.

418
00:29:32,274 --> 00:29:35,514
Why did Ro Um's parents have to die?

419
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:39,784
Her parents...

420
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:42,784
found her again after ten years.

421
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:04,105
I sent letters...

422
00:30:05,974 --> 00:30:08,244
and did all I could.

423
00:30:11,885 --> 00:30:13,185
Did you get the letters?

424
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,694
I didn't think I could speak,

425
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,634
so I wrote everything down.

426
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:27,595
We were told...

427
00:30:28,635 --> 00:30:30,435
you didn't want to see us.

428
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:33,405
And we believed it.

429
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:38,675
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:44,514 --> 00:30:45,645
Not long...

431
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:48,415
after you left,

432
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:54,254
I couldn't eat or sleep.

433
00:30:57,694 --> 00:30:59,854
The foundation said they couldn't let you come back...

434
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:02,095
because you'd been given a scholarship.

435
00:31:04,835 --> 00:31:06,405
Your dad was sick,

436
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,744
and our debt kept building up.

437
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:13,514
To be honest,

438
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,784
I thought...

439
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:21,385
you'd be doing fine.

440
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:26,254
You were so sweet and clever.

441
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,565
We thought you'd be much better off...

442
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,194
than living with us.

443
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:43,704
We're sorry.

444
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:51,385
It'll sound like an excuse,

445
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:54,254
and I shouldn't say this but...

446
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:09,135
Let's...

447
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:11,565
go back.

448
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:18,605
Come home.

449
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,584
(Don't skip meals and stay healthy.)

450
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:32,784
(It's the same. Our house is the same.)

451
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:51,774
Ro Um was going to go back to her parents.

452
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,345
That's all.

453
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:02,085
Ye Chung Sik said...

454
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:06,554
to his cellmates before he died...

455
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:12,165
that he's a stand-in and the real killer is out there.

456
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:16,533
You paid Hong Chang Ki.

457
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:17,704
What kind of game...

458
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,774
were you playing with the two?

459
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,744
I knew you'd end up in here,

460
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:29,915
being the psychopath you are.

461
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:34,654
My supervisor arrested you ten years ago...

462
00:33:34,655 --> 00:33:36,054
and got you to confess.

463
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,454
You sly girl. We thought you'd rot in prison.

464
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:44,895
Who knew this would happen ten years later?

465
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:51,003
I bet you lost it when Ye Chung Sik said...

466
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:52,835
he'd confess that he didn't actually do it.

467
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:57,604
That's why you ordered Hong Chang Ki to kill him.

468
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:00,645
You must've paid him and used your smart brain to threaten him.

469
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,284
I remember now.

470
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:10,685
I was interrogated just like this ten years ago.

471
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:15,395
What do you mean?

472
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,694
It was so obvious that he was strictly following orders,

473
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:24,065
like an obedient dog. I'm talking about your supervisor.

474
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:26,775
You little...

475
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:28,235
How dare you.

476
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:32,404
Watch what you say, okay?

477
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:35,674
I want my lawyer here.

478
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:39,485

That's Ms. Lee's bag.

484

I told you.

485
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:27,744
I must make sure she never goes anywhere near muddy mires.

486
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:31,834
Shouldn't you first find out if she walked in there of her own accord?

487
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:33,475
I'm sorry, but is her trial already over?

488
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,875
From what I know, she was arrested today.

489

Well, I'm sorry.

491
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:43,815
To me, she's a criminal.

492

Just like the other 100 ex-cons that have been assigned to me.

525

then you'll be considered her accomplice.

526

545
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:57,275
(8 hours after her arrest)

546
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:07,315
Did you read this?

547
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:09,554
No, I did not.

548
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:14,535
(Wolgye Environmental Development, revolver, leave in the golf bag)

549
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:17,585
You must've been waiting for my answer.

550
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,364
So what was I really after?

551
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:22,594
Just so you know, the deal with Sim Kyung Hwa is done.

552
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,704
He escaped arrest thanks to Han Moo Young.

553
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:27,274
But there's still evidence...

554
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:29,395
that Park Jong Gu gambled and committed embezzlement.

555
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:32,473
Han Moo Young thought...

556
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:35,645
I planned this to take him out.

557
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:38,984
So did Na Sa, who had been getting money...

558
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,585
from Jang Kyung Ja.

559
00:39:42,054 --> 00:39:45,685

landed an evidence disposal deal with police precincts...

Who will use this?

567
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:31,704
Ro Um.

568
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:35,904
Ro Um will use this?

569
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:37,744
Why?

570
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,775
You've gotten quite chatty.

571
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,344
I can't even ask?

572
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,145
I'll need a few more days to change the serial number.

573
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:49,085
No need. Just leave it.

574
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:51,424
Don't change the number.

575
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:54,494
But you said this was for Ro Um.

576
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,065
Na Su Ho.

577
00:40:58,424 --> 00:40:59,764
Who's your boss?

578
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:05,065
Whoever pays me.

579
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,375
So it's not Ro Um.

580
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:16,174

581
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,025

584
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,335
If Han Moo Young delivered it successfully,

585
00:41:38,534 --> 00:41:42,275

698

699
00:50:16,206 --> 00:50:18,175
and gave him the murder weapon that you stashed.

709
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:39,525
Why would you be intimidated by him?

710

He's just a middle-aged man with a pot belly.

711
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:43,734
Why did a clever girl like you...

712
00:50:43,735 --> 00:50:45,665
confess to a crime...

713
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:47,706
that you didn't even commit back then?

714

715
00:50:53,276 --> 00:50:54,746

722
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:18,965

00:51:34,285 --> 00:51:35,515
She'll be released tomorrow.

729
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:41,726
Someone went through her studio apartment.

730
00:51:42,296 --> 00:51:43,456
It must have been the police.

731
00:51:44,765 --> 00:51:46,566
I moved her stuff before that.

732
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:50,265
So, that's why I couldn't find the bag.

733
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:54,776
Moo Young.

734
00:51:55,936 --> 00:51:56,936
Yes?

735
00:51:57,106 --> 00:51:58,745
Why do you think we regrouped...

736
00:51:58,746 --> 00:52:00,776
when we've all become a mess?

737
00:52:02,046 --> 00:52:04,115
We've always wanted to run.

738
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:06,046
Always.

739
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,285
We were just not brave enough.

740
00:52:10,316 --> 00:52:11,424
It's funny.

741
00:52:11,425 --> 00:52:13,125
Ro Um had never thought of escaping,

742
00:52:13,126 --> 00:52:15,996
and she was the first one to leave Jeokmok,

743
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:19,195
not one of us, who always wanted to run.

744
00:52:20,425 --> 00:52:21,695
Did I tell you?

745
00:52:22,396 --> 00:52:25,235
That I owe my life to Ro Um.

746
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:04,035
If you're going to kill him, make it quick.

747
00:53:04,706 --> 00:53:06,746
Don't torture him by dragging it on.

748
00:53:10,776 --> 00:53:11,885
I need him.

749
00:53:12,285 --> 00:53:13,885
So quit ruining him.

750
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:17,726
Tell the president.

751
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:19,825
If you hurt him anymore,

752
00:53:20,956 --> 00:53:22,296
I can't work either.

753
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:27,296
The Geumseong murders.

754
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:30,566
Da Jung and Na Sa took part in it,

755
00:53:30,735 --> 00:53:32,166
and I ran away.

756
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:36,105
Da Jung and Na Sa could say they were doing as they were told,

757
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:37,276
but not me.

758
00:53:39,106 --> 00:53:41,276
Ro Um knew she was putting herself in danger,

759
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:43,646
but she saved me first.

760
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:46,246
She saved me, and I...

761
00:53:47,246 --> 00:53:48,785
I betrayed her.

762
00:53:52,226 --> 00:53:54,725
That's why I serve her loyally,

763
00:53:54,726 --> 00:53:57,195
with all my life, until I make up for it.

764
00:53:58,226 --> 00:54:00,936
But that's just the situation I'm in.

765
00:54:01,465 --> 00:54:04,195
When Ro Um called the cops during the last operation,

766
00:54:04,765 --> 00:54:07,336
if things went as planned, lots of people would've gotten hurt.

767
00:54:07,905 --> 00:54:10,705
No one knows what Ro Um's thinking...

768
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,146
or can control her.

769
00:54:17,615 --> 00:54:18,646
Moo Young.

770
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:23,115
Can I trust you?

771
00:54:25,385 --> 00:54:27,186
I just have to put this...

772
00:54:27,586 --> 00:54:29,526
in the bag Ro Um indicated.

773
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:33,095
Can I do that?

774
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,166
Yes.

775
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,336
Do it.

776
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:46,305
Thank you.

777
00:55:09,896 --> 00:55:11,706
Since Ro Um chose her family,

778
00:55:13,836 --> 00:55:16,175
the president played a game with her.

779
00:55:17,006 --> 00:55:19,006
(Unknown number: Welcome back.)

780
00:55:27,515 --> 00:55:29,015
(Statement)

781
00:55:48,336 --> 00:55:50,936
(Bar Association)

782
00:56:17,695 --> 00:56:19,706
(Moran Dongbu Police Station)

783
00:56:24,675 --> 00:56:27,506
(Released)

784
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:19,796
Hello.

785
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:23,465
That's mine.

786
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:26,566
No.

787
00:57:26,936 --> 00:57:28,206
It's what you stole.

788
00:57:30,805 --> 00:57:31,845
Hand it over.

789
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:33,305
I understand.

790
00:57:35,046 --> 00:57:36,175
You understand?

791
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:38,316
I do understand.

792
00:57:44,526 --> 00:57:45,526
You?

793
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:52,425
Yes, me.

794
00:57:58,006 --> 00:57:59,035
Three months.

795
00:58:00,805 --> 00:58:02,635
Trust me for three months.

796
00:58:04,575 --> 00:58:06,675
Because for three months, I'm not a lawyer.

797
00:58:11,215 --> 00:58:12,246
Ro Um.

798
00:58:14,956 --> 00:58:16,316
He's Han Jae Seok's son.

799
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:20,526
When we were 14, we bankrupted...

800
00:58:23,396 --> 00:58:25,526
Moyang Foods, Han Jae Seok's company.

801
00:59:01,735 --> 00:59:02,865
Han Moo Young...

802
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:05,166
is his son.

803
00:59:19,215 --> 00:59:21,715
I'll bring down Jeokmok.

804
00:59:23,985 --> 00:59:25,385
And to do that, first,

805
00:59:26,655 --> 00:59:27,996
I'll go after Jang Kyung Ja.

806
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,066
Fine.

807
00:59:33,965 --> 00:59:35,896
Let's commit fraud together.

808
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:48,376
(Delightfully Deceitful)

809
01:00:07,425 --> 01:00:09,296
You'll let Mr. Han in?

810
01:00:09,865 --> 01:00:12,305
Use me. I'm using you too.

811
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:14,705
I got suspended...

812
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:15,875
because of you, Ro Um.

813
01:00:15,876 --> 01:00:16,936
Did you know...

814
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:19,175
they're all a gang?

815
01:00:19,476 --> 01:00:23,046
They received scholarships from the same foundation.

816
01:00:23,316 --> 01:00:24,345
What are you doing?

817
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:26,285
Long time no see.

818
01:00:26,715 --> 01:00:28,285
I've wanted to ask you...

819
01:00:28,485 --> 01:00:30,186
the truth about Jeokmok.

820
01:00:30,485 --> 01:00:33,186
The president's identity is in there.
