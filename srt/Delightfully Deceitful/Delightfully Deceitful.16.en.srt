1
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:52,605
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:54,405
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:57,176 --> 00:00:58,575
(I'll go back to where I belong.)

4
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:07,416
Do you mean this?

5
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:10,155
I do.

6
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:12,385
Why did you change your mind?

7
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,155
Let's talk in person.

8
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:15,995
Where are you?

9
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,065
I'm on the run, so I'm on the move.

10
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:19,696
I'll send a car.

11
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:21,666
You're alone, aren't you?

12
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:23,935
Are you?

13
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:25,535
Will you come alone?

14
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:28,306
I'll text you.

15
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,516
(Locker Service)

16
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,854
(Women)

17
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:46,185
The camera footage was programmed to be deleted.

18
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:48,196
Was that your doing?

19
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,525
Yes.

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,665
Did you give Lee Ro Um a pass?

21
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,195
Yes.

22
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:56,636
Na Su Ho. Was he in on it too?

23
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:58,365
Yes.

24
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:02,906
You could go away for this. Do you know that?

25
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:05,175
Yes.

26
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,106
What about Han Moo Young?

27
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:09,615
He called you both here.

28
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:12,915
You called us both in.

29
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:17,485
We will...

30
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:20,156
search your and Na's residences and seize all we can.

31
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:22,025
We'll check your phones too.

32
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:26,025
Don't smash your way in.

33
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:28,895
Unlock the door with this.

34
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:30,995
At the end of the hall past the toilet,

35
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:32,936
you'll find a padlocked circuit breaker.

36
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,606
Unlock that with this.

37
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:37,136
Then flip the lever on the far left.

38
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,346
That will get you into my workroom.

39
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:42,145
You'll have to see it.

40
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:56,455
The papers you gave me are the complete version...

41
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,166
of what we found on Ji Seung Don.

42
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:01,935
As we thought, it's the details of how Navis was laundering money.

43
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:05,565
The company doing the deed...

44
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,566
is Roman and Bay, a law firm in Panama.

45
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:10,375
Their primary bank is B Bank in the Netherlands.

46
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:20,046
I found the banker in charge of the president's funds.

47
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:21,316
Kevin Ju.

48
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:22,915
He's Korean-American,

49
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,625
and he manages the accounts that are in Ji Seung Don's name.

50
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,835
Ji Seung Don has five accounts.

51
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,266
Three business and two personal accounts.

52
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:39,635
Over 700 million dollars went through...

53
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,506
these accounts in the past three years.

54
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:48,075
As you see, all that money...

55
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:50,675
ends up in one encoded account.

56
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,786
Everything you see,

57
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:59,125
the prosecutors will find when they search my place.

58
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:31,385
Info on Navis Well-being...

59
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:33,886
we got from Jang Kyung Ja's phone is in the Gray box.

60
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,195
Roman and Bay's money-laundering...

61
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:38,025
we tracked through that is in the blue box.

62
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,364
Details on B Bank...

63
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,465
and Kevin Ju are in the black box.

64
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,335
Details on Jeokmok, the red box.

65
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,305
Everything on Ji Seung Don, the white box.

66
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:03,616
All five money-laundering accounts are in Ji Seung Don's name.

67
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:07,255
Everything that's laundered ends up in a secret account...

68
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,095
called F55.

69
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:12,094
There's no way to find out who holds a secret account.

70
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,795
Someone else holds the special drawing rights to Ji's accounts.

71
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,835
And you're saying that's Jay?

72
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:20,665
Yes.

73
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,206
Where's the proof of that?

74
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,376
Is that at your store too?

75
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,376
As Jung Da Jung said,

76
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:32,414
it's information on money laundering.

77
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,816
Based on the statements,

78
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,056
the biggest deposit they made in a month is over 200 million.

79
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:41,426
We have enough to officially ask for account details.

80
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,895
Then we'll only get Ji Seung Don.

81
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,465
Or they could close all accounts by then.

82
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,035
You said...

83
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:56,505
we should find proof that points to the president...

84
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,035
or a weapon to bargain with.

85
00:05:58,605 --> 00:05:59,876
I'm sorry this is it.

86
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,576
I won't lie about you forcing me.

87
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:05,715
I did it because I wanted to, so this is about us.

88
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:08,915
Put an end to it and come back safely.

89
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:10,915
I'll wait, Ro Um.

90
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:20,966
(497 Nambu-ro 15-Gil, Seocheon-Gu, Seoul)

91
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,335
(497 Nambu-ro 15-Gil, Seocheon-Gu, Seoul)

92
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,975
If it's me the president wants...

93
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,446
We do have some kind of weapon.

94
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:38,386
It's not bad.

95
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,516
I just have to risk my life.

96
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,866
I thought you'd stop me from going alone.

97
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:41,506
This is something you should put an end yourself.

98
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:43,716
Something you can do and no one else can.

99
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:13,206
Ro Um will meet Jay and get it herself.

100
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:15,844
The evidence that Jay owns the account.

101
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:16,876
What if she can't?

102
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:20,284
Ms. Lee is still suspected of murdering Jang Kyung Ja.

103
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,414
Besides, she's run off despite the arrest warrant.

104
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,485
Do you know what this could cause?

105
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,985
What can Ms. Lee do?

106
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,196
The chances are really low that things will go as planned.

107
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,315
You shouldn't do something this reckless...

108
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:34,126
for that scarce possibility.

109
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:37,335
If there had been another choice, we would've taken it.

110
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,834
If Ro Um fails like you expect,

111
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:40,965
it will be over for us.

112
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:44,676
I wish the timing won't go off...

113
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:47,075
I wish this will work no matter how tough it is...

114
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:50,316
so that you can arrest her safely.

115
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:54,215
So when she sends a signal,

116
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:56,116
please be there in time.

117
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:01,725
Keep sharing this location with the police.

118
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:03,395
Where are you going?

119
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,465
I need to go myself.

120
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,046
Don't go anywhere, and stand by here.

121
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:08,266
Stand by?

122
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:11,965
Keep monitoring it as you leave footage.

123
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,066
What...

124
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:08,255
How did you escape?

125
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,805
Check news reports when the morning comes.

126
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:15,196
I prepared flight tickets, but I guess we won't get to ride it.

127
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,196
You were to be released if you waited a little.

128
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,906
Why were you so rushed?

129
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,475
You mean, after you kill all the others.

130
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:26,446
When did you grow so attached to them?

131
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:30,146
You relied only on me in Jeokmok.

132
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:32,146
And I paid the price for it.

133
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,556
I don't understand.

134
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:39,625
You're still hung up on your parents.

135
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,354
Blood relationships mean nothing, Ro Um.

136
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,125
It's not something you chose.

137
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:46,665
You depended and trusted me...

138
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,265
more than your family.

139
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:50,296
Just as I chose you.

140
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,906
This is what really matters.

141
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,406
What exactly do you want from me?

142
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:58,806
Replace Jang Kyung Ja?

143
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:01,975
It's totally different.

144
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:04,446
You'll come to understand soon.

145
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,446
Where are we going?

146
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:09,755
First, Hong Kong.

147
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:11,786
When are we departing?

148
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:14,156
I'm looking for a way to go there by ship.

149
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,865
Then we'll have time to settle.

150
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:27,964
You paid me before I left ten years ago.

151
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:29,835
Do you need money? How much?

152
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,776
How much did you make through Navis Well-being?

153
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:35,416
News reports estimate it to be a billion dollars.

154
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,276
What will you do with it?

155
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:40,645
I'm going to give it back to who originally owned it.

156
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:42,686
- Why? - Because I saw...

157
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:44,786
the victims.

158
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,926
Is this some sense of justice?

159
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,926
I opened Jang Kyung Ja's safe.

160
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:59,765
F55, the documents about your secret bank account.

161
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:02,505
The evidence to prove that you own it.

162
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:06,806
Those were in Ms. Jang's safe?

163
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:09,946
You don't know what was in it.

164
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:12,385
She told me everything.

165
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,585
It had nothing about the secret account.

166
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,615
Is that why you killed her?

167
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:18,316
Because you believed her?

168
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,656
She's gone now.

169
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:23,595
I'm the only one who knows what was in it.

170
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:29,465
If you got it, why did you come all the way here?

171
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,406
I'm here to bargain with someone who'd buy it at the highest price.

172
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:39,206
Around 300 million was deposited under Ji Seung Don's name, right?

173
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:43,176
Consider it an advance and wire the money.

174
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,816
Those documents are managed offline,

175
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:52,926
so Ms. Jang had no access.

176
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:55,495
You think...

177
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:59,625
she collected them all alone?

178
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:01,965
Figures.

179
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:05,135
You never even checked her phone.

180
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,835
Meanwhile, I remember your last text messages.

181
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:14,406
Why suggest a trip to Sapporo when you were going to kill her?

182
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:20,146
What? Are you finally sensing all this is possible?

183
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,114
Wire the money,

184
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:27,255
or do nothing and get arrested with me.

185
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:29,625
It's up to you.

186
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:32,265
Aren't you excited?

187
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:34,865
You like making choices.

188
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:43,605
The account number is N-1-7-8-B-A-N-K-0-9-1-0-3-1-3-1-7.

189
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,105
Let's start with this.

190
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,206
Around 130 million will do.

191
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:50,416
I'll give you the second number in five minutes.

192
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:56,156
It's a piece of cake to mobilize the men.

193
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:59,426
It's a faraway country. How will you arrive in five minutes?

194
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:06,365
I guess you still won't believe it unless you see it...

195
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:07,926
for yourself.

196
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,696
I trust Da Jung, you know.

197
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,384
(Contacts)

198
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:30,615
(Kevin Ju)

199
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:41,796
I couldn't find any documents that had his name on them.

200
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,205
What's important is, only one has been registered...

201
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,036
to access these accounts online.

202
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:04,786
I believe it's Jay's phone which has been off all along.

203
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:08,624
Once his phone turns on,

204
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,526
I'll get the IP and MAC addresses through the Telecom service.

205
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,925
If those match,

206
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:15,766
an alarm will go off at the comic books place.

207
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,835
It says a match, right?

208
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:26,906
Yes.

209
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:28,576
(Prosecutor Ryu Jae Hyuk)

210
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,745
Yes, it's as Ms. Jung said.

211
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:35,146
Lee Jay owns the account.

212
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,855
No, at least it's enough to arrest him.

213
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:55,306
You...

214
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:59,146
needed my access history?

215
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:10,786
Let me tell you why you're obsessed with me.

216
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:13,985
You know what your nature is.

217
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:15,685
What, the world abandoned you?

218
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,895
Some people empathized with even the likes of me.

219
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,265
I'm sure some did with you too.

220
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:24,436
They must've approached and helped you with good intentions.

221
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,665
You probably took that for granted,

222
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,276
took away their everything, and threw them out.

223
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:31,806
That's what you are like.

224
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,375
You isolate yourself and fall behind.

225
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:37,344
Violence or money is your only means to deal with people.

226
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:39,686
Every moment, you're scared and suspicious...

227
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:41,816
in case someone takes away what you have from you.

228
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,885
I'm like you? Am I?

229
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,156
It was your wishful thinking.

230
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:50,655
Because you needed at least one more of someone like you...

231
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:53,195
so you'd seem less hopeless and pathetic.

232
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:55,635
So what?

233
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,065
I'm not like you, you piece of trash!

234
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,465
I was wrong about you?

235
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:03,206
Is that right?

236
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:04,875
For that long?

237
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,505
It doesn't matter.

238
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:10,046
I know you're a great actor.

239
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,345
Act like somebody else and smile.

240
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:15,615
You can keep doing that from now on for me.

241
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:20,255
Da Jung, Na Sa, and Ring Go, and their families.

242
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:23,326
I'll kill Moo Young and Jae Seok if I have to!

243
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,725
Until you realize where you stand,

244
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:29,864
and kneel before me,

245
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,865
and never even think of putting your head up!

246
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:35,265
I'll show them to you one by one.

247
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:39,046
When you lose your mind, I'll lock you up and watch.

248
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:42,646
If you die, I'll even take your ashes!

249
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,816
You can never get away from me.

250
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,085
Kill me.

251
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:51,285
That will make things way easier.

252
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,255
Ro Um has been arrested.

253
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:43,065
Does that mean...

254
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,565
that she's alive?

255
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,166
Yes.

256
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:50,176
Jay was the one who got shot.

257
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,045
He's not dead, is he?

258
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:00,846
I mean,

259
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:04,186
Ro Um didn't commit murder, right?

260
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:10,755
Ro Um is still the suspect of Jang Kyung Ja's murder.

261
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,465
The one who shot him...

262
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,295
was her lawyer.

263
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:15,965
What?

264
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,336
(Police)

265
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:37,335
You have evidence that proves that Jay is the president, right?

266
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:38,785
Is that your concern right now?

267
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,325
What about Ro Um?

268
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:44,025
Worry about yourself.

269
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:46,765
She's fine.

270
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:02,916
Is it all over now?

271
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:04,715
It's a beginning.

272
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:06,715
That's true.

273
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:08,446
Thanks to you,

274
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:10,555
I have truckloads of issues to deal with.

275
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:13,796
It sounds like you should be celebrating.

276
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:15,995
It's a jackpot.

277
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:17,255
Gosh.

278
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,926
You're certainly outcome-oriented.

279
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:23,396
You said that you also wanted to change the outcome.

280
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,706
Now, it's your turn.

281
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:28,436
I'll leave it to you.

282
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,676
Because I never want to come back to this.

283
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:37,775
- Take her away. - Yes, sir.

284
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:40,346
Let's go.

285
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:44,514
These are the materials confiscated from Jung,

286
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:47,625
the accomplice to the escape from the Prosecutions' Service.

287
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:50,355
From a foundation established in the 1990s...

288
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:51,855
to the Navisgate,

289
00:21:51,856 --> 00:21:55,725
these files include the incidents of the past 20 years.

290
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:58,764
Your closest personal,

291
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:01,366
also known as the Messenger, Kim Seung Hyun.

292
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:03,676
And the anchor, Kevin Ju.

293
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:06,744
They've been arrested, and we got their warrants.

294
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,745
They both confessed.

295
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,475
And as you know,

296
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,785
you're the leader of Jeokmok...

297
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:15,586
and the owner of Navis Well-being.

298
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,215
Do you admit that you're the president?

299
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:24,754
It will be tiresome to lengthen the questioning.

300
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:27,495
You don't seem to be in the best condition either.

301
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,465
Will you not confess?

302
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:34,165
Fine.

303
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,206
Then,

304
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,175
let's begin with the murder of Ms. Jang Kyung Ja.

305
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:42,244
Han was caught in the act of using firearms...

306
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:44,445
to subdue Lee on the scene and was arrested.

307
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,885
He's currently being interrogated without detention...

308
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:48,761
for violating the Gun Control Act causing bodily harm.

309
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,386
Are you saying that you intended all of it?

310
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:53,784
Because I've seen...

311
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:55,856
what type of man Jay was and what he had done.

312
00:22:56,495 --> 00:22:58,096
I figured that I'd need a gun.

313
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:02,196
How did you know they were there?

314
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,835
I was the one who led Ro Um's escape.

315
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:08,336
I also helped her escape.

316
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:40,464
These are the past decisions...

317
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:42,335
of non-indictment by Prosecutor Choi.

318
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,376
Thanks.

319
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:47,044
I looked into it,

320
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:50,176
and he seemed to be the type to analyze the situation in detail.

321
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,685
Our case might be complicated,

322
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:55,744
but I reckoned it'd be better to tell him the exact circumstances.

323
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:56,784
In the standard fashion.

324
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:58,215
During the trial, Moo Young...

325
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:03,856
Let's get the written opinion done.

326
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:07,126
Hey.

327
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:12,606
I think they're having a hard time due to lack of evidence.

328
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:14,711
The security footage has been deleted as well.

329
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:16,176
But he was caught red-handed.

330
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:18,074
I'm sure they'll connect him to helping the escape.

331
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:21,045
They'll indict him for conspiring with Ro Um.

332
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:24,175
But it's likely to be declined for lack of evidence,

333
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,457
so they'll try to get everything they can connect to her.

334
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,186
Here. The interrogation file.

335
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:31,656
I'll copy them.

336
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,196
Just tell them that I didn't do it.

337
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,025
You'll be at a disadvantage if you deny all of them.

338
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,535
They say that the Messenger talked.

339
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:46,106
Is that true?

340
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:50,405
Where's Baek Ho?

341
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,646
Do you know how much he got from this?

342
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:55,176
None of them can help you.

343
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:57,775
Nor will they run into you in the courtroom.

344
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:01,446
I had been building my credit for 20 years.

345
00:25:01,745 --> 00:25:04,092
And you want me to believe that no one will testify for me?

346
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:05,616
We can't claim innocence.

347
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:08,156
You must admit to a few crimes...

348
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:09,926
to get a reduced sentence.

349
00:25:10,696 --> 00:25:12,025
This is a tough situation.

350
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:14,565
So, make the situation easier.

351
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:17,436
That is why I'm paying you.

352
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:19,465
This trial is not the end.

353
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,635
I heard that you've replaced five attorneys.

354
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:25,005
But your charges are too extensive.

355
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:26,951
You must brace yourself for prolonged war.

356
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,545
You've decided to have faith in us,

357
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,376
so we need your trust.

358
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:32,075
"Trust?"

359
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:33,946
"Have faith?"

360
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:37,755
In you?

361
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,456
We'll lose in the trial.

362
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:45,225
But it was self-defence. You didn't even kill him.

363
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:47,876
I could be sentenced to three years just for carrying firearms.

364
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,065
It's more than enough to disbar me.

365
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:53,336
You knew that?

366
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,336
I did.

367
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:56,935
What were you thinking?

368
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:59,176
You were in danger. I didn't have the time to think.

369
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:04,146
Tell them that I had the gun.

370
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:05,975
And pin the blame on you?

371
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:08,215
When I had done it? Like a coward?

372
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,784
Or say that Jay dropped it.

373
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:13,156
Tell them it was his gun. It's not exactly false.

374
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,626
I did have it on me,

375
00:26:17,096 --> 00:26:18,225
so that'd be perjury.

376
00:26:19,696 --> 00:26:21,764
How are you so inflexible?

377
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:23,366
You let that gun go.

378
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,265
That's what kept Jay alive so that he could be punished by law.

379
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,406
This is worth it.

380
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:30,865
Otherwise, I'll be damaging the value...

381
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,946
of the hard-earned trial.

382
00:26:33,446 --> 00:26:35,406
So, you're just going to give up?

383
00:26:37,215 --> 00:26:39,176
My lawyer will write a statement.

384
00:26:39,715 --> 00:26:42,916
The prosecutor will read it and decide...

385
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,886
whether to prosecute me or not.

386
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:50,126
Is he a good lawyer?

387
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:58,065
Our firm is preparing to defend you in court.

388
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,706
You don't need to worry about it.

389
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:11,275
Hello.

390
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:15,785
Take your pick. You're hard at work.

391
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:17,656
Thank you.

392
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:22,896
- Let me... - Leave it.

393
00:27:23,356 --> 00:27:24,426
Thanks.

394
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:28,695
- Thank you. - It's nothing.

395
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:31,095
Oh, the lawyer you're prosecuting.

396
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:33,004
The other charges won't stick,

397
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:35,166
but you have him on possessing a firearm.

398
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:37,974
Yes. I'm considering that.

399
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,504
Jay gave that gun...

400
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:41,445
to Lee Ro Um to kill someone else.

401
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:44,474
And she left it with her lawyer to return it.

402
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:46,445
But he must've reached for it...

403
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,285
because his client was in danger.

404
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:50,314
You were at the scene, right?

405
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:53,025
I was, and it was a dreadful sight.

406
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:55,856
I hate to think what would've happened if he hadn't been there.

407
00:27:55,985 --> 00:27:58,294
Jay would've killed Lee and fled,

408
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:00,795
and the public would bury us for losing the culprit.

409
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:04,395
The more the public hears about the case,

410
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:05,835
the worse it is for us.

411
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:08,964
If you want to charge the guy, you'd better steel yourself.

412
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:10,535
You might get shot down too.

413
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:13,706
Okay. I'll look over the papers carefully.

414
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:15,645
You know what to do.

415
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:17,415
When you're done with this,

416
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:19,176
how about joining Special Investigations?

417
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:22,215
Jay's a jackpot for us, and I need some good men.

418
00:28:22,886 --> 00:28:24,956
You heard we're expanding, right?

419
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:28,686
Think about it. Enjoy the soda.

420
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,396

424
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,784
You know it's almost impossible...

425
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,985
to prove you helped her escape.

426
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:03,156
Why did you confess to that?

427
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:06,055
Tell me. Your illness.

428
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:07,666
It got bad, didn't it?

429
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:10,065
That's the only explanation.

430
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:12,906
So will he charge me for aiding and abetting?

431
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,365
It'll be stay of prosecution.

432
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:16,504
Stay of prosecution?

433
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,105
He thinks you lied...

434
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,706
to cover for your client.

435
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:22,445
- I didn't lie. - Exactly.

436
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:24,274
He's confused because you confessed...

437
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:25,975
when he had no proof of it.

438
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:29,015
Letting just the two get indicted for what I planned...

439
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:32,014
Without helping Lee escape,

440
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:34,686
your other clients have a mountain of other charges.

441
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:37,095
This trial isn't an easy one.

442
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:38,824
Lee has a flashy past,

443
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,265
and the media will chew her out.

444
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:42,824
Do you think Da Jung and Su Ho will be any different?

445
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:43,995
They have records.

446
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:47,705
The wisest thing to do is to defend them in court.

447
00:29:47,706 --> 00:29:49,336
Not go down with them.

448
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:51,936
To do that, you have to scale a mountain already,

449
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:54,606
without adding to the height.

462
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,213
(Lack of evidence, self defence)

463
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:06,202
On March 18, 2023, the defendant...

464
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,612
was detained at Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office,

465
00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:10,142
and right before transportation to lockup,

466
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:12,541
she fled the Prosecutors’ Office during a blackout,

467
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,682
thereby causing a disruption to the investigation.

468
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,182
So according to Article 145 of the Penal Code,

469
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:19,943
we charge defendant Lee Ro Um with escaping.

470
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,491
We charge Jung Da Jung according to...

471
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:26,291
Article 147 for aiding escape, and the promotion of information...

472
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:29,093
and communication network use and protection of information.

473
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,402
For the previously stated reasons, Na Su Ho is charged with...

474
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:33,632
aiding escape, and the promotion of information...

475
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:36,033
and communication network use and protection of information.

476
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:39,042
How do you know the defendants?

477
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,612
When I was in medical school, I took part...

478
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:44,581
in a study involving the defendants.

479
00:32:44,582 --> 00:32:45,812
What was it about?

480
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:49,353
We studied the educational background of gifted children.

481
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:52,082
Alternative schooling as opposed to home schooling.

482
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:55,653
I didn't know at the time, but that foundation was Jeokmok.

483
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:59,663
Did you meet the defendants since they came of age?

484
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,831
I visited them much later...

485
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:04,162
to apologize, after I found out about Jeokmok.

486
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:06,203
Why did you want to apologize?

487
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,402
Because no children should ever be raised...

488
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:11,342
in those conditions.

489
00:33:11,343 --> 00:33:15,042
The study I took part in contributed to creating Jeokmok Kids.

490
00:33:16,312 --> 00:33:18,113
I felt guilty.

491
00:33:18,883 --> 00:33:20,812
As a psychiatrist,

492
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:24,982
do you have an opinion on what the defendants did?

493
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:28,521
The defendants had no protector...

494
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,262
within the Jeokmok group.

495
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:32,692
They were given orders, not instructions,

496
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,732
and to survive, they'd have had to obey.

497
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:36,862
Their values would've been distorted,

498
00:33:36,863 --> 00:33:40,103
and as adults, they'd have struggled to lead normal lives.

499
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:43,403
Despite that, the defendants...

500
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:47,012
seem to have become each other's protector.

501
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:49,173
To protect others,

502
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:52,443
they used what they'd learned and what they were used to.

503
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:55,653
I think that was their only option.

504
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:59,723
Do you wish to say the defendants aren't criminals?

505
00:34:00,153 --> 00:34:02,993
I'm not saying they didn't do wrong.

506
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:04,762
I'm saying...

507
00:34:04,763 --> 00:34:08,133
they could've made different choices if it hadn't been for Jeokmok.

508
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:11,133
Not even a doctor could be sure of that.

509
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:16,033
We can't say because you nor I have been through it.

510
00:34:16,173 --> 00:34:18,541
I only gave my opinion...

511
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:21,371
on why they had to break the law...

512
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:23,013
to achieve their goal.

513
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:25,481
Our past experiences...

514
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,482
influence how we make a choice.

515
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,513
Even if it's wrong,

516
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:33,153
not everyone always makes the moral or legal choice.

517
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:36,823
You have a scary way of justifying crimes.

518
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,932
I'm not trying to justify crimes.

519
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:42,792
That's the judge's decision.

520
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:47,473
I just want to say the lives they led...

521
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:52,041
gave me clues that allow me to understand them.

522
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:53,713
That's all.

523
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:04,783
Are you nervous?

524
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:07,852
- About what? - The sentencing?

525
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:11,093
We will try, but you might get sent away.

526
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:13,993
Not really.

527
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,102
I even stood trial for something I didn't do.

528
00:35:19,002 --> 00:35:21,372
This time, it's for something I did do.

529
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:23,642
More than anything,

530
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:26,173
I trust my lawyer.

531
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:32,743
Make your final statement.

532
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:34,852
The defendants,

533
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:37,883
to get through a situation in which their lives were at stake,

534
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:40,693
planned to escape the Prosecutors' Office,

535
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:42,351
and in the process,

536
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:44,093
the legal system and government offices...

537
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:46,423

543
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:15,093
(Defence Counsel)

544
00:36:25,403 --> 00:36:27,002
Despite the countless suspicions...

545
00:36:27,973 --> 00:36:29,732
regarding the defendants,

546
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:31,943
something didn't change.

547
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:35,343
Before Jeokmok, they were...

548
00:36:36,272 --> 00:36:37,912
ordinary kids.

549
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:40,312
Before being prodigies,

550
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:43,251
she was an eight-year-old girl...

551
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:45,612
who wanted her parents' happiness more than her own safety.

552
00:36:46,423 --> 00:36:48,529
She was a girl who discovered the world within computers...

553
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:51,062
while her family was away from home.

554
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:53,632
He was an ordinary 14-year-old boy...

555
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:55,693
whose dream was to be part of NASA.

556
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,162
Park Hae Dong, who's still unconscious,

557
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:00,701
joined the scholarship foundation...

558
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:02,822
for his parents struggling to pay his hospital bills.

559
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,473
They were ordinary young kids.

560
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,013
But confined by a criminal group called Jeokmok,

561
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:10,943
they were forced to get trained.

562
00:37:11,343 --> 00:37:14,681
They were raised to commit crimes...

563
00:37:14,682 --> 00:37:16,681
on behalves of the assailants who were adults and their leaders.

564
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:18,223
(Judge)

565
00:37:22,122 --> 00:37:23,492
(Defence Counsel)

566
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:26,392
If the law redeems one, they put their faith in the law.

567
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,463
If society helps one,

568
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,832
they put their faith in society.

569
00:37:33,432 --> 00:37:36,903
Enduring those horrible times,

570
00:37:37,272 --> 00:37:39,073
they couldn't receive anyone's help.

571
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:41,042
But they held out,

572
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,383
undoubtedly believing that the law and society would punish evil.

573
00:37:45,912 --> 00:37:46,912
In the end,

574
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:49,951
they revealed themselves...

575
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,582
who should be punished.

576
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:55,823
What I can do as an attorney...

577
00:37:57,823 --> 00:37:59,723
is only to inform the truth.

578
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:01,792
Your Honour,

579
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:03,903
if you can please give them...

580
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:07,033
a chance to choose their future...

581
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:09,772
which they couldn't 20 years ago,

582
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:13,542
they will gladly reflect on themselves in life.

583
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:16,112
And if you can understand...

584
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:18,082
the good intentions they tried to uphold,

585
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:19,982
they will...

586
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,323
remember that the law offered its hand...

587
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:27,993
to them.

588
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,392
(Judge)

589
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:31,962
That is all.

590
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:35,162
(Defendant)

591
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:43,972
Defendants, do you have anything to say?

592
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:45,803
(Defendant)

593
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:49,612
(Judge)

594
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,783
I'm seated here as an assailant,

595
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:55,412
but in another case, I'm a victim.

596
00:38:55,912 --> 00:38:56,982
You see,

597
00:38:58,122 --> 00:38:59,352
as a victim myself,

598
00:39:00,622 --> 00:39:03,053
I want the assailant to be punished severely.

599
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:06,263
So I shouldn't ask for my punishment to be light.

600
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:08,792
The law has to remain sacred.

601
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:12,232
I do not...

602
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:14,653
need favourable arrangements.

603
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:17,573
But I do regret what I did.

604
00:39:19,843 --> 00:39:22,213
She's crazy indeed.

605
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:25,912
You may demand a penalty.

606
00:39:26,982 --> 00:39:30,352
The defendant violated a total of 12 laws...

607
00:39:30,553 --> 00:39:32,052
including committing murder, aiding and abetting murder,

608
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:33,553
fraud, forging private documents,

609
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:35,423
and violating the capital market...

610
00:39:35,823 --> 00:39:37,963
as he caused huge financial damage...

611
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:40,493
worth two billion dollars to Korea.

612
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,431
Despite clear evidence and testimonies,

613
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:48,033
he still denies his charges not to take responsibility...

614
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:50,033
instead of reflecting on himself.

615
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:53,542
Countless people were victimized by the criminal group he made.

616
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:56,843
He played a part in the act that corrupted society in general.

617
00:39:57,082 --> 00:39:58,883
Thus, he's needed to be confined permanently.

618
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:01,793
Please sentence the defendant...

619
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:04,352
to life imprisonment.

620
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:09,493
The ruling.

621
00:40:10,122 --> 00:40:11,622
Lee Ro Um, the principal offender,

622
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:13,783
is sentenced to a year in prison.

623
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:16,292
Her original stay of execution has been cancelled,

624
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:18,331
and in total with the sentence she has received,

625
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,002
she's sentenced to a year and six months in prison.

626
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:23,843
Jung Da Jung...

627
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:25,763
is sentenced to a year in prison.

628
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:28,042
Na Su Ho is sentenced to four months in prison.

629
00:40:29,272 --> 00:40:31,232
The original stay of execution has been cancelled,

630
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,181
and in total with the sentence he has received,

631
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:35,113
he's sentenced to ten months in prison.

632
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,832
It's such a relief.

633
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,372
And it's so impressive.

634
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,572
It went well, right?

635
00:40:56,573 --> 00:40:57,642
Yes, it did.

636
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:00,573
I'm so glad.

637
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:04,283
Which way are you going?

638
00:41:04,682 --> 00:41:06,283
To the bus stop.

639
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:11,223
Do you have any siblings?

640
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:14,621
My family has lots of daughters.

641
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:15,852
I have two older sisters.

642
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:17,463
I'm the only son.

643
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:19,363
I see.

644
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:21,193
Are you okay with such a family?

645
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:23,863
Well, yes. Why would it not be okay?

646
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:25,863
Who are you texting with?

647
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:27,532
When my sisters send their kids' pictures,

648
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:30,053
I need to respond with heart emojis, or they make a great fuss.

649
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:38,712
Is it just your nephews and nieces?

650
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:42,513
That you send heart emojis for.

651
00:42:00,803 --> 00:42:02,002
May I join you?

652
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:05,573
I thought you hated me.

653
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:07,673
Hardly.

654
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:09,513
I know you helped me.

655
00:42:10,243 --> 00:42:11,613
The non indictment too.

656
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:12,982
Gosh.

657
00:42:12,983 --> 00:42:14,981
As if one doesn't get indicted just because I say so.

658
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:17,181
Mr. Han right here wrote...

659
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:19,482
such a convincing written opinion.

660
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:21,451
Prosecutor Tak said he'd never read...

661
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,452
a written opinion as exemplary as that.

662
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,193
Still.

663
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:28,062
I'm grateful for others too.

664
00:42:28,732 --> 00:42:29,732
And I'm sorry.

665
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:35,403
This is why I feel so lonely.

666
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:37,303
This is why I'm here.

667
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,771
Excuse me. Could we have one more glass?

668
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:42,772
Sure.

669
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:44,283
All right.

670
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:46,013
This is rather small,

671
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:49,042
but the first issue of Big News has been released.

672
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:50,452
He's now the CEO.

673
00:42:50,752 --> 00:42:51,883
Call me Mr. CEO now.

674
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:53,622
Let me send you right away.

675
00:42:54,622 --> 00:42:55,653
All right.

676
00:42:56,752 --> 00:42:58,872
It's been such a long time since we had a group chat.

677
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:04,731

678
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:08,432
"'Dreaming for the Righteous World with No Deceit'?"

679
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:10,133
It's so well-written.

680
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:11,673
Although, it sounds obvious.

681
00:43:13,702 --> 00:43:16,243
I can't believe you praise your own writing.

682
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:18,883
No one does it.

683
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:22,153
Goodness.

00:43:29,622 --> 00:43:31,621

("Dreaming for the Righteous World with No Deceit")

686
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,501
The trial about the Jeokmok Kids...

687
00:43:41,502 --> 00:43:45,243
that drew so much attention has ended today.

688
00:43:45,573 --> 00:43:47,973
As their unfortunate past got revealed,

689
00:43:48,113 --> 00:43:51,411
their runaway plot, hacking, and other criminal acts...

690
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:54,181
were interpreted as the righteous revenge...

691
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:55,882
to punish the absolute evil such as Navisgate,

692
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,323
which drew attention.

693
00:43:57,682 --> 00:43:59,422
It seems quite certain...

694
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:02,291
that thanks to the evidence they secured,

695
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:05,722
Chairman Lee Jay could be punished, and the financial damage...

696
00:44:05,723 --> 00:44:08,493
caused by Navisgate could be retrieved.

697
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:12,232
Despite the belated public support,

698
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:16,272
they accepted the primary sentence without making an appeal.

699
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:18,371
When they were asked to make a final argument,

700
00:44:18,372 --> 00:44:21,771
they asked for a chance to repent instead of favourable arrangements.

701
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:25,141
Such an attitude provides food for thought to the public...

702
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:27,912
who has described them as outlaws.

703
00:44:30,582 --> 00:44:33,053
Time flew without realizing it.

(Daejin Prison ensures safety for people together.)

705
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:39,492
Su Ho's sentence was the shortest,

706
00:44:39,493 --> 00:44:40,962
but he said it felt extremely long.

707
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:41,963
Hey.

00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:56,972
You're looking good.

711
00:44:56,973 --> 00:44:59,212
I guess the prison food suited your palate.

(Establishment of the Law and Order)

713
00:45:01,553 --> 00:45:04,081
I was released today, and he was there to see me.

714
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:06,082
- Here. - I guess he grew up.

715
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:07,792
Come on. You've got to have this.

716
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:10,763
There you go.

717
00:45:11,493 --> 00:45:13,962
I only spent two more months in prison than he did.

718
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:15,062
But it felt long.

719
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:19,763
I wondered how it was for you to spend ten years.

720
00:45:20,432 --> 00:45:22,232
You were a lot younger than us now.

721
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,271
- Ro Um... - Still, I'm glad...

722
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:27,371
that you're having a suit for damages.

723
00:45:27,372 --> 00:45:28,771

724
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:30,013
from Attorney Han.

- I'll visit you soon too. - It's this person, right?

726
00:45:35,252 --> 00:45:38,122
I'm writing this letter to inform you of this news.

727
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:40,383
Hae Dong woke up, Ro Um.

728
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:42,752
I'll see you at the trial.

729
00:45:52,162 --> 00:45:53,702
(Prison with Hope and Tomorrow)

730
00:46:08,812 --> 00:46:10,283
Do I know Attorney Han Moo Young?

731
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:14,353
Of all the lawyers I've known,

732
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:17,792
he was the best.

733
00:46:18,593 --> 00:46:21,463
Mr. Park, this isn't a video. It's a photo.

734
00:46:22,832 --> 00:46:24,132
- Oh, a photo? - Yes.

735
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:26,133
Let's do it plainly for now.

736
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:30,272
First off, the damage suit.

737
00:46:30,642 --> 00:46:34,112
By next month, the confiscated amount returns to Korea.

738
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:37,411
Then, not only the clients of our firm...

739
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:40,042
but also the victims of Navis Well-being...

740
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:42,382
will be able to receive the compensations...

741
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,322
all because we were able to acquire the evidence to prove...

742
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:45,582
that it was a Ponzi scheme.

743
00:46:45,823 --> 00:46:47,283
And Ms. Lee Ro Um.

744
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:49,752
What do you think about her damage suit?

745
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:51,562
I believe her.

746
00:46:52,463 --> 00:46:55,533
Moo Young is a conscience as an attorney.

747
00:46:57,602 --> 00:46:58,932
I like your choice of words.

748
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:01,602
When I was in my mid-20s...

749
00:47:02,372 --> 00:47:04,601
To be honest, this might sound...

750
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:07,202
a bit conceited, coming from myself.

751
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:10,443
But my family is pretty rich.

752
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:12,113
So, I was in the US.

753
00:47:12,743 --> 00:47:13,882
I told my family...

754
00:47:13,883 --> 00:47:15,811
that I'd be studying English,

755
00:47:15,812 --> 00:47:17,681
but I was actually there to fool around.

756
00:47:17,682 --> 00:47:19,822
When I was almost sick of fooling around,

757
00:47:19,823 --> 00:47:21,822
I returned to Korea and returned to school.

758
00:47:21,823 --> 00:47:22,952
That's when Moo Young...

759
00:47:23,923 --> 00:47:25,243
The defendant, Republic of Korea,

760
00:47:26,062 --> 00:47:27,391
will provide the plaintiff, Lee Ro Um,

761
00:47:27,392 --> 00:47:28,561
(Plaintiff)

762
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:30,731
with a million dollars and the amount above...

763
00:47:30,732 --> 00:47:33,932
by 12 percent every year.

764
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:37,133
The defendant will bear the costs of this trial.

765
00:47:51,027 --> 00:47:54,365
I thought, "I have to bring him in."

766
00:47:54,366 --> 00:47:57,265
So, I was thinking...

767
00:47:57,266 --> 00:47:58,436
of training this guy...

768
00:48:02,476 --> 00:48:03,536
How did it go?

769
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:07,007
It went well, thanks to you guys.

770
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:08,246
Okay.

771
00:48:09,476 --> 00:48:10,846
Moo Young, check out your office.

772
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:15,016
Okay.

773
00:48:18,456 --> 00:48:20,456
- So... Listen. - No.

774
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:29,237
You'll be fully compensated by next month.

775
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:36,436
I met Mr. Kang.

776
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,507
He told me...

777
00:48:41,476 --> 00:48:43,016
about everything that happened.

778
00:48:43,516 --> 00:48:44,947
I had to reconsider it...

779
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,757
thousands of times before coming here.

780
00:48:50,016 --> 00:48:51,927
When I'm doing nothing at night,

781
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:54,357
I come to think...

782
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:58,967
that I have no memory of you...

783
00:49:00,226 --> 00:49:01,636
other than hurting you.

784
00:49:02,897 --> 00:49:04,706
It felt like what happened to your dad...

785
00:49:05,366 --> 00:49:07,406
was all my fault.

786
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:08,706
No, it wasn't.

787
00:49:09,706 --> 00:49:11,147
I only brought you pain.

788
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:13,447
Not a single sweet memory.

789
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:18,246
You're the strongest driving force of my life.

790
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,416
I want you to be happy.

791
00:49:24,726 --> 00:49:26,726
And there were sweet memories.

792
00:49:30,527 --> 00:49:33,226
We went to the fishing place by the reservoir from time to time.

793
00:49:33,496 --> 00:49:35,036
You were cooking ramyeon,

794
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:37,566
and Dad was drunk without having to drink,

795
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:38,837
which was rare.

796
00:49:43,107 --> 00:49:45,306
I still haven't been able to throw out...

797
00:49:45,706 --> 00:49:47,516
the fishing rod that he used.

798
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:50,177
I always wondered why I still kept it,

799
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:54,415
and someone told me...

800
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:56,757
that even an insignificant memory can help me forgive...

801
00:49:57,456 --> 00:49:58,627
a person that I hate.

802
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:03,197
When bad things happen in the future,

803
00:50:05,427 --> 00:50:07,337
let's solve them together.

804
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,036
I'd like to do that with you.

805
00:50:21,177 --> 00:50:23,877
(Chungwoon Prison)

806
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:27,817
Thank you.

807
00:50:33,757 --> 00:50:35,657
(Waiting Room)

808
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:50,337
I got a new car.

809
00:50:51,246 --> 00:50:53,006
Were you hiding?

810
00:50:53,007 --> 00:50:54,516
Why would I hide?

811
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:56,176
I was on the phone in my car,

812
00:50:56,177 --> 00:50:58,116
and you got out sooner than I thought.

813
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:01,886
You have a lot of stuff.

814
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:07,127
It's heavy.

815
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:31,846
I want to drive.

816
00:51:32,746 --> 00:51:34,316
You don't even have a license.

817
00:51:34,317 --> 00:51:35,757
I got it in prison.

818
00:51:36,616 --> 00:51:39,726
They let model prisoners take it for social adjustment.

819
00:51:39,826 --> 00:51:41,257
Were you a model prisoner?

820
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:42,627
I said I'd try it.

821
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:44,727
I'll pay you the lawyer's fee.

822
00:51:45,427 --> 00:51:47,967
I don't think that has anything to do with this.

823
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:53,666
I'm proud of you. A model prisoner.

824
00:51:55,607 --> 00:51:56,607
Whatever.

825
00:52:04,516 --> 00:52:07,386
(Chungwoon Prison)

826
00:52:27,036 --> 00:52:28,076
Who are you?

827
00:52:34,447 --> 00:52:37,075
I said that was not funny.

828
00:52:37,076 --> 00:52:39,016
You always pull the same trick.

829
00:52:51,826 --> 00:52:53,496
Stop. I'm getting a crush on you.

830
00:53:02,507 --> 00:53:04,376
Gently. No, stronger. Just a bit stronger.

831
00:53:04,377 --> 00:53:07,647
- Okay. - That's all right.

832
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:09,476
Slowly.

833
00:53:10,476 --> 00:53:12,487
Slow and...

834
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:14,515
smooth.

835
00:53:14,516 --> 00:53:16,186
- Let's try reversing. - Reverse.

836
00:53:17,056 --> 00:53:18,056
- Go? - Now...

837
00:53:18,826 --> 00:53:20,427
Slow down.

838
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:26,527
Go straight, Ro Um.

839
00:53:28,697 --> 00:53:29,797
I think I did it.

840
00:53:30,197 --> 00:53:33,436
Now, let's take it slowly from the top.

841
00:53:33,967 --> 00:53:35,435
Which way is the left turn?

842
00:53:35,436 --> 00:53:38,547
Left turn. Left hand. Left side.

843
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:40,006
Left.

844
00:53:40,007 --> 00:53:41,777
Try it with the steering wheel.

845
00:53:41,877 --> 00:53:44,615
Left turn. Left side.

846
00:53:44,616 --> 00:53:45,686
Right turn.

847
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:48,555
Right. Right hand.

848
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:50,987
No, right side. Right turn.

849
00:53:51,286 --> 00:53:53,157
You're too slow.

850
00:53:53,757 --> 00:53:56,726
Why would you turn left and turn right right after?

851
00:53:56,897 --> 00:53:58,726
I'm not saying that it's the actual route.

852
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:01,837
You'll be in a car accident, at this rate.

853
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,366
Then, you can defend me.

854
00:54:05,436 --> 00:54:08,076
Don't ever say that with a straight face.

855
00:54:09,636 --> 00:54:10,906
Then, let me try again.

856
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:12,146
- No. - I can do it.

857
00:54:12,147 --> 00:54:13,345
- No, Ro Um. - I'll do it well.

858
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:15,615
- Let's take a short break. - Left turn.

859
00:54:15,616 --> 00:54:16,646
(Resident Registration)

860
00:54:16,647 --> 00:54:19,317
Your probation officer is...

861
00:54:20,346 --> 00:54:21,416
Ms. Lee Ro Um.

862
00:54:24,186 --> 00:54:25,186
Hi.

863
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:33,527
Lee Ro Um.

864
00:54:49,246 --> 00:54:50,416
We're in love.

865
00:54:52,147 --> 00:54:55,016
I thought you'd have nothing to do. But you've been pretty busy.

866
00:54:57,186 --> 00:54:58,356
The task force to retrieve...

867
00:54:58,357 --> 00:54:59,526
the criminal proceeds of Navis Well-being...

868
00:54:59,527 --> 00:55:02,127
is expanding the scope of redemption.

869
00:55:02,357 --> 00:55:04,725
By inviting experts in the legal, digital,

870
00:55:04,726 --> 00:55:08,067
and financial field to complement the judiciary procedure...

871
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,306
- Me? - Yes.

872
00:55:12,136 --> 00:55:13,967
I'd like you to help us.

873
00:55:14,737 --> 00:55:16,205
The Cyber Bureau...

874
00:55:16,206 --> 00:55:18,777
and Asset Recovery Team are recruiting too,

875
00:55:18,976 --> 00:55:20,575
but no one knows...

876
00:55:20,576 --> 00:55:22,817
the Jeokmok mechanism as well as you.

877
00:55:23,217 --> 00:55:25,217
You'll be an unofficial team member.

878
00:55:25,587 --> 00:55:27,016
Your identity will be protected.

879
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:29,257
You'll be a specialized member.

880
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:34,056
The one who knows best about a con...

881
00:55:35,596 --> 00:55:36,757
is a con artist.

882
00:55:48,737 --> 00:55:49,976
Do it if you want to.

883
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:53,107
What do you think?

884
00:55:53,877 --> 00:55:55,016
You sound interested.

885
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:58,786
I never told you why I joined Jeokmok, right?

886
00:56:07,257 --> 00:56:09,757
It was the first place that acknowledged me.

887
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:12,366
So Dam was sick,

888
00:56:12,897 --> 00:56:14,836
and my parents were busy working.

889
00:56:14,837 --> 00:56:17,197
I was alone at school and at home,

890
00:56:17,636 --> 00:56:19,407
and they were the first to praise me.

891
00:56:22,377 --> 00:56:24,136
It's a simple and stupid reason.

892
00:56:25,107 --> 00:56:26,706
I wondered a lot...

893
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:30,516
if it would've been different if any other group had picked me.

894
00:56:31,616 --> 00:56:33,246
Just do it. Why wonder?

895
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:35,857
It feels like...

896
00:56:36,616 --> 00:56:39,627
I'm the only one clinging to the past.

897
00:56:40,286 --> 00:56:41,496
It's a sense of duty.

898
00:56:42,297 --> 00:56:44,297
If you're competent and have a sense of duty,

899
00:56:45,726 --> 00:56:46,967
do good for society.

900
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:48,596
And be acknowledged.

901
00:56:49,636 --> 00:56:51,337
- What about you? - What about me?

902
00:56:51,737 --> 00:56:53,766
I think he's considering you too.

903
00:56:57,636 --> 00:56:59,246
I'll live a boring life.

904
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:01,047
I can't be bothered.

905
00:57:33,547 --> 00:57:35,177
I'd always wanted to ask.

906
00:57:36,677 --> 00:57:38,047
What makes you laugh?

907
00:57:38,286 --> 00:57:39,717
Bring Ro Um.

908
00:57:40,846 --> 00:57:43,185
She won't visit as long as you live.

909
00:57:43,186 --> 00:57:45,927
I'll be out in a few years.

910
00:57:46,786 --> 00:57:48,357
That won't happen either.

911
00:57:49,127 --> 00:57:50,697
Appeal all you want.

912
00:57:51,826 --> 00:57:54,837
We can't do anything about the charges that expired,

913
00:57:55,136 --> 00:57:57,467
but you'll stand trial until you're sick of it.

914
00:57:57,866 --> 00:58:00,166
In your dreams, even in death.

915
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:02,107
You came here to say that?

916
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:03,677
And one more thing.

917
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:09,047
Don't do anything, however callous or crass...

918
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:10,746
to get to us.

919
00:58:11,317 --> 00:58:12,317
What if I do?

920
00:58:12,587 --> 00:58:14,087
Unlike Ro Um,

921
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,657
I don't care if you live or die.

922
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,357
It wasn't a mistake that I let you live.

923
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:37,076
I'm sorry.

924
00:58:39,877 --> 00:58:42,746
I never thought that like me,

925
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:45,786
you were a living person.

926
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:49,157
So back then,

927
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:52,157
I felt no guilt.

928
00:58:54,286 --> 00:58:56,056
If the statues hadn't expired,

929
00:58:56,797 --> 00:58:59,496
I'd be in prison for conning you.

930
00:59:01,366 --> 00:59:03,096
You're not bad at all.

931
00:59:05,036 --> 00:59:07,036
The scumbags are the ones who made you do it.

932
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:16,547
I apologize.

933
00:59:19,547 --> 00:59:22,516
I dreamed of it every night for ten years.

934
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:26,286
Of that night.

935
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,967
So I know how horrible it is.

936
00:59:36,837 --> 00:59:37,866
I wanted to...

937
00:59:39,737 --> 00:59:42,177
tell you to sleep soundly.

938
00:59:45,806 --> 00:59:46,877
Because now,

939
00:59:48,777 --> 00:59:50,147
I can sleep peacefully.

940
00:59:51,317 --> 00:59:53,147
Thanks to Moo Young.

941
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:07,166
Next up.

942
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:09,095
The Navisgate mastermind,

943
01:00:09,096 --> 01:00:11,135
Lee Jay was arrested a year ago.

944
01:00:11,136 --> 01:00:13,736
From Jeokmok Foundation to Navis Well-being,

945
01:00:13,737 --> 01:00:17,135
a total of 42 people were indicted for their involvement,

946
01:00:17,136 --> 01:00:19,377
and nine were sentenced so far.

947
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:23,346
Lee Jay is still involved in over 30 lawsuits,

948
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:26,647
and as things drag on, the longer his sentence has become.

949
01:00:41,636 --> 01:00:44,166
(Ramyeon)

950
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:48,677
You went through a lot.

951
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:53,377
For having...

952
01:00:55,677 --> 01:00:56,777
a daughter like me.

953
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:10,427
This is all I have. Do you mind?

954
01:01:20,936 --> 01:01:21,936
Zero sugar?

955
01:01:23,036 --> 01:01:24,076
It's not bad.

956
01:01:25,206 --> 01:01:26,206
Here.

957
01:01:28,147 --> 01:01:30,777
Check the amendments and sign it.

01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:37,986

(Lee Ro Um)

962
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:49,737
And here.

963
01:01:54,636 --> 01:01:56,306
Once the money's wired,

964
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:58,246
is it over?

965
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:01,246
It's over between you and me.

966
01:02:08,456 --> 01:02:09,487
The contract, I mean.

967
01:02:12,987 --> 01:02:15,096
I don't want to have to defend you now.

968
01:02:22,366 --> 01:02:24,805
Su Ho, where are the zip ties?

969
01:02:24,806 --> 01:02:26,467
Oh, I have them.

970
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:28,806
Hey, Ro Um.

971
01:02:29,107 --> 01:02:30,975
I think you were conned.

972
01:02:30,976 --> 01:02:32,475
The lights here are nice,

973
01:02:32,476 --> 01:02:33,745
but did you go upstairs?

974
01:02:33,746 --> 01:02:34,946
The bathroom tiles are cracked...

975
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:36,546
and the door doesn't shut.

976
01:02:36,547 --> 01:02:37,616
Work, don't talk.

977
01:02:39,186 --> 01:02:41,416
Get the landlord to fix that.

978
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:43,286
Can't you fix it now?

979
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:45,587
I will, okay?

980
01:02:45,987 --> 01:02:47,685
But have them pay for it.

981
01:02:47,686 --> 01:02:49,197
Don't let it slide.

982
01:02:50,496 --> 01:02:51,766
Will Moo Young come too?

983
01:02:52,096 --> 01:02:53,096
No.

984
01:02:54,766 --> 01:02:56,467
You didn't tell him we moved?

985
01:02:57,436 --> 01:02:59,636
No. Should I?

- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

994
01:03:48,786 --> 01:03:50,556
- Okay. - Darn!

995
01:03:51,826 --> 01:03:53,956
Be honest. Did you plan this?

996
01:03:55,496 --> 01:03:57,055
Lee Ro Um, was it you?

997
01:03:57,056 --> 01:03:58,056
Look into my...

998
01:03:59,527 --> 01:04:00,726
I can't tell.

999
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:02,967
Why me?

1000
01:04:03,397 --> 01:04:05,865
Why the heck is it always me?

1001
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:08,836
This doesn't make any sense.

1002
01:04:08,837 --> 01:04:11,606
Unless you planned this, there's no way I'm always the one.

1003
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:15,146
Hey, if you think about it, I'm the eldest here, okay?

1004
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:16,575
Remember that.

1005
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:18,516
I'm doing this for you, you know.

1006
01:04:19,246 --> 01:04:21,785
That's not easy for a guy like me.

1007
01:04:21,786 --> 01:04:22,786
Hello?

1008
01:04:23,286 --> 01:04:24,587
Ro Um, it's me.

1009
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:27,857
I see you paid me.

1010
01:04:28,596 --> 01:04:30,157
I'm glad you got it.

1011
01:04:30,456 --> 01:04:32,797
You forgot a few zeros.

1012
01:04:33,496 --> 01:04:34,496
Who did?

1013
01:04:35,036 --> 01:04:36,237
You did.

1014
01:04:36,797 --> 01:04:39,107
- That can't be. - Can you check for me?

1015
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:40,706
Fine.

1016
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:42,976
Can you do it right now?

1017
01:04:44,337 --> 01:04:46,047
- When I'm free. - Are you busy?

1018
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:48,947
- What are you doing? - I'm moving.

1019
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:51,786
You're moving. Congratulations.

01:04:54,746 --> 01:04:55,757
I have.

1022
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:06,567
Gosh.

1023
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:09,096
Nice house.

1024

How did you know the address?

1025
01:05:13,306 --> 01:05:16,076
Well, there's someone who shares me such stuff.

1026
01:05:24,377 --> 01:05:27,487
So? You came all the way for money?

1027
01:05:27,817 --> 01:05:28,886
No.

1028
