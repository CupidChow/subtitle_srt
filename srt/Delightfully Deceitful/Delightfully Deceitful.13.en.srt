00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:57,451
(Episode 13)

2
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,530
Can I have a go?

3
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,020
What were you thinking?

4
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:34,651
What were you thinking about as you shot?

5
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:38,260
That I should shoot the bottle.

6
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,791
Is there someone you'd like to shoot?

7
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:45,471
You asked for a gun when you have no one you want to shoot?

8
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,501
Do you have lots of people you want to shoot?

9
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:51,741
The truth is,

10
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,640
there's no one I don't want to shoot.

11
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:02,521
I feel the same.

12
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,310
It didn't look like part of the show.

13
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:06,181
It's camcorder footage.

14
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:07,780
Who took it?

15
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,820
(Reporter Woo Young Ki)

16
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:20,331
Hello, Mr. Woo.

17
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,839
This evening in Ganghyeon-Gu,

18
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,939
a man fell to his death from the roof of network enterprise...

19
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,869
of Navis Well-being's headquarters.

20
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,610
Police identified him...

21
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:40,080
as Director Ma Kang Soo who hosted an investment briefing...

22
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,119
that evening in the very building.

23
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,520
Reporter Kim Jun Young has the story.

24
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:46,220
I'm outside Navis Well-being.

25
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,059
Director Ma hosted an investment briefing...

26
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,520
from which he left in a hurry...

27
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,030
after being accused of stock manipulation.

28
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:53,830
About two hours later,

29
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,761
Ma fell to his death from the roof.

30
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,599
Police arrested suspect Lee...

31
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,401
at the scene who admitted to killing Ma.

32
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,969
The CEO who was injured...

33
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,000
was taken to a hospital in Seoul.

34
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,380
How does it look?

35
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,879
We lost a lot of the files we got from Navis...

36
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,450
during the briefing.

37
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:20,551
We're exposed, aren't we?

38
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,690
Yes. They got to us.

39
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,701
Let's pack up.

40
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,431
We'll stay with Ring Go for a while.

41
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:40,211
(Dajung Comic Books)

42
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:43,040
Is she okay?

43
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,981
She wouldn't be. Her home's exposed.

44
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,551
What about you?

45
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,361
It's not the first time I got such a message.

46
00:04:58,891 --> 00:04:59,891
It's a bit...

47
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,790
different.

48
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,860
It's more of an invitation than a warning.

49
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,501
As if he'll appear in person.

50
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,881
Hey, I'm here.

51
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,021
- You were smoking, weren't you? - No.

52
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:34,430
Have you lost your mind?

53
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,430
Do you want to get kicked out again?

54
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,130
Don't you hear them blasting announcements...

55
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,669
day and night because of you?

56
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,729
Tell them to kick me out. I feel so cooped up here.

57
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,339
I want to go home!

58
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,609
You really are driving me nuts.

59
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,669
Would you look at yourself before you talk such nonsense?

60
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,040
- I told you to pick up some beers. - Your bones won't heal!

61
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,321
Aren't you in pain?

62
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,390
- It's not too bad. - You can laugh now?

63
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,160
Hey, smile a little. Did someone die or something?

64
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, that's right. Ma Kang Soo died.

65
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:14,331
- Hey, are you okay? - With what?

66
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,001
- You got beaten up. - Oh, that.

67
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:19,010
Come on. It's nothing new.

68
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,910
We got beaten up like this many times in the past.

69
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,350
It's just been a while. That's all.

70
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,021
And if the one who beat you up dies,

71
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:31,220
you have nothing to say.

72
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,891
My dad beat me up all the time. And when he died,

73
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,160
I had nothing to say.

74
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,691
I couldn't even resent him.

75
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,131
I'm cool about these things.

76
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,300
I don't hold grudges.

77
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,131
But why did you go to Ma Kang Soo, of all people?

78
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,599
Because he had the power.

79
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,969
As soon as I joined hands with him,

80
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,470
he knocked out one of Jang Kyung Ja's men.

81
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:52,571
Always side with the stronger one.

82
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,511
That's your logic? You're nuts.

83
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:56,280
Darn it. Ma Kang Soo ordered me...

84
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,211
to find the notebook we had been looking for, and I was so close.

85
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
"Notebook?"

86
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:03,850
What notebook? Jang Kyung Ja burned it.

87
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:07,891
No, we put up a camera in her office and watched her.

88
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:11,121
Was it a lighter? She hid something in it.

89
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:13,529
- Yes, a converted one. - What did she hide in it?

90
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,631
No idea. I assumed it was a copy of the notebook.

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,371
- Have you told Ro Um about this? - No, not yet.

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,670
Don't tell her.

93
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,469
- Why not? - Da Jung's store was broken into,

94
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,641
so she's frazzled right now.

95
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:26,941
The comic book store? Who's the jerk that did this?

96
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,780
The president.

97
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,820
We lost most of the data obtained through the hacking tool...

98
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,420
Na Sa had installed.

99
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,021
They were all important evidence.

100
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:46,929
I should've been more careful. I'm sorry.

101
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,061
It's not your fault.

102
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,061
She's right. It's not your fault, Da Jung.

103
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,400
We duped them, so why is it that I feel like we've been duped?

104
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:56,501
The operation was focused on Ma Kang Soo, and we blew it all.

105
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,540
We managed to put a stop to the stock manipulation.

106
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,210
We put a stop on the wrap-up, and it'll impact the president.

107
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,240
And overall, we reduced the scope of the damage.

108
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,011
You saved the victims.

109
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:12,451
I'll start preparing for a class action suit.

110
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,719
It'll be a roadblock to every final move...

111
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,990
Navis Well-being could take.

112
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,230
But lawsuits can take a long time.

113
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,230
Well, it'll take some time to gather plaintiffs.

114
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,500
But once I have enough people, we can expedite things.

115
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,370
Nothing puts more pressure on a fraud case...

116
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:30,840
than a class action suit.

117
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,270
When we're filing the complaint, we can put in a request...

118
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:37,280
for searches and seizures on Navis' properties and its executives...

119
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,350
as well as travel bans.

120
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:42,451
But they'll destroy all evidence and get ready to flee.

121
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,251
You guys all know...

122
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:48,090
what fraudsters would do to cover their tracks.

123
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,690
If we make sure they can't destroy evidence,

124
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:52,290
would we find things through a search and seizure?

125
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:53,790
Let's hope so.

126
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,360
The president reacted...

127
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,830
and is likely to make a move.

128
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,740
So let's get to work too.

129
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,410
The situation isn't looking bad.

130
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:13,151
People are starting to suspect Navis,

131
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,451
and the investigative agencies are keeping an eye on them too.

132
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,250
We should search their head office first.

133
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:19,919
I'll try to restore the data.

134
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,590
I should be able to find some helpful data.

135
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:24,320
First, let's tie down Navis.

136
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:28,590
The information was revealed to the public first,

137
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:31,659
which is unprecedented for a stock manipulation case.

138
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,640
A file revealing its details was shared on a blog called HOJUNG.

139
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,810
Thanks to that, we were able to prevent the worst-case scenario.

140
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,809
Reporter Woo Young Ki from Moran Daily is here to tell us more.

141
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,881
- Hello. - Hello.

142
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:48,651
I heard you predicted the stock manipulation.

143
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,919
To put it more precisely, I predicted Ma Kang Soo's scams.

144
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,991
- Right. - It was all thanks to HOJUNG.

145
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,959
The blog, HOJUNG, was created...

146
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,559
by Mr. Yeon Tae Hoon, the father of Yeon Ho Jung,

147
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,230
the victim of Darusa International,

148
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,429
another pyramid scheme by Ma Kang Soo.

149
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,300
It was created to expose pyramid schemes.

150
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:07,470
I see. Let's watch Mr. Yeon Tae Hoon's interview...

151
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,240
before we continue.

152
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,270
(Yeon Tae Hoon, manages blog "HOJUNG")

153
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:12,539
Ma Kang Soo died...

154
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,210
without paying for what he did.

155
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,611
However, Navis Well-being still remains.

156
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:21,709
There are still many things involving Navis Well-being...

157
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,481
that must be investigated.

158
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,621
If the investigation is carried out in a fair, transparent manner,

159
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,631
I believe...

160
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,160
there will be no more victims like my daughter, Ho Jung.

161
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:42,400
"Things involving Navis Well-being that must be investigated?"

162
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,600
By that, was he referring to the stock manipulation scandal?

163
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:48,070
They're suspected to have committed many other illegal deeds.

164
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,740
Today, the full archive about Navis Well-being...

165
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:54,650
will be revealed through HOJUNG, the blog.

166
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:56,621
The blog will continuously be updated with new cases.

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,180
Send us tip-offs.

168
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,490
From Navis' former members, current members,

169
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,189
franchisees, and customers.

170
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,991
Send us anything and everything you know.

171
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,290
We look forward to hearing from you.

172
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:08,930
Just a comment, please!

173
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:14,070
- Is it really true? - Just one comment, please!

174
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:28,980
None of the files about the stock manipulation mentions your name.

175
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,550
And now that Ma Kang Soo is dead, the case is no longer indictable.

176
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:34,391
The Financial Supervisory Service's audit will make us uneasy,

177
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:35,690
but...

178
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,891
I'm more worried about the blog posts.

179
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:43,231
So what are you saying we should do?

180
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,700
Were all the bribes just a big waste of money?

181
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,939
Of course, I'm doing my very best to stop them.

182
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,871
Public opinion is the problem.

183
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,240
We're getting many refund requests,

184
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:55,570
and the local branches are thrown upside down due to the prepayments.

185
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:58,180
If we tolerate these things, we'll go bankrupt...

186
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,280
before we even know it.

187
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,120
We really don't have much time left.

188
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:05,751
You must seal the deal with your higher-ups.

189
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,830
Can't the branches manage their members better?

190
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:15,901
Can they not think?

191
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:18,601
If the company is audited, and if the CEO ends up in jail,

192
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,770
will they get their prepayments back?

193
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:23,371
Do they actually think that?

194
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,870
Teach them that first!

195
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,381
What does it mean for the company to be in jeopardy?

196
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,040
What is the attitude they must have now?

197
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:36,151
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:39,351
Start getting things sorted out internally.

199
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,559
Customers are still demanding refunds from Navis Well-being.

200
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,630
Navis stated that refunds would be processed in due order...

201
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:54,029
through the company's local branches...

202
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,470
and that the company...

203
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:57,971
would take legal action against any speculative allegations.

204
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,271
Navis Well-being...

205
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,111
has 100,000 members.

206
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,611
All tip-offs will be shared with us,

207
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,350
and we've obtained some internal documents.

208
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,721
I'm hoping the firm could side with the victims.

209
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,650
Help me.

210
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:14,320
Refund requests are pouring in,

211
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,991
and Navis Well-being...

212
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,300
The comic book store. Was that you?

213
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:32,271
Is that important to you?

214
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,370
It's not like you didn't see this coming.

215
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,780
This is now a totally different game for both of us.

216
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,409
There's no middle ground.

217
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,910
You said you'd help us this time.

218
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:43,079
I asked you to make sure the briefing would end safely.

219
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,120
I did not know that Jang Kyung Ja would kill someone.

220
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:46,690
She nearly died too...

221
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,391
because of you.

222
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:50,221
I gave her a chance.

223
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:52,891
- But she declined. - What chance?

224
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:54,761
A chance to hand over the president.

225
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,300
She knows who the president is.

226
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,040
Was that the content of the notebook you tried to steal?

227
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,240
A gun's only meaningful when there's someone to shoot.

228
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:10,141
No, you've had a change of heart.

229
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:13,111
You're counting on the prosecution and the media.

230
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,180
Did Jeokmok not teach you?

231
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,250
You should never count on such things.

232
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,580
This, I didn't know.

233
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,060
The fact that you can never really join hands with me.

234
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:26,659
- Lee Ro Um. - I don't care how you do it...

235
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,960
or what your reason is.

236
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,830
You'd better not mess with us.

237
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,871
Let me say this again. It's just that there was no one to shoot.

238
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:35,771
It wasn't because I didn't have a gun.

The thing with Ma Kang Soo while covering the Darusa scandal?

245
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,641
Are you afraid it'd be brought up again?

246
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,809
Look at you running your mouth...

247
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,111
when you did a TV interview without even informing your boss.

248
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,780
Do you feel like a martyr?

249
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:24,780
So, get out of this place and write anything you want.

250
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,991

251
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,190
Now I see what I liked so much about Han Moo Young.

252
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,230
That lawyer and I were...

253
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:39,471
both crazy people who had to make crazy choices in crazy situations.

254
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,010
Oh, and I'm fired,

255
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,310
so don't you dare take away my severance pay.

256
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:57,721
Try me and see what happens. I'll dig into everything.

257

00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,290
- Gosh, seriously... - What's wrong with him?

259
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,330
- Mr. Woo. - Hello.

260
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:09,660
Hi, there.

261
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,670
Were you fired?

262
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,771
No, I quit.

263
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,670
It was such a small company unfit for a great reporter like me.

264
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:20,910
- I'm sorry. - I'm telling you the truth.

265
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,079
I got on the mass media,

266
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,480
so I'm going to be an investigative journalist.

267
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:26,150

270
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:31,080
Thank you. I was craving some alcohol.

271
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:32,381
By the way,

272
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,690
do you mind if I crash here for a few days?

273
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:39,460
Gosh.

274
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,770
The contract papers all seem fabricated.

275
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:55,141
But there's no evidence.

276
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,511

277
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:00,251

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,690
I'll be back in a minute.

279
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,361
She's so depressed.

280
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,430
Is it because of that video?

281
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,771
It means that she's tolerated all of that so far.

282
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,200
I can't even imagine how it must have been.

283
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,001
So, I'm trying to do what I can...

284
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,810
to help her.

285
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:28,910

286
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,540

00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,011

291
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,689

292
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,230
and register them all at the finance department.

293
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:23,430

304
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,621

He used to be a prosecutor.

334
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,600

335
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,999
to prepare for the search and seizure.

336

If they're distributing them to the employees,

339

Some of Navis' funds were transferred...

344
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,591
to an overseas corporation under the name of Ji Seung Don.

345
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,419
It may look like a normal contract,

346
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,989
but I think they're laundering money.

347
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,390

348
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:06,890

to help establish Jeokmok Foundation?

353
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,070
So I made a list of rich people who could afford such a sum...

354
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,769
and were related to Geumseong.

355

And one of them was Ji Seung Don.

356
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,880

357
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:28,450

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,581
He's almost 90 years old.

359
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:34,719
We had never heard of that name while we were in Jeokmok.

360
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,091
That means that we found something that's been hidden thus far.

361
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,989
I thought it'd be worth it to look into it,

362
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,690
considering they still use this.

363
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,459
I plan on investigating the people around Ji Seung Don.

364
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Actually,

365
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:46,061
I'll help.

366
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:47,871
What about the lawsuit?

367
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,801
The members of the local branches won't step up.

368
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,010
- Why not? - They've made prepayments.

369
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,940
They think they can't get it back if they file a complaint.

370
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,341
And Navis will give it back if they do nothing?

371
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,210
It's not like we can force them.

372
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,420
I'm going to visit the local branches myself.

373
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,460
You can use...

374
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:12,190
these towels,

375
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,331
but there's no room.

376
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,000
Contact Na Sa.

377
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,510
Come out.

378
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,480
- Right. - Right.

379
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:43,861
Na Sa!

380
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,160
Have you lost your mind? How did you get out?

381
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,131
I escaped.

382
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:54,571
Why did they dig it so deeply?

383
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:56,400
I could have died.

384
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:57,970
- Are you all right? - Yes.

385
00:22:58,341 --> 00:22:59,371
Fifty percent.

386
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,509
What are you talking about? Go back to the hospital!

387
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,541
That hurts. Come on. Stop nagging.

388
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,851
Leave him alone. He says he's fine.

389
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,381
Ro Um knows what I'm talking about.

390
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,720
What's with all the furniture?

391
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:18,020
This is better.

392
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,490
What?

393
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:22,531
You found nothing from Navis?

394
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:23,901
No.

395
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,259
But they must be scared.

396
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,970
How do they still keep them?

397
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,970
Is there a place they can hide them?

398
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,670
You saw the blueprint.

399
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:33,769
If it's inside the building, we're doomed.

400
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,739
We don't have anyone to cooperate with us.

401
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,110
Their security is tighter,

402
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:38,881
and our engineer isn't healthy.

403
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,311
Wait.

404
00:23:40,312 --> 00:23:42,550
What about the search and seizure when you sue them?

405
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,219
No one is willing to sue the company.

406
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,880
They're worried about losing their prepayments.

407
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:46,949
Gosh.

408
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,490
That's messed up.

409
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:51,620
Tell them that we'll pay them...

410
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,260
to sue the company together.

411
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,460
Do you think that makes sense?

412
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,330
Guys,

413
00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:02,871
come to think of it, we never drank together.

414
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:04,571
It's not even healthy.

415
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:06,910
You don't know anything.

416
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,381
We're like this because we don't drink.

417
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,310
- What's wrong with us? - We're super awkward!

418
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,950
Who would think that we've shared a room for ten years?

419
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,551
It's so suffocating.

420
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,220
Maybe you're just uncomfortable to be here sober.

421
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,260
Hey.

422
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:30,561
Look at them. Their daily routine is like the one at prison.

423
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:33,630
Are you picking a fight or what?

424
00:24:33,631 --> 00:24:34,800
But it's true!

425
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:36,100
Am I right?

426
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,000
Maybe you should check it out too.

427
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:40,270
You could probably quit drinking.

428
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,840
I've been to prison for three months because of used cars.

429
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:46,080
Is that a brag?

430
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:47,680
It's a fact.

431
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,121
Won't we all go to prison after this?

432
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:53,351
Well, it's nothing.

433
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,791
Guys.

434
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:57,560
She and I are on probation.

435
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:00,429
Then, the judge will say to us, "Little punk!"

436
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,960
Can you please shut it?

437
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,831
Gosh.

438
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:07,170
What did he say?

439
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:10,041
He told you to go to sleep.

440
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,740
Gosh. Well, say it in Korean next time.

441
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,990
You took your time.

442
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,900
Why did you make such a mess?

443
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,670
What should I have done?

444
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:43,499
Let Ma Kang Soo kill me?

445
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,101
Sit around doing nothing, lose the whole company,

446
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:49,469
realize what happened after wrap-up, and get ditched?

447
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,940
We picked up Director Ma's phone.

448
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:56,281
We heard your conversation with Lee Ro Um.

449
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:58,151
With Ma gone,

450
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,990
you should take responsibility.

451
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:17,270
If I die...

452
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,770
or go to prison,

453
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,311
the world...

454
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,450
will learn a great deal.

455
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,750
Is that a threat?

456
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,720
A threat, a deal.

457
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,719
Bring me a plan that'll get me out of the country within a week.

458
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,690
Do that, and once again,

459
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,960
I'll become a loyal servant.

460
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,215
Isn't it rough staying at the auto shop?

461
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:36,725
It is, isn't it?

462
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,555
Not even you can predict everything...

463
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:41,126
and prepare for it.

464
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,695
You must've been startled.

465
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,596
And worried about the comic book store.

466
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,666
Did you never consider this?

467
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:54,005
Each time we gain someone you call a teammate,

468
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,945
each time we consider someone...

469
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:00,485
you call a victim,

470
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:04,685
we gain more weaknesses.

471
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:08,656
There's only one reason I failed ten years ago.

472
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,896
It wasn't my stupidity,

473
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,326
Jang Kyung Ja's betrayal,

474
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,425
or misfortune.

475
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:18,235
It was because I wanted to protect someone.

476
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:25,836
At this rate,

477
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:28,346
we'll lose.

478
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:31,376
Because of the people we call friends.

479
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:33,146
Trying to protect them all.

480
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:34,945
You're right.

481
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:37,755
Protecting someone and becoming a team.

482
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:39,886
It's tough.

483
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:43,396
But we got this far, which means you're strong.

484
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:45,326
Not because I egged you on.

485
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:48,895
Without the courage, who'd have sided with all these people...

486
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,465
to fight for each other?

487
00:28:53,735 --> 00:28:54,965
This isn't courage.

488
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:56,876
We're just a gang.

489
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:00,945
Admitting we need each other...

490
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,876
takes great courage.

491
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:05,816
I couldn't do that long ago.

492
00:29:06,886 --> 00:29:07,886
When?

493
00:29:10,086 --> 00:29:11,386
When my mother left.

494
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,525
I'd had a chance to make her stay.

495
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:19,454
A chance to ask her...

496
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:22,326
to stay and fight with me for me, and to get through it.

497
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,435
But I didn't have the guts to say it.

498
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:26,866
Truth be told,

499
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:31,705
I wasn't sure I could get through it.

500
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:39,014
You chose the option that helped...

501
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:40,945
not just yourself but everyone else.

502
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:44,785
Thanks to you, we'll become stronger...

503
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:46,386
and tougher.

504
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:51,856
Is that the better outcome?

505
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:54,195
Possibly?

506
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,705
Because until we win, we'll fight together.

507
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:03,366
For each other.

508

512
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:56,185
You know, the one Jay used to use.

513
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,425
- The Eldenbridge one? - Yes.

514
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:03,565
Can you get an identical one?

515
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:04,566
Why?

516
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:07,836
What for?

517
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,175
To switch with Jang Kyung Ja's.

518
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:12,035
Is that Ro Um's idea?

519
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:16,505
Is that even possible? She carries it everywhere.

520
00:31:16,646 --> 00:31:18,475
I'll ask Jay.

521
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:22,985
Would he help?

522
00:31:23,245 --> 00:31:24,616
I'll ask at least.

523
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:26,755
Can you get me one?

524
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:28,425
It's really old.

525
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:33,396
I'll make a few calls and ask around.

526
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:34,826
Thank you.

527
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,735
Let's go. Ro Um will be waiting.

The result might, though.

533

725
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:37,955
you had to see this. How embarrassing.

726
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,526
- No, it's okay. - I must've been out of my mind.

727
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,196
I must've been totally out of my mind.

728
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,666
I had no idea that it was a scam.

729
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,236
I can help you now, Mother.

730
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:52,535
So put your worries to rest.

731
00:42:53,776 --> 00:42:55,845
Your son is a lawyer. What's there to worry about?

732
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:01,685
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:30,106
(Kang Kyung Ho)

734
00:43:34,685 --> 00:43:35,716
Yes.

735
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,256
I did the right thing.

736
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,455
I did the best I could do.

737
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:46,155
Darn it.

738
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:07,646
Han Moo Young.

739
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:57,896
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:20,285
Thanks for coming.

741
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,055
What did you want to ask me?

742
00:45:22,885 --> 00:45:24,525
You said last time...

743
00:45:24,526 --> 00:45:26,655
that we all owed Ro Um.

744
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,696
That occurred to me.

745
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,166
I need you to bring Ms. Jang's lighter.

746
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:39,305
The lighter? Why?

747
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:41,546
To settle my debt with Ro Um.

748
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:44,916
Don't you want to repay her for the last time?

749
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:46,615
Repay Ro Um, I mean.

750
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:17,646
Did you do this?

751
00:46:20,676 --> 00:46:21,745
Yes.

752
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:26,356
My fever is gone, thanks to you.

753
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:31,495
Did the talk go well?

754
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,126
Yes.

755
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,236
The group is ready.

756
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:42,905
I'm going to finish it.

757
00:46:45,276 --> 00:46:46,276
So are we.

758
00:46:47,535 --> 00:46:48,646
We're almost ready.

759
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:01,639
You're visiting a sick person.

760
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:04,237
Where are the flowers?

761
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,869
I've come to give you one last chance.

762
00:47:08,979 --> 00:47:09,979
Turn yourself in.

763
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,817
What are the terms?

764
00:47:16,818 --> 00:47:20,119
Why do you need terms when you're paying for your sins?

765
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,358
They're not my sins.

766
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:27,258
I was used just like Ro Um was.

767
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,599
Then, come clean and tell us the mastermind.

768
00:47:30,758 --> 00:47:33,729
Who ordered you to swindle hundreds of thousands of people?

769
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:35,298
If you don't tell us the truth,

770
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:38,369
that's your fault aside from the president.

771
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:40,108
No one took advantage of you.

772
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:41,878
You think I'm evil, don't you?

773
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:44,139
I think you're a criminal.

774
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:47,849
If I hadn't been born as myself,

775
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:50,079
I wouldn't have led this life.

776
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:53,389
Someone would have taken my place if not me,

777
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:56,318
and I was merely doing my job in my position.

778
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,858
I worked very hard...

779
00:47:58,659 --> 00:47:59,659
to survive.

780
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:01,999
I was expecting at least a hint of responsibility.

781
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:03,699
But it was a waste of time.

782
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:06,127
My survival is my priority.

783
00:48:06,128 --> 00:48:07,769
What's the point of all this when I'm dead?

784
00:48:10,738 --> 00:48:12,408
Did it ever occur to you...

785
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:14,778
that catching the president was the safest way?

786
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:18,309
There's a world that you're not aware of.

787
00:48:18,548 --> 00:48:20,809
I don't know about you,

788
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:24,119
but I like you.

789
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:26,019
We have something in common.

790
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:27,449
Do we?

791
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:31,288
We both gave our hearts to people...

792
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:32,588
who would never reciprocate.

793
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:38,429
I'll see you in court.

794
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:40,429
If you're lucky, that is.

795
00:48:48,938 --> 00:48:50,338
Are you still working on it with her?

796
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,208
Ro Um's revenge.

797
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:56,548
Can you go as far as to kill a man?

798
00:48:57,878 --> 00:48:58,988
For Ro Um.

799
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:02,019
You must think that's a good deed.

800
00:49:02,688 --> 00:49:04,519
Just like ten years ago,

801
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:07,358
you will never be able to help her.

802
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,999
You'd be too busy trying to save Ms. Jang, anyway.

803
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,568
Not that I believe that you truly want to save her.

804
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:28,548
I contacted Ji Seung Don's son in the US.

805
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:33,188
Mr. Ji did donate all his fortune to Jeokmok Foundation.

806
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:35,218
That's why they grew apart,

807
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:37,119
and it's been years since the family cut off ties.

808
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:41,229
And they got a similar call looking for him ten years ago.

809
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:43,957
I reckon it was An Chae Hong.

810
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,797
They got a bill from a hospital that they had never heard of,

811
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:48,539
so they told Ji Seung Don about it.

812
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,269
Could it have been from Hyeseung Hospital?

813
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,638
The one that Hong Chang Ki drove An Chae Hong to.

814
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,667
Right.

815
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:55,178
We couldn't find anything as it was closed...

816
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:56,639
when we tried to look into it.

817
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:58,608
Anyway, they figured out from the bill...

818
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:01,749
that Ji Seung Don was in the VIP room in a vegetative state.

819
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:04,578
Who hospitalized him without telling his family?

820
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:06,789
He did have a caregiver.

821
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:09,858
An orphan from the orphanage that Ji had been sponsoring.

822
00:50:10,818 --> 00:50:11,889
That's all I know.

823
00:50:14,628 --> 00:50:16,897
Mr. Woo said he'd check out that orphanage.

824
00:50:16,898 --> 00:50:18,568
To see if he can find anything.

825
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:19,898
Okay.

826
00:50:20,298 --> 00:50:22,768
The members of Navis Well-being under the controversy...

827
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,707
of stock price manipulation and mass recall...

828
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:28,909
have sued the company for damages.

829
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:30,938
Other than similar deposit-taking, default on an obligation,

830
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:33,909
and violation of the Door to Door Sales Act,

831
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,377
they're also suspected of embezzlement and breach of trust.

832
00:50:36,378 --> 00:50:37,718
We've currently requested that they be forbidden...

833
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:39,788
from leaving the country and be seized and searched.

834
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:42,487
The plaintiff's counsel, Park Cue,

835
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:44,288
has submitted the complaint...

836
00:50:44,289 --> 00:50:46,857
of claiming one million dollars for damages...

837
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:49,027
on behalf of about 150 victims at the Seoul Central District Court.

838
00:50:49,028 --> 00:50:51,158
The Financial Crimes Unit of Seoul Police Agency...

839
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:54,468
has announced to request a search warrant...

840
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:58,268
on the head office and branches of Navis Well-being.

841
00:50:58,269 --> 00:51:00,108
We're here to execute a warrant.

842
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:16,818
This way.

843
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:23,698
What?

844
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:24,729
(Finance Department)

845
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:26,929
What's going on?

846
00:51:28,398 --> 00:51:30,568
We got a tip that there was a secret room.

847
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:33,638
I asked the members of the local branches,

848
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:35,108
and they all said the same thing.

849
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:36,737
The branch representatives told them...

850
00:51:36,738 --> 00:51:39,348
to send documents to the head office by express delivery too.

851
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:42,418
Some of the members had family members at the head office.

852
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:44,018
They were told to submit the documents and hard drives...

853
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:45,448
to the finance department.

854
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:48,588
Good. The rooms that were different from the floor plan.

855
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:50,888
The finance department on the second floor...

856
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:51,889
and between the pillars.

857
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:53,258
A secret room?

858
00:51:53,688 --> 00:51:55,357
Yes. It's probably a fake wall.

859
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:56,929
A non-destructive device will do the trick.

860
00:51:58,099 --> 00:51:59,999
(Fire Shutter)

861
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:06,969
Empty space confirmed, sir.

862
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:08,338
Open it.

863
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:09,938
How do I open it?

864
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,448
The police have arrested...

865
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:17,218
the financial director, Kim, without a warrant...

866
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:19,789
while searching the head office of Navis Well-being.

867
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:23,718
From the secret room of the building,

868
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,588
various flash drives, hard drives, and confidential papers were found.

869
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:31,098
There was also a bribe ledger with the names of officials...

870
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:32,599
in politics, the financial world, and the police.

871
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:36,797
At that moment, the pyramid scheme...

872
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:38,269
turned into the so-called Navisgate.

873
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:41,139
Navis Well-being's multilevel marketing...

874
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:43,978
of gift cards and membership businesses...

875
00:52:43,979 --> 00:52:45,507
is estimated to have caused...

876
00:52:45,508 --> 00:52:48,548
damages of at least hundreds of millions of dollars.

877
00:52:48,878 --> 00:52:51,448
The prosecution has announced to form a task force...

878
00:52:51,449 --> 00:52:53,187
to begin investigating...

879
00:52:53,188 --> 00:52:56,219

I'm the district attorney of the Central Prosecutors' Office.

883
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:07,769
Yes, sir.

884
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:10,268
A notice has been sent to you.

885
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:11,298
Read it and come back to Seoul.

886
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:14,838
Yes, sir.

890
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:56,619
Okay.

891
00:53:58,648 --> 00:53:59,848
I'm going out.

892
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:01,918
Where are you headed?

893
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:04,159
To see Jay. He'll give me the lighter.

894
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:05,458
Are you wearing the watch?

895
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:07,389
You bet.

896
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,059
Send a signal right away so I can trace you.

897
00:54:09,128 --> 00:54:10,228
I will.

00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:12,099

899
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,668

00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:51,869
Find Jay.

906
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:53,798
Sorry?

907
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:56,668
Jay. Find him.

908
00:55:57,139 --> 00:55:58,508
Locate him right away.

909
00:55:58,838 --> 00:55:59,908
You'll be late.

910
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:02,409
- If you miss the flight... - Turn the car around!

911
00:56:09,878 --> 00:56:10,918
Where are the others?

912
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:13,818
Ring Go went to see Jay.

913
00:56:14,048 --> 00:56:15,318
I don't know about the others.

914
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:17,059
Why would Ring Go meet Jay?

915
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:18,628
The lighter.

916
00:56:19,028 --> 00:56:20,789
Jay said he'd give it to him.

917
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:22,358
What lighter?

918
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:27,898
Shoot. I knew it.

919
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:30,938
(Lee Ro Um)

920
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:36,278
The call cannot be connected.

921
00:56:44,349 --> 00:56:45,349
Hey.

922
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:47,648
Hi, Moo Young. I wanted to ask you something.

923
00:56:48,048 --> 00:56:50,388
The second trial will be on a much larger scale.

924
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:52,487
I'd like to find a firm to partner with.

925
00:56:52,488 --> 00:56:54,528
- What do you think? - Oh, I see.

926
00:56:55,729 --> 00:56:56,828
Let's do that.

927
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:58,929
Did you hear from Mr. Kang?

928
00:56:59,168 --> 00:57:00,429
No, not recently.

929
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:02,999
He asked for your address, so I gave it to him.

930
00:57:03,499 --> 00:57:04,538
Did you?

931
00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:06,468
Watch out what you say to him.

932
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:09,039
If he realizes you're working with Lee Ro Um,

933
00:57:09,938 --> 00:57:11,309
he could be quite upset.

934
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:13,308
How does he know about Ro Um?

935
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:14,978
Because you mentioned Jeokmok...

936
00:57:14,979 --> 00:57:17,349
and talked about conning them and whatnot.

937
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:20,148
I never mentioned Ro Um to him.

938
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:22,088
Where did he hear about Jeokmok, then?

939
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:24,018
We talked about Ro Um...

940
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:25,528
because he brought her up.

941
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:29,858
I'll call you back.

Jay.

946

Where's the lighter?

947
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,168
Thank you.

948
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:26,508
Okay.

949
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:31,818
What's that?

950
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:35,618
I'll return it to Ro Um.

951
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:37,019
Why bother?

952
00:59:59,249 --> 01:00:00,778
Do you have any questions?

953
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:05,818
My name is...

954
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:09,688
Mr. Kang.

955
01:00:13,289 --> 01:00:14,389
Come in.

956
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:22,238
It's hard, isn't it?

957
01:00:35,949 --> 01:00:37,079
Did you see this?

958
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:38,719

Hello.

Da Jung.

972
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,639
I just sent a photo.

973
01:01:33,168 --> 01:01:35,479
The orphan who looked after Ji Seung Don.

974
01:01:37,438 --> 01:01:38,978

975
01:01:38,979 --> 01:01:39,979

Is it in there?

977
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:50,119
The president's identity.

01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:55,429

990

991

994
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:38,858
I listened to you, and I think it has only made me weaker.

995

Don't go alone. Please, Ro Um.

996
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,897
I'll take responsibility.

997
01:03:42,898 --> 01:03:45,098
I'll put an end to this. I must.

998
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:46,868

1003
01:04:01,148 --> 01:04:03,358
You could say he's unique?

1004
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:06,588
An attention seeker who wants to look mysterious.

1005
01:04:07,028 --> 01:04:09,828
