00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,649
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:52,988
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:54,219
(Child actors filmed in safety.)

4
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,419
(Episode 9)

5
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:48,447
You didn't check the flash drive?

6
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:50,218
I did.

7
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:52,287
- And the contents? - That too.

8
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,587
And you're still doing this?

9
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:59,458
What do you want me to do, then?

10
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,497
Why did you leave that for me?

11
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:07,137
Out of pity.

12
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:10,108
Not knowing that we conned your family and ruined it,

13
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:12,708
you wanted to help and even join us.

14
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:15,178
I felt sorry for you.

15
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,708
So did I.

16
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:20,678
I'm doing this out of pity for you.

17
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:24,387
Take a shower.

18
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:28,458
Do you forgive someone for anything if you pity them?

19
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:30,757
Do you want to talk?

20
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:32,757
Then we can talk.

21
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:34,897
There's no need to be angry.

22
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:39,298
What about the gun?

23
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:41,938
Did you really shoot Na Sa?

24
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:45,908
Yes.

25
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:47,678
Is that why you took it?

26
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:50,347
I took it to get rid of whoever got in the way,

27
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,717
and he got in the way.

28
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:55,548
Mr. Ko is looking for him right now.

29
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,458
He'll be searching the hotel.

30
00:02:58,918 --> 00:02:59,958
Did you kill Na Sa?

31
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:01,258
If so, tell me.

32
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:03,328
I'll call the police, not your probation officer.

33
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:27,347
Hello?

34
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:29,147
I got Ro Um back safely.

35
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:32,717
Thank you, Da Jung.

36
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:39,258
Take a seat.

37
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,728
You won't see a doctor.

38
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:44,858
I can't go to sleep like that. Come here.

39
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:56,367
Who hit you this badly?

40
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:00,338
I don't know his name.

41
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:14,288
Why are you staring?

42
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:19,697
You didn't answer yet.

43
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:23,028
Why are you doing this to me?

44
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:26,968
I always answered.

45
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:43,088
If you showed that to me,

46
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,387
did you think it would be the end?

47
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:51,957
Did you think I'd give up...

48
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:54,658
if you revealed the truth behind a case...

49
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:57,067
you can no longer be prosecuted for?

50
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,937
I will never ask to be forgiven as someone who has harmed others.

51
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,807
Isn't revealing one's past wrongdoings...

52
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:07,307
a way of apologizing?

53
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:11,048
To be honest, I was angry, and I felt betrayed,

54
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:13,778
so I was torn.

55
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:16,447
But then I thought it wasn't...

56
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:19,218
the fault of a 14-year-old kid.

57
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:24,557
Now I'm even more sure of it.

58
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:27,528
My reason to go all the way.

59
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,228
That's why I'm sorry...

60
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:32,338
I took so long.

61
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:13,408
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

62
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:38,298
The other day, you were all eager, talking about an arrest warrant.

63
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:40,197
What are you doing?

64
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:41,497
(Personal Details of Offender)

65
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:42,637
Your client is here.

66
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:14,968
I know everything about you now.

67
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:16,038
Not really.

68
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:19,038
And you know everything about me too.

69
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:20,307
I don't think so.

70
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:23,848
Don't you think we're in this together?

71
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:26,877
Not really.

72
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:30,048
- Technically, I'm your guardian... - Probation officer.

73
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:34,918
Goodness. This is so awkward.

74
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:38,728
Professor Shin said she acted as an advisor for a short while.

75
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:43,668
As far as I know, she doesn't lie.

76
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,997
The problem is that she does bad things without shame.

77
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:52,108
Did she hurt you a lot?

78
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:54,238
My mother.

79
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:03,817
I had a few sessions with her upon joining the foundation,

80
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:05,757
but nothing after that.

81
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,997
On my mother's behalf,

82
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,827
I'd like to apologize.

83
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:25,038
You see, I wish my mother could change for the better.

84
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:31,947
I'll just be a worse son than I already am.

85
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,788
Gosh, why is everyone apologizing to me?

86
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:40,987
You people have no reason to apologize to me.

87
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:46,128
I think it's all because of your attitude.

88
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:50,268
You know what you did wrong.

89
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:54,837
You won't try to lure others into the muddy swamp you're stuck in.

90
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,408
Mr. Han said...

91
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:02,378
someone should go to your rescue and pull you out of there.

92
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:04,908
And I...

93
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:07,278
agree with him.

94
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:13,258
You know you can't go over a month, right?

95
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:16,028
(Train Ticket)

96
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:23,567
I'll think that you're coming back.

97
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:28,467
Okay.

98
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:51,788
She said she wanted the earliest train regardless of destination.

99
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,737
Why are you all quiet? Did you two fight?

100
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,668
No, we did not. She'll need some time.

101
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:08,278
She understands the rules and knows to return within a month,

102
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:12,118
but she can easily change her address if she reports it.

103
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:17,388
She will come back, won't she?

104
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,087
What's going on with Na Su Ho?

105
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:23,727
Well, he's fallen off the face of the earth.

106
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,827
But I'm trying to track him down, so don't worry.

107
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:32,437
Anyway, aren't I too nice?

108
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:34,668
Because of your request,

109
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:37,168
I searched that huge hotel.

110
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,778
When they asked for a civil servant,

111
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,937
I ignored them and kept running around for two hours straight.

112
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:43,678
Today, we received complaints at the center,

113
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:45,378
so I had to submit a written apology.

114
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,518
Gosh, my wrist still hurts.

115
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,987
I didn't think you'd search the place in such a dumb manner.

116
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:59,028
Thanks, and sorry.

117
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:00,028
All right.

118
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,768
Oh, I wanted to ask you something.

119
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:05,067
What is it?

120
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:11,638
I've been struggling to fall asleep at night.

121
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,878
Do you know who is to blame?

122
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,807
Are you going to blame that on me too?

123
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,408
Come on. Does everything have to be about you?

124
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:20,577
It's because of Professor Shin.

125
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:23,217
- I see. - Anyway, so...

126
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:28,457
If your psychiatrist is good,

127
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,857
could you put me in touch with her?

128
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:32,028
Is your insomnia that serious?

129
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:33,898
Gosh, don't even get me started.

130
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:35,158
You've never met Professor Shin, right?

131
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:38,837
If you ever have to pull an all-nighter, let me know.

132
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:41,937
I'll arrange a meeting with her for you.

133
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:24,307
(Lee Ro Um)

134
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:53,538
What about booze?

135
00:13:58,508 --> 00:13:59,548
Thanks.

136
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:03,587
Have you had a chance to think about what I said?

137
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,717
Isn't the deadline coming up?

138
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:09,528
Aren't you short-staffed?

139
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,298
Well, I have an idea of what's going on.

140
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:15,197
It's obvious.

141
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:17,597
What was your next move supposed to be?

142
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:21,197
Oh, I'm not sure.

143
00:14:21,197 --> 00:14:23,138
I was just told to steal the notebook...

144
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,378
What's in that notebook?

145
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,678
Jang Kyung Ja... I mean, didn't Ms. Jang tell you?

146
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:40,317
Hey, put in a good word for me with Ms. Jang.

147
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:44,057
Tell her I can do a good job with everything and that I'll be loyal.

148
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:52,197
You won't go back to Ro Um?

149
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:54,868
If I go back,

150
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:58,437
Ro Um will kill me first.

151
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,587
Miss, this is the last bus.

152
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:47,288
(Yusong Station)

153
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:56,998
(Subway Station Entrance)

154
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,508
Ma'am.

155
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,778
It gets warm if you shake it like this.

156
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,337
Shake it like this, okay?

157
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:10,408
And sit over there. It's too windy here.

158
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:12,248
Drink the coffee before it gets cold!

159
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:15,548
Thank you.

160
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:39,878
Don't you understand the situation?

161
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:45,618
From now on, the president will want to know what you are hiding.

162
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:49,187
The president will suspect you.

163
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:20,947
What was Ro Um after?

164
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:22,648
Who knows?

165
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,557
A few gold bars...

166
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:27,888
and jewellery, I guess.

167
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,987
It was our family's safe from my parents.

168
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,298
What could be in there?

169
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:35,057
How about you give me an answer...

170
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,967
that the president will accept?

171
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,168
You're asking the wrong person.

172
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:41,837
You should be asking Ro Um.

173
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,168
Can't you understand that wasting our time like this...

174
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:48,277
is exactly what she wants?

175
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,618
Would you like me to deliver those words to the president?

176
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,088
She probably thought...

177
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,818
that the ledger I handed over...

178
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:03,457
was in that vault.

179
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,997
Other than that, I don't see why she was after it.

180
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,197
Yes, that's my entire answer.

181
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:15,437
You can rush me all you want,

182
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:17,507
but I can't make up a story.

183
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,477
Mr. Ma will be out soon.

184
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:24,947
You must bring him to the company yourself.

185
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:29,918
Why is Mr. Ma...

186
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:33,388
joining my company?

187
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:37,928
The deadline is near, isn't it?

188
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:43,297
I can handle that myself.

189
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,937
I don't need him.

190
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:49,937
I'm afraid that it's not up to you.

191
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:52,808
Your next instructions...

192
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:55,378
will be sent via text message.

193
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:04,717
(Arrival)

194
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:16,967
You're Dr. Shin's student, right?

195
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:22,197
What a coincidence.

196
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:24,668
Are you going somewhere? The hair salon?

197
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:26,937
Church?

198
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:28,678
Or do you live around here?

199
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:30,007
It's a nice neighbourhood.

200
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:40,318
(Mo Jae In Mental Wellness Clinic)

201
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:44,628
Hello, Dr. Mo.

202
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:47,257
- Why do you keep... - Do you work here?

203
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:50,668
So, you're the doctor here.

204
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:53,037
Sorry. I'm afraid I can't.

205
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:54,697
What do you mean?

206
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:56,937
I'll recommend you another doctor.

207
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:59,078
Tell me the type of consultation you'd like.

208
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:01,808
I'd rather not get a recommendation from someone...

209
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:03,308
who has Dr. Shin as her mentor.

210
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:07,078
All the more reason for you not to consult me.

211
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:08,078
So,

212
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:11,987
why do I have such weak trust in my mother?

213
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,558
That's what I want to talk about.

214
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:15,257
There are many competent psychiatrists.

215
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,527
I don't expect much from psychiatrists.

216
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:18,727
All I need are listening ears.

217
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:20,058
Don't worry.

218
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:21,328
They all have ears.

219
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:22,797
(Dr. Choi Han Wook, Dr. Kwon Hyun Woo)

220
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:25,227
Why do you do that?

221
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,098
I do not give therapy to acquaintances.

222
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:29,937
Are we acquaintances?

223
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:33,078
Then, why don't we go outside and share a meal?

224
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:34,737
I know a sick budae jjigae place.

225
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:36,547
What's it going to be?

226
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:38,408
Public or private?

227
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,088
You're as straight as an arrow.

228
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,658
You're making me competitive.

229
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,757
Why do you try so hard to protect Dr. Shin?

230
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:51,358
I'm not trying to protect her.

231
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:55,358
I just don't want to talk about her with her son.

232
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:56,727
It's inappropriate.

233
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:01,838
Have you heard of the Jeokmok Kids?

234
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,237
Dr. Shin was a consultant to Jeokmok Foundation,

235
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:06,838
and she participated in selecting...

236
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:09,178
and raising the scholarship students into criminals.

237
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:13,348
You don't have to know the whole story.

238
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,187
You see,

239
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:19,047
I wasn't going to talk about Dr. Shin behind her back.

240
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,888
But is a doctor allowed to do that?

241
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:22,787
Answer me.

242
00:21:26,697 --> 00:21:27,727
They were prodigies,

243
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:30,297
but they were unstable due to their poor home environment.

244
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:33,537
I just don't get it.

245
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:36,437
What did you learn from her at school?

246
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:37,868
Was she even a good teacher?

247
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:46,078
Thank you.

248
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:49,187
You should take off that gown.

249
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:51,648
This is red soup.

250
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:59,027
Ma'am, can you get us an apron?

251
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:00,328
Sure.

252
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:03,297
Try arrowroot juice and massagers...

253
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:05,568
that will help enhance your stamina.

254
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,997
(Discount 30 percent)

255
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:09,507
Please try this massage gun.

256
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:11,207
It's...

257
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:13,178
Would you like to try...

258
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:19,477
Goodness.

259
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:21,648
You're adorable.

260
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:24,618
You're pretty good for a girl who's only worked here for a month.

261
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:25,747
Thank you.

262
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:29,017
I have something for your parents.

263
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:30,457
Here.

264
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:33,027
Bring them these.

265
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:35,328
Thank you.

266
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:38,128
But isn't it too much?

267
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:41,297
I only give these to diligent workers.

268
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:45,408
You know, you want to give good things to good people.

269
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:49,078
Also, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop,

270
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:52,078
but you asked the manager to get your payment in advance.

271
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:55,717
Well,

272
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:58,287
I had stuff going on at home.

273
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:01,787
Oh, I won't judge you!

274
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:04,658
We all have problems.

275
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:07,797
That reminds me.

276
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,668
Are you free tomorrow?

277
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:10,928
Tomorrow?

278
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:13,168
It's my day off.

279
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:18,037
There's a great lecture at the local community center.

280
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:19,437
You should come and check it out.

281
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:22,237
- A lecture? - Yes.

282
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:24,078
It won't take long.

283
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,178
And they even give out gift cards to this department store...

284
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:27,717
if you come.

285
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:31,588
It also helps with work.

286
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:32,588
Who knows?

287
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:34,517
They're looking for full-time employees at the head office.

288
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:37,987
That will be much better than this contract gig.

289
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,328
Right. Okay.

290
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:43,697
- Good. - I'll come.

291
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:44,697
Good.

292
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,797
- Thank you. - Sure.

293
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:52,007
Hi, Attorney Han.

294
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:54,078
What's your schedule?

295
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:56,378
I need you.

296
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:58,447
You sound determined.

297
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:00,747
I'm single, so I'm free.

298
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:02,078
You're lucky.

299
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:04,118
And I need an investigator.

300
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,818
I'd like to consult Prosecutor Ryu.

301
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:08,287
Prosecutor Ryu Jae Hyuk?

302
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:15,328
He's not that competent, though.

303
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,467
(The Prosecutor of the Year Award)

304
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,098
Yes, I can look into that.

305
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:21,767
Violations, legal flaws,

306
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:24,168
and any written complaints are good enough, right?

307
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:27,777
Who said so?

308
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:30,947
It was Mr. Woo, wasn't it?

309
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:32,848
Is he with you?

310
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:36,947
Hi.

311
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:41,217
What's an old man like you doing where the cool kids are?

312
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:42,217
Well,

313
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:44,128
I had...

314
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:47,128
a traumatic experience of being ostracised.

315
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:48,497
It's nice to see you.

316
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,027
What are all these?

317
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:53,737
I gathered the materials that I had...

318
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:55,797
and the ones from Mr. Woo.

319
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:57,808
You can read them all here,

320
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,138
and I don't want the documents to leak.

321
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:02,908
I finally get to see it.

322
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:05,447
I brought some materials about Navis Well-being.

323
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:07,118
It's not much,

324
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:08,918
but here are the printed documents.

325
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:11,517
But it's the smart generation.

326
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:13,287
This is the problem with bar exam passers.

327
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:14,618
Here.

328
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:17,058
This is called a projector. It's the latest model.

329
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,388
I'm going to use this.

330
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:19,727
And I prepared for my presentation all night.

331
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:21,197
Gosh.

332
00:25:21,197 --> 00:25:24,467
Anyway, Jeokmok and Navis Well-being are all in it together?

333
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:26,398
The guy they call the president is at the top?

334
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:27,737
Yes.

335
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:29,608
One more thing.

336
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,267
Darusa International.

337
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:32,507
What?

338
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:35,108
But the CEO of Darusa International went to prison.

339
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:36,477
Yes. His name is Ma Kang Soo.

340
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:38,648
He's like the travelling salesman for Jeokmok.

341
00:25:39,648 --> 00:25:41,947
In 2007, he was the head of the financial department.

342
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:45,148
And he led the supply fraud, which was the first job...

343
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:47,118
that the Jeokmok Kids took on.

344
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:51,388
"Moyang Food factory fraud."

345
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:54,527
Yes, that was Darusa International ten years ago.

346
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:57,727
The plant manager took all the blame for it,

347
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:58,898
and the company went bankrupt.

348
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:02,237
That's right. The manager was Han Jae Seok.

349
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:04,608
He's my father.

350
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:13,648
Ma Kang Soo was the only person...

351
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:15,148
who was involved with all the projects of Jeokmok...

352
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:16,517
except for Navis Well-being.

353
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:18,348
If he gets out of prison...

354
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:20,088
and joins Navis Well-being,

355
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:22,257
we can overturn Jeokmok...

356
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:24,358
just by investigating him.

357
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:27,527
But he got ten years in prison.

358
00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:30,227
Doesn't he still have years left?

359
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:32,797
He was recently released on parole.

360
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:33,937
I quit.

361
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:36,608
(Daejin Prison)

362
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:41,908
I brought you a separate car in case you'd be uncomfortable.

363
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:47,017
I'm not uncomfortable.

364
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,628
I heard you got it wrong.

365
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:05,628
By Lee Ro Um.

366
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:08,598
Isn't she something?

367
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:12,537
When was it? Was it 15 years ago?

368
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:16,148
She was so smart even then. I was shocked and impressed.

369
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:21,977
Can't we get her back...

370
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:24,388
to work at Navis Well-being?

371
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:31,088
You look quite different compared to...

372
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:32,928
when we last met.

373
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:41,497
What a lovely day.

374
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:50,719
What do you know about Navis Well-being?

375
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,028
It's a pyramid scheme, typical of Jeokmok businesses.

376
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,659
You're right.

377
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:59,768
But Navis is unique in that it employs...

378
00:27:59,768 --> 00:28:02,568
both a private and a company pyramid.

379
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:04,669
They're reversed.

380
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:08,109
Members on the lowest level have access to the fewest brands.

381
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:11,078
A private member of the highest level...

382
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:13,879
can buy anything on any level at a member's discount,

383
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:16,048
but that's what they want people to think.

384
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:20,488
How much you must spend to climb a level,

385
00:28:20,488 --> 00:28:22,619
or how much profit a member actually makes...

386
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,459
is not known.

387
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,959
But it's a legal company.

388
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:28,629
Let's think objectively.

389
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:31,359
If we didn't know about Jeokmok and stuff,

390
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,598
would they look dangerous? I say no.

391
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,768
It's one of the most successful companies right now,

392
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:39,199
and it's too well-known and out in the open.

393
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:42,038
Yes, there are some big and small legal suits,

394
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:44,639
but companies that size are rarely without such issues.

395
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:48,508
Not to mention most of the suits were settled or dropped.

396
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:52,449
I got this information from a friend who works at a web portal.

397
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:55,348
It's true that Navis Well-being spends a fortune on marketing...

398
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:57,818
related to search words and posts.

399
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:59,788
And they strictly monitor comments.

400
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:03,028
Products endorsed by celebrities and promoted by influencers...

401
00:29:03,028 --> 00:29:04,429
were said to have gone moldy,

402
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:08,768
and the machines used on skin was made with shoddy materials.

403
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,038
But the uproar didn't last.

404
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:12,469
Like you said, no complaints actually led to a viable suit.

405
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:16,808
If this happened since the Jeokmok days,

406
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,278
could they have decade-old political or financial connections?

407
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:23,348
If we were to get prosecutors or the media involved,

408
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:25,119
what would we need?

409
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:28,219
A whistle-blower, at least.

410
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:30,719

411

That's a great question.

Navis Well-being has their own sniper, a veiled blogger.

431
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,979
It's "HOJUNG," a private blog.

432
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:33,818
But I have skills too, and I found some screencaps.

Yes.

This blogger's the most famous when it comes to pyramid schemes.

436
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:43,558
If you track the dates of the pieces I found, they attacked Navis...

437
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:46,258
since the early days as if they knew something was up.

438
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:48,229

00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:58,959
I've also had to pay for the products, so I'm broke now.

547
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:00,928
Ho Jung.

548
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:04,058
The creditors started harassing me this week.

549
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:07,899
- Please? - What do you want from me?

550
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:11,439
You clearly don't respect my privacy.

551
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:14,638
You followed me into the men's room...

552
00:39:15,368 --> 00:39:17,279
and are going on about your up-front payments and loans.

553
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:19,009
Why are you doing this?

554
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:23,009
Are you here to ask me to pay off your debt for you or what?

555
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:25,118
No, it's not that.

556
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:26,149
Seriously...

557
00:39:26,578 --> 00:39:27,919
I'd like to leave...

558
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:30,718
I want to cancel my membership.

559
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:33,419
You see, those up-front payments...

560
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,629
Who spent the money?

561
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:38,328
You asked for the money upfront and spent it.

562
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:41,069
And who took out the loans?

563
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:43,428
You did.

564
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:47,169
And you were the one who took all the products...

565
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:49,408
and failed to sell them.

566
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:53,879
You'll have to pay for all the products before you leave.

567
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:56,808
Why must you bother me like this?

568
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:57,948
But that's...

569
00:39:58,618 --> 00:39:59,879
I told you.

570
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:02,218
The interest on the private loan you helped me take out...

571
00:40:02,218 --> 00:40:04,788
has surpassed the principal.

572
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:07,658
As for the products,

573
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:10,899
I can't sell them as they have such a short shelf-life.

574
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,198
Please help me, sir.

575
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,569
Then...

576
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:21,908
as for the up-front payments, I'll pay them off little by little.

577
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:24,638
Please just let me cancel my membership.

578
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:28,549
Next month, there will be a new batch of products,

579
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:31,049
and I'll owe even more money then.

580
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:34,549
I want to stop.

581
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,759
Please let me stop, sir.

582
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:41,828
Aren't you an adult?

583
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:45,598
It's your life. Don't expect others to take responsibility for it.

584
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:49,268
You're so annoying.

585
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,348
Only then, you realize...

586
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:11,989
that something...

587
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:15,029
has gone really wrong.

588

(Sodamhae Gimbap)

589
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,319
Hello.

590
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:14,319
I'll have a bowl of ramyeon.

591
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,348
Sure.

592
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:17,359
One ramyeon, please!

593
00:42:23,689 --> 00:42:24,799
(Sodamhae Gimbap)

594
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:35,468
Enjoy.

595
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:42,078
What are you doing?

596
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:44,049
I just ordered.

597
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:46,518
Let's talk after I eat.

598
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:51,518
When I had sessions with teens in the past,

599
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:53,859
I told them to cherish and love themselves...

600
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:57,058
and gave them a card that said, "Love yourself."

601
00:42:57,428 --> 00:43:00,799
But once, one of them came to see me afterward.

602
00:43:01,098 --> 00:43:02,368
Do you know what they said?

603
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:04,069
"Doctor, you're annoying."

604
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:06,069
(Protecting Youth Mental Health)

605
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:09,709
"Even my parents have never once made me feel loved."

606
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:12,408
"So how could I cherish and love myself?"

607
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:15,748
They would have never known had you not told them.

608
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,549
I suggest you practice expressing your feelings.

609
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:22,419
I think you'll find it helpful, Ji Sun.

610
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:28,788
The kids have so much energy, don't they?

611
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:32,598
When they're playing, you can see that they're still kids.

612
00:43:32,928 --> 00:43:34,029
And I like that.

613
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,439
The kids here are so lucky to have you.

614
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,868
The kids on the outskirts can't enjoy such privileges.

615
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:42,839
They probably have more wounds and scars.

616
00:43:43,509 --> 00:43:44,578
Where is this place?

617
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:46,808
Let's visit a center in that area next time.

618
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:48,779
Where is it?

619
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:51,819
Many kids there are left neglected.

620
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:53,678
Either their parents won't let them go to the center,

621
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:55,248
or they have to work part-time.

622
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:57,288
They all have their own circumstances.

623
00:43:58,419 --> 00:43:59,589
It's odd, isn't it?

624
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:01,428
The system is there,

625
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:03,729
but the kids who really need it can't benefit from it.

626
00:44:04,828 --> 00:44:06,828
Who can look after them if they can't even do this?

627
00:44:07,928 --> 00:44:10,069
Take Lee Ro Um, for example.

628
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:12,069
She's incredibly smart.

629
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:14,638
When we were studying her,

630
00:44:14,638 --> 00:44:16,239
no one expected that she'd end up like this.

631
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:18,709
Study?

632
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:20,308
What are you talking about?

633
00:44:20,308 --> 00:44:23,779
The case study we did with Professor Shin on prodigies.

634
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:26,319
Don't you remember Lee Ro Um?

635
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:28,788
Lee Ro Um?

636
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:31,118
Every case was anonymous.

637
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:35,158
Who else was on TV as a prodigy with eidetic memory?

638
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:37,459
So we all knew that it was her.

639
00:44:38,828 --> 00:44:41,229
Lee Ro Um was on Professor Shin's show too.

640
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:43,569
There was that hacker too.

641
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:46,468
And the one who could speak multiple foreign languages. Remember?

642
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:48,408
Gosh, what was the case study called?

643
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,009
It had "prodigies" in the name.

644
00:44:52,178 --> 00:44:54,209
The Correlations Between the Physical Experience...

645
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:56,209
- and the Psychiatric Experience... - And the Psychiatric Experience...

646
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:57,549
- of Prodigies Born... - of Prodigies Born...

647
00:44:57,549 --> 00:44:59,419
- in Unfortunate Circumstances. - in Unfortunate Circumstances.

648
00:45:11,428 --> 00:45:12,799
Do you plan to live here from now on?

649
00:45:17,899 --> 00:45:18,968
Why are you here?

650
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:21,308
Now, you need me?

651
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:25,879
I always need you.

652
00:45:28,209 --> 00:45:30,408
What happened that day? What happened to Na Sa?

653
00:45:32,218 --> 00:45:34,248
- Do you think I killed him? - Yes.

654
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:36,989
That's what I'm suspecting.

655
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,489
He's not dead.

656
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:41,259
But I don't know where he is now.

657
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:44,198
What did he do so wrong that you had to shoot him?

658
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:48,529
Should Ring Go and I let you hold us hostage...

659
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:51,399
and drag us around for the rest of our lives?

660
00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:53,598
I've never held you guys hostage.

661
00:45:53,598 --> 00:45:55,109
We had no idea either.

662
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:01,408
You know more than we do...

663
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:03,748
about how the organization operates.

664
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:08,189
If we had said no even with a gun to our heads...

665
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:09,888
Sure.

666
00:46:10,959 --> 00:46:13,058
We wouldn't have ended up like this.

667
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:17,259
But you know what?

668
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:20,828
We were teenagers.

669
00:46:22,598 --> 00:46:24,368
We were normal kids.

670
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:28,209
We were afraid,

671
00:46:29,038 --> 00:46:31,109
and we couldn't wait to go back to our families.

672
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:38,348
So was I.

673
00:46:40,118 --> 00:46:41,288
Ten years ago...

674
00:46:42,248 --> 00:46:43,348
and at the hotel.

675
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:48,328
I wanted to get what I needed...

676
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:52,899
and end it.

677
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:54,669
That's why I did it.

678
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:00,098
Why do you think we helped you?

679
00:47:03,638 --> 00:47:05,178
Because you promised us money?

680
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:07,379
No.

681
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:10,348
We were all haunted by guilt.

682
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:13,649
That's why we did our best to cooperate.

683
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:23,089
Even if there wasn't money involved,

684
00:47:25,558 --> 00:47:28,029
wouldn't you want to get revenge on Jeokmok?

685
00:47:29,468 --> 00:47:31,268
You really don't understand us, do you?

686
00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:36,339
No matter how angry we are,

687
00:47:37,578 --> 00:47:40,308
we're not bold enough to go against Jeokmok.

688
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:42,779
We did it for you.

689
00:47:54,158 --> 00:47:55,158
Then,

690
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:00,558
what should I do to work with you again?

691
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:08,669
It's been ten years,

692
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:17,408
and I still feel like we're locked up.

693
00:48:21,919 --> 00:48:23,518
I want to stop feeling that way.

694
00:48:27,629 --> 00:48:28,989
I don't want to go back...

695
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,428
to when we were struggling to survive.

696
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:33,498
Can't we just be a team together?

697
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:45,509
When your parents passed away,

698
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:50,109
we collected their bodies...

699
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:53,078
and held a small funeral.

700
00:48:56,288 --> 00:48:58,359
Ring Go had been taking care of their graves.

701
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:01,129
I just...

702
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:06,899
I just want you...

703
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,098
to acknowledge us.

704
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:16,908
And I'm sorry.

705
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:19,439
I realized that I never told you that.

00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,838
"and he can speak multiple languages as fluently as a native..."

727
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:40,137
"without education."

728
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:41,508
Then,

729
00:50:42,238 --> 00:50:45,008
do you believe that the depression we find from them...

730
00:50:45,307 --> 00:50:47,307
is caused by their family background?

731
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:50,878
Yes. There are numerous studies that prove that children...

732
00:50:50,878 --> 00:50:54,448
with an unstable mentality show little academic achievements.

733
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:57,818
Prodigies are far more intellectual than others,

734
00:50:57,818 --> 00:51:00,028
but they can be more sensitive to external stimulus.

735
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:02,128
So, I believe combining psychotherapy...

736
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:06,068
and meticulously controlled education will help.

737
00:51:07,528 --> 00:51:09,968
Dr. Shin was a consultant to Jeokmok Foundation,

738
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:11,508
and she participated in selecting...

739
00:51:11,508 --> 00:51:13,807
and raising the scholarship students into criminals.

740
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:17,608
But is a doctor allowed to do that?

741
00:51:18,448 --> 00:51:19,508
Answer me.

742
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:26,918
(This may lead to self-denial and excessively trying to reward...)

743
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,198

744
00:51:41,937 --> 00:51:43,468

745
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,168
How are you feeling?

746
00:51:46,468 --> 00:51:48,738
I'm all good. How about you?

747
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,477
Me too.

748
00:51:52,148 --> 00:51:55,117
We could have been in serious trouble this time, right?

749
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:09,597
Didn't I give you my card that time?

750
00:52:12,097 --> 00:52:13,968
Even so, you called Dr. Shin...

751
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:16,367
and told her that I had left my wallet in your car?

752
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:20,108
I got scolded, thanks to you.

753
00:52:20,108 --> 00:52:22,707
For riding her student's car when I had just met her.

754
00:52:23,238 --> 00:52:24,307
Gosh.

755
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:29,178
But she's definitely not in the position to scold me now.

756
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:31,648
I had no other choice. I apologize.

757
00:52:33,247 --> 00:52:34,318
Fine.

758
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:37,088
What was so urgent?

759
00:52:39,758 --> 00:52:41,327
About what you told me last time.

760
00:52:42,698 --> 00:52:45,668
Was one of the prodigies Ro Um?

761
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:48,168
The prodigy with eidetic memory?

762
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:52,637
Yes.

763
00:52:59,948 --> 00:53:01,048
(Mo Jae In's notes)

764
00:53:04,378 --> 00:53:05,787
I just remembered them.

765
00:53:06,887 --> 00:53:09,258
There was a study group about prodigies...

766
00:53:09,988 --> 00:53:11,988
in Dr. Shin's class when I was in school.

767
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,758
The subjects were anonymous.

768
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:17,657
I only heard about them through the recordings.

769
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:20,827
So I couldn't connect the dots even when you told me.

770
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:24,497
But I somehow got to read the case study files.

771
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:29,738
Now, I finally realized that those were who you meant.

772
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:34,307
What was the study group for?

773
00:53:34,747 --> 00:53:37,778
It was to help prodigies adapt to new learning environments.

774
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:40,548
They were too stressed out...

775
00:53:40,548 --> 00:53:42,488
due to their poor family environments.

776
00:53:42,488 --> 00:53:43,488
So,

777
00:53:45,387 --> 00:53:46,858
I reckoned it'd help to put them...

778
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:48,858
in a completely different environment.

779
00:53:50,258 --> 00:53:52,068
And that was the conclusion that the group reached.

780
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,037
I didn't know what happened after that,

781
00:53:56,097 --> 00:53:57,238
which would sound like an excuse.

782
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:01,937
The reason I called you is...

783
00:54:03,238 --> 00:54:05,448
that I want to know...

784
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:08,418
exactly what happened to them in detail.

785
00:54:09,178 --> 00:54:10,747
Why do you want to know?

786
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,318
I was merely studying at the time, but for them,

787
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:16,718
their lives have changed.

788
00:54:19,227 --> 00:54:21,898
Though it's late, I don't want to just look past it.

789
00:54:22,557 --> 00:54:24,258
It's a very disturbing story.

790
00:54:24,258 --> 00:54:25,867
If it's so disturbing,

791
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,137
I believe it's fair...

792
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,437
that I at least let it deprive me of sleep.

793
00:54:33,238 --> 00:54:35,738
Okay. Let's do it.

794
00:54:36,508 --> 00:54:38,847
I heard about this from Han Moo Young, anyway.

795
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:41,678
Han Moo Young?

796
00:54:42,117 --> 00:54:43,517
Didn't I tell you?

797
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:46,847
I'm a friend of his.

798
00:54:47,747 --> 00:54:49,318
He recommended you.

799
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:54,787
In the end, you were also six or fewer connections away.

The blog I mentioned.

803
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:16,278
I managed to borrow an ID to gain access,

804
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:18,517
but the last post is dated a year ago.

805
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:20,548
And the archive is empty.

807
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:24,787
that's not what's important.

808
00:55:25,157 --> 00:55:27,387

You're still alive.

909
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:30,307
I'll go back to them.

910
01:03:30,778 --> 01:03:32,707
I don't think it has gotten better.

911
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:34,747
I want to introduce someone.

912
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,148
Who?

913
01:03:36,148 --> 01:03:37,818
Someone to help us from now on.
