(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,400
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,131
Ms. Lee.

4
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,400
Who's that?

5
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,040
What on earth have you done?

6
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:03,811
Commit fraud.

7
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,281
Why?

8
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,910
That's what I do.

9
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,880
What did you do while I got this?

10
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,320
Did you shed a few buckets of tears?

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,060
Who's at the door?

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,541
Han Moo Young the lawyer!

13
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,141
Who is it?

14
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:36,170
Let's talk!

15
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:45,821
How did you...

16
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,121
It's fine.

17
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:50,421
Han! Moo! Young!

18
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,421
Come out or I'll come in!

19
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,531
Don't.

20
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:05,570
What do you want?

21
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,311
Do you know you're pretty weird,

22
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:11,311
Mr. Han?

23
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,981
You're the weirdest lawyer I know.

24
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,951
- What? - Why?

25
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:23,451
Why are you inhaling and exhaling at such a rapid pace?

26
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,831
I did some hurried cleaning up.

27
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:29,930
The place was a mess.

28
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,231
For me?

29
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,460
To let me in?

30
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,930
- What? - But then,

31
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:37,801
I spared time from my busy schedule to bring you home from the ER.

32
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:38,841
How about...

33
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:41,001
some beer as a thank-you?

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,171
No, thanks. I have work tomorrow.

35
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,471
That's tomorrow.

36
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,910
- Do you have some beer? - You...

37
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,010
Excuse me.

38
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,020
Did you clean up in the dark?

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,620
I expected a lawyer to have books.

40
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,220
Is this the closet?

41
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,190
Let's get some beer.

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,891
- You don't have any? - No. I don't drink.

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,990
Then...

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,060
You have beer.

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,970
Lots.

46
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:23,750
Mr. Han.

47
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,690
Are you...

48
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,490
an alcoholic?

49
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,090
I love it.

50
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:38,900
Four.

51
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,301
Twelve.

52
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:54,881
Bro.

53
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:58,481
Why am I your bro?

54
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,951
Are we family?

55
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,451
Why are you all here?

56
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:05,620
Is there a party?

57
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:08,261
Yes, there is.

58
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:09,761
You didn't know?

59
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,500
Gosh, you...

60
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,530
What's this about?

61
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,240
The kids you gathered by random...

62
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,141
took my money and ran.

63
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,611
Should I beat you up randomly...

64
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,240
or severely?

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,680
I'd never seen them in my life.

66
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,150
They wanted to sell...

67
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,990
What a joke.

68
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,490
Hey, he's putting on a show.

69
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,461
He's trying so hard.

70
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,510
Hey.

71
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,880
Kid.

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,281
Hey.

73
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,721
Guys.

74
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,320
A toast to your pupils.

75
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,861
(Lee Ro Um: Suffocating)

76
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:48,990
Why put your can down instead of taking a sip?

77
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,990
Am I the only one drinking?

78
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,861
(Hang in there. I'll send him away soon.)

79
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,531
Anyway,

80
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,271
will you switch shrinks or not?

81
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,240
Why are you so interested in my doctor?

82
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:05,440
It's just that...

83
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,250
someone I know is a psychiatrist.

84
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,781
I'm not interested.

85
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,851
I'm just saying you should pick a good one.

86
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,580
They're not like fortune-tellers.

87
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,721
That's so annoying.

88
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:23,861
(It's stuffy.)

89
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:27,830
(Wait, send Ko Yong Han, we talk, then we go.)

90
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,601
When will you leave, Mr. Ko?

91
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,471
Why...

92
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:37,111
are they called "squid rings" and "onion rings?"

93
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,250
What are you talking about?

94
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,151
If you're out of your mind, are you a tree or wood?

95
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,651
What?

96
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,291
It's all...

97
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:53,120
hereditary.

98
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:56,231
Is there even a strand of logic?

99
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,461
Come on, Mr. Han.

100
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,500
If you want to be friends, say so.

101
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,601
When you wash your feet,

102
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:07,500
do you need a raccoon?

103
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:10,870
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,281
What should we do if the seas dry...

105
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,911
and the mountains flatten?

106
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:45,841
My pants...

107
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,221
Help me take these off.

108
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,620
- Take them off for me. - Okay.

109
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,990
- Okay. - Take them off.

110
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,031
Okay.

111
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,171
Okay.

112
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:28,250
(White Village, Dorim Nature)

113
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:41,731
Ms. Lee?

114
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:45,271
Gosh!

115
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:47,341
Hey!

116
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,010
Goodness. You scared me.

117
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,211
Why? What's up?

118
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,341
Ro Um.

119
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,351
You told me to wait.

120
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,551
Since when were you so obedient?

121
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,630
What did you say?

122
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,771
- Her place... - I asked Ms. Lee.

123
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,230
We're in love.

124
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,041
What?

125
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:22,840
My place got flooded.

126
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,551
I'm off.

127
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,251
Won't you see me out?

128
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,551
See you out?

129
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,190
Kindly walk me out, please.

130
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,830
All right, bye.

131
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:49,271
You know, my toilet gets clogged very often.

132
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:52,541
Last time, it overflowed like this. It was insane.

133
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:53,840
Like "Parasite."

134
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,271
Would you let me move in too?

135
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:01,541
Not me?

136
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,210
Yet your female client who is much younger than you...

137
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,720
can stay with you?

138
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,720
I guess you're picky and choosy with whom you help.

139
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,291
She has her own room,

140
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,621
and I'll make sure she leaves as soon as her place gets fixed.

141
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:13,960
You were going to hide it from me though.

142
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,330
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.

143
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,131
Thanks to what you did, I'm getting a totally wrong idea.

144
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,570
Mr. Han Moo Young, you're the weirdest lawyer I know.

145
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,771
Oh, that's right.

146
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,171
What happened with that case?

147
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:32,241
You know, at Dongma Park.

148
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,281
She was released without charge.

149
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,950
I suppose you did your job as her attorney this time.

150
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,051
Ro Um didn't have bad intentions...

151
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:43,491
I know. He's an ex-sex offender wearing an electronic anklet.

152
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:47,320
And I bet he provoked her first.

153
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,291
So I understand she had a reason...

154
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,261
for wanting to teach him a lesson.

155
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:52,261
However,

156
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,570
that's not her job.

157
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:59,340
In fact, it's what she should avoid the most...

158
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,501
while being on probation.

159
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:03,671
Punishing others however she pleases.

160
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,651
Don't try to explain her actions to me.

161
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,710
I guess you have no idea because you always run to her rescue...

162
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,450
whether she's stuck in mud or in a swamp.

163
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,521
As for me,

164
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,690
I must make sure she never goes anywhere near muddy mires...

165
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,761
because that's my job.

166
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:24,330
And don't get too close to her.

167
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,001
After all, she's just a client of yours.

168
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:35,200
Anyway, thanks for the drinks last night.

169
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,960
(Ro Um)

170
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:58,600
Da Jung.

171
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:00,200
Ring Go.

172
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,470
Gosh, it really hurts.

173
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,470
Did I hurt my face too?

174
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:09,741
A little.

175
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:11,911
Oh, no. My money maker.

176
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,281
Da Jung, have you eaten yet?

177
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:20,881
Was it because of the borrowed-name account?

178
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,720
Don't tell me you just had cup noodles.

179
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:25,891
I bet they ran away because you collapsed.

180
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,891
Will they come back?

181
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,430
They will.

182
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,001
The high school punks who opened the account ran off with the money.

183
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:37,301
They'll come barging in again if they find out that I'm alive.

184
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,501
So I have to hide for the time being.

185
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,011
Da Jung. You'll eat well even if I'm not around, right?

186
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:46,840
How much did they take?

187
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,781
About 50,000 dollars?

188
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:54,651
Don't tell Ro Um about me.

189
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:57,090
She'll be disappointed if she finds out that I still work in this field.

190
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,791
You're worried about Ro Um now?

191
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,360
Yes, because I'm all hers.

192
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,261
You know that.

193
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,401
They haven't called me yet, have they?

194
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:09,801
No, not yet.

195
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,501
Okay, all right.

196
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,600
Ouch. Oh, boy.

197
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:31,051
(Strawberry Farm)

198
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,810
Now, tell me. What did you do?

199
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,680
Let's hear it.

200
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,021
How do you scam others?

201
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,621
- HAPPY. - What?

202
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:07,921

Plow, Propose, Yield.

206
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,041
HAPPY.

(Dongsan Kindergarten)

208
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,411
(Chapter 1: Hunt)

209
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,350
Throw bait and let them take it.

210
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,251
As you know, I threw bait to get the adoptive mother.

211
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,621
I told her that her troublemaker son was a genius.

212
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,730
Use all the info you've obtained...

213
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,391
to gain full control...

214
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:46,460
over their thoughts.

215
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,531
Ma'am.

216
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:52,001
- Yes? - For breakfast this morning,

217
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:55,440
you had braised black beans and stir-fried dry squid strips, right?

218
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
- My gosh. - Your husband...

219
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,541
uses scalp coverage hair powder, right?

220
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:03,310
Yes!

221
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,350
Back in school,

222
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,680
you had the lowest GPA in the entire school.

223
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,850
My gosh!

224
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,060
(Chapter 2: Appointment)

225
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:18,860
If the bait swells up once they took it,

226
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,230
their mouth will rip.

227
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,901
The funny thing is, depending on what you tell them,

228
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:27,271
you could make them bite it harder instead of spitting it out,

229
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,710
without realizing their teeth could all fall out.

230
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:32,210
Ma'am.

231
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,480
Yes?

232
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,911
Honorary Professor John Kohl Williams of Harvard University,

233
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:41,251

234
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:44,151
and was previously nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine...

235
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:48,090
performed this brain test on world leaders.

236
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:51,531
This is the result of the test performed on ordinary people.

237
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,330
The graphs look totally different, don't they?

238
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,301
Well, the percentage is what really matters.

239
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:01,600
Why don't you read out the number below Bill Gates' graph?

240
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,710
It's 56 percent.

241
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:05,371
And your son's?

242
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:08,411
It's 60 percent?

243
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,121
Throwing the bait is the focal point of any scam.

244
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,720
(Chapter 3: Plow)

245
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,761
Bring any book from home.

246
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,590
The more difficult the book is, the better it'll be.

247
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:36,671
("Plow")

248
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,110
Open the book to any page and just state the page number.

249
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:51,751
Page 22.

250
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,791
"You took in a friend's child,"

251
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,661
"signed 15 life insurance policies,"

252
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:00,261
"killed him, and made it look like he drowned."

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,930
"According to the law, which a pushover I know worships,"

254

"these evil people who killed an 18-year-old boy..."

255
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,641
"and got 430,000 dollars..."

256
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:10,610
"will be sentenced to ten years in jail..."

257
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,541
"and fined 50,000 dollars at the most."

258
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,850
My gosh. You have it all memorized!

259
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,381
My Einstein cell percentage is only 12.

260
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,051
It's only 12 percent.

261
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
My gosh.

262
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,720
Step Four. Propose.

263
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,460
If you want to succeed, you must remember this.

264
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:33,700
Never make a proposal.

265
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:38,830
Being born with a brain like his is like winning the lottery.

266
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
The problem is that...

267
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:44,411
he only has a little bit of time left to pick up his lottery prize.

268
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:48,281
Right now, he's at the peak of his potential.

269
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:51,810
However, his IQ could diminish very quickly.

270
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,090
I specialize in child psychology,

271
00:17:57,221 --> 00:17:58,590
but as you can see here...

272
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:03,830
I'm an advisor to an educational organization,

273
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:06,160
whose name I cannot reveal.

274
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,231
I'll be off, then. Take care.

275
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:12,370
(Yield)

276
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,771
Why are you being like this?

277
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,741
- Ms. Kwon! - Please!

278
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:18,310
Please.

279
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,211
How do we get into that educational institution?

280
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,850
There is a way, right?

281
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,211
You know how, don't you?

282
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:26,951
You can apply...

283
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:29,191
for the one-year program at the center in San Francisco.

284
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,820
But over a hundred students are on the waiting list every semester.

285
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,461
Most importantly,

286
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:36,630
the tuition is seriously high.

287
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,360
- How much is it? - In Korean won,

288
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,560
it's about 500 million won.

289
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,531
- What? - Wait.

290
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:46,140
Give us some time to think.

291
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,610
I didn't say...

292
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,170
that you could get accepted only with money.

293
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Sorry?

294
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,441
Even the parents at the governor level...

295
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:57,910
are waiting just to get the examination.

296
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:00,751
Then, why did you tell us?

297
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:01,751
That was...

298
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:05,120
because it was such a shame!

299
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,160
As an educator,

300
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,860
disregarding talent would be dereliction of duty.

301
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,890
- Please, ma'am. - You'll have to excuse me.

302
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,931
- No! - You can't just go.

303
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,471
- Just get us on the waiting list. - That's possible, isn't it?

304
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,801
I can't say that it's impossible.

305
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,670
We...

306
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:24,441
have...

307
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,140
the money.

308
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:29,781
We got a sizeable sum of money recently.

309
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,850
We'll pay this much in advance...

310
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,420
and either get a loan or take out a mortgage...

311
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,090
to pay up to 500,000 dollars.

312
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,961
Is that right?

313
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,261
(Total: 436,032 dollars)

314
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,100
And they just handed over that much money?

315
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,001
I may have left out a few parts.

316
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,370
Ro Um.

317
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,701
Are you actually a con artist?

318
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,541
Have you even been listening to me?

319
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,090
What are you doing?

320
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,761
We need to give it back.

321
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:17,791
You're insane.

322
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,400
Are you going to leave Korea?

323
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,900
Those parents must have called the police on you already.

324
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,541
They know your face,

325
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,801
and there's a record of the transfer.

326
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:32,170
Only an amateur leaves a transfer record.

327
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,310
They can't call the police.

328
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:39,150
Listen to me.

329
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,981
They just can't.

330
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,731
- What's this? - My insurance.

331
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,201
Insurance?

332
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,241
I told you that they couldn't report me.

333
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,110
That's why.

334
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,541
What is it?

335
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,610
Stop yapping and take a look.

336
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,650
What is your plan here?

337
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,751
You're on probation right now.

338
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,791
After you take this from those parents,

339
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,090
what's the next step?

340
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:20,590
Your goal was to satisfy...

341
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,060
Seo Gye Sook's grudge?

342
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,060
Then, what's your goal?

343
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:28,961
What is driving you to go this far?

344
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:32,840
You mocked the only solution that I suggested...

345
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,170
when it was the most effective and realistic.

346
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,541
Just for that,

347
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,041
you put in all that time and effort?

348
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:44,080
Just admit it.

349
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,721
That I did something that you couldn't.

350
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,650
You're right.

351
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:52,191
I can't do it. But it's not just me.

352
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:54,920
No one in this world takes such a measure,

353
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,160
given that they're normal.

354
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,701
Though you said that Ms. Seo was partly responsible,

355
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,701
you related to her position in the end, didn't you?

356
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,170
"Relate?"

357
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:09,810
Tell me I'm wrong.

358
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,711
Your safety is my first priority.

359
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:17,681
This was totally unnecessary.

360
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,451
Whether you're a murderer or a con artist,

361
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:23,120
I don't intend on taking advantage of you.

362
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,890
And this was the wrong way.

363
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:29,731
Is that so?

364
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,600
Give it back.

365
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:34,731
I'm sure it's not too late.

366
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,271
Even the phone?

367
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,701
What on earth is it?

368
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,211
Think this through.

369
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,541
You might regret it.

370

I'll give you a choice.

371
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:51,910
When I give them the money back,

372
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,350
the phone also goes with it.

373
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,090
If you choose to use the phone, it goes the same for the money.

374
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:00,560
I'll give you one week.

375

377
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:22,813
Why don't you answer me?

378
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:25,272
I asked if Ring Go was on standby.

379
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:28,742
Ring Go isn't available right now.

380
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:29,912
Why not?

381
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:32,182
He's hospitalized. And he's on the run.

382
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:38,192
Is he still cleaning up after thugs?

383
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:41,962
Before you criticize him,

384
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,732
put yourself in his shoes for once.

385
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:50,333
I don't care about that.

386
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:54,702
Aren't you old enough to decide what's more at stake?

387
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,113
Get Ring Go back in one week.

388
00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:01,313
Are you going to the hospital?

389
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:03,982
What would I do at the hospital? I'm not a doctor.

390
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:06,113
Aren't you worried about him?

391
00:24:06,383 --> 00:24:07,722
You know how much he cares for you.

392
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:10,522
His caring for me is none of my business.

393
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:13,162
You're only cooperating for something that you want.

394

397

Da Jung. What's going on?

398
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:07,182
I can't go to the police station...

399
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:08,643
because it's Ring Go's fault.

400

Please help me.

401
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:12,883
Come inside.

402
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:17,222
Please don't tell Ro Um about this.

403
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:21,962
Why not?

404
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:35,472
Will you tell me what's going on?

405
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:38,873
You?

406
00:25:42,313 --> 00:25:43,982
I came to talk to Mr. Han.

407
00:25:44,682 --> 00:25:46,323
I thought he'd listen...

408
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:48,123
to what you don't even care.

409
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,123
You've met him once, and now you're friends?

410
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:54,593
I'm only here to ask for help.

411
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:57,093
Let me hear her out. Is that all right?

412
00:25:59,702 --> 00:26:00,833
There's a guy called Ring Go.

413
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:04,073
He runs an errand center, and he was abducted.

414
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:06,502
Abducted?

415
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:08,803
He was trading fake bank accounts.

416
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:12,242
He buys bank accounts from naive people...

417
00:26:12,442 --> 00:26:14,682
and hands them over to voice phishing organizations.

418
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:16,682
The teenagers who sold him bank accounts...

419
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:18,383
put a payment suspension on them...

420
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:19,623
and took the money...

421
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:21,623
from the victims before the scammers got it.

422
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,353
Just give me a second.

423
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:24,422
We're running out of time.

424
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:26,022
It's coming out.

425
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:27,922
Look.

426
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:29,492
Yes!

427
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:31,692
Is that our money?

428
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:35,202
Ring Go was doing something illegal, though.

429
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:38,373
But the issue is that the scammers think...

430
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:40,202
that Ring Go is working with the teenagers who ran.

431
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:42,202
So, they abducted him.

432
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:44,172
But Ring Go has a condition,

433
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:45,972
so he may get into serious trouble.

434
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:48,982
I know those scammers.

435
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,982
They will never cooperate if they think the police are on it.

436
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:55,952
But I thought that you would understand.

437
00:26:56,393 --> 00:26:59,452
Can you claim that you're his lawyer and get him back...

438
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,492
Then what?

439
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:08,932
They think that Ring Go was in on it with those teenagers.

440
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:13,303
What makes you think they'll stop before they get the teenagers?

441
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:15,873
Where's the money?

442
00:27:18,143 --> 00:27:20,883
You know what to do, don't you?

443
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:24,412
Do you still need a lawyer?

444
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:26,623
Ms. Lee.

445
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:28,422
What can you do?

446
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:33,863
Make a choice before you get involved.

447
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:43,603
Darn it.

448
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:46,442
Must we eat instant noodles by the river in a luxury car?

449

You don't know what you're saying.

450
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:50,442
This is what the rich do.

451
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:53,212
They don't collect sauce packets or lick the yoghurt lid,

452
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:55,012
They eat the drumsticks and throw the rest away.

453
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,682
These days you can buy just drumsticks.

454
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:58,682
Hey.

455
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:01,722

- Right. - Let's go on a trip.

457
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:05,553

Deal? Yes?

00:28:08,823 --> 00:28:11,232
Are you sure we can do this?

461
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,103
Yes, it's fine.

462
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:15,762
What they're doing is illegal, so they can't report us.

463
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,803
They'll just have to cut their losses...

464
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:19,133

One, return the money the kids stole,

476
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:04,452
which is a loss on our part because Ring Go didn't take it.

477
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:08,283
Two, catch the kids and offer them up.

478
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:10,692
I'm not the type to accept a loss,

479
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:11,992
so I opt for the delivery service.

480

00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:55,962
Seriously? A bit down.

(To Do Errand Center)

553
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:58,903
- The right... - Stop it.

554
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:01,672
I can manage.

555
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:04,843
Go and check out the cars.

556

(Attorney Han Moo Young)

557

(To Do Errand Center)

558
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:24,192
Hello?

559
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,593
Did you find the teenagers?

560
00:35:27,263 --> 00:35:28,332
Yes.

561
00:35:28,332 --> 00:35:31,102
Will you really hand them over to the gang?

562
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:34,303
You asked me for advice.

563
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:48,683
I'm outside a police station.

564
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:55,863
- Who is it? - The lawyer.

565
00:35:58,192 --> 00:35:59,263
He's at a police station.

566
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:09,872
Get the two kids and the bag of cash.

567
00:36:10,513 --> 00:36:11,542
Check the amount.

568
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:14,212
- Okay. - Got it.

569
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:19,852
What then?

570
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:23,723
It's okay. Let's finish this conversation.

571
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:31,332
You went to the police to report it.

572
00:36:32,562 --> 00:36:33,562
Yes.

573
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:35,502
That day...

574
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:38,232
You asked me for advice.

575
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:40,442
I gave her my advice.

576
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:43,573
I'm outside a police station.

577
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:46,212
To report Ring Go missing.

578
00:36:46,613 --> 00:36:48,712
The advice I could give as a lawyer.

579
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:50,752
The police will mobilize...

580
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:53,752
and find the teens who caused the mess.

581
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:55,883
I wanted Lee Ro Um to hear it too.

582
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:57,653
Tell Ro Um that...

583
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:00,422
I'm at a police station,

584
00:37:00,422 --> 00:37:03,323
and that the police will trace Ring Go.

585
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,863
Did telling Lee Ro Um that...

586
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:10,633
mean something to you?

587
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,442
- It was important. - Why?

588
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:17,413
All the choices I made that day...

589
00:37:20,843 --> 00:37:22,683
She was the reason I made those choices.

590
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:30,292
Before you get nosy,

591
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,252
make up your mind first.

592
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,442
- Hello? - Hello, Mr. Han.

593
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:52,312
Ms. Kim Bo Ra wishes to settle before the end of the week.

594
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,613
If it goes past that,

595
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:56,383
she'd like to change the amount of the settlement money.

596
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:59,212
Is that so?

597
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:00,883
You know, I'll be honest.

598
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:03,553
We've waited long enough.

599
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:06,192
As you know, the death was ruled accidental.

600
00:38:06,593 --> 00:38:08,462
I'm sure you're not hoping...

601
00:38:08,823 --> 00:38:10,633
to magically turn the tables.

602
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:14,703
For Ms. Seo's sake, you should quickly...

603
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:30,712
Your goal was to satisfy...

604
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:32,153
Seo Gye Sook's grudge?

605
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:40,392
(Enter Passcode)

606
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:58,712
Do you realize what kind of danger Ring Go is facing now?

607
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:01,142
That gang is in the bottom of the gutter.

608
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:03,013
The money is no longer our concern.

609
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:04,752
We should be worried about them taking his organs.

610
00:39:04,982 --> 00:39:07,453
Let the police handle the voice phishing ring.

611
00:39:10,922 --> 00:39:12,352
I don't care about them.

612
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:15,723
We must rescue Ring Go safe and sound.

613
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:17,462
What about the safety of the high school kids?

614
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:19,232
That is none of my concern.

615
00:39:19,363 --> 00:39:20,962
Let them go.

616
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:24,303
The police must already be on their way now.

617
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,573
So you'd better figure out a way.

618
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:28,843
A way to keep both Ring Go and the kids safe...

619
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:32,172
and return the money to the victim.

620
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:34,982
And make sure the police don't catch on.

621
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:46,192
Get in the car.

622
00:39:47,323 --> 00:39:49,593
It looks like we have to start all over again.

(To Do Errand Center)

624
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:22,396
If the police beat us to it, Ring Go will get arrested too.

625
00:40:22,396 --> 00:40:24,596
Even if he's released, the gang will retaliate.

626
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:27,797
We must move faster than the police.

627
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:30,266
First, return the money to the victim.

628
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:31,737
Then let the kids go...

629
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:33,067
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

630
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:38,246
- Ouch, that hurts. - Goodness.

631
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:39,507
You little jerk.

632
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:42,277
How dare you take my money?

633
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:43,677
Where's your phone?

634
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:46,246
Found it.

635
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:47,916
- You little... - Sir.

636
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:50,056
Could you move my hair out of my face?

637
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,527
It's so itchy.

638
00:40:52,627 --> 00:40:53,657
- What? - Shut it.

639
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:55,996
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

640
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,226
Where did you hide it?

641
00:40:58,226 --> 00:40:59,527
(Messages)

642
00:41:03,396 --> 00:41:04,467
Gosh, you little...

643
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,277
- What? - You punk. I knew it.

644
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,337
You're so dead.

645
00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:12,177
Hello? Are you the high school kid?

646
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:13,976
This is Prosecutor Park Kyu Ri...

647
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:15,476
from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

648
00:41:15,646 --> 00:41:17,116
Mr. Park Hae Dong?

649
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:20,016
Is your real name Park Hae Dong?

650
00:41:23,657 --> 00:41:25,887
Well, I can talk to you on his behalf.

651
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:28,956
What is your relationship with Mr. Park Hae Dong?

652
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:31,627
Well, I'm...

653
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:34,467
I'm like his uncle.

654
00:41:34,837 --> 00:41:36,596
Hae Dong is in the shower now.

655
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:39,806
We found the 50,000 dollars which Mr. Park Hae Dong...

656
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:43,677
reported stolen at 11:25pm last night.

657
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:45,907
If Mr. Park isn't available at the moment,

658
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:48,277
would you like to continue this conversation with us on his behalf?

659
00:41:48,277 --> 00:41:49,317
Pardon me?

660
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:51,516
Yes, sure. That's fine.

661
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:53,246
All right. Then we'll need...

662
00:41:53,246 --> 00:41:55,887
your cell phone number and name.

663
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:57,757
Sure, I'm...

664
00:41:58,257 --> 00:42:00,357
Kim Sam Pal.

665
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:04,596
My number is 010-845-5738.

666
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,396
He impersonated a prosecutor.

667
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:09,766
"Your bank account is being used for criminal purposes."

668
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:12,806
"Move all the money in the account to other accounts..."

669
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:14,677
"in order to prevent further damage."

670
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:17,677
After being dragged around for four hours,

671
00:42:17,677 --> 00:42:20,107
the victim sent 50,000 dollars to 5 different accounts.

672
00:42:20,346 --> 00:42:22,516
The psychological torture clouded her judgement.

673
00:42:22,817 --> 00:42:24,846
They threatened her that she'd be held criminally responsible...

674
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:26,047
if she hung up.

675
00:42:26,346 --> 00:42:29,587
Real civil servants would never threaten anyone like that.

676
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:31,527
He's a con man.

677
00:42:32,556 --> 00:42:36,527
We've arrested two teenagers for theft.

678
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:39,166
Since they stated that the 50,000 dollars they stole...

679
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,766
belonged to Mr. Park Hae Dong,

680
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,567
we have to interview him as a witness.

681
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:44,567
Oh, that money!

682
00:42:44,907 --> 00:42:46,407
It is our money.

683
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:49,076
Gosh, you punk.

684
00:42:49,237 --> 00:42:51,107
My gosh. Thank you, Ms. Prosecutor.

685
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:52,607
Because of the investigation,

686
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:55,677
we'll have to wire you the money.

687
00:42:55,677 --> 00:42:59,487
However, all of Mr. Park's accounts have been suspended.

688
00:42:59,846 --> 00:43:02,286
Mr. Kim, do you have an account that we could use for this?

689
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:04,487
Yes, sure thing.

690
00:43:04,786 --> 00:43:07,556
Well, are you going to wire the money right away?

691
00:43:08,326 --> 00:43:10,996
We need Mr. Park's consent before we can do that.

692
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:12,396
Is Mr. Park...

693
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:15,266
able to come in for an interview with us?

694
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:16,297
Well...

695
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,306
- Yes, sure. - Great.

696
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:20,067
Then we'll contact a local office in your area...

697
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,306
and send a patrol car.

698
00:43:22,306 --> 00:43:23,576
Could you tell me your address?

699
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:25,407
The address is...

700
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:32,387
Go to the main road, and you'll see a police car.

701
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:35,487
Watch what you say, or you know what will happen.

702
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,516
You little...

703
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:37,987
Hey.

704
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:52,567
Be careful.

705
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:06,186
It was Ro Um, wasn't it?

706
00:44:07,317 --> 00:44:08,556
Yes, that's right.

707
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:10,416
Can I meet her?

708
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,527
No, you can't.

709
00:44:11,786 --> 00:44:13,427
I told her I'd take you to the hospital.

710
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:19,297
So what do you think now that you've met her?

711
00:44:19,297 --> 00:44:21,396
Well, just as I heard.

712
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,007
I got him. He's safe now.

713
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:31,206
I'll take him to the hospital and head back.

714
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:34,846
Please put on your seat belt.

715
00:44:36,476 --> 00:44:37,616
Gosh.

716
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:40,487
- We'll leave now. - Okay.

717
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,127
Mr. Park Hae Dong...

718
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:51,896
is safe with us now.

719
00:44:51,896 --> 00:44:53,596
And he gave us his consent...

720
00:44:53,596 --> 00:44:57,036
to send the 50,000 dollars to your account, Mr. Kim.

721
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,266
Okay, great.

722
00:44:59,536 --> 00:45:01,877
Then do you just need my account info now?

723
00:45:01,877 --> 00:45:03,076
Yes, go ahead and tell me.

724
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:04,476
Okay.

725
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,206
Samsam Bank.

726
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,177
Three, three, seven, one,

727
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:12,746
eight, one, zero, one, nine, six, six, seven, four, five.

728
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,087
Okay, then we'll call you...

729
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:18,427
on your cell phone to verify that it's you.

730
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:20,257
Okay, thank you.

731
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:25,226
Destroy all the data on Ring Go's phone.

732
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:29,797
Hey, have you seen my phone?

733
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:32,737
Did I leave it in the car?

734
00:45:46,516 --> 00:45:48,056
(Samsam Bank, Withdrawal)

735
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:51,226
What is this? How come I missed so many calls?

736
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:56,857
"Account Holder, Kim Sam Pal. A loan has been..."

737
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:58,627
What is this?

738
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:00,596
"Please check your account..."

739
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:03,737
Hello?

740
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:06,567
Hello? This is Manager Lee Ji Young from Samsam Bank.

741
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:07,877
By any chance,

742
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:11,206
did you receive a call from 010-347-5698?

743
00:46:11,206 --> 00:46:12,306
Ms. Lee!

744
00:46:12,306 --> 00:46:14,516
The prosecutor needs to talk to him.

745
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:17,416
"The person to commit..."

746
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:20,246
"any of the articles below for the purpose of fraud..."

747
00:46:20,246 --> 00:46:21,887
"will be sentenced up to ten years in prison..."

748
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:23,516
"or fined up to 100,000 dollars."

749
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:27,726
Just a second. I'll put you through to the prosecutor.

750
00:46:28,027 --> 00:46:30,197
- What? - Hello.

751
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:32,896
This is Prosecutor Seo In Kyung from Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

752
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:34,166
Wait.

753
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:38,337
I was talking to a different prosecutor earlier.

754
00:46:38,706 --> 00:46:42,877
You were involved in a voice phishing scam.

755
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:47,306
Did the caller impersonate Prosecutor Park Kyu Ri?

756
00:46:47,476 --> 00:46:51,087
There's no prosecutor with that name at Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

757
00:46:51,087 --> 00:46:52,146
That's a fraud.

758
00:46:53,087 --> 00:46:55,587
We've been trying to reach you this whole time.

759
00:46:55,587 --> 00:46:58,826
We've noticed a few strange things from your bank account.

760
00:46:58,826 --> 00:47:01,226
There's a high chance the organization we're tracking...

761
00:47:01,226 --> 00:47:03,927
has its hands on your account. That's why I called.

762
00:47:04,027 --> 00:47:05,527
You don't have time for this.

763
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:08,567
There must be 10,000 dollars being withdrawn each time.

764
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,297
What?

765
00:47:12,036 --> 00:47:13,067
You're right.

766
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,137
Wait, this is...

767
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:17,576
What should I do?

768
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:21,217
All your personal information has been leaked.

769
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:23,146
To stop the leakage,

770
00:47:23,146 --> 00:47:26,217
you must transfer all the balance remaining in the bank...

771
00:47:26,217 --> 00:47:30,056
to the encrypted account that is managed...

772
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,556
by the Prosecutors' Office immediately.

773
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:33,987
Do you think you can do that?

774
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:35,027
Yes.

775
00:47:36,456 --> 00:47:37,527
Shoot.

776
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,967
Don't turn off yet. My charger.

777
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:46,806
Eight, five.

778
00:47:46,806 --> 00:47:51,306
Social security number. It's 771212...

779
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:54,817
What's my social security number?

780
00:47:55,717 --> 00:47:58,987
I don't even know my social security number!

781
00:48:01,387 --> 00:48:02,416
There.

782
00:48:02,757 --> 00:48:05,456
It's 155487...

783
00:48:05,456 --> 00:48:07,387
What's this? My ID card?

784
00:48:07,896 --> 00:48:11,266
Oh, they ask for so much!

785
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:12,297
(Identification)

786
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:15,166
(Ministry of Justice, 180,000 dollars)

787
00:48:16,297 --> 00:48:17,297
That's 180,000 dollars.

788
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:24,107
Wait.

789
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:26,306
What's this?

790
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,846
I did it. These punks.

791
00:48:31,447 --> 00:48:33,186
Are they joking?

792
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,317
The number you have dialled is out of service.

793
00:48:36,317 --> 00:48:37,317
What?

794
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:39,127
- Please check... - Out of service?

795
00:48:41,197 --> 00:48:42,956
What's happening?

796
00:48:46,596 --> 00:48:48,567
- Hello? - This is Prosecutor Park Kyu Ri.

797
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:50,297
Have you checked your deposit?

798
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:51,567
What?

799
00:48:52,536 --> 00:48:54,107
Well...

800
00:48:54,107 --> 00:48:55,777
Have you checked it?

801
00:48:57,846 --> 00:48:59,076
Are you Prosecutor Park Kyu Ri?

802
00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:01,476
Yes, at 3:22pm,

803
00:49:01,476 --> 00:49:03,947
I transferred 50,000 dollars.

804
00:49:05,646 --> 00:49:08,556
Wait. Prosecutor Park,

805
00:49:08,556 --> 00:49:12,387
who was it that called my phone?

806
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:15,427
Pardon? I'm not following you.

807
00:49:15,596 --> 00:49:19,496
Another prosecutor called me earlier...

808
00:49:19,866 --> 00:49:23,766
and told me that Park Kyu Ri was a voice phishing scammer.

809
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:28,137
Is it still a scam if I give you money?

810
00:49:28,907 --> 00:49:31,107
There was a transfer limit,

811
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:34,007
so I wired 10,000 dollars each time.

812
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:35,377
Then,

813
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:38,916
where did I send the money to?

814
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:40,087
I'm not sure.

815
00:49:41,257 --> 00:49:44,387
Where did you transfer the money to?

816
00:49:48,927 --> 00:49:50,226
(Transferred 180,000 dollars)

817
00:49:50,326 --> 00:49:53,096
What? My money!

818
00:49:54,067 --> 00:49:58,337
Hey! Which bank is this? Find it!

819
00:49:58,337 --> 00:49:59,366
Hello?

820
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:02,007
Hello?

821
00:50:03,476 --> 00:50:04,476
Hello, there.

822
00:50:11,817 --> 00:50:12,817
Delivery!

823
00:50:27,396 --> 00:50:28,436
Oh, my.

824
00:50:30,337 --> 00:50:31,766
I've been saved.

825
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:33,407
Goodness.

826
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:06,467
Who the heck are you?

827
00:51:06,936 --> 00:51:08,007
Mr. Han?

828
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:10,407
Yes?

829
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:13,306
About the phone...

830
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:18,947
You said that Ro Um took the phone from the foster parents.

831
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:23,717
What was in it?

832
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:30,627
(Kim Kyung Jin, Cho and Son Law Firm)

833
00:51:34,396 --> 00:51:35,666
(Missed calls)

834
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,567
Can we talk about that next time?

835
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:43,806
Sure. We'll end the session today.

836
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:53,746
You said last time...

837
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:56,657
that looking away was...

838
00:51:57,087 --> 00:51:59,887
only the process of treatment, not the outcome.

839
00:52:03,127 --> 00:52:04,527
I think I get what you mean.

840
00:52:16,377 --> 00:52:17,607
- Mr. Han. - Yes.

841
00:52:18,306 --> 00:52:20,277
- Did you watch the news? - No.

842
00:52:21,317 --> 00:52:22,976
Check it out. You'll like it.

843
00:52:24,146 --> 00:52:25,186
When it's over.

844
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:28,916
It's one of the specialties.

845
00:52:29,186 --> 00:52:30,186
Hi.

846
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:32,087
Sorry.

847
00:52:32,686 --> 00:52:33,686
Why?

848
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:35,496
I'm Kim Mi Hwa from News Y.

849
00:52:35,496 --> 00:52:36,927
Don't turn on the news.

850
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:38,266
Woo Young can't watch the news.

851
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:40,766
We've recently covered the story of a son...

852
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:44,936
who returned a dead body after he was adopted.

853
00:52:45,366 --> 00:52:49,407
A woman who entrusted her friends with her teenage son...

854
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:52,507
claimed that his son mysteriously died...

855
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:54,717
during a summer vacation with his adoptive parents.

856
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:57,717
The case was closed as an accidental death,

857
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,987
but evidence was found at last.

858
00:53:01,757 --> 00:53:04,087
Don't read other articles. Read mine.

859
00:53:04,357 --> 00:53:05,357
I wrote it beautifully.

860
00:53:07,056 --> 00:53:10,326
("The Last Hope, Proof That It Was Murder")

861
00:53:28,646 --> 00:53:29,877
You won, Ro Um.

862
00:53:33,746 --> 00:53:36,357
("The Son Was Murdered by His Adoptive Parents")

863
00:53:36,757 --> 00:53:38,456
The video you will watch is...

864
00:53:38,456 --> 00:53:42,157
crucial evidence that may turn around the whole case.

865
00:53:42,326 --> 00:53:44,456
While there's no direct description,

866
00:53:44,456 --> 00:53:47,266
please beware of the cruelty of the content.

867
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:48,567
Over to you, Reporter Kim Ga Jin.

868
00:53:49,237 --> 00:53:51,866
Evidence was found at a rather unexpected place.

869
00:53:52,137 --> 00:53:55,576
The answer was on the phone with videos frequently filmed...

870
00:53:55,576 --> 00:53:57,277
by the biological daughter of the adoptive parents.

871
00:53:57,737 --> 00:53:59,677
The video vividly records...

872
00:53:59,777 --> 00:54:02,177
what happened that day.

873
00:54:02,516 --> 00:54:05,346
- Mom! Dad! - The police have resumed...

874
00:54:05,346 --> 00:54:06,547
the investigation, using the video.

875
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:11,987
("The Son Was Murdered by His Adoptive Parents")

876
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:14,956
Mom, Myung Hoon's calling you.

877
00:54:14,956 --> 00:54:17,197
- He's fooling around. Just eat. - Dad.

878
00:54:17,697 --> 00:54:19,596
- Help. - Eat your watermelon.

879
00:54:21,226 --> 00:54:23,666
Mom, Myung Hoon is gone.

880
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:57,467
(Moran Dongbu Police Station)

881
00:55:00,637 --> 00:55:02,536
The police are already on the way.

882
00:55:03,536 --> 00:55:05,407
So, you'd better find out...

883
00:55:06,476 --> 00:55:08,717
how to keep Ring Go and the students safe...

884
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:11,916
while returning the damage amount to the victims.

885
00:55:13,516 --> 00:55:15,416
That way, the police won't find fault with you.

886
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:45,217
(Call)

887
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,246
(Calling)

888
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:52,056
Find out...

889
00:55:53,757 --> 00:55:56,127
which police station Moo Young called a week ago.

890
00:56:00,896 --> 00:56:03,197
I found this diary at Myung Hoon's school.

891
00:56:03,596 --> 00:56:07,007
Mom, why did you give birth to me?

892
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:08,237
Myung Hoon...

893
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:11,547
didn't resent you.

894
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,846
Why did Mom have me?

895
00:56:16,846 --> 00:56:19,317
She'd have lived happily if she hadn't had me.

896
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:22,657
That's why I couldn't ask her to take me back.

897
00:56:28,757 --> 00:56:30,396
When I grow up and work,

898
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:33,067
can I look after her then?

899
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:35,166
Let's hang on.

900
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:37,266
Let's fight.

901
00:56:39,007 --> 00:56:40,607
Wait just a little longer, Mom.

902
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:44,777
He worried and cared about you,

903
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:48,717
and he understood.

904
00:57:12,107 --> 00:57:15,436
I bet that even now, he'll want you to be happy.

905
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:52,806
Ro Um.

906
00:57:59,616 --> 00:58:00,686
Did you look into it?

907
00:58:14,896 --> 00:58:17,166
I searched Ring Go's center, the nearby police stations,

908
00:58:17,797 --> 00:58:20,067
and even the lawyer's outgoing calls.

909
00:58:21,467 --> 00:58:23,237
I checked if there was a case on Ring Go,

910
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:25,306
or if the teens were reported missing.

911
00:58:26,646 --> 00:58:27,646
And?

912
00:58:28,107 --> 00:58:29,576
If you think about it,

913
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:34,587
he didn't know Ring Go's name or where the errand center was.

914
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:39,157
He never called the police.

915
00:58:52,536 --> 00:58:53,567
Count me in.

916
00:58:55,177 --> 00:58:56,177
Into what?

917
00:58:56,306 --> 00:58:59,177
Let's do what you're doing together.

918
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:02,476
What am I doing?

919
00:59:05,016 --> 00:59:06,047
Fraud.

920
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:22,166
(Delightfully Deceitful)

921
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:26,436
(Special thanks to Jang Yeong Nam)

922
00:59:44,857 --> 00:59:46,456
Do you know the Jeokmok Kids?

923
00:59:47,157 --> 00:59:49,197
We were an elite group of sorts.

924
00:59:49,956 --> 00:59:51,226
I remembered...

925
00:59:51,527 --> 00:59:53,226
what I was originally like.

926
00:59:53,866 --> 00:59:54,996
I'll con people.

927
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:56,637
I'll show you the difference...

928
00:59:56,766 --> 00:59:58,467
between a lawyer and a con artist.

929
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:01,677
I landed myself a target, and I need a house.

930
01:00:02,137 --> 01:00:03,806
- Where's the player? - Right here.

931
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:06,107
Is this plan solid?

932
01:00:06,277 --> 01:00:07,607
You must know that.

933
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:09,016
Someone saw us.
