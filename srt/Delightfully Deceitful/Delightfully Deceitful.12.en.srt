00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:02,986
Yes.

(Episode 12)

5
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,567
Why didn't you tell me?

6
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,466
I didn't keep it from you.

7
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:21,637
I told you I was in the audience.

8
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:24,936
I believe I told you I saw you as a kid,

9
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:26,807
that I knew you.

10
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:30,877
I didn't think you'd remember my number.

11
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,686
I thought it meant nothing to you.

12
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,057
Let's go.

13
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:51,697
You're just the same, then and now.

People who appear suddenly and offer to help.

15
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:00,206
I thought of you sometimes because I doubted the purpose.

16
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:17,956
But...

17
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,397
no one will know unless you tell people.

18
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,867
It's too scary...

19
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:24,697
by yourself.

20
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,167
And it's lonely.

21
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,977
You said you were lonely and scared. I believe that.

Why do you think 99.9 percent of stock manipulation scams fail?

00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:47,057
- Fraud? - Internal discord.

25
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:50,825
Ma Kang Soo needs money to obtain shares,

26
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:52,796
and financier Min Kang Yoon has the money.

27
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:56,737
Starting with the party, we'll cause a rift between them.

28
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:59,737
Min Kang Yoon was divorced twice.

29
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:02,035
Both men were younger, rich,

30
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:03,436
and shared her interests.

31
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,976
She married them both a month after meeting them.

32
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:07,906
She must believe in fate.

33
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,277
What are her interests?

34
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,885
Her father made her travel as a kid,

35
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:13,416
so she's practically a foreigner.

36
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:15,017
She mainly speaks German and English.

37
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:17,686
We know who to send in, then.

38
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:21,486
That means Ko Yo Han and his partner...

39
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:23,427
will mark Ma Kang Soo.

40
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:26,666
Will he bring someone we can trust?

41
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:28,536
He will.

Why ask when you heard the first time?

45
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:43,017
Why would you drag her into this?

46
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:45,647
You told me to bring a partner.

47
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:49,885
You could bring someone, anyone you happen to know.

48
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:50,957
I know her.

49
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,225
- She's my shrink. - Not anymore.

50
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:54,256
Exactly.

51
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,957
How could you involve her when she's no longer my shrink?

52
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,256
It's dangerous.

53
00:03:58,726 --> 00:03:59,726
Wait.

54
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,367
I'm almost hurt.

55
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,737
You dragged me in like it was nothing.

56
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:07,665
The danger level isn't much different...

57
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,837
from what you already do.

58
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,536
Should I even have to listen to this?

59
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,345
I got you the invitation.

60
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:15,516
Plus, I'm a very valuable player.

00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,786
You should thank me.

66
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,857
"Thank you, Yo Han." Go on, say it.

67
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,096

68
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:33,726

To Ma Kang Soo, we'll send a fake investor who seems credible.

Oh, thank you.

188
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,926
Hello, sir. We have assorted desserts...

189
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:55,786
Would you like a little whiskey?

190
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,697
- I'll take it straight. - Sure.

191
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,526
Oh, my.

192
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:05,567
Enjoy.

193
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:19,317
Gosh! Oh, no.

194
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,617
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

195
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:23,786
Min Kang Yoon is here. Ring Go, be on standby.

196
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:00,686
- Hello. - Hello.

197
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,126
- It's been a while. - You look stunning.

198
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:06,265
This is Josh. He said you two went to school in the same neighbourhood.

199
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,425
Yes, in Karlsruhe.

200
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:10,266
I'm Josh Hong.

201
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,536
What's that watch you're wearing?

202
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:18,376
Oh, this. Someone gave it to me as a gift.

203
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:21,247
She's the CEO of that brand.

204
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,717
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

205
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,247
A gift from a girlfriend?

206
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:29,256
An ex.

207
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:31,816
I'm really sorry!

208
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:34,155
Babe, I told you to come this way.

209
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:35,997
Gosh. Here, use this.

210
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:38,996
It's okay. It was just a mistake.

211
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:41,896
I apologize. I'll take care of the dry-cleaning fee.

212
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,806
You... Aren't you Yo Han?

213
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:54,207
I guess you know Yo Han.

214
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:58,577
I'll go.

215
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,376
Ro Um, I'm not her cup of tea.

216
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,006
I'm not Min Kang Yoon's type.

217
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:37,957
Sorry. I thought you were someone I knew.

218
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:43,097
What's your name? You're a new face.

219
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:46,697
You're Korean, right?

220
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:50,036
If not, just tell me. I can speak a few foreign languages.

221
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,737
Yes, I am Korean.

222
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,306
Good.

223
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:00,347
I'm Min Kang Yoon. I'm the one who organized this party.

224
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,587
I'm Bae Ha Na.

225
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:14,056
My, look at you. You're all grown up now.

226
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:17,227
No wonder you're here too. I saw Professor Shin over there.

227
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:20,567
My gosh. Your face hasn't changed one bit.

228
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:22,596
Mr. Ma.

229
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,067
Oh, Professor Shin.

230
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:25,796
My gosh.

231
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,305
It's been a while, Mr. Ma.

232
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:31,336
Gosh, pardon my messy shirt.

233
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:34,077
I was going to come over and say hello earlier.

234
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:36,447
I've been very busy, you know.

235
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:37,947
I see.

236
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:41,217
Anyway, your son is all grown up now.

237
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,617
I saw his photo from his college entrance ceremony.

238
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:47,857
Do you know me?

239
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,626
You brat!

240
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:53,197
I gave you pocket money and adored you when you were little.

241
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:57,036
You know this man too?

242
00:17:57,397 --> 00:17:58,796
Is she your girlfriend?

243
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:02,065
Nice to meet you.

244
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,477
We're engaged.

245
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:08,247
I see. My gosh, Yo Han really is all grown up now.

246
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:13,316
Right?

247
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,416
This happened in the blink of an eye.

248
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,457
For real.

249
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,987
Invite me to your wedding. You have to, okay?

250
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:21,427
I'll be expecting an invitation. I'm serious.

251
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:25,256
I should go do something about my shirt.

252
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:26,866
I'll be in touch.

253
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:29,167
- Okay. - It was nice seeing you.

254
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,407
Will I get an invite too?

255
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:44,147
Hey, go to my car and get me a shirt.

256
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:46,217
Yes, there are some in the trunk. Get me a white one.

257
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:48,046
I'm in the men's room. Hurry.

258
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,796
Too bad that happened before you could even meet her.

259
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,266
I'm not sure if this will make you feel better,

260
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:11,376
but it looks like game over, so quit trying.

261
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:12,806
What are you talking about?

262
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:14,346
Min Kang Yoon.

263
00:19:14,677 --> 00:19:17,576
Last year, she even rejected a candidate her father recommended.

264
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:18,947
This time, I hear she's decided...

265
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:22,546
to invest in some unicorn company she's obsessed with.

266
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:26,927
Is this credible information?

267
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:30,397
You know that she's very unpredictable.

268
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:36,596
With Min Kang Yoon, there's never a guarantee.

269
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:42,006
And who are you?

270
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:49,917
(Cryptocurrency Investment and Consulting, CEO Blue)

271
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:02,256
(Cryptocurrency Investment and Consulting, CEO Blue)

272
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:08,967
This is a boring party, no?

273
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:12,036
Sorry for throwing such a lame party.

274
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:14,766
It's fun.

275
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,806
I got to see you, Ms. Min.

276
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:20,447
Me?

277
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:22,106
Why?

278
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:26,417
Because you're...

279
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:30,217
a person who can give me what I need.

280
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:35,487
Do I look like a nice girl who will give you things?

281
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:38,296
Compared to your father, yes.

282
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:42,997
I have nothing, though.

283
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:45,596
Compared to my dad.

284
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,006
Kang Soo just stepped out of the bathroom.

285
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:56,207
Let's move for now.

286
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:03,256
Kang Soo is in the lobby.

287
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:06,326
He's entering. We need to hurry.

288
00:21:16,397 --> 00:21:17,397
Wait.

289
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:19,397
You don't have a choice.

290
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:21,237
Exit through the emergency exit on your right.

291
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:29,447
Ms. Min.

292
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:31,977
Mr. Ma!

293
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:35,417
I love the atmosphere of this party.

294
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:38,187
It's all thanks to you.

295
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:39,487
You're welcome.

296
00:21:39,826 --> 00:21:42,286
I guess Ms. Jang is not here yet.

297
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:44,397
Pardon?

298
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:50,467
Hi, there.

299
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,766
I'm sorry I didn't send you the invitation.

300
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:55,707
Don't be.

301
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:57,806
I'm here, aren't I?

302
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:01,947
- Mr. Ma. - Ms. Jang.

303
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:06,016
I was going to ask Mr. Ma for his understanding.

304
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:09,316
I see.

305
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:12,417
I called her urgently last night...

306
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,526
to tell her that we'd issue Navis Well-being's gift cards.

307
00:22:16,157 --> 00:22:17,596
I thought that you should know.

308
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:19,765
Navis Well-being's gift cards?

309
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:22,467
The gift card project is pretty extensive.

310
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,296
I'm afraid it'll affect your business proposal.

311
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:28,206
Give my risk management team some time to review the plan.

312
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,207
Is that all right?

313
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,006
Sure. No problem.

314
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:37,776
Then, I'll get back to you on the 15th.

315
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:39,016
I'll be waiting.

316
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:40,585
Thanks for coming, Ms. Jang.

317
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:41,887
I'll see you next time, Mr. Ma.

318
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:51,796
What do you think you're doing?

319
00:22:53,427 --> 00:22:55,866
Have you eventually lost your senses?

320
00:22:56,437 --> 00:22:57,467
Why?

321
00:22:58,296 --> 00:23:00,237
Are you worried that Kang Yoon will reject you?

322
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:04,506
You're out of your mind.

323
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:06,947
If she does reject you,

324
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:09,407
I'll let you in on my business.

325
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,316
You're welcome to take a spot.

326
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:25,457
Do your worst.

327
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:42,346
It's not over yet.

328
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:46,917
I'm going to get Kang Yoon, no matter what.

329
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:48,487
I can't go empty-handed.

330
00:23:51,116 --> 00:23:52,286
Pull back, everyone.

331
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:55,756
Da Jung, find out where Kang Yoon is.

332
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:24,387
Get a taxi.

333
00:24:47,806 --> 00:24:50,576
I thought you had gone home with that man.

334
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:54,747
Is he your boyfriend?

335
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:57,256
We're colleagues.

336
00:24:58,487 --> 00:25:00,427
I wasn't lying about what I said earlier.

337
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,197
I have no money or power.

338
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:05,326
That's not entirely true.

339
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:08,196
All those people up there...

340
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:10,836
were there to talk to you.

341
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:16,937
You must want more than a talk, seeing that you've come this far.

342
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:21,506
How much do you need?

343
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,247
Let's meet once again.

344
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:30,516
Isn't it money that you want?

345
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,256
Well, it suits me.

346
00:25:39,397 --> 00:25:42,397
But you only get one chance, okay?

347
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:50,922
Why do you unnecessarily attract people's attention?

348
00:25:51,622 --> 00:25:54,521
I'm doing business. I need to make a profit.

349
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:56,962
Who asked you to make a profit?

350
00:25:57,761 --> 00:25:59,761
Can't you see that doing nothing is our best option?

351
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:03,531
You walk into danger if you do nothing.

352
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,531
And you'll be deserted.

353
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,402
So, what exactly is it that you're trying to do?

354
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:12,741
Begging her to choose you?

355
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,712
What's so wrong with this when it's the same money?

356
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,241
My plan may work better.

357
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:19,881
That's not up to you.

358
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:22,751
You were out of options the moment Kang Soo emerged.

359
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:28,990
You're intentionally interrupting us wrap it up,

360
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:30,191
and it's dangerous.

361
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:31,661
Don't drag it out too long, and end it.

362
00:26:31,662 --> 00:26:32,921
If this goes south,

363
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,331
you will not leave in one piece.

364
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:42,301
"We."

365
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:47,071
It's "we."

366
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,482
You wanted to flee together.

367

368
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,081
trust me, and wait.

370

371
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:06,561
what's in your head.

372
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,791
I need to see everything...

373
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,031
so that I can trust you,

374
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,402

378
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:39,091

How did Kyung Ja find out about that?

383
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:23,031
I wonder how she knew where I was and who I met.

384
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,271
I thought very hard about it,

385
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:31,182
and you were the only one who touched my phone.

386
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,810
You went through my text messages...

387
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,051
as you installed the security cameras, didn't you?

388
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:39,281
Did you or did you not?

389
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:49,892
Did you or did you not, you punk?

390
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:51,862
It wasn't me.

391
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:54,232
You won't say you didn't see it.

392
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:28,301
What about Mr. Min?

393
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:30,642
He said he'd be in touch.

394
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,571
He said you shouldn't worry too much.

395
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:36,372
It sounds like I should worry a bit.

396
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:39,081
You know how unpredictable she is.

397
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:46,381
To Min Kang Yoon, nothing is unconditional.

398
00:29:46,382 --> 00:29:48,591

399

Members can get them at a 20-percent discount,

404

More and more people are applying for a membership,

408

Jang Kyung Ja was a con artist too.

411
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:47,152
If the president approves of her, she'll give him the profits,

412
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:49,751
and if not, she'll keep it for herself.

413
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:55,192
She's saying she won't go out without a fight.

414
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,392
Why be so irresponsible?

415
00:30:57,662 --> 00:30:59,490
If the company doesn't pay up,

416
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,061
the business must shoulder the debt.

417
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:03,632
She doesn't have to think about that.

418
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:05,301
It's not worth caring.

419
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,531
They're ants she never sees.

420
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:12,202
We don't care or feel responsible if we step on an ant.

421
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:14,511

424
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:22,780
reveals the company at the briefing,

425
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,151
and announces the merger,

426
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:26,321

I have.

So what?

485
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:24,721
Should a fraud become honest?

502
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:23,982

00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:37,672
You can never do business with someone you don't trust.

550
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:57,521
Drink up.

551
00:40:57,862 --> 00:40:59,962
Down it even if you can't drink. To get what you want, that is.

552
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,391
Just drinking like this is no fun.

553
00:41:05,402 --> 00:41:06,632
Let's play a game.

554
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:10,331
What kind of game?

555
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:13,971
Truth or dare.

556
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:19,512
Take a seat.

557
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:30,791
I see that you're quite impatient.

558
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:35,161
Why don't we relax and talk about some current events first?

559
00:41:35,732 --> 00:41:37,331
I'm sure you already vetted me.

560
00:41:38,402 --> 00:41:40,161
So there must be a reason why you came here.

561
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:45,201
Do I look like someone who has time to chitchat with you here?

562
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:49,712
Right.

563
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,580
I understand that you're a very successful man.

564
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:53,581
But you see,

565
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:56,351
I have my own values.

566
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,052
I can only do business with people who share the same values as mine.

567
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:28,581
Why did you get a divorce?

568
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,652
Shouldn't you be asking why I got married?

569
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:33,751
I already know the answer to that.

570
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:36,992
What is the answer?

571
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:43,632
Your lies.

572
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:01,212
I am...

573
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,851
a fraud.

574
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:06,152
I must take revenge,

575
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,322
and I need your help.

576
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:17,831
Please pick up, Ro Um.

577
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,732
The call cannot be connected. Please leave...

578
00:43:22,302 --> 00:43:23,831
We'll just go there and get Na Sa.

579
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:27,500
We won't get in.

580
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:29,341
He won't actually kill him.

581
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:30,342
He will.

582
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:31,882
He is certainly capable of killing.

583
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:38,081
Have you ever killed anyone?

584
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,621
You see, this is what stresses me out the most.

585
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:44,822
They die so easily.

586
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,191
It's always those who can't handle the consequences...

587
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:49,592
that put in all their money.

588
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:52,132
Then they get greedy, so they take out a loan.

589
00:43:53,532 --> 00:43:55,672
Then they just write a will.

590
00:43:55,871 --> 00:43:58,242
"It's the company's fault. I'm the victim here."

591
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:00,571
Stupid cockroaches.

592
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:03,311
I wouldn't have had to go to jail if those idiots hadn't done that.

593
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:09,451
When you run a business, you can't put people first.

594
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,021
So I've decided to see it this way.

595
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:14,592
"I should..."

596
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,192
"buy up expensive lives to begin with."

597
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:25,362
I shouldn't give the money...

598
00:44:25,601 --> 00:44:27,101
to Ma Kang Soo?

599
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:48,492
Ro Um.

600
00:44:49,992 --> 00:44:51,061
Yes, talk.

601
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:52,962
You two aren't done yet, right?

602
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,391
Na Sa will die if the investment falls through.

603
00:44:57,232 --> 00:44:58,661
Ma Kang Soo said he would kill him.

604
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:05,101
Be clear.

605
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:10,212
I told him I'd send the money on the dot.

606
00:45:25,992 --> 00:45:27,021
What's she saying?

607
00:45:27,462 --> 00:45:28,661
What is Ro Um saying?

608
00:45:44,712 --> 00:45:45,712
Oh, boy.

609
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,152
I'm sorry.

610
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:52,681
Let's do business together...

611
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,592
another time.

612
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:07,561
We did it!

613
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:10,401
(150 million dollars has been deposited, )

614
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:11,572
(and we received a 50 million dollar check at the office.)

615
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,101
Send money to the boys. Let's get started.

(Dajung Comic Books)

617
00:46:30,322 --> 00:46:31,391
Ro Um.

618
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:42,732
You made the right decision.

(Dajung Comic Books)

620
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:55,251
Yes, that's it.

621
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:57,282
Yes. That's right.

622
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:58,951
We did it.

(Yiyang Bio)

624
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:02,221
We did it!

625
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,962
What is the gain on this?

626
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,871
Hey, Su Ho. Your life has been spared.

627
00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:20,701
Oh, my.

628
00:47:20,842 --> 00:47:21,842
Yes, come in.

629
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:26,040
We need you in the lobby, sir.

630
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,081
Why?

631
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:32,581
What's up?

632
00:47:34,822 --> 00:47:36,021
My gosh.

633
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:41,192
Hey, mister!

634
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,262
Hey, Ko Yo Han.

635
00:47:43,431 --> 00:47:44,601
How have you been?

636
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:47,732
I heard one of the offenders I manage was here.

637
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:50,271
What? Offenders?

638
00:47:50,802 --> 00:47:52,101
I guess you don't know.

639
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:54,811
I'm a probation officer.

640
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,680
Anyway, that's not important.

641
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:01,712
I'm here to pick up my precious offender.

642
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:04,652
Who is this offender?

643
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:08,492
The one in your office right now.

644
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,161
My goodness.

645
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:15,462
Is this how you usually do things? This is so random.

646
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:18,302
You didn't know?

647
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,732
I thought you knew me very well.

648
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,431
This is how I roll.

649
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:25,241
Did you bring a warrant?

650
00:48:25,242 --> 00:48:26,572
Come on now.

651
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:29,271
Why do I need a warrant? I thought we were close.

652
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:31,442
I'll send you my wedding invitation.

653
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,181
A search warrant, you idiot.

654
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,882
I have no such thing, you idiot.

655
00:48:40,552 --> 00:48:43,151
According to Article 40 of the Act on Probation,

656
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:44,692
I can arrest him immediately, you jerk.

657
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:48,961
All right, we're moving in now.

658
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:51,401
If you lay a finger on my boys here,

659
00:48:51,402 --> 00:48:53,232
I'll report you to the police for obstructing justice.

660
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:55,072
I'll get on the floor and get obnoxious.

661
00:48:55,902 --> 00:48:58,771
All these scenes are provided at a bargain...

662
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,342
unless you let us quietly take Mr. Na Su Ho.

663
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:02,641
Okay?

664
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:14,450
I have a very pleasant occasion today.

665
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,521
Right.

666
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,762
Open the gate.

667
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,431
This guy.

668
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,291

I'm Ma Kang Soo.

677
00:51:03,242 --> 00:51:07,213
While I was taking my time to reflect on myself,

678
00:51:07,383 --> 00:51:10,222
the world has made amazing progress.

679
00:51:10,952 --> 00:51:13,992
The people here will no longer invest...

680
00:51:14,353 --> 00:51:16,391
in old-fashioned items.

681
00:51:16,392 --> 00:51:20,362
And I am not here to bring you such items.

682
00:51:21,032 --> 00:51:22,362
We are...

683
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:25,003
going to change the future.

What are we going to change?

685
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,372
- The future! - The future!

686
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:29,842
That's right. The future!

687
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:33,173
I give you the new brand of Navis Well-being...

688
00:51:33,373 --> 00:51:36,682
that will help change your future.

689
00:51:36,883 --> 00:51:39,653
It is Navis Bio!

691
00:51:50,563 --> 00:51:53,091
- What do you like? - Money!

692
00:51:53,092 --> 00:51:54,662
That's right. You like money.

693
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:00,503
What?

694
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:02,873
- What is that? - What's going on?

695
00:52:03,972 --> 00:52:05,412
"Stock Price Manipulation?"

696
00:52:05,572 --> 00:52:07,341
What takes up 99 percent of the cause...

697
00:52:07,342 --> 00:52:09,182
of stock price manipulation failures?

698
00:52:10,483 --> 00:52:11,552
Internal discord.

699
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:15,853
Kang Soo has succeeded in stopping the virus.

700
00:52:19,322 --> 00:52:22,392
But what he failed to notice was a bug...

701
00:52:22,693 --> 00:52:24,123
that was already in there.

702
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:41,012

00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:00,633
Why are you ghosting me?

707
00:53:01,532 --> 00:53:03,403
You know that every second counts right now.

708
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:06,702
Ro Um?

709
00:53:06,703 --> 00:53:09,443
I have a bomb that can ruin the wrap-up.

710
00:53:09,903 --> 00:53:12,273
Now, I'm going to offer you a deal.

711
00:53:14,112 --> 00:53:15,141
What?

712
00:53:15,142 --> 00:53:16,681
If you refuse,

713
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:19,012
the recording of this phone call goes to Kang Soo.

714
00:53:20,112 --> 00:53:22,522
If he finds out that you agreed to scrap the wrap-up,

715
00:53:22,523 --> 00:53:24,822
he'll probably go insane, right?

716
00:53:25,492 --> 00:53:26,552
You already know...

717
00:53:27,322 --> 00:53:29,822
that emotion causes betrayals more than rationality.

718
00:53:31,693 --> 00:53:35,003
I guess that's why I hated you so much...

719
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:36,633
for the last ten years.

720
00:53:37,103 --> 00:53:39,903
But I'm a little different from you.

721
00:53:40,003 --> 00:53:41,133
So I'm going to give you an opportunity.

722
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:44,943
Tell me who the president is.

723
00:53:46,112 --> 00:53:47,313
Or I blow this up.

724
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:52,012
Go ahead.

725
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:56,452
You're foolish and arrogant.

726
00:53:56,682 --> 00:53:58,153
Go ahead and try it.

727
00:54:01,423 --> 00:54:02,463
I told you, didn't I?

728
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:04,892
I knew she wouldn't listen.

729
00:54:07,892 --> 00:54:09,003
I feel sorry for you.

730
00:54:10,063 --> 00:54:13,072
Jay tried so hard to save you.

731
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:20,172
Just like how Kang Soo buys stocks...

732
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,543
at the lowest and sells at the highest,

733
00:54:22,642 --> 00:54:25,912
we decided to go for the peak where he could suffer the most.

734
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:29,551
He's the only one that fails when he fails to get investments.

735
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:31,152
But when an official event fails,

736
00:54:31,153 --> 00:54:33,253
it's the failure of the entire Navis Well-being.

737
00:54:36,963 --> 00:54:40,133
(Starting)

738
00:54:40,662 --> 00:54:45,132
(Welcome)

739
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:48,672
(Navis Well-being)

740
00:54:48,673 --> 00:54:51,813
Take the business plan out of Kang Soo's computer.

741
00:54:55,612 --> 00:54:58,682
Take over the network of Navis Well-being.

742
00:54:58,952 --> 00:55:01,051
It's always the ones with zero capabilities...

743
00:55:01,052 --> 00:55:03,222
that invest their whole fortune.

744
00:55:03,682 --> 00:55:06,353
- Then, they get greedy... - For entertaining purposes,

745
00:55:06,523 --> 00:55:08,793
we add audiovisual materials.

746
00:55:09,092 --> 00:55:10,123
Lastly,

747
00:55:11,793 --> 00:55:12,991
we drop the bomb.

748
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:15,002
It's always the ones with zero capabilities...

749
00:55:15,003 --> 00:55:16,963
that invest their whole fortune.

750
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:19,572
Then, they get greedy and get loans.

751
00:55:20,773 --> 00:55:23,341
And they write their last wills.

752
00:55:23,342 --> 00:55:24,543
Have you ever killed anyone?

753
00:55:24,673 --> 00:55:26,912
You see, this is what stresses me out the most.

754
00:55:27,412 --> 00:55:29,543
They die so easily.

755
00:55:30,742 --> 00:55:31,812
They'll turn the computer off, right?

756
00:55:31,813 --> 00:55:34,282
Na Sa's flash drive installs a rootkit.

757
00:55:34,912 --> 00:55:36,983
You might as well speak moon language.

758
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:41,992
It enables better attacks as he tries to defend it.

759
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:43,792
"It's the company's fault."

760
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:44,963
"I'm a victim."

761
00:55:45,662 --> 00:55:46,991
Those pieces of trash.

762
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:49,762
Had they not told a lie, I wouldn't have gone to prison.

763
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:53,432
Rebooting or vaccine software...

764
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:55,472
will only spread our attacks.

765
00:55:57,202 --> 00:55:58,242
I got a message!

766
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:00,141
(Stock Manipulation Using Navis Bio)

767
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:01,443
What are these?

768
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:04,882
- Is this for real? - Check this out!

769
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:07,353
- This can't be right. - No way!

770
00:56:07,612 --> 00:56:09,253
Fraud!

771
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:14,293
You told me not to invest earlier. Why are you asking me to send it?

772
00:56:15,063 --> 00:56:16,592
My teammates...

773
00:56:18,092 --> 00:56:19,133
will find a way.

774
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:21,463
What about me?

775
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:26,103
Isn't it my loss...

776
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:29,342
when Navis Bio goes to ruin after I invest in it?

777
00:56:31,503 --> 00:56:33,912
Your dad will get it back, anyway.

778
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:36,182
Whatever it costs.

779
00:56:40,813 --> 00:56:43,222
I liked Bae Ha Na for how tough she was.

780
00:56:44,423 --> 00:56:45,853
It turns out that Lee Ro Um is tougher.

781
00:56:46,623 --> 00:56:47,822
Fine, then.

782
00:56:50,293 --> 00:56:52,293
And one last thing.

783
00:56:54,592 --> 00:56:55,633
That man.

784
00:56:57,403 --> 00:56:58,773
It's not just a business relationship, is it?

785
00:57:01,802 --> 00:57:02,842
Keep that relationship,

786
00:57:04,373 --> 00:57:06,472
and don't hesitate to call me when you get bored.

787
00:57:11,483 --> 00:57:13,512
So I've decided to see it this way.

788
00:57:13,912 --> 00:57:14,983
"I should..."

789
00:57:16,552 --> 00:57:18,623
"buy up expensive lives to begin with."

790
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:23,262
Gosh.

791
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:25,991
That stock price is going to plunge tomorrow.

(Navis Well-being)

793
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:35,072
This is going to lead Kang Soo's men to panic-sell.

794
00:57:46,853 --> 00:57:48,383
- Find her. - Who, sir?

795
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:51,222
Find Jang Kyung Ja!

796
00:57:51,282 --> 00:57:52,452
Let's move!

797
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:56,261
If you refuse,

798
00:57:56,262 --> 00:57:58,563
the recording of this phone call goes to Kang Soo.

799
00:58:13,173 --> 00:58:15,483
Now, I'm going to offer you a deal.

800
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:18,043
Tell me who the president is.

801
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:20,313
Or I blow this up.

802
00:58:36,862 --> 00:58:38,633
You witch!

803
00:58:41,373 --> 00:58:42,403
My gosh.

804
00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:44,943
You just won't stop, will you?

805
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:47,842
Do you think life's that simple?

806
00:58:50,182 --> 00:58:51,411
Did you think...

807
00:58:51,412 --> 00:58:53,512
you were a queen because I was respectful?

808
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:01,552
Do you think you ruined me?

809
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,123
No.

810
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:06,793
If you die here and now,

811
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,702
it'll be over.

812
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:10,432
So die.

813
00:59:11,003 --> 00:59:12,003
Die!

814
00:59:12,273 --> 00:59:15,302
Gosh, do you believe what just happened?

815
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:18,173
That was crazy.

816
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:02,753
Well done.

817
01:00:54,773 --> 01:00:56,141
(I'm sorry.)

818
01:00:56,142 --> 01:00:58,912
I don't have the courage to ruin Moo Young's future.

819
01:01:00,112 --> 01:01:01,142
I'm sorry.

820
01:01:33,112 --> 01:01:34,212
Surprise 100,

821
01:01:34,213 --> 01:01:36,983
please welcome child genius Lee Ro Um!

822
01:01:52,992 --> 01:01:54,633
Okay. Lee Ro Um has to...

823
01:01:55,662 --> 01:01:58,103
recite everything perfectly.

824
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:00,472
Lee Ro Um?

825
01:02:04,202 --> 01:02:07,042
It looks like Ro Um is nervous.

826
01:02:07,043 --> 01:02:08,782
It's very possible.

827
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,712
What's this?

828
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:14,352
Ro Um, will you tell us about number 25?

829
01:02:14,353 --> 01:02:15,353
The president.

The comic book store. Was that you?

833
01:02:51,623 --> 01:02:53,891
Was that the contents of the notebook you tried to steal?

834
01:02:53,892 --> 01:02:55,891
A lighter? She hid something in it.

835
01:02:55,892 --> 01:02:58,661
Don't you want to repay your debt to Ro Um?

836
01:02:58,662 --> 01:03:00,761
Does it have the president's identity?

837
01:03:00,762 --> 01:03:02,462
The president reacted,

838
01:03:02,463 --> 01:03:04,602
and is likely to make a move.

839
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:06,172
Let's tie down Navis.

840
01:03:06,173 --> 01:03:07,832
The problem is the media.

841
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,672
Teach them that first!

842
01:03:09,673 --> 01:03:11,902
The attitude they must have!

843
01:03:11,903 --> 01:03:13,611
It's more of an invitation than a warning.

844
01:03:13,612 --> 01:03:15,583
As if he'll appear in person.

845
01:03:23,423 --> 01:03:25,383
Do you know me?

01:03:25,853 --> 01:03:26,853
(What is this guy?)

847
01:03:26,854 --> 01:03:29,362
You could say he's unique?

848

An attention seeker who wants to look mysterious.

849
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:35,661
Do you tend not to lie?

850
01:03:35,662 --> 01:03:36,733
