1
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,264
You're...

2
00:00:58,694 --> 00:00:59,694
fired.

3
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:12,473
How are you sure that girl...

4
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,443
and Lee Ro Um are the same person?

5
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:16,782
What do you mean?

6
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:20,083
The Lee Ro Um you saw years ago as a child...

7
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:21,853
was a little girl.

8
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:24,384
What kind of person Lee Ro Um is now,

9
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:26,354
what kind of adult she has become,

10
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:28,394
you can't tell based on that.

11
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:32,794
Didn't you yourself feel...

12
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:34,693
how unfamiliar...

13
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,934
Lee Ro Um was?

14
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:40,934
I think that is what's important right now.

15
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,202
Is the current Lee Ro Um...

16
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:48,074
the same person as the child you wanted to help?

17
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,593
(Episode 3)

18
00:02:03,964 --> 00:02:04,964
What?

19
00:02:05,194 --> 00:02:06,593
What are you staring at?

20
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:08,634
Is there something interesting?

21
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,434
Don't you have something to do?

22
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,733
Of course I do.

23
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,474
That's why I'm here.

24
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:17,604
But don't worry.

25
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:19,372
I'll watch for ten more minutes...

26
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,914
before heading off to get someone.

27
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:24,313
Don't mind me.

28
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,113
The woman I'm picking up is family.

29
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:28,413
But then, you don't have to...

30
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,354
get jealous or anything.

31
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:32,423
She's family, but not my wife...

32
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,393
What's wrong?

33
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:39,834
(Love Share Service, Ministry of Justice)

34
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,784
Were you lied to and duped all your life?

35
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:04,683
It's not just a grade A clip. It's a grade A-plus.

36
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,893
She's real famous.

37
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:19,303
Hey.

38
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:21,703
Hey, you!

39
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:23,844
Darn it.

40
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:25,414
Gosh.

41
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:28,243
It's perfect weather to lynch someone.

42
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:30,813
You treated a million-dollar suit...

43
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:32,182
as if it were worth a dollar.

44
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:34,383
What will you do about the loss,

45
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:35,923
Mr. Han Moo Young?

46
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:37,284
Goodness.

47
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,654
We didn't even get a down payment.

48
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,154
I apologize.

49
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:44,193
This Lee Ro Um is more harm to us than good.

50
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:45,993
Is there something about her?

51
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:48,633
Nothing that involves her works out.

52
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:49,663
Am I wrong?

53
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,363
Will you tell me...

54
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,673
you won't see her again,

55
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,203
and nothing else will happen?

56
00:03:57,743 --> 00:04:00,012
I even got you out of a disciplinary committee.

57
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:01,314
Will you tell me that?

Moo Young.

61
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:13,553
- Excuse me. - Sure.

62
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:17,094
What?

63
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:23,404
Is this really happening? His boss was talking.

64
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:24,833
Hello?

65
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,534
Mr. Han, it's me.

00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:33,314
I know that, and I'm listening.

68
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,483
I'm at Dongma Park.

69
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:38,314
Lee Ro Um needs a lawyer.

70
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:40,654
Did something happen to her?

71
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,254
Come and see for yourself.

72
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:46,323
I have to pick up a female member of my family...

73
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:48,824
who isn't my spouse, so...

74
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:52,293
- Hello? - Hey, let go!

75
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:54,594
Hey, come out. What's your problem?

76
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,702
- What happened? - Come out!

77
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,733
Darn it.

78
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:59,633
- Calm down. - Let go!

79
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,733
- We'll have to call the police. - Hey, come out.

80
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,243
Hey!

81
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:05,773
I told you to come out!

82
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:08,273
- Calm down, will you? - What's going on?

83
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,083
Ms. Lee! It's me, Ko Yo Han.

84
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:14,014
I called Mr. Han Moo Young, so wait just a few minutes.

85
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:16,953
Who?

86
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:18,823
I have somewhere to be, so I'm leaving.

87
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:23,524
I called the cops, so wait just a little longer.

00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:26,964
(Love Share Service, Ministry of Justice)

89
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:32,774
Who did he call?

90
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:36,774
He said he called the cops!

91
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:45,552
Mr. Attorney, don't stand around like that. Take a seat.

92
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,683
Bring that chair.

93
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:50,524
I told you that he wasn't my attorney.

94
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:53,253
Then shall I represent him instead?

95
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:55,623
I'm Han Moo Young.

96
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:01,464
All right.

97
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:06,573
So you suddenly pulled the mop for no reason.

98
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:10,002
Because of that, you hurt your back.

99
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,003
No, my whole body.

100
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,173
I suffered a whole-body injury.

101
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,883
I stole your cell phone, didn't I?

102
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:22,483
What? What is this nonsense about?

103
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:29,294
All you did was hurt me physically.

104
00:06:29,363 --> 00:06:30,594
What's going on here?

105
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:33,464
Did she steal your phone... I mean,

106
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,363
is it true that you got your phone stolen?

107
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,704
No, not at all.

108
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:42,003
Then why did you call it in?

109
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,204
I wasn't the one who called it in.

110
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:49,344
This woman's probation officer called it in.

111
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,014
Mr. Ko Yo Han called the police?

112
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,584
Well, then first...

113
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:57,583
As the assailant is saying, you only admit to the assault...

114
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,594
No, I mean... Not the assault.

115
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,264
The victim is...

116
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,423
No, I really stole it.

117
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:06,693
Go ahead and search me.

118
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:08,334
My back!

119
00:07:09,704 --> 00:07:12,904
My back is okay now, so I'll just head home.

120
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,774
All right, then.

121
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:17,604
What are you two doing right now?

122
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:21,144
Then how am I supposed to summarize it and write a report?

123
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,943
Talk to the lawyer.

124
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,993
I believe you don't really need my help here.

125
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,923
You're useless.

126
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:37,294
All right.

127
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:41,433
You said she assaulted you but denied that she stole your phone.

128
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:43,603
You admitted that you stole his phone...

129
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:46,333
but denied that you assaulted him, but he said he was okay now.

130
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,433
That is correct.

131
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:49,203
I'll just go home.

132
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:50,673
We'll get going too, then.

133
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:54,844
(Police)

134
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,753
- Hey, give it back. - Gosh.

135
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:10,464
What are you doing?

136
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,834
Hey, give me back my phone.

137
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,264
How much will you give me?

138
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:19,474
That crazy little...

139
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:23,173
Why are you doing this to me?

140
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:24,774
What did I do to you?

141
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:26,243
That's enough.

142
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,644
(Done)

143
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,383
I'll give it back to you.

144
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,383
Call this number.

145
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,594
That little...

146
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,604
So you did steal his phone.

147
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:58,474
Why did you do that?

148
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:00,373
Because he got on my nerves.

149
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:02,943
Why?

150
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,584
Some people irritate me with their existence alone.

151
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:10,354
I'm meeting an awful lot of them these days.

152
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,154
It must be in the restroom at the park.

153
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:16,993
You told him you'd give it back.

154
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:18,994
You probably hid his phone there.

155
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:21,264
Put on your seat belt.

156
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,833
(Verified, you may now start the car.)

157
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:32,813
(Ready to drive)

158
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:51,264
How much will you ask for?

159
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:53,833
Are you saying I should sell this?

160
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,634
What a shame.

161
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:58,803
Others would even sell their organs to find what's on that phone.

162
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:03,504
- What is it? - It's unlocked. Take a look.

163
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:15,723
Ro Um.

164
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:19,994
Did you see these?

165
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:21,723
Yes.

166
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:23,863
And you want me to return this phone to him?

167
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:26,933
I checked thinking it was me, but it wasn't. So I don't care.

168
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,702
He didn't take pictures of you, so we can give this back to him?

169
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,973
Then go take it to the police.

170
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:38,043
If I hand this over to the police now,

171
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,943
he'll get you roped into this.

172
00:10:41,044 --> 00:10:42,713
As you know, a theft charge is separate.

173
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:50,284
What do you want to do, then?

174
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,423
You said you didn't want to give it back to him.

175
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:58,093
I'm asking what your plan is.

176
00:10:58,223 --> 00:10:59,962
We'll charge him for possessing illegally filmed materials...

177
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,394
and get our hands on the original files.

178
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:04,404
Then we'll leave his phone in a camera blind spot.

179
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,202
In his messenger, there's evidence that he was involved...

180
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:09,703
in filming and selling the materials on top of possessing them.

181
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,943
I believe he even signed a contract with a webhard company.

182
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,572
I planted malware on his phone,

183
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,614
so I can go through his hard drive and everything else.

184
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,213
You did what?

185
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:22,154
You didn't understand what I just said?

186
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:31,723
I have to explain such a simple procedure.

187
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:35,494
First, return his phone to him with the malware planted on it.

188
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:39,603
The malware will leak everything on his phone.

189
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:42,744
We're practically copying everything on his phone.

190
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:56,024
As soon as this jerk gets home, he'll back up all the data.

191
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:59,654
He'd be anxious because he had it stolen.

192
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:03,323
The moment the phone is connected to his desktop or to the cloud,

193
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:05,693
the malicious code would get planted on those too.

194
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:10,063
Based on the nature of what he does, he probably has other phones too.

195
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:17,774
We can gain full control over all the hacked devices.

196
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:33,494
From that point on, anything's possible.

197
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,423
We could tell his family about it.

198
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,963
"This jerk will betray you and rat you out to the police."

199
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,573
We could tell that to his business partners too.

200
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:51,173
(We need it by today. How come you haven't sent it yet?)

201
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,813
Darn it.

202
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,572
We could also take a classic approach...

203
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,583
and tell him to send us the money he earned through this.

204
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,884
- Then... - Ro Um.

205
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,024
What are you saying?

206
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,124
That's all illegal.

207
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,093
You're talking about the law now?

208
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,193
As a lawyer, it is my job to talk about the law.

209
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:16,033
He ordered food with the money he earned by blackmailing girls.

210
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,864
But he was released on probation thanks to that "law."

211
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,802
Is that your weapon?

212
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:23,774
What is your weapon, then? Assault and unlawful acts?

213
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:26,374
I use anything and everything I can use.

214
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,014
That includes lawyers.

215
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:31,812
A lawyer who offered to help me pro bono...

216
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,384
is standing right before me now.

217
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:37,583
Although I have no idea what he wants from me.

218
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:41,353
Some people help others without expecting anything in return...

219
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,563
and try to protect others even when they have no reason to.

220
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:47,692
I've never seen such people, but if they do exist,

221
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,463
I'd say they're total pushovers.

222
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,332
It's called a friend.

223
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:55,203
You become a tool because you don't realize that you're a mere tool.

224
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,904
Knock yourself out. Be my "friend" all you want.

225
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,923
He's been doing that since he got back from Cho and Son.

228

231
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:40,613
They concluded that he drowned in the valley...

232
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,013
where his adoptive mother took him.

233
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,883
They'll receive a six-figure insurance payout.

234
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,082
They filed for an injunction to stop the documentary...

235
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,323
from being broadcast.

236
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:49,764
They were making a fuss!

237
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,063
Cho and Son Law Firm did, I mean.

238
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,093
They asked for 50,000 dollars of settlement money.

239
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:57,264
We'll have to negotiate.

240
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,563

241
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,072

243
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:06,173
way more furious than before after the case closed.

244
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,414
She's entitled to be upset.

245

I'm not saying that I don't understand her.

246
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:14,453

249
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:21,493
and she's defaming them in the meantime!

250
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:24,294
She's been defaming them the whole time.

251
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,034

252

253

It was her fault for stealing it in the first place!

I didn't steal it. I've acquired a lost item.

Okay. Fine.

I can't get to personal clouds or the deep web.

365
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:35,394
That's much better than what I can do.

366
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,024
Please do that.

367
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,795
The other part sounded like the police's job.

368
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:42,894
What's wrong?

369
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:45,364
Nothing.

370
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,104
I'll look into it and call you.

371
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:51,075
How do you know Ms. Lee?

372
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:55,414
Oh, we were prison cell mates.

373
00:23:56,444 --> 00:23:57,485
I see.

374
00:23:58,844 --> 00:24:00,714
You're helping her?

375
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:01,854
Yes, that's right.

376
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:03,555
There's no way...

377
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:06,894
she told you that.

378
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:08,825
She doesn't care at all about me.

379
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,694
You must care a lot about her, though.

380
00:26:01,705 --> 00:26:03,874
What? You can't do it?

381
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:07,975
Stay awake. I'm always watching.

382
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:43,285
- Han Moo Young. - What?

383
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:48,584
We negotiated the settlement from 50,000 down to 5,000 dollars.

384
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,624
Don't I deserve some acknowledgement?

385
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:54,725
Are you talking about Seo Gye Sook?

386
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:57,465
What about her son's case?

387
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:04,364
You...

388
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:07,035
You really...

389
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:11,144
Your mind is all over the place, isn't it?

390
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,275
The case was closed.

391
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:15,874
The insurance...

392
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,444
was paid out long ago.

393
00:27:19,684 --> 00:27:21,315
What do you mean the case was closed?

394
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:29,995
It was concluded an accidental death.

395
00:27:31,124 --> 00:27:33,394
An accidental death? What about the insurance?

396
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:37,505
What 18-year-old pays 2,000 dollars a month in premiums?

397
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,535
They were all life insurance policies.

398
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:44,144
I did all I could do.

399
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:49,244
The case was closed, but Seo Gye Sook kept protesting...

400
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:50,814
and acting out,

401
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:52,215
and I had to stop her.

402
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:56,584
As I just said, I negotiated the settlement down to a tenth.

403
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:58,285
What more should I do?

404
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:00,154
Investigate the death?

405
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:03,995
Do you admit that I did enough?

406
00:28:04,194 --> 00:28:07,864
As a lawyer, I did all I could do within my legal capacity.

407
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:10,433
Seo Gye Sook said she'd rather...

408
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:12,265
go to prison than settle,

409
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,834
and she's your problem now.

410
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,584
What on earth happened?

411
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:30,424
What a mess.

412
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:33,623
Don't even ask. It's a disaster zone.

413
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:35,424
Was there no maintenance done?

414
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:45,305
Everything here's a mess.

415
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:09,054

Han Moo Young speaking.

419
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:25,174
I did everything you asked me to.

420
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:28,015
Thanks a lot, Da Jung.

421
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,344
I'll pay you the outstanding amount.

422
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:32,584
- Are you at home? - Yes.

423
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:36,755
Am I being traced?

424
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:39,555
Something like that.

425
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:53,904
Ro Um.

426
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:58,374
For rent.

427
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:05,684
Is something wrong? Were you out?

428
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,854
The studio's flooded. Take the money.

429
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:14,094
Take it.

430
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:18,394
Why would I? This isn't a hotel.

431
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:20,265
Come in.

432
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:06,444
How long will you keep staring?

433
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:33,434
What are you looking at? Stop looking.

434
00:31:42,344 --> 00:31:44,785
(Yoo Myung Hoon had multiple life insurance policies.)

435
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:49,815
What's that?

436
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:55,694
A suspected insurance fraud case.

437
00:31:55,825 --> 00:31:58,294
(Yoo Myung Hoon had multiple life insurance policies.)

438
00:31:58,295 --> 00:31:59,825
The adopted kid's accidental death?

439
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,535
It was in the news.

440
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:03,765
A grown kid got adopted out.

441
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:07,305
To a friend the mother trusted.

442
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,404
Then why is it fraud?

443
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:14,214
A guy who couldn't swim was found in deep waters...

444
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:16,114
without any safety equipment.

445
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:18,614
He had 15 life insurance policies.

446
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:21,784
Did his adoptive parents sell insurance?

447
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:23,315
The woman's sibling did.

448
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:25,284
How could you tell?

449
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:27,694
Insurance fraud requires someone with experience.

450
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:29,455
Were they caught?

451
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:31,594
No.

452
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:34,234
The death was ruled accidental,

453
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,065
and the insurance money was paid out.

454
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:39,465
- Then it's over. - Not yet.

455
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:42,735
The birth mother refuses to settle, and I'm helping her.

456
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:48,613
You're helping her refuse to settle?

457
00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:50,285
I should help her settle.

458
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,714
It'll get even harder if the defamation charge sticks.

459
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:55,315
Why is she refusing to settle?

460
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:56,684
Because she's penniless?

461
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,255
Because of her son.

462
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:03,025
If she settles, it means admitting the adoptive parents were right.

463
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:06,124
The truth will be buried.

464
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:08,565
See if you can say that for a smaller amount of money.

465
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:12,805
It's not about money. I want to fight to the end.

466
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,075
"Fight?"

467
00:33:15,634 --> 00:33:19,144
It looks like you're whining, keeping the neighbourhood awake.

468
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:21,744
If someone killed your child,

469
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:23,883
you must gouge out their eyes and dig out their heart...

470
00:33:23,884 --> 00:33:25,644
in front of their family.

471
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:28,854
That's what you must do to call yourself family.

472
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:30,883
If you thought someone else...

473
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,285
could do a better job raising your child,

474
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,394
whether it ends in abuse or murder,

475
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:37,325
that's what you must live with.

476
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:40,124
Her kid died because of the choice she made.

477
00:33:41,434 --> 00:33:43,634
Expecting society to pay the price...

478
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:46,265
is cowardice.

479
00:33:48,604 --> 00:33:49,634
Go tell her.

480
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:52,744
If she has a conscience, she should know...

481
00:33:52,745 --> 00:33:54,875
to gladly pay the consequences for her own actions,

482
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:57,185
even if it leads to pure misery.

483
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:58,785
Ro Um.

484
00:34:01,614 --> 00:34:04,685
No one can pay the consequences for their every action.

485
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,125
That's why we all need others.

486
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:14,335
What can other people do for her?

487
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:18,734
No matter how difficult the situation is,

488
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:21,504
I'll fight alongside her to the end.

489
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,495
Your dad and I came to get you.

490
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:44,325
Come with us.

491
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:47,134
Let's go home.

492
00:34:49,694 --> 00:34:51,705
- Ro Um... - Ro Um.

493
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:53,835
- No! - Ro Um...

495
00:35:57,935 --> 00:35:59,105

(Details: The defendant defamed the plaintiff.)

498
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:30,805
My rent.

499
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:32,904
I said you didn't need to pay rent.

500
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,974
Where did you get this?

501
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,274
The box next door.

502
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,085
(Chungju Apples)

503
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,725
It's Sunday.

504
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,954
I have to meet the client I told you about yesterday.

505
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:57,464
(1 Box of Red Apples, Buy)

506
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:01,035
You live your life inefficiently.

507
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:07,875
I'm sure you can understand Ms. Seo Gye Sook.

508
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,503
You filed a damage claim too.

509
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:13,245
Wasn't it because you wanted to reveal the truth?

510
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:19,585
A trial won't bring out the truth.

511
00:37:19,944 --> 00:37:22,214
I beg to differ. A trial can bring out the truth.

512
00:37:22,984 --> 00:37:25,225
It's what softies do.

513
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,154
Those who believe that the law is justice.

514
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:29,325
That doesn't mean revenge is justice.

515
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:32,625
Revenge is always justice.

516
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:36,035
Since way before the law you always talk about was created.

517
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:39,535
Since the moment humans admitted their weakness.

518
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,705
Why was the law created to begin with?

519
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:46,745
Because personal acts of vengeance yielded miserable results.

520
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:50,375
It was unethical and unfair.

521
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,185
Are you sure about that?

522
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:56,455
In my opinion, it is the only solution in this situation.

523
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:59,524
Tell her to hire someone if she doesn't want to do it herself.

524
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:01,355
Shall I give you a hitman's number?

525
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:04,924
Do you like magic?

526
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:07,464
Then I'll show you a magic trick...

527
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:10,705
that can turn your probation into jail time.

528
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:15,503
Make yourself at home until your living situation gets sorted out.

529
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,705
I'll go sleep somewhere else if you want me to.

530
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:20,044
What about you?

531
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:23,645
Do you like magic?

532
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:26,015
No, not really.

533
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:28,714
It is deception, after all.

534
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:40,634
You will learn to like it.

535
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:46,165
Let me show you some magic too.

536
00:38:54,314 --> 00:38:55,314
Hey.

537
00:38:58,145 --> 00:38:59,145
Yes.

538
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:00,754
Another lawyer is here.

539
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:08,994
I...

540
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:10,424
I won't settle.

541
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:13,825
If you don't settle...

542
00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:15,794
I know I'll serve jail time.

543
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,404
Mr. Cho already told me everything.

544
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:23,633
I do not understand why he sent another lawyer.

545
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:26,205
Especially if you're here to say the exact same thing.

546
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:30,915
Please leave.

547
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:32,944
Don't waste your time.

548
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,924
Since I'm never the one actually going through it,

549
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:47,225
showing tears...

550
00:39:48,794 --> 00:39:50,535
and anger could be perceived...

551
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,574
as disrespectful by the person who's in that situation,

552
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:57,035
and it's nothing but shallow sympathy.

553
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:02,674
I can't say I know what they're going through,

554
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:06,444
nor can I say I understand their pain.

555
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:18,864
I can't tell them that I'm hurting just as much.

556
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:33,975
Back then,

557
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:37,585
you were...

558
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:39,515
the person going through it.

559
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:19,424
Don't worry about me. Just go.

560
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:22,625
Mom, I don't want you...

561
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:26,964
to suffer anymore.

562
00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:40,904
Hello.

563
00:42:56,484 --> 00:42:57,524
Excuse me.

564
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,055
Could you recommend a mindless book?

565
00:43:06,024 --> 00:43:07,634
("Cat Bookstore")

566
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:46,165
When are you going to quit visiting?

567
00:43:47,265 --> 00:43:48,934
I perfectly understand...

568
00:43:48,935 --> 00:43:50,435
No, you don't!

569
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:53,375
How would you understand?

570
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:55,475
I frustrate you, don't I?

571
00:43:56,575 --> 00:43:58,914
You think I'm some ignorant lady...

572
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:00,645
who doesn't even know the law.

573
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:06,355
This may be one of many cases that you take,

574
00:44:06,884 --> 00:44:08,094
but to me,

575
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:12,194
this is the death of my one and only child.

576
00:44:12,464 --> 00:44:14,895
This case will haunt me until the day I die.

577
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:18,734
This case sets fire...

578
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:23,305
to my heart thousands of times a day.

579
00:44:27,174 --> 00:44:28,614
You don't have to settle.

580
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,285
I'm merely your spokesman.

581
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:37,254
Whatever it is you want, tell me. I'll listen...

582
00:44:38,484 --> 00:44:40,825
and do what I can as your lawyer.

583
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,864
(Put the books back!)

584
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:47,524
Welcome.

585
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:53,335
Where's your room?

586
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:57,234
Do you mean the computer room?

587
00:45:00,274 --> 00:45:01,314
In the back.

588
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:05,044
I need you to do something for me.

589
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:08,455
Come inside.

590
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:17,793
- Come on. - No!

591
00:45:17,794 --> 00:45:19,394
(Dongsan Kindergarten)

592
00:45:19,395 --> 00:45:20,724
Listen to your teacher.

593
00:45:20,725 --> 00:45:22,733
Ask me whatever you want to eat.

594
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:24,534
I want to have steak today.

595
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:26,935
Sure. We'll go to your favourite restaurant tonight.

596
00:45:27,205 --> 00:45:29,074
And I want a game console.

597
00:45:29,075 --> 00:45:30,634
We're rich.

598
00:45:33,404 --> 00:45:34,943
Don't ever say that.

599
00:45:34,944 --> 00:45:36,015
Say what?

600
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,785
I'll buy you that game console,

601
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:42,514
so don't mention the insurance money.

602
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:44,185
I want game disks too.

603
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:46,924
- I get it. - And steak!

604
00:45:47,254 --> 00:45:48,495
I will!

605
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,923
And don't let Dad eat it.

606
00:45:50,924 --> 00:45:54,594
Dad finished all my food last time, and I had nothing to eat.

607
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,094
If you do that again...

608
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:01,575
I told you not to hit me.

609
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:03,273
You can't eat it too.

610
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:04,875
I get it!

611
00:46:05,844 --> 00:46:07,874
- Good morning. - Hello.

612
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:11,114
Sin Woo, you must have a big appetite.

613
00:46:11,444 --> 00:46:14,484
Apparently. Still, you should share with your parents.

614
00:46:15,754 --> 00:46:18,555
We do share. He only says that.

615
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,125
Let's go.

616
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:25,293
I'm so worried that my kid will be in his class.

617
00:46:25,294 --> 00:46:26,495
So am I.

618
00:46:27,165 --> 00:46:30,734
We have a very important guest today.

619
00:46:31,364 --> 00:46:34,975
She majored in Child Psychology at Brown University.

620
00:46:35,205 --> 00:46:37,844
Affiliated with the San Francisco Government,

621
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:42,773
Kid's Heart is a center that takes care of youth mental health,

622
00:46:42,774 --> 00:46:46,044
and she's been successfully running it.

623
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:48,785
Please welcome Dr. Courtney Kwon.

624
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:58,524
I'm Courtney Kwon, a child psychology specialist.

625
00:46:58,594 --> 00:47:00,765
It's a pleasure to meet you.

626
00:47:06,265 --> 00:47:07,834
I've observed...

627
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:10,835
the parents and the children on their way to school.

628
00:47:10,975 --> 00:47:14,645
And I've noticed something quite significant.

629
00:47:18,915 --> 00:47:20,785
Will you introduce yourself?

630
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:22,814
- Me? - Yes.

631
00:47:23,455 --> 00:47:26,024
What is your son's name?

632
00:47:27,524 --> 00:47:29,094
It's Choi Sin Woo.

633
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:30,594
I see.

634
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:34,794
He certainly stood out.

635
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:39,503
An abnormal appetite, self-centered thinking,

636
00:47:39,504 --> 00:47:42,435
limited vocabulary, and violent inclination.

637
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:44,904
He's not that bad.

638
00:47:45,205 --> 00:47:46,745
That's what is seen...

639
00:47:46,975 --> 00:47:49,214
from average people.

640
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,915
But here's what I sense from him.

641
00:47:53,185 --> 00:47:56,084
Super stimulus, extrasensory manifestation,

642
00:47:56,085 --> 00:47:58,555
and triggered introversion and extroversion.

643
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:02,994
These are qualities found in children with Einstein's cell,

644
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:05,325
namely, the genius cell.

645
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:10,765
All parents desire their children's specialness.

646
00:48:10,964 --> 00:48:13,434
The moment their children are acknowledged...

647
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:16,375
as superior to other children,

648
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:18,544
that becomes a trophy of its own.

649
00:48:19,044 --> 00:48:21,444
It may sound preposterous, but you'll see it soon.

650
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,084
The more foolish the parents are, the likelier they are...

651
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:28,355
to sell everything they've got to pursue that fantasy.

652
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:35,325
(Child Psychology Specialist, Courtney Kwon)

653
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:41,594
Your son has recently experienced a close person's death, hasn't he?

654
00:48:42,665 --> 00:48:44,634
If so, it's now or never.

655
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:49,004
This will be a turning point in Sin Woo's life.

656
00:48:51,944 --> 00:48:53,174
Here.

657
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:02,415
We honestly raise our children with love.

658
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:10,654
Do you have two children?

659
00:49:11,794 --> 00:49:12,825
- Yes. - Yes.

660
00:49:15,134 --> 00:49:16,835
Go away. Stop taking pictures of her.

661
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:21,605
You're hiding something from me.

662
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:25,204
I will conduct individual interviews on all the family members...

663
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:26,904
by the end of the week.

664
00:49:27,105 --> 00:49:30,113
I must know everything about what is currently going on,

665
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:32,414
what has happened, and what's going to happen,

666
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,645
within this family.

667
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:35,915
As I mentioned, your son's life...

668
00:49:36,384 --> 00:49:38,524
depends on this period.

669
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,055
(Update Error)

670
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,564
What are you staring at?

671
00:49:48,294 --> 00:49:51,504
I just can't get it to update.

672
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:53,105
Let me.

673
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,274
Look at that.

674
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:02,975
You already have the original app.

675
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:06,444
Delete these two, and...

676
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:07,685
Hang on.

677
00:50:18,633 --> 00:50:21,003
- Attorney Han, please check... - Sorry.

678
00:50:21,263 --> 00:50:23,702
Talk to me later. I'm late for a meeting.

679
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:29,072
Please take into consideration that our client was...

680
00:50:29,073 --> 00:50:33,312
going through severe mental anguish due to her son's death.

681
00:50:33,843 --> 00:50:36,451
The protest is her way of satisfying her grudge...

682
00:50:36,452 --> 00:50:37,852
and finding mental peace.

683
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,093
She never meant to harm anyone.

684
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:51,331
Does that mean that she'll keep protesting?

685
00:50:51,332 --> 00:50:52,503
I'll talk her out of it.

686
00:50:52,903 --> 00:50:55,673
But she'll need some time until she finds peace.

687
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:58,741
The ban on broadcasting it has been approved,

688
00:50:58,742 --> 00:51:00,073
so please understand.

689
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:03,412
(Park and Cue Law Firm)

690
00:51:04,772 --> 00:51:07,783
Our client has also mentally suffered.

691
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:09,752
It can be stressful to be accused...

692
00:51:09,753 --> 00:51:11,253
of murder.

693
00:51:11,582 --> 00:51:15,352
Moreover, Ms. Seo asked them to adopt Myung Hoon.

694
00:51:15,553 --> 00:51:17,693
The accident occurred while they were taking care of him.

695
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:20,292
She doesn't have the right to defame them for it.

696
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:22,033
I'm aware.

697
00:51:38,613 --> 00:51:40,943
(Seo Gye Sook: "Thank you for everything, Mr. Han.")

698
00:51:45,923 --> 00:51:47,883
("Thank you for everything, Mr. Han.")

699
00:52:20,952 --> 00:52:21,992
Ms. Seo.

700
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:26,093
No.

701
00:52:27,122 --> 00:52:29,392
Think about Myung Hoon, and stop.

702
00:52:33,162 --> 00:52:34,903
Unless I do this,

703
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:38,102
I'm just a mom...

704
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:41,673
who sent her son to her friend to save herself.

705
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:45,741
I didn't even care what he ate or how he dressed.

706
00:52:45,742 --> 00:52:48,383
I didn't even care how he slept.

707
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:01,492
My poor baby...

708
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:07,003
told me with his whole being that he didn't want to go to them.

709
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:11,503
I ignored and turned away.

710
00:53:12,073 --> 00:53:15,472
If the likes of me don't kill myself...

711
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:19,412
My poor Myung Hoon.

712
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:24,452
Who will avenge his wrongful death?

713
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:32,021
(June 14, 2022)

714
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:33,991
(I asked how Myung Hoon was doing.)

715
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:35,732
(Kim Bo Ra already had a plan.)

716
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:37,392
(They didn't tell me Myung Hoon was dead.)

717
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:43,602
We can reopen the case if we find physical evidence.

718
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:49,972
To do that, you must stay strong.

719
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:58,722
I miss my poor baby so much.

720
00:54:00,522 --> 00:54:04,022
If I could turn back time...

721
00:54:04,753 --> 00:54:07,693
to the day I last saw him...

722
00:54:08,863 --> 00:54:09,863
Then...

723
00:54:10,963 --> 00:54:12,003
Then...

724
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:13,202
Eat up.

725
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:16,403
Eat lots of veggies too.

726
00:54:16,872 --> 00:54:18,202
Chew it well.

727
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:24,513
I sent money for a new tee.

728
00:54:25,312 --> 00:54:26,883
Did your stepmom not buy you one?

729
00:54:29,952 --> 00:54:31,153
I should call her.

730
00:54:31,753 --> 00:54:33,153
Don't call.

731
00:54:38,053 --> 00:54:39,423
Will you go somewhere on holiday?

732
00:54:39,992 --> 00:54:41,693
- Yes. - Where?

733
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,463
To some valley stream.

734
00:54:44,832 --> 00:54:48,402
Even a trip like that must cost a lot...

735
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:49,772
for a family of five.

736
00:54:51,303 --> 00:54:53,971
I'll send some extra next week...

737
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:56,042
No, wait.

738
00:55:01,213 --> 00:55:02,952
Not next week.

739
00:55:03,153 --> 00:55:04,613
- Mom. - Yes?

740
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:09,693
Why did you have me?

741
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:16,193
What do you mean?

742
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:19,162
I just want to know.

743
00:55:23,932 --> 00:55:25,803
I keep dreaming of him.

744
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:32,042
As he sinks to the bottom of the cold stream,

745
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:35,312
Myung Hoon...

746
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:38,952
keeps asking...

747
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:43,152
(My son died a year after he was adopted.)

748
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:45,392
why I gave birth to him.

749
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:21,792
My goodness.

750
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:25,463
How come...

751
00:56:26,332 --> 00:56:28,033
You passed out in the street.

752
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:30,102
Why are you here?

753
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:35,002
I happened to call you right at that moment.

754
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:36,113
It was a stroke of luck.

755
00:56:37,343 --> 00:56:38,372
Hang on.

756
00:56:38,783 --> 00:56:41,042
I wonder which of the nurses I talked to.

757
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:43,483
She had a beautiful voice.

758
00:56:44,852 --> 00:56:46,952
Is that her over there?

759
00:56:47,622 --> 00:56:49,022
Why did you call me?

760
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:52,562
Oh, the studio apartment flooded,

761
00:56:53,062 --> 00:56:55,932
and I can't seem to locate Lee Ro Um.

762
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:03,173
You must be under a lot of stress.

763
00:57:03,673 --> 00:57:05,443
Do you see a shrink?

764
00:57:06,772 --> 00:57:07,772
(12th, Calendar)

765
00:57:13,883 --> 00:57:15,451
Considering the state you're in,

766
00:57:15,452 --> 00:57:17,452
I think you should find a new shrink.

767
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:19,721
Consultations cost a fortune and look at you.

768
00:57:19,722 --> 00:57:21,952
My doctor is just fine.

769
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:23,193
My gosh.

770
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:25,053
What patient's this loyal?

771
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:29,292
Take the opportunity to switch to someone good.

772
00:57:31,662 --> 00:57:32,803
Stay out of it.

773
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:38,272
I came all the way here for you.

774
00:57:41,272 --> 00:57:42,343
Thank you.

775
00:57:43,343 --> 00:57:44,412
You're welcome.

776
00:57:45,613 --> 00:57:47,343
(Moran Hospital)

777
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,682
You can go now.

778
00:57:57,952 --> 00:57:59,323
Okay, fine.

779
00:58:05,332 --> 00:58:06,403
I mean it.

780
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:09,202
I called a cab. You can go.

781
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:12,903
Our ancestors said no meant yes.

782
00:58:14,573 --> 00:58:16,943
You look so weak and frail.

783
00:58:17,272 --> 00:58:19,113
You'd flop with one nudge.

784
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:22,612
How do you think I'd feel to leave you...

785
00:58:22,613 --> 00:58:24,053
struggle to get home?

786
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:27,522
What are you on about?

787
00:58:28,082 --> 00:58:30,322
I'm fine, and a cab's on the way.

788
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:32,022
Our ancestors said...

789
00:58:32,463 --> 00:58:35,193
a vehement denial was a strong affirmation.

790
00:58:36,162 --> 00:58:38,192
What ancestor said...

791
00:58:38,193 --> 00:58:41,332
I can't believe I must watch over a lawyer too.

792
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:42,932
Goodness.

793
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:47,173
I'm such a great probation officer.

794
00:58:50,513 --> 00:58:51,573
Leave me alone now.

795
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:56,253
Yes means no.

796
00:59:02,253 --> 00:59:03,423
Take me home, then.

797
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:05,022
Yes.

798
00:59:13,503 --> 00:59:14,562
Go.

799
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:21,142
Isn't it time you go home?

800
00:59:23,912 --> 00:59:25,142
You're the frigid type.

801
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:27,513
I'll make sure you go inside.

802
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:47,463
Let's agree on...

803
00:59:47,832 --> 00:59:49,272
a few things.

804
00:59:50,803 --> 00:59:53,502
Things you must do to protect yourself...

805
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:55,772
when you deal with Lee Ro Um.

806
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:00,783
First,

807
01:00:01,343 --> 01:00:04,312
don't go against your principles as a lawyer.

808
01:00:09,923 --> 01:00:10,952
Ms. Lee.

809
01:00:11,222 --> 01:00:12,263
Second,

810
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,463
keep her out of your personal domain.

811
01:00:15,963 --> 01:00:17,162
What's all this?

812
01:00:17,963 --> 01:00:19,003
Third,

813
01:00:20,332 --> 01:00:22,872
do not overlook anything illegal.

814
01:00:23,602 --> 01:00:25,332
Yoo Myung Hoon's insurance payout.

815
01:00:27,272 --> 01:00:28,343
Lastly,

816
01:00:30,173 --> 01:00:31,213
never...

817
01:00:32,483 --> 01:00:34,042
let your guard down.

818
01:00:34,812 --> 01:00:36,412
A total of 430,000 dollars.

819
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:02,673
(Delightfully Deceitful)

820
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:27,303
- What? - We're in love.

821
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:30,202
Don't let it look so obvious.

822
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:32,343
We must return this.

823
01:01:33,003 --> 01:01:34,142
Just admit that...

824
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:36,443
I did something you couldn't.

825
01:01:37,272 --> 01:01:39,443
Mr. Han. I need help.

826
01:01:39,582 --> 01:01:41,883
A friend who does odd jobs was kidnapped.

827
01:01:42,753 --> 01:01:44,282
You asked someone...

828
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,383
you only met once to save Ring Go?

829
01:01:46,622 --> 01:01:47,622
Ms. Lee.

830
01:01:48,253 --> 01:01:50,153
What can you do?
