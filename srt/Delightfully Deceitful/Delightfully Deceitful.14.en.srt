(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:54,483
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:55,883
The ledger.

4
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:57,723
(Episode 14)

5
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,025
I have it.

6
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:00,624
All of it.

7
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,364
Come and...

8
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:05,435
clean this up for me.

9
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:07,704
The director.

10
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:09,604
He's dead.

11
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,125
As of today, I realized who the president was.

12
00:01:38,394 --> 00:01:41,235
(Hyeseung Hospital)

13
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:52,214
Congratulations. You found the place.

14
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:54,384
What's going on?

15
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,455
What are you doing here?

16
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:58,684
I should be saying that.

17
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,455
This is...

18
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,294
Aren't you looking for the president?

19
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:06,894
The person...

20
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:08,895
who established Jeokmok and made you director.

21
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:11,395
Yes.

22
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:14,035
President Ji Seung Don.

23
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,734
He just lent his name.

24
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,705
He was a good guy.

25
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,775
His flaw was that he was too trusting.

26
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:27,344
Then you...

27
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:29,684
You're...

28
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:31,785
It was you?

29
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:34,654
Why come all the way here to back out?

30
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,195
What was the plan?

31
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:41,225
Weren't you going to kill the president and replace him?

32
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:43,263
I was frustrated.

33
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,035
I wanted a frank conversation.

34
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,665
Leader to leader.

35
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,234
I'm closing down the foundation.

36
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,545
There's no reason to keep it going.

37
00:02:58,775 --> 00:02:59,985
You have 24 hours.

38
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:03,314
Run away.

39
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,455
Jay that punk is the president.

40
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,525
Now I must run.

41
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:11,654
Because I know his identity,

42
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:15,425
and he knows I was looking into him.

43
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,025
I could lust for more...

44
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,254
and end up losing my life.

45
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,384
(Da Jung)

46
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:42,514
(I'm outside. Na Sa will be there. See you in the afternoon.)

47
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,485
(Jay that punk is the president.)

48
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:49,223
(Jay that punk is the president.)

49
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:50,254
Hey.

50
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:51,855
Hey.

51
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:53,924
"Jay that punk is the president."

52
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,325
Is this...

53
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:57,835
It says Jay's the president. Is he?

54
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:01,434
We must find Ring Go first.

55
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,874
- We're back. - The car.

56
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,445
The car. Get the car!

57
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:10,214
What's going on?

58
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:12,315
Is this it?

59
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:16,955
There's not much.

60
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,695
Were you bluffing?

61
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:32,435
Or was it meant to be a surprise?

62
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:44,914
Why didn't you tell me?

63
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:47,445
For ten years.

64
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,484
Because it didn't matter...

65
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:53,825
between us.

66
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,995
It won't change anything.

67
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,625
That you're the president.

68
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:03,765
You didn't tell me either.

69
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,594
What would I get from showing I knew?

70
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:09,104
I covered it up,

71
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:10,875
for your sake.

72
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,534
For our sake.

73
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:17,114
Because...

74
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:19,714
I just need you.

75
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,645
Okay.

76
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:24,784
Believe that.

77
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,104
There's a suitcase in a locker at the airport.

78
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,973
You'll find a map and phone inside.

79
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:52,245
Go and wait.

80
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,284
Only spend cash.

81
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,654
Did you hear me?

82
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:09,895
Hurry.

83
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,664
Before a travel ban's issued.

84
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:37,294
Mr. Kang.

85
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,354
Is something wrong?

86
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,395
Mr. Kang.

87
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:46,534
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,435
I'm sorry, Moo Young.

89
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:52,435
What's this about?

90
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,145
I can't find your dad.

91
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:07,854
(Danger, Do Not Enter)

92
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:28,875
Please spare my life.

93
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:32,414
Spare me. Don't kill me.

94
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:38,815
What do you mean you can't find Dad?

95
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,585
I should've told you sooner.

96
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:44,924
What's going on?

97
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,895
I think something happened to him.

98
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:50,594
What?

99
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,904
Spare me, please.

100
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:56,565
Spare me.

101
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:58,974
Please spare my life.

102
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:15,424
Spare me.

103
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,625
Spare me.

104
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:25,164
No!

105
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,235
Hurry up and take a photo.

106
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:34,875
Go on.

107
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,115
Make sure you get everything.

108
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:41,215
Darn it.

109
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:43,515
What are you doing?

110
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:46,184
Hey.

111
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:57,135
Please spare me.

112
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:09,505
A month ago,

113
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:13,914
you appeared on TV...

114
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,814
as the lawyer of the Geumseong killer.

115
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,554
Your dad saw and came to me.

116
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,595
He'd given me some cash long ago,

117
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,465
and he wanted to tell me about it.

118
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:28,965
I should've...

119
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,395
told you about it then.

120
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:34,304
What money did Dad give you?

121
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,574
When you got into law school.

122
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,304
Your tuition.

123
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,044
My tuition?

124
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:46,044
You said it was a scholarship.

125
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:47,615
Back then,

126
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:52,284
he said you wouldn't accept it if I told you it was from him.

127
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,594
I should've asked him where he suddenly got...

128
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:02,495
such a huge amount of money.

129
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,804
There was no way he could've earned that money in a lawful manner.

130
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:08,304
Okay, so?

131
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:10,775
What about the money?

132
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,635
Where did he get the money?

133
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:19,975
I found out a month ago...

134
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,095
that he got the money in return for killing someone.

135
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,895
Please don't kill me.

136
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:34,564
Please spare me.

137
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,895
(Han Jae Seok)

138
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:49,044
(Han Jae Seok)

139
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:55,215
- Say something! - What will you do?

140
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,283
- Do something! - Let go!

141
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,924
- Say something! - How will you fix this?

142
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:13,064
What did you say?

143
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,574
He got paid for killing someone?

144
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,015
I became a lawyer with the money...

145
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,614
that my father received in return for killing someone?

146
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,615
Moo Young.

147
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:33,184
What on earth are you talking about?

148
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,554
Who?

149
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:38,755
Who's the person he killed?

150
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:42,524
Who was killed?

151
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:44,534
What money? And how was it received?

152
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:47,135
The case that happened in Geumseong.

153
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:50,105
That murder in Geumseong.

154
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:56,804
He was one of the culprits in the murder of Lee Ro Um's parents.

155
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,015
Your father.

156
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,214
So we were just like gig workers. Shin Ki Ho and I.

157
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:06,984
Oh, there was someone else.

158
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:08,505
It was someone I had never met before.

159
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:11,823
- He's a ghost. - A "ghost?"

160
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,025
That's what Jeokmok calls their disposable workers.

161
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:16,725
They pick people who have hit rock bottom.

162
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,995
Their known weaknesses make them easy to manipulate.

163
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,005
Having nothing to lose makes them bold,

164
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:24,434
and more than anything, they're easily swayed by money.

165
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,704
He killed Ro Um's parents?

166
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:35,584
Here, wear this.

167
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:39,015
- Come on! - Yes, sir.

168
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:41,385
Wear this. Hurry.

169
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:52,294
What are you waiting for?

170
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,475
That's why your father came to see me.

171
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:05,874
He didn't get involved knowing what it was about.

172
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,443
He said he had no idea that he'd had to kill someone.

173
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:10,184
However, he did commit a crime,

174
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,404
so he decided to turn himself in.

175
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:16,454
He said he'd see you for one last time and go to the police with me.

176
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,354
But I couldn't reach him for the past few days, so I went to see him.

177
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:21,755
He left a note, saying he'd hate to cause trouble for you...

178
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:25,595
Hey, Moo Young.

179
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,184
(Slide to answer)

180
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:01,434
Did you like the gift?

181
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:09,304
Was it you?

182
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:13,745
Why? Did you think it wouldn't be me?

183
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,215
Did you trust me?

184
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:17,784
You...

185
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:20,485
Where are you now?

186
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,584
Open the gift first.

187
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,755
What are you doing?

188
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,894
The man in front of you...

189
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,034
killed your parents for 10,000 dollars.

190
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:32,965
Han Moo Young's father.

191
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:37,574
I know you wanted to find the last remaining ghost.

192
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:38,875
Stop talking nonsense.

193
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,073
I was...

194
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,121
There's a correct order for everything, including revenge.

195
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,321
You can't skip the middle step and go after the president.

196
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,314
I still have your gun,

197
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:50,044
so I'll help you.

198
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:52,015
Cut the gibberish.

199
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,184
Show yourself, and we'll talk.

200
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,895
Don't you worry. You'll see me very soon.

201
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:01,595
You know, Ring Go is here too.

202
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,894
He's lost a lot of blood.

203
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:09,005
He probably can't even speak Korean now, let alone other languages.

204
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:15,505
Where are you?

205
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,444
Where are you now?

206
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,345
Don't get worked up, Ro Um.

207
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:25,954
Enjoy.

208
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:25,015
You were always Ro Um's weakness, even when we were young.

209
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,684
How should I put this?

210
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:31,755
Shall I say she never hides her weaknesses?

211
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:35,184
Back then, I hated it.

212
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,154
But now, it's the reason I must spare you.

213
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:43,995
I'm hoping this imparts a message to her.

214
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,465
Every living thing will continue...

215
00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:51,475
to be Ro Um's weakness.

216
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,754
Why isn't it moving? It's making me nervous.

217
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,724
The call cannot be connected. Please leave a message...

218
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:17,955
Ro Um isn't picking up.

219
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:21,195
Mr. Han isn't picking up either.

220
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:23,694
What are they doing? I'm so worried.

221
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,665
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

222
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:28,235
Hey, does this even make sense to you?

223
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,005
Can you believe it? How could Jay be...

224
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,374
I had no idea.

225
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:42,714
Hey, Ro Um. Where are you?

226
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:43,745
Lee Ro Um!

227
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,514
Do you have Ring Go's location?

228
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:48,455
His watch was pinged in Geumseong, so we're headed there now.

229
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:53,294
Ro Um, that orphan. We found Jay in that photo.

230
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:56,695
And the photo of the note Ring Go sent says that Jay is the president.

231
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,094
Ring Go said he was going to meet Jay.

232
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:00,905
What should we do, Ro Um?

233
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:04,804
Ro Um.

234
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,205
First, go there and look for him.

235
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,074
And call the police.

236
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:11,314
Where are you?

237
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:14,614
Stay with the others. Don't go anywhere alone.

238
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,195
Take me to the president.

239
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:46,686
I don't think we can catch your flight.

240
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,486
The quality of the products was deemed impossible to be sold...

241
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:50,897
Just get to the airport.

242
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:53,555
Breaking news.

243
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:56,765
A special investigative squad of Navisgate will be formed...

244
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,236
at the Central Prosecutors' Office tomorrow morning.

245
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,065
The leader of this squad is...

246
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,035
likely to be Prosecutor Ryu Jae Hyuk...

247
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:05,606
who was once in the Criminal Trial Division.

248
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:06,906
Prosecutor Ryu had been...

249
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,775
investigating Navis Well-being by himself,

250
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:10,375
and discovered their plans of stock manipulation.

251
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,045
Though he's a junior prosecutor,

252
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:14,146
he's expected to help the prosecution...

253
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,686
that's being doubted of affiliating with Navis.

254
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:16,986
("Special Investigation Team Launched for Navisgate")

255
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:19,467
("Prosecutor Ryu Jae Hyuk Will Be Appointed to Lead the Team")

256
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:31,296
- Hello? - Hello, mister.

257
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,606
Are you really coming to join the Navis investigative team?

258
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:37,066
Yes, I arrived today.

259
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:39,737
The universe is helping.

260
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,946
A lot of things have happened to us.

261
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:45,376
I'm on a business trip, and...

262
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,687
You've been working on that this whole time?

263
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:49,046
Of course.

264
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:53,615
I didn't want to get into your head...

265
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,686
when you were just sent to the countryside,

266
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,927
so I kept you in the dark on purpose.

267
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:00,697
Did you get in touch with Mr. Han?

268
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:02,496
No.

269
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:04,365
Then, I'll help you catch up.

270
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,237
First off, I have left my company.

271
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:09,466
Were you fired too?

272
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,336
No, I wasn't fired.

273
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:14,977
Was anyone else fired?

274
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:20,075
It was an industrial disaster.

275
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:21,716
And I was willing to risk my job, anyway.

276
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:24,555
I have to go.

277
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:27,055
Let's have a drink later.

278
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:28,656
Wait, Mr. Ryu.

279
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:30,056
Navis is...

280
00:22:34,326 --> 00:22:37,326
(To Do Errand Center)

281
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:42,106
(To Do Errand Center)

282
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:52,447
It's his watch.

283
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,785
So, is this Hae Dong's blood?

284
00:22:54,786 --> 00:22:56,416
How come he bled so much?

285
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,256
Does this mean that he's dead?

286
00:22:58,257 --> 00:22:59,656
- Guys. - Hi, we're...

287
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:01,157
at 310, Taeseong-Gu, Geumseong.

288
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:02,966
I'd like to report a missing person.

289
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,296
Hae Dong!

290
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,197
Where are you?

291
00:23:08,897 --> 00:23:09,996
- Su Ho. - What?

292
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,167
It's nearby.

293
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,336
Hyeseung Hospital.

294
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:16,566
The place that An Chae Hong said he saw Jay, the president.

295
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,177
Right.

296
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,907
- Tell us the address. - Right.

297
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:17,497
I saw that you let Han Jae Seok live.

298
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:20,967
We can talk after you send Ring Go back.

299
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:22,637
He won't die.

300
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,606
We have a lot to catch up on.

301
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,237
Send Ring Go back!

302
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:29,647
Why are you so mad?

303
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,816
No!

304
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,786
Should I kill him, so he won't get in the way?

305
00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:55,407
Why did you let Han Jae Seok live?

306
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:58,407
Because of Han Moo Young?

307
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:02,576
Do you like him that much? Does he treat you well?

308
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:09,346
I didn't expect you to respond to such a thing.

309
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:12,286
Though we've been apart for ten years,

310
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:16,086
it feels weird every time I see your unexpected sides.

311
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:19,796
I'm...

312
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:22,826
going to kill you.

313
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:25,866
You can't.

314
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:28,167
You've become too soft-hearted.

315
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:29,606
What do you know?

316
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:33,707
Just because some parts of my information changed,

317
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,806
that doesn't mean our whole history disappears.

318
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:37,546
We go back years, don't we?

319
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:41,286
Why don't we start with the day that we first met?

320
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:43,917
October 22, 2002.

321
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:46,316
The day I decided to save you.

322
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:51,025
Ro Um, you seem nervous.

323
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:52,757
Yes, that's natural.

324
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:56,766
Now, please repeat the information, Ro Um.

325
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,166
To add value to our scholarship project,

326
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:01,967
I thought that a prodigy wouldn't hurt.

327
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:04,576
So I went there as I was curious, and you happened...

328
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:06,275
to make a mistake that day.

329
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,147
Let's take a break, guys!

330
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:10,346
Take five! Stop filming.

331
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:14,687
That didn't surprise me, though. You were only a kid.

332
00:26:15,816 --> 00:26:16,816
But...

333
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:25,356
("Surprise 100")

334
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:28,167
("Surprise 100")

335
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:40,076
You came back.

336
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:42,805
And you finished the shoot...

337
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:44,207
without a single mistake.

338
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:47,477
You were even smiling as if nothing had happened.

339
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:49,286
That's when I knew...

340
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:52,217
that you'd be my family if there even was one.

341
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:56,286
We were both born in a ditch...

342
00:26:56,586 --> 00:26:58,356
and abandoned by the world.

343
00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:01,626
But we're the type of people to dominate it in the end.

344
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,076
What makes you think I was born in a ditch?

345
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:16,656
You were performing at nightclubs at the age of nine.

346
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:19,015
You couldn't even go to school,

347
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:20,656
and you didn't have time to eat or sleep.

348
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:24,046
You had eight shows a day at the maximum,

349
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:26,186
including the ones in the countryside.

350
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,556
You put makeup on,

351
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,727
took photos with them, and played cute tricks.

352
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:33,026
Just like a clown.

353
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:39,036
You wanted someone to save you, anyway.

354
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:40,497
Also,

355
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:43,336
I didn't exactly kidnap you, Ro Um.

356
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,336
Your parents sold you for money.

357
00:27:46,836 --> 00:27:47,876
Why?

358
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,147
Because your value was about to diminish.

359
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:56,516
They were foolish and short-sighted.

360
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:58,387
I said I'd do it.

361
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:02,326
They only respected your opinion?

362
00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:04,156
It's only reasonable...

363
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:05,795
to take advantage of your skills when they have value.

364
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:07,525
Your psychological tests...

365
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:09,626
consistently showed one emotion.

366
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:12,835
Deep-rooted, cold anger toward your parents!

367
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:13,937
So what?

368
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:16,737
So what's your point?

369
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:19,806
Are you trying to say that you saved me?

370
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,247
You were trying to go back to that ditch.

371
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:27,516
(Messages)

372
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:28,916
(I'm sorry, but we need to talk.)

373
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,637
(I know where you are. I'm in the hallway.)

374
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:49,237
How did you know I was here?

375
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:51,737
Don't worry.

376
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:54,477
The director doesn't know about you two.

377
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:56,747
I just...

378
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:59,116
wanted to tell you that I knew.

379
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:00,816
I'll pretend that I don't know,

380
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:03,346
so I want you to pretend ignorance...

381
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:05,286
when I leave.

382
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,386
- You're leaving? - I'm going back.

383
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:09,826
What's the problem?

384
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:15,366
I believed that we both thought we were family.

385
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:20,036
Why would you return to your parents who's done nothing for you?

386
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:23,806
Maybe I have low expectations.

387
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:39,987
You were going the wrong way. I had to set you on the right path.

388
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:41,987
That's what a true family does.

389
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:44,957
It worked, didn't it?

390
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:49,397
Since then, for ten years, you focused only on me,

391
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:52,897
dreamed only of me, and lived for me.

392
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:55,407
The moment you came back to me.

393
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:59,106
It was such a thrilling thought.

394
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:05,947
I'm always on your side, Ro Um.

395
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,076
Only I am.

396
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:14,616
Now tell me.

397
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:18,026
Do you still think you have somewhere to go back to?

398
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:28,167
Then I'll destroy them one by one.

399
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:34,707
I don't expect you to think for yourself.

400
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,306
If need be, I will intervene.

401
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:38,776
What do you want?

402
00:30:41,147 --> 00:30:43,247
Kyung Ja won't be able to leave the country.

403
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:46,416
Plan B is to stow away via Busan.

404
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,056
There's a temp agency.

405
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:51,157
You'll see her there in a few days.

406
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,026
While I handle Navis,

407
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:58,897
go beyond the point of no return.

408
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:02,137
You are...

409
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:05,637
a real scumbag.

410
00:31:09,977 --> 00:31:12,546
You'll be the face of the next project.

411
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:15,046
You and Kyung Ja can't coexist.

412
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:18,046
Can you get along?

413
00:31:22,387 --> 00:31:26,227
That woman was willing to risk her life...

414
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:28,397
to save you.

415
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:32,066
I have a fierce survival instinct.

416
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,566
No one protects me.

417
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:43,747
Stay alert.

418
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:46,516
I'll be watching.

419
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:58,355
The investigation is going nowhere due to the suspects' schedules,

420
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:01,696
and Prosecutor Ryu Jae Hyuk who's heading the investigation...

421
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:04,096
told the press of his plans.

422
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:07,535
Arrest warrants were issued for Navis Well-being's CEO Jang...

423
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:09,937
and three other executives.

424
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,365
The second search and seizure,

425
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:13,937
based on information found during the first search...

426
00:32:14,137 --> 00:32:17,647
will include digital devices and financial institutions.

427
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:20,177
Jang Kyung Ja is currently on the run...

428
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:22,086
and a BOLO was issued.

429
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:24,045
She's banned from leaving the country,

430
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:26,956
so we're working hard with the goal of apprehending her...

431
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:28,356
in the near future.

432
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,626
Jang Kyung Ja was Navis Well-being's...

433
00:32:43,606 --> 00:32:46,076
Ring Go! Ring Go is here.

434
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:50,846
Call for help.

435
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:55,016
Hae Dong.

436
00:32:56,387 --> 00:32:57,417
Hello?

437
00:32:57,516 --> 00:33:00,056
We're at 27, Taeseong-Gu, Geumseong.

438
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:01,856
- Someone's badly hurt. - Are you okay?

439
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:03,757
Yes, get here quickly.

440
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:04,927
Yes.

441
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:06,727
Hae Dong.

442
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:10,466
Hae Dong, let's go.

443
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:11,697
Let's get you to a hospital.

444
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:21,876
Another one can join us.

445
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:23,546
There's room for one more.

446
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,687
You should go. I'll take the van.

447
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:30,747
You're hurt too.

448
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:33,086
- It's not my blood. - Jung Da Jung.

449
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:36,086
See you at the hospital.

450
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,757
Bring her straight to the hospital.

451
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:42,796
- Okay. - Stay right behind us.

452
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:44,497
(Ambulance)

453
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:46,296
Get in.

454
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:58,776
Dear Almighty. Buddha. Whatever else.

455
00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:02,517
Hae Dong.

456
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:05,887
Hang in there.

457
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:08,387
Hae Dong. Fight for us.

458
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:12,956
Hae Dong.

459
00:34:13,827 --> 00:34:15,296
Hae Dong. Hang on.

460
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:16,996
I'm sorry.

461
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:19,936
Hang in there, okay?

462
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:21,706
Oh, no.

463
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:34,976
Oh, dear.

00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:53,037
(Daesan University Hospital)

(Restricted Area)

466
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:20,427
Moo Young, are you all right?

467
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:23,296
Find my dad first.

468
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:24,867
Your dad.

469
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:27,436
He's here.

470
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:32,775
(Operating Room)

471
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:34,907
Why does he need a transfusion?

472
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:39,517
My brother's in there, so he'll be fine.

473
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:42,017
You shouldn't have let Ro Um go.

474
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:43,717
Sorry.

475
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:45,657
She said she had to make a stop.

476
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:47,717
She said she'd be right back. Sorry.

477
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:50,987
I'm not blaming you.

478
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,657
- Na Sa. - What?

479
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:55,827
I'll drop by the comic book store.

480
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,967
What for? Stay here.

481
00:35:58,327 --> 00:35:59,796
Ro Um will look for us.

482
00:36:00,566 --> 00:36:01,967
Can you reach the lawyer?

483
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:04,065
I texted him where we are.

484
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:05,907
Fill him in if he comes over.

485
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:07,637
Tell him what?

486
00:36:08,807 --> 00:36:10,077
That Jay's the president.

487
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:13,947
Let's accept it. So we can get him.

488
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,447
(Restricted Area)

489
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:20,316
Okay, go ahead.

490
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:23,526
Yoo Neung, go with her. I'll stay.

491
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:25,456
Okay.

(Emergency Room)

493
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:39,137
Was it really you?

494
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:41,106
The Geumseong murder.

495
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:43,706
Tell me yourself.

496
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,077
Was it you?

497
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,986
I was going to turn myself in.

498
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:51,816
Then why did you disappear?

499
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:54,086
You didn't want to turn yourself in.

500
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,726
I tried to forgive you.

501
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:58,327
To meet you...

502
00:36:59,126 --> 00:37:01,827
and see if I could find one thing worth understanding you for.

503
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:04,126
I don't care now.

504
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:06,867
What did you expect when you took that money?

505
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:14,077
Will you forgive me? Forgive me.

506
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:16,646
I'm not the person you should be begging.

507
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:20,875
I apologized to her too.

508
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,416
I did.

509
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:24,646
What do you mean?

510
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:27,456
You met Ro Um?

511
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:42,967
Sorry.

512
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,037
I'm sorry.

513
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:49,376
I apologize.

514
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:51,376
I didn't know...

515
00:37:53,517 --> 00:37:55,046
what I'd have to do.

516
00:37:57,617 --> 00:38:00,517
I just needed the money.

517
00:38:04,387 --> 00:38:05,427
Did you ever...

518
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:09,867
regret it?

519
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,137
Regret it?

520
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:15,336
I did.

521
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:34,856
I hope...

522
00:38:36,257 --> 00:38:39,356
you tell your son that.

523
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:01,416

Why do you ask?

Why do you ask, Mr. Han?

534
00:39:46,456 --> 00:39:47,726
Put her on the phone.

536
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:52,267
And she'll continue to be very busy.

Han Jae Seok is your father, right?

542
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:07,046
How do you know this?

543
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:08,816
I only found out recently too.

544
00:40:09,017 --> 00:40:11,217
And I swear, I didn't deliberately set it up like this.

545
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,487
How would I have known ten years ago that you'd get involved?

546
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:16,287

00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:23,767
Are you the president?

550
00:40:27,396 --> 00:40:28,767
I guess it's your fault...

551
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:31,447
that Ro Um has turned into such a softie.

552
00:40:32,776 --> 00:40:36,206
I worked hard to train her, and you ruined everything.

553

- Where are you now? - Why?

00:40:39,017 --> 00:40:40,217
Now, you want to see me?

555
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:41,617
Where are you?

556
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:44,717
What could you even do if I told you where I was?

557
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:47,756
I asked you...

558
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:49,887
if you'd be able to kill someone for Ro Um.

559
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:52,396
It's so amusing, isn't it?

560
00:40:53,427 --> 00:40:56,066
The fact that your father killed Ro Um's parents.

561
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,527
He sure chose a different path than his son.

562
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:02,106
Sacrificing his morals for greed.

563
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:03,936
"Amusing?"

564
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:06,436
You think this is "amusing?"

565
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:08,975
You took in innocent kids,

566
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:10,883
turned them into criminals, and committed fraud,

567
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:13,177
then even turned the victims into assailants.

568
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:15,275
You think you can get away with this...

569
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:17,156
because you don't have blood on your own hands?

570
00:41:17,787 --> 00:41:19,316
Do you think it's over?

571
00:41:19,856 --> 00:41:23,856
Now, in Ro Um's eyes, we're equally bad.

572
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:26,626
The only difference is...

573
00:41:28,757 --> 00:41:31,097
that you're acting like a victim.

574
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:34,237
Don't run your mouth like that, or I'll rip your lips off.

575
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,876
I didn't know you could say stuff like that, Attorney Han Moo Young.

576
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:42,376
I do want to see the look on your face right now.

577
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:44,606
If Ro Um is hurt,

578
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:46,546
I will kill you.

579
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:48,646
I don't buy that.

580
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:52,186
Do you think I spared Ring Go by mistake?

581
00:41:53,617 --> 00:41:55,017
The kids are mine,

582
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:57,026
and Jeokmok is my world.

583
00:41:57,157 --> 00:41:59,657
My toy. My plaything.

584
00:42:01,996 --> 00:42:03,327
As long as I'm alive,

585
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,566
this won't change.

586
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:09,456
It was fun knowing you, Han Moo Young.

587
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:17,206
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

588
00:42:29,226 --> 00:42:30,946
I think someone went through these drawers.

589
00:42:32,657 --> 00:42:33,927
I guess Ro Um was here.

590
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:38,326
Can you see what's missing?

591
00:42:38,327 --> 00:42:39,336
Okay.

592
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:51,646
(Sanjeong)

593
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:12,267
Ro Um.

594
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:14,496
Hello?

595
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:16,807
Hi.

596
00:43:17,537 --> 00:43:18,767
Where are you now?

597
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:21,976
How's Ring Go?

598
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:24,276
His surgery went well.

599
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:26,067
They've moved him to the recovery room.

600
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:27,516
Where are you now?

601
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:28,716
This is an announcement.

602
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:30,145
So his surgery was a success?

603
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:34,016
All passengers for Train 9787 bound for Sosan,

604
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:36,377
- please come to the platform now. - His surgery went well.

605
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:38,972
- This is an announcement. - Why weren't you at the hospital?

606
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:40,656
All passengers...

607
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:43,526
- for Train 9787 bound for Sosan... - I'm sorry for everything.

608
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:45,597
Why are you saying that?

609
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:47,996
Seriously, where are you?

610
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:52,476
Da Jung.

611
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,046
I'll...

612
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:00,947
put an end to this. I must.

613
00:44:01,617 --> 00:44:04,245
Ro Um, I'll do whatever I can.

614
00:44:04,246 --> 00:44:05,246
So first...

615
00:44:12,757 --> 00:44:14,356
(Train to Sosan)

616
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:20,226
The call cannot be connected. Please leave a message...

617
00:44:26,407 --> 00:44:28,577
- Yes, Mr. Han. - Hello, Da Jung.

618
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:30,646
Can you trace Ro Um's location?

619
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:33,046
Her phone turned off just now.

620
00:44:33,577 --> 00:44:35,476
She took a different phone.

621
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:37,516
I talked to her just now and confirmed it.

622
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:38,745
She's at Sanjeong Station now.

623
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:40,186
I'll send you the number.

624
00:44:47,097 --> 00:44:49,327
The call cannot be connected. Please leave a message...

625
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:06,916
(Sanjeong)

626
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:11,316
Ro Um.

627
00:45:11,646 --> 00:45:12,816
Where are you?

628
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:19,396
Ro Um, I'm sorry.

629
00:45:20,557 --> 00:45:23,026
I meddled in your life when I knew nothing.

630
00:45:23,827 --> 00:45:25,026
It was reckless of me.

631
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,107
Whatever it is that you're trying to do now...

632
00:45:29,606 --> 00:45:30,836
Don't go alone.

633
00:45:31,936 --> 00:45:33,807
I'll take responsibility. Okay?

634
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:35,807
Ro Um.

635
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:38,407
Please, Ro Um. Please!

636
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:43,787
I listened to you, and I think it has only made me weaker.

637
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:47,832
Even weaker than when I was all alone and had nothing but a gun.

638
00:45:47,856 --> 00:45:48,887
Ro Um.

639
00:45:49,626 --> 00:45:51,026
I was wrong.

640
00:45:51,856 --> 00:45:54,396
I must kill the president with my own hands.

641
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:57,707
Only then can we put an end to this.

642
00:45:58,066 --> 00:45:59,097
Yes.

643
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:00,867
You're right, Ro Um.

644
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:02,407
Do that.

645
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:04,706
Or I'll die.

646
00:46:06,836 --> 00:46:07,836
Ro Um.

647
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:10,347
This can't end in any other way.

648
00:47:18,257 --> 00:47:19,266
Yes.

649
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:21,196
Mr. Ryu, I saw the news.

650
00:47:22,636 --> 00:47:24,897
We found the last page of the notebook.

651
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:27,305
Jay, the head of Security at Navis Well-being,

652
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:28,667
is the president.

653
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:30,777
He shot Ring Go.

654
00:47:32,277 --> 00:47:33,575
Did you report this to the police?

655
00:47:33,576 --> 00:47:36,146
Yes, we did. And Ring Go underwent surgery earlier.

656
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:38,246
I'll send you all the info I gathered on Jay through Jeokmok,

657
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:40,846
as well as all the data I collected through Navis' network.

658
00:47:41,286 --> 00:47:43,516
- He used the name, Ji Seung Don... - Da Jung.

659
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:47,056
I'm investigating Navis Well-being, not Jeokmok.

660
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:49,357
I can't share the details with you,

661
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:52,765
but we have no evidence to believe the head of Security was involved.

662
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:56,466
Besides, such evidence could be problematic.

663
00:47:57,236 --> 00:47:59,276
Especially the kind of evidence that you collected.

664
00:48:01,067 --> 00:48:02,636
I understand how you feel, Da Jung.

665
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:04,806
But to properly investigate this,

666
00:48:05,036 --> 00:48:07,306
I must follow the rules and proper procedures.

667
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:10,216
If you'd like to share any information with us,

668
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:12,196
please contact the investigation team.

669
00:48:12,446 --> 00:48:14,446
We'll go over your request according to the rules.

670
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:25,556
It took place in 2012?

671
00:48:25,857 --> 00:48:26,926
Yes.

672
00:48:27,127 --> 00:48:28,366
Sir.

673
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:30,906
Are you saying you're the real culprit of the case?

674
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:34,806
Yes, it was me.

675
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:37,207
I'm sorry.

676
00:48:38,277 --> 00:48:40,547
The murder that took place in Geumseong in 2012.

677
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,845
Initially, the daughter was falsely convicted,

678
00:48:42,846 --> 00:48:44,846
and the real culprit was caught last year.

679
00:48:45,616 --> 00:48:47,187
There are three perpetrators.

680
00:48:48,587 --> 00:48:50,587
Mr. Han Jae Seok is the only survivor for now.

681
00:48:51,116 --> 00:48:54,127
Who are you, by the way?

682
00:48:56,826 --> 00:48:58,896
I can be questioned by myself.

683
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:01,365
I'll tell you everything.

684
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:04,896
I'm Mr. Han's lawyer.

685
00:49:04,897 --> 00:49:07,036
You can talk to me instead.

686
00:49:17,877 --> 00:49:19,917
(Sangjin University Hospital)

687
00:49:25,656 --> 00:49:27,925
(Intensive Care Unit)

688
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:28,986
Su Ho.

689
00:49:30,196 --> 00:49:31,326
You're here.

690
00:49:32,027 --> 00:49:33,567
We can't visit him yet.

691
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,997
I can't imagine how bad it is.

692
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:40,636
He said that he'd go and get the lighter from Jay.

693
00:49:41,636 --> 00:49:44,276
He thought that Kyung Ja put the backup of the notebook...

694
00:49:44,277 --> 00:49:45,636
in it.

695
00:49:46,846 --> 00:49:47,977
I told him about it.

696
00:49:48,076 --> 00:49:50,216
And I got him the copy of the lighter.

697
00:49:51,216 --> 00:49:53,747
I sent him to the president on a silver platter.

698
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,056
Hae Dong.

699
00:49:57,016 --> 00:49:58,857
What if he dies?

700
00:49:59,116 --> 00:50:01,257
And what if Ro Um doesn't recover?

701
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:06,027
My toy. My plaything.

702
00:50:19,846 --> 00:50:23,047
Mr. Ryu says he won't be able to see you for now.

703
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:26,846
Sure.

704
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:30,216
(Prosecutors' Office)

705
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:49,837
So, this is what Jeokmok is.

706
00:51:01,946 --> 00:51:04,515
I checked the security footage of the trains that departed...

707
00:51:04,516 --> 00:51:06,286
at that time and where they stopped.

708
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:08,257
But I can't find where they are.

709
00:51:09,596 --> 00:51:12,096
I got the messenger's face near the abandoned building.

710
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:14,526
They probably drove an unregistered car,

711
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:15,807
and I put it on the wanted list.

712
00:51:15,926 --> 00:51:16,997
What about Jay?

713
00:51:17,096 --> 00:51:19,066
The phone he had used was a burner phone.

714
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:20,365
He's already dumped it.

715
00:51:20,366 --> 00:51:22,436
He has a phone under his name,

716
00:51:22,437 --> 00:51:24,877
but it stays off, so I can't track him with that.

717
00:51:25,507 --> 00:51:27,377
What's the connection with Ji Seung Don?

718
00:51:27,777 --> 00:51:31,546
Mr. Ji has regularly supported the orphanage since 1991.

719
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:34,316
Jay went to high school on a judo scholarship,

720
00:51:34,317 --> 00:51:35,547
and he quit...

721
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:37,986
to be Mr. Ji's personal assistant.

722
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:40,555
It seems like he's been able...

723
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,926
to control Mr. Ji naturally since then.

724
00:51:43,897 --> 00:51:47,227
I know Mr. Ryu is working hard,

725
00:51:47,497 --> 00:51:49,765
but it's a bit frustrating to hear about it...

726
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:51,567
from the news.

727
00:51:51,966 --> 00:51:53,607
I wonder if he's connecting the dots.

728
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,006
Post the messenger's photo online.

729
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:01,376
Tell them that he's a contract killer...

730
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:02,747
and charged with attempted murder.

731
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:09,785
Attorney Ryu Jae Hyuk, the leader of Navisgate Special Investigations,

732
00:52:09,786 --> 00:52:12,086
has announced the first investigation result.

733
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,825
We've secured a testament...

734
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:16,296
proving that Ms. Jang ordered the stock price manipulation.

735
00:52:16,297 --> 00:52:17,825
Some of the criminal proceeds were...

736
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:20,465
transferred to the bank account of Ms. Jang's cousin.

737
00:52:20,466 --> 00:52:22,325
Recently, Lee,

738
00:52:22,326 --> 00:52:24,496
who was imprisoned for murder,

739
00:52:24,497 --> 00:52:26,836
confessed to his crimes while voluntarily returning...

740
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:29,676
the cash that Ms. Jang paid him for his help.

741
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:33,607
Judging from these, she's likely to have committed major crimes too.

742
00:52:33,747 --> 00:52:35,076
Starting this moment,

743
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,376
Ms. Jang Kyung Ja, the accused of fraud,

744
00:52:37,377 --> 00:52:39,885
is wanted for fraud,

745
00:52:39,886 --> 00:52:42,686
violation of the Capital Market Act, and aiding and abetting a murder.

746
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:44,856
The special investigative team suspects...

747
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:47,727
that some executives of Navis have helped Ms. Jang escape...

748
00:52:52,727 --> 00:52:56,766
I asked Professor Shin if she knew anything, and she said no.

749
00:52:58,297 --> 00:52:59,297
I'm sorry.

750
00:53:01,366 --> 00:53:02,906
Please put Ro Um on the wanted list.

751
00:53:04,536 --> 00:53:06,683
You have the authority to put her on the wanted list...

752
00:53:06,707 --> 00:53:08,946
when she's unreachable and can't be located.

753
00:53:10,016 --> 00:53:11,096
Put her on the wanted list.

754
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:15,317
The call cannot be connected.

755
00:53:23,397 --> 00:53:24,727
What are you doing here?

756
00:53:25,297 --> 00:53:26,826
I wasn't sure you'd come.

757
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:28,926
But you did.

758
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:33,707
Who were you expecting? Jay?

759
00:53:35,406 --> 00:53:36,437
The president?

760
00:53:37,337 --> 00:53:39,377
You got what you wanted. Why did you come here?

761
00:53:48,446 --> 00:53:51,686
I was wondering where that went. You had it all along?

762
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,056
That punk gave it to me to kill you with it.

763
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:55,486
You're lying.

764
00:53:58,997 --> 00:54:00,167
Do you still believe...

765
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:02,497
that you have a future with him?

766
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:04,897
Don't you watch the news?

767
00:54:05,497 --> 00:54:08,167
You're the president to the people of Korea.

768
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:10,206
What makes you think he's so powerless...

769
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:11,635
that he'll just watch that?

770
00:54:11,636 --> 00:54:12,837
You know nothing!

771
00:54:14,576 --> 00:54:18,317
If I don't, he'll kill you.

772
00:54:18,446 --> 00:54:19,946
He can't.

773
00:54:20,516 --> 00:54:23,516
When I'm dead, it'll put Jay in danger as well.

774
00:54:24,687 --> 00:54:26,567
Did you think I'd let them kill me that easily?

775
00:54:27,227 --> 00:54:28,727
I won't go down alone.

776
00:54:30,497 --> 00:54:32,965
I'll be more than grateful if you manage to kill him.

777
00:54:32,966 --> 00:54:34,366
Don't use Jay as an excuse.

778
00:54:34,696 --> 00:54:36,466
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

779
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:39,337
You've been dying to kill me.

780
00:54:40,007 --> 00:54:42,837
How thrilled are you to be in this moment?

781
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:51,346
No.

782
00:54:59,386 --> 00:55:00,656
There are people...

783
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:08,127
I want to protect even if it means going this far.

784
00:55:27,486 --> 00:55:29,016
Did you investigate Jay?

785
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:31,362
You know that I can't tell you anything about the investigation.

786
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:34,227
He's Jang Kyung Ja's lover. You must've investigated him.

787
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:36,956
- Mr. Han. - Ro Um has gone missing.

788
00:55:36,957 --> 00:55:38,126
Mr. Han!

789
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:39,997
Ring Go, who you also saw,

790
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:41,466
was shot.

791
00:55:41,826 --> 00:55:43,336
He's still in a coma.

792
00:55:43,337 --> 00:55:44,737
You've heard about that too, right?

793
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:48,007
What Da Jung told you,

794
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:50,336
what materials she promised to send,

795
00:55:50,337 --> 00:55:52,706
and how you rejected her. They told me all about it.

796
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:54,446
Even the reason I rejected it?

797
00:55:56,716 --> 00:55:59,615
Why on earth did you reject it?

798
00:55:59,616 --> 00:56:01,687
I can no longer work with you.

799
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,916
If people find out about the time I went beyond the law,

800
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:06,216
my investigation will not be justified.

801
00:56:06,957 --> 00:56:08,356
That's your reason?

802
00:56:08,357 --> 00:56:10,155
Is just catching them enough?

803
00:56:10,156 --> 00:56:12,627
You said so yourself. That you'd go by the law.

804
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,327
It's not like you'll personally punish them.

805
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:17,296
While we follow the legal procedure,

806
00:56:17,297 --> 00:56:18,796
people die.

807
00:56:18,797 --> 00:56:21,937
So, we just ignore due process and judge them first?

808
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:24,277
You have no idea what kind of person he is.

809
00:56:24,576 --> 00:56:26,575
He manipulates people to kill other people,

810
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:29,777
yet he bears no guilt or responsibility.

811
00:56:29,946 --> 00:56:32,175
As we try to follow due process,

812
00:56:32,176 --> 00:56:34,615
he slips out again and finds another victim.

813
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:36,386
As if he's playing a game!

814
00:56:37,216 --> 00:56:38,357
Mr. Han.

815
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:40,757
That's enough.

816
00:56:41,556 --> 00:56:43,227
Okay? Just stop.

817
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:46,396
How can I stop when nothing is solved?

818
00:56:46,397 --> 00:56:49,067
I doubt that this is the way to solve it.

819
00:56:50,136 --> 00:56:51,896
You're going to cross the line at this rate.

820
00:56:53,937 --> 00:56:55,007
All right, then.

821
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:58,736
You can stop.

822
00:56:59,607 --> 00:57:01,376
If crossing the line is what it takes to solve it,

823
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:03,216
I will gladly do so.

824
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:27,067
It's okay. As long as you're alive.

825
00:57:30,837 --> 00:57:33,147
Mr. Han, Ro Um is back.

826
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:35,066
She says she's going to Ring Go's hospital.

827
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:44,186
The corporation provided the members...

828
00:57:44,187 --> 00:57:47,126
with the annual membership of receiving...

829
00:57:47,127 --> 00:57:49,486
its newly-released products at a discount of 30 percent.

830
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:53,055
As the service went on, the firm forced...

831
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:54,226
middle management...

832
00:57:54,227 --> 00:57:55,296
Ro Um.

833
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:57,466
To buy its products every month.

834
00:57:57,966 --> 00:57:59,766
Yesterday, their products...

835
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:01,465
Why don't we talk outside?

836
00:58:01,466 --> 00:58:03,136
Have been analysed,

837
00:58:03,377 --> 00:58:05,836
and the results are shocking.

838
00:58:05,837 --> 00:58:08,277
The membership fee that they claimed...

839
00:58:08,377 --> 00:58:09,607
turned out to be...

840
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:17,486
Are you all right?

841
00:58:19,216 --> 00:58:20,457
Where have you been?

842
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:26,997
You said you'd defend me, right?

843
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:29,397
You said...

844
00:58:30,096 --> 00:58:32,397
that you'd be there for me when I finished this job.

845
00:58:34,837 --> 00:58:35,837
I did.

846
00:58:36,707 --> 00:58:39,036
No matter what crimes I committed?

847
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:41,507
No matter what.

848
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:46,317
When I first got started,

849
00:58:48,047 --> 00:58:50,386
I wanted to see my parents' killers...

850
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:53,227
suffer in anguish.

851
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,326
Enough that they wanted to die...

852
00:58:56,857 --> 00:58:58,957
because they couldn't wake from their nightmares.

853
00:59:02,696 --> 00:59:03,797
Do you get that?

854
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:06,766
I do.

855
00:59:14,607 --> 00:59:15,676
Do you promise...

856
00:59:17,877 --> 00:59:19,247
to defend me?

857
00:59:21,216 --> 00:59:22,247
I promise.

858
00:59:24,757 --> 00:59:25,786
Okay, then.

859
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:28,087
That'll do.

860
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:01,326
Lee Ro Um.

861
01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:03,127
Surrender.

862
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,296
Breaking news.

863
01:00:06,297 --> 01:00:09,965
Police identified a woman in her 40s who was found dead...

864
01:00:09,966 --> 01:00:12,695
in a temp agency office in Busan.

865
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:15,106
It was Navis Well-being's CEO Jang Kyung Ja...

866
01:00:15,107 --> 01:00:17,735
who was wanted for fraud and conspiracy of murder.

867
01:00:17,736 --> 01:00:19,736
With Jang found dead,

868
01:00:19,977 --> 01:00:22,675
the public are criticizing prosecution...

869
01:00:22,676 --> 01:00:24,575
for possibly losing the chance...

870
01:00:24,576 --> 01:00:27,087
to indict anyone for the billion-dollar fraud charge.

871
01:00:27,386 --> 01:00:30,516
Police suspect Jang's death was a murder...

872
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:32,715
and identified a suspect based on evidence...

873
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:36,257
found at the scene, as well as witness statements.

874
01:00:50,977 --> 01:00:53,346
Lee Ro Um, you are under arrest for Jang Kyung Ja's murder.

875
01:01:09,156 --> 01:01:11,357
(Delightfully Deceitful)

876
01:01:30,116 --> 01:01:32,046
Did you kill her, Ms. Lee Ro Um?

877
01:01:32,047 --> 01:01:34,316
You want to put me away, don't you?

878
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:35,715
Is there proof against it?

879
01:01:35,716 --> 01:01:36,785
Bring it to me, then.

880
01:01:36,786 --> 01:01:38,485
I'll find you that proof.

881
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,155
Jay is really going to take Ro Um this time.

882
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,756
When Ro Um gets out,

883
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:45,456
I want her to not have a choice.

884
01:01:45,457 --> 01:01:46,925
An article will go out tomorrow...

885
01:01:46,926 --> 01:01:49,526
that says Han Jae Seok is your father.

886
01:01:49,527 --> 01:01:52,297
I can't keep my promise to defend you.

887
01:01:52,596 --> 01:01:53,936
I lose again, then.

888
01:01:53,937 --> 01:01:57,107
I'm going to break you out of the Prosecutors' Office.
