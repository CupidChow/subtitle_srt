(Episode 11)

2
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:20,393
Are we not there yet?

3
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:22,063
We're almost there.

(Mihwadang)

5
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:48,953
Don't stand there.

6
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,853
Get him. I'll wait out here.

7
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:52,893
Okay.

8
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:18,684
(Mihwadang)

9
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:07,194
What are you doing?

10
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,583
- Careful. - Oh, no.

11
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:29,953
Keep your legs steady. Gosh.

12
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:31,724
- What is this? - Oh, no!

13
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:33,622
- Wait, hold on. - Hey!

14
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:35,694
Ma'am! She's right there.

15
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:40,663
- Goodness. Sir, watch your feet. - Let go of me.

16
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:43,164
The car is right here, sir.

17
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:46,673
Watch your head. Be careful.

18
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:51,203
There, let's go. Oh, boy.

19
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:22,743
You won't have met. Say hi.

20
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:24,203
It's Jay.

21
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:31,814
We meet again.

22
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,623
First, I need you to tell me...

23
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:44,694
what it is that Ro Um tried to steal from Kyung Ja.

24
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:52,273
- A notebook. - A notebook?

25
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:56,344
Yes. Director An Chae Hong's notebook.

26
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,773
Jeokmok's ledger?

27
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:02,183
Kyung Ja already handed that over to the president.

28
00:05:02,484 --> 00:05:05,883
The last remaining one. Only Jang Kyung Ja knows about it.

29
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:08,513
The last remaining one?

30
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:10,253
Yes.

31
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:14,053
Then why is Ro Um so determined to find it?

32
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:16,693
It contains info on the identity of the president.

33
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,373
So Kyung Ja knows who the president is?

34
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:29,644
Yes.

35
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:33,474
Where is it now?

36
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:36,113
That I don't know.

37
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:39,413
Oh, right. Jang Kyung Ja took it back.

38
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:40,784
That was the last time I saw it.

39
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:58,404
And I bet that's how I got out. Am I right?

40
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:04,803
My, Kyung Ja is one scary woman.

41
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:08,312
Sneaking that out is one thing,

42
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:11,344
but causing all this mess after holding onto it for this long...

43
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:21,693
How about you work with me once more?

44
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:23,594
What do you say, Su Ho?

45
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:25,534
Pardon me?

46
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:29,104
Whether Kyung Ja has hidden the notebook...

47
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:31,933
or has a copy,

48
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:34,803
I believe that notebook is all we need...

49
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:38,604
to finish her off for good.

50
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:41,214
Then there will be nothing stopping us.

51
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:44,914
You can plant a camera in Kyung Ja's room, right?

52
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,214
You're good at making that stuff.

53
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,654
The kind with audio, of course.

54
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,964
What do you mean?

55
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:04,334
He'll help us?

56
00:07:04,763 --> 00:07:06,034
Yes, you heard me right.

57
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:09,604
Did you guys decide this together?

58
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:18,044
Ro Um.

59
00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:20,484
Let's talk.

(Dajung Comic Books)

61
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:44,573
Did you reach out to him? Or did he come to you?

62
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:49,214
(Auto Repair)

63
00:07:58,794 --> 00:07:59,954
We met by chance.

64
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:03,294
Then whose idea was it? Him helping us.

65
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:11,664
There's something I can help you with.

66
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,704
And I agree.

67
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,603
It won't be bad to have one of Jang Kyung Ja's men on the team.

68
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,413
You always do this, Ro Um.

69
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:21,743
You believe that your goal can justify the means.

70
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:24,013
I do?

71
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:29,224
I thought we were done talking about issues like this.

72
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:31,654
Yeon Tae Hoon.

73
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,954
You think he's like Yeon Tae Hoon?

74
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,563
How could you trust him?

75
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:40,833
Didn't you say you couldn't relate to Yeon Tae Hoon at all?

76
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,904
He beat up Ring Go without batting an eye.

77
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:50,104
What do you think the Jeokmok Kids were all about?

78
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:53,943
Jay was trained to kill.

79
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:57,484
And we were taught to punish each other. That was our rule.

80
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:59,113
Ring Go knows that too.

81
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,854
It's not about whether or not he knows the rule.

82
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,984
Are you saying we should be grateful that he didn't kill Ring Go?

83
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:08,294
All will be fine if Jay follows the rules.

84
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:10,294
On what grounds are you saying this?

85
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:16,063
I'm basing my decision on my faith stemming from my experience.

86
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:17,834
"Faith?"

87
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:27,043
Ro Um, if you must get him involved,

88
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:30,282
- I decide the rules. - What?

89
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:33,314
As of this moment, you won't talk to him.

90
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:34,653
I'll talk to him.

91
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,883
That's fine, right?

92
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,224
You and I are a team anyway.

93
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,123
The revolver.

94
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,424
Find my revolver.

95
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,403
I guess you guys rely a lot on that lawyer.

96
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:01,314
Well, he's a good guy.

97
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:07,653
Shall we step out? If you're uncomfortable here.

98
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:11,123
Why are you asking me? I'm not Ring Go.

99
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:13,993
Shall we step out?

100
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:18,724
No. I mean... Sure, if you want to step out.

101
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,064
Why are you here?

102
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:22,964
I kept being reminded of the old days.

103
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:27,773
As you know, I'm indebted to Ro Um, just like you guys.

104
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,984
Did you always talk so politely to me?

105
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:42,054
I've never once talked casually to you.

106
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:09,743
So I guess you haven't told her.

107
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:12,313
She thinks we've never met before.

108
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:13,883
That's right. Not yet.

109
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,354
Why are you saying you want to help us?

110
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:21,653
Did Ro Um not tell you?

111
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,623
I must hear it directly from you.

112
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:30,633
The president chose Ma Kang Soo instead of Ms. Jang,

113
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:34,834
which means she'll be put in danger after the wrap-up.

114
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,403
Ro Um is after the president anyway.

115
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:38,804
So I said I'd help her...

116
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:41,974
if she could keep me and Ms. Jang safe.

117
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:46,954
Okay.

118
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:51,853
Call me at this number from now on.

(Attorney Han Moo Young)

120
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:57,123
Why do you dislike me?

121
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,704
Must I like you?

123
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:15,743
- As for Jay... - You don't need to explain.

124
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:22,054
I went to the auto shop to meet Na Sa.

125
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:27,824
But Jay was there.

126
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:32,763
Why did you bring him here?

127
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:34,862
If you went there to meet Na Sa,

128
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:37,163
why didn't you keep looking for him? We need to find him.

129
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:39,604
To drive Jang Kyung Ja crazy.

130
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,643
I'm sure Na Sa is busy gambling away.

131
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:45,543
He said that he'd go back...

132
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:47,714
to Jeokmok.

133
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:49,944
He said he'd work at Navis Well-being.

134
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:52,684
Who's stupid enough to accept him?

135
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,283
I want to bring him back.

136
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:01,554
I want you to bring him back.

137
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,724
Not Jay. Na Sa.

138
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,373
- Hey. - Where are you?

139
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:21,674
I'm outside. I was about to go back.

The proposal that the financial director brought.

145
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,873
Tell him to bring it to me quietly.

146
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,984
Here's how they'll manipulate the stock price.

147
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,382
Ma Kang Soo has already chosen the stock item.

148
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:09,753
And he has his people ready.

149
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,253
We planted our informant in Stage Two.

150
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:27,804
It looks like an empty flash drive, but it's a hacking tool.

As long as the employees connect them to their computers,

153
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:34,373
we'll get access to their network.

154
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:54,892
Yeon Tae Hoon is going to work as a researcher...

155
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:56,863
to bring good news to the bio industry.

156
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,804
He hasn't gotten in touch with Ma Kang Soo's team yet.

157
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:03,643
They consider him as an outside adviser.

158
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:07,413
His men are always guarding his office.

159
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:10,742
Ma Kang Soo detects all wiretapping...

160
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:12,714
who enters and leaves his office.

161
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:16,782
All we can use is a recorder,

162
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:19,053
so we only have access to information...

163
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:20,493
that Mr. Yeon directly listens to.

164
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:22,693
It sounds like an impenetrable fortress.

165
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:25,223
Information protection is everything when it comes to stock manipulation,

166
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:26,793
since even leaking the stock item can ruin the plan.

167
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,003
Kang Soo is almost losing his mind.

168
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:33,503
Because he has to return to prison if he doesn't pull it off.

169
00:16:33,804 --> 00:16:34,934
Can you even see with that?

170
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:36,403
We can listen.

171
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:42,143

172
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:44,743

Do you think you're working at a local store?

176
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,564
Would you pay for this much?

00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,272
Would you?

178
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:08,304
We apologize.

179
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,714
And the daughter?

180
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:16,913
She said she'd text us the date of the meeting.

182
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,924
They're talking about the financier.

00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:26,893
They need a large sum of money to move on to the next step.

184
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:29,464
They need seed money to secure a sufficient quantity of stocks.

185
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:32,793
So, they normally bring a financier.

186
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:34,493
The president isn't paying for it?

187
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:36,734
You never use your own money in stock price manipulation.

188
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,503
Ma Kang Soo's financier is Min Chae Pyo, the loan shark.

189
00:17:40,003 --> 00:17:41,674
They've known each other since Darusa.

190
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,142
They must be close.

191
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:44,872
But while Kang Soo was imprisoned,

192
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:46,313
the domestic business went to Chae Pyo's daughter,

193
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:47,814
Min Kang Yoon.

194
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,113
That's why he called her the daughter?

195
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:51,443
Kang Soo is managing the business plan...

196
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,184
for the meeting with the financier.

197
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:00,752
The business plan?

198
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:02,423
"We're going to manipulate the price of this stock,"

199
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:04,224
"and we need this much budget."

200
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,532
"You give me money, and I'll work with these men..."

201
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,532
"to execute the manipulation plan."

202
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,663
Something like that.

203
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,734
It's basically a collection of evidence.

204
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:14,673
Yes. So, we're planning to get to the external hard drive...

205
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:17,103
that holds the business plan in excuse of file modification.

206
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:19,714
Once we get that,

207
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:22,813
we can control the whole operation.

208
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,724
I'd like to modify the file for the last time if you don't mind.

209
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:41,493
Send it to my email address.

210
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,404
Come in.

211
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:02,154
Yes.

212
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,454
Eat up. I have a meeting.

213
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,424
Yes, sir.

214
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:17,563
May I...

215
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:20,734
have the floor plan of this center?

216
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,073
- The floor plan? - Yes,

217
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:26,944
it would come in handy to plant the devices.

218
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:29,614
Wireless connection isn't that stable.

219
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:31,884
Fine.

220
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:33,884
I can get you a floor plan.

221
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,154
But...

222
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:38,454
the order seems off,

223
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:40,154
doesn't it?

224
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:43,293
Because I never got anything from you, Su Ho,

225
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:45,224
other than your requests.

226
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:48,763
When I bring you the floor plan,

227
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:51,934
how long will it take to monitor Kyung Ja's office?

228
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:56,243
Su Ho?

229
00:19:56,704 --> 00:19:57,704
Sir.

230
00:19:57,705 --> 00:19:59,273
I remember you.

231
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:01,543
You were very obedient when you were little.

232
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:03,243
And you were cute.

233
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:06,214
Do you know when you were the most obedient?

234
00:20:08,714 --> 00:20:10,424
The day after you were beaten.

235
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:16,154
Do you still do that?

236
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,793
Well...

237
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,434
If you get me the floor plan,

238
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:23,762
I can install them that night.

239
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:24,833
Right away.

240
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:26,704
Good.

241
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:28,904
- Let's do that. - Yes, sir.

242
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,053
What are you doing?

243
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,363
Ro Um sent you, didn't she?

244
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:51,394
What?

245
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:53,134
This.

246
00:20:53,763 --> 00:20:54,894
Who do you think made this?

247
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:56,904
It's an older model.

248
00:20:58,164 --> 00:20:59,674
I'm pretty sure I told you guys...

249
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:02,273
not to put me in danger.

250
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,002
I'm with Mr. Ma right now.

251
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:05,103
If they find an informant,

252
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:07,073
who will they suspect first?

253
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:11,743
I don't know anything.

254
00:21:14,684 --> 00:21:16,013
Even if I do this?

255
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,154
This is mine.

256
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:24,394
Go and tell Ro Um...

257
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:26,664
that I'll tell him everything if she doesn't quit.

258
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:41,374
Why is Su Ho siding with Kang Soo?

259
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,984
This is driving me insane.

260
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:50,924
She was supposed to text them the date of the meeting, right?

261
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:52,823
What's your plan?

262
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:55,023
First off,

263
00:21:56,224 --> 00:21:59,293
ask Jay to send us the guard schedule.

264
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:00,763
Ro Um.

265
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:03,333
This is plan B.

266
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,323
(Jay)

267
00:22:33,364 --> 00:22:34,563
Are you out of your mind?

268
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,093
Where do you think you are?

269
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:37,434
An auto shop.

270
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:40,103
You have no idea how crazy Kang Soo is right now.

271
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:41,874
Are you sure no one followed you?

272
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,343
I heard you're working with Ma Kang Soo.

273
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:49,343
Okay.

274
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:53,583
Take these. He'll suspect me if he finds these.

275
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,214
Are you trying to get me killed?

276
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,353
Get rid of these and back off.

277
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:03,364
Or I'll tattle. I'm serious.

278
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:05,823
Ma Kang Soo's meeting with the financier.

279
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,863
You'll stop the wrap-up?

280
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:13,572
I'm expecting the schedule to be relayed by text.

281
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:14,603
I need it.

282
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,573
What do you want?

283
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:19,204
I can't back out until I have that.

284
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:20,743
Are you here to blackmail me?

285
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,914
Did you put up a spy cam in Jang Kyung Ja's office?

286
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:31,384
You'll have to set it up at night.

287
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:34,093
Won't Security be an issue?

288
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:35,694
I'll send you their shift times.

289
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:37,864
Is this a trap?

290
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,624
It's not.

291
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,434
Da Jung doesn't want you to end up dead.

292
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:45,563
Ring Go keeps dreaming of you getting beaten up.

293
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:48,974
Lee Ro Um.

294
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:53,444
Were you really going to kill me?

295
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:57,944
No. Would I want to get arrested before meeting the president?

296
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:01,414
I did what I was trained to do.

297
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:03,583
I thought you'd listen.

298
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:06,323
Because of my servile nature?

299
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,523
Yes.

300
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:10,823
That goes for me too.

301
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,063
Good luck setting up the cameras and hang in there.

302
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,333
Hey.

303
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,503
You're not the kid you used to be.

304
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:25,743
Bite their leg if they beat you up.

305
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:27,543
What else are teeth for?

306
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:49,803
Why the serious face? I'm getting nervous.

307
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:54,134
Are you all right? You're not sick, are you?

308
00:24:56,904 --> 00:24:59,603
What is Moo Young up to these days?

309
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:01,013
These days?

310
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:02,843
He said he was busy.

311
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:06,013
Yes, well...

312
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,282
He's not still tied up...

313
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:14,352
with stuff about Lee Ro Um, is he?

314
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:18,263
Come on. Gosh, no. No way.

315
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:19,664
Are you sure?

316
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:22,793
No.

317
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:27,803
He can't do that.

318
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,674
Moo Young...

319
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:32,203
has to stay away from Jeokmok and Lee Ro Um.

320
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:33,444
"Jeokmok?"

321
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,414
Look into it for me.

322
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:42,114
I want Moo Young to drop that case.

323
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:53,263
How did it go?

324
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,134
He'll have gotten the message.

325
00:25:56,364 --> 00:25:58,204
Did Jay say anything?

326
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,303
He let me off quietly when I talked about you needing him.

327
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:06,474
What is he?

328
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:09,313
What do you mean?

329
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:12,043
What is he to you?

330
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:13,753
What's your relationship like?

331
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,984
I'm trying to understand.

332
00:26:20,624 --> 00:26:22,253
I had a crush on him.

333
00:26:23,864 --> 00:26:24,923
What?

334
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:27,763
I liked him at one time.

335
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,906
(Navis Well-being)

336
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:44,076
Director.

337
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:45,375
(Director Ma Kang Soo)

338
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,777
When you meet with Mr. Min,

339
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,747
would you need my assistance?

340
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:55,917
Come in.

341
00:26:58,386 --> 00:27:01,027
Hey. You can put that down here.

342
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:02,656
Gosh.

343
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,696
This is the real deal.

344
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:07,796
Mandarins grown outdoors.

345
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:10,806
Have one.

346
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:14,777
No, thanks.

347
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:17,606
Do you not like mandarins?

348
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:21,546
Have one. It's my favourite fruit.

349
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:24,616
Here.

350
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:27,017
Come on.

351
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:29,187
Have one.

352
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:34,326
It's really sweet.

353
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:46,366
Is something bothering you?

354
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:50,546
No.

355
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,477
- Hello. - Hi.

356
00:27:56,947 --> 00:27:58,017
Hello.

357
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:00,586
How's Mr. Yeon?

358
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:03,386
Ma Kang Soo fired him today.

359
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,027
Is he okay?

360
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:09,456
Yes. He came by to drop this off,

361
00:28:09,457 --> 00:28:11,126
but he looked sad.

362
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:13,697
Is that the last recording?

363
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:17,906
Yes. He said he got nothing so it's not worth listening to.

364
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:19,767
I'll have a listen anyway.

365
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:22,737
What for?

366
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:25,376
I'll listen to it at home. Email it to me.

367
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:26,616
Okay.

368
00:28:37,086 --> 00:28:39,257
Is something bothering you?

369
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:42,626
No.

370
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:47,596
Come on, smile. It's a great day.

371
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:53,906
Other than not being able to smoke,

372
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:57,747
my life is so full.

373
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:04,947
Nothing beats being free and in good health.

374
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:09,616
Shall we wrap things up?

375
00:29:10,086 --> 00:29:11,126
Does the name...

376
00:29:13,656 --> 00:29:15,427
Yeon Ho Jung ring a bell?

377
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:20,296
Do you know it?

378
00:29:28,537 --> 00:29:29,606
What's that?

379
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:31,447
Is it a person?

380
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:41,116
You ask...

381
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:44,156
a few too many questions these days.

382
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:41,116
Hello?

383
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:43,546
It's Han Moo Young.

384
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,257
You did well.

385
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:50,156
Thank you.

386
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:53,396
Yeon Ho Jung...

387
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:55,656
We'll remember her.

388
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:30,366
It's me.

389
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:33,896
I'll meet my father.

390
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:36,636

I'm expecting the schedule to be relayed by text.

398
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:32,427
I need it.

399

Well...

405
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:50,007
I need your phone for a moment.

406
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:53,646
I'll set it up so you can see Jang Kyung Ja's office on your phone.

It's done, sir.

416
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:05,986
Just press her a little,

417
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:08,056
and you'll soon see...

418
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:10,357
where she hid that important notebook.

419
00:34:10,957 --> 00:34:12,025
Yes.

420
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:14,055
I hope it's somewhere in her office.

421
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:15,457
Give me a few more days,

422
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:17,897

00:34:25,006 --> 00:34:27,006
All right. Well done.

00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:44,526
I heard all about it.

What Ro Um nearly stole from you.

429
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,136
You see, here's what I think.

430
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:58,136
Knowing what kind of decision you made in such a situation,

431
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:02,236
I believe you've made a copy of it.

432
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:07,846
I'd say it's only a matter of time before I find it.

433
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:09,477
Wouldn't you agree?

434
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:12,147
What are you talking about?

435
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:17,026
I'm trying to provoke your biggest weakness right now.

436
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:18,727
And you know that too.

437
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:21,857
I don't care what you're up to these days,

438
00:35:22,227 --> 00:35:25,026
but if you ruin my plans,

439
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:28,466
I can't let you walk away unscathed.

00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:34,736

443
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:48,017
You hate getting blood on your own hands.

444
00:35:48,716 --> 00:35:50,786
So why are you obsessing over it?

445
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:52,486
You're not even ready to handle it.

446
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:56,297
Is that what you think?

447
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:02,837
You don't think I'm ready to handle it?

448
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:07,537
What, then?

449
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:09,977
Are you planning a coup or something?

450
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:22,687
Mr. Yoon took it. The revolver.

451
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:27,627
Bring it to me, and I'll believe...

452
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:30,156

(Wednesday February 8, Myungjin Garcia Club Lounge)

457
00:37:01,156 --> 00:37:03,255
It's a networking event organized by Min Kang Yoon,

458
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:04,996
the daughter of Min Chae Pyo, Ma Kang Soo's financier.

459
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:07,936
She meets people she might do business with at parties like this.

460
00:37:07,937 --> 00:37:09,396
If she meets someone she likes,

461
00:37:09,397 --> 00:37:11,437
she'll open her wallet.

462
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:13,876
Ma Kang Soo needs 200 million dollars,

463
00:37:13,877 --> 00:37:17,075
and she's the only person in the country who can lend him...

464
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:18,346
that kind of money, in cash.

465
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:19,747
In other words,

466
00:37:19,977 --> 00:37:21,946
if he loses Min Kang Yoon,

467
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:23,747
his plan will go down the drain.

468
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,616
Then we'll have to make sure he loses her.

469
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:30,016
Ma Kang Soo will be very careful.

470
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:32,526
And so will we.

471
00:37:33,026 --> 00:37:36,196
Then we'd have to attend that party ourselves.

472
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:38,096
Is there a way, though?

473
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:39,897
It looks very exclusive.

474
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:41,596
Yes, it is.

475
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:44,837
We can only get additional invites from VIP guests.

476
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:48,306
There's a name we know on the VIP guest list.

477
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,446
Professor Shin Seo Ra.

478
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:56,175
It's a party organized by a loan shark,

479
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:57,886
and Professor Shin was invited as a VIP guest?

480
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:00,457
My goodness.

481
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,787
I should go and turn her house upside down.

482
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,026
No, don't.

483
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:07,726
Don't turn it upside down.

484
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,227
What we need is an invitation.

485
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:11,826
And we need you, Mr. Ko.

486
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:14,497
Me? You need me?

487
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:17,306
We need a completely new face to pull this off.

488
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:20,207
And when you're asking Professor Shin for the invite,

489
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,207
you should tell her that you'll be attending the party yourself.

490
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:25,076
What? Seriously...

491
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,046
Why are you doing this to me?

492
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:29,817
You need to find a partner too.

493
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:31,886
You can't do this alone.

494
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,386
Mr. Han.

495
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:38,386
Don't do this to me, okay?

496
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:43,096
Just take me out for dinner to repay me.

497
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:46,866
I'm free next weekend.

498
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:50,636
Can't you think like normal people do?

499
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,767
I'm giving you a chance, you see.

500
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:56,906
A chance to make up for your past mistakes.

501
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:02,377
Why on earth are you a VIP guest at a party organized by a loan shark?

502
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:04,846
We shall leave that out of the discussion for now.

503
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:06,687
Won't you need my help there?

504
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:09,317
I really am going to help you.

505
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:15,556
As for the dinner, bring Jae In along.

506
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:17,696
Mo Jae In? Why?

507
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,297
When you two met...

508
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:21,466
What did you talk about?

509
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,406
Something that you're not ashamed of at all, Professor Shin.

510
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:29,236
Unlike you, she was very ashamed of it.

511
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,676
Jae In...

512
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:33,607
She's nice, isn't she?

513
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:35,747
Goodness.

514
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:39,317
Well, what is this about?

515
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,256
You're getting defensive.

516
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:51,997
Call me...

517
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,897
when you get your hands on another invitation.

518
00:40:00,977 --> 00:40:02,337
Let's go for lunch.

519
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:03,607
Dr. Mo.

520
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,446
What?

521
00:40:17,386 --> 00:40:19,156
- Sure. - What?

522
00:40:20,696 --> 00:40:21,756
Are you sure?

523
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:25,167
You know what Professor Shin is thinking.

524
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:26,797
What is she thinking?

525
00:40:31,236 --> 00:40:33,107
I know she's difficult.

526
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,306
You can't persuade her without conceding to her request.

527
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:38,306
But she's fond of me, you know.

528
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:41,647
Right. That's why you fascinate me.

529
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:45,747
When Professor Shin says she likes someone, I can't stand them.

530
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,047
But you...

531
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:55,256
Well, you don't really seem like Professor Shin's type.

532
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:57,426
She even hates me, her own son.

533
00:40:57,866 --> 00:41:00,966
What do you mean she hates you? She loves you very much.

534
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:04,635
You see, Professor Shin is an amazing actress.

535
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:06,436
She's been hosting that talk show for over 20 years,

536
00:41:06,437 --> 00:41:08,006
looking like Mother Teresa.

537
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:10,606
I've known her all my life,

538
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:12,076
but I still feel so uncomfortable around her.

539
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:15,116
I guess I should build my inner strength.

540
00:41:15,377 --> 00:41:16,716
It's because you two are family.

541
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:18,446
Dealing with your family is hard.

542
00:41:18,986 --> 00:41:20,756
Don't blame it on yourself.

543
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:24,156
Are you really going to have dinner with me and Professor Shin?

544
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:25,486
Yes!

545
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:27,857
Are you not afraid of what she might do after that?

546
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,926
I can't control what she'll do.

547
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:36,196
At the end of the day, I can help them by doing this,

548
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:37,906
so I want to do it.

549
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:41,837
You're so cool.

550
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:47,176
Do you want to go to the party with me?

551
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:10,236
Do you need anything?

552
00:42:10,806 --> 00:42:13,006
He never locked his office before.

553
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,306
Why did he lock it now?

554
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:19,306
I think he's recently started locking it.

555
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:23,076
If he's suspended,

556
00:42:23,817 --> 00:42:26,587
he shouldn't print any pages, should he?

557
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:28,555
Am I wrong?

558
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:31,287
And he can't tell what Ms. Park to do.

559
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,556
I'm fine with it.

560
00:42:34,656 --> 00:42:37,627
Mr. Cho recently lost a case,

561
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:39,466
so I have some time left.

562
00:42:42,236 --> 00:42:43,267
What's wrong?

563
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:47,337
Well, I wouldn't know since I've never been suspended.

564
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:51,207
But how is a suspended lawyer...

565
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:53,445
so busy?

566
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,716
He's got something going on.

568
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:03,917
What? Well, no.

569
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:08,525
Last time, I had mold at my house, so I asked him...

570
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:10,526
if I could stay at his company house for a few days.

571
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:14,067
And he said no. He doesn't even own that house.

00:43:54,576 --> 00:43:56,136
I had a hunch.

582
00:43:56,906 --> 00:43:58,547
I saw you struggling to find the right connections.

I'm not following you, sir.

584
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:03,747
Why are you investigating Navis Well-being?

585
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:06,687
Wasn't that to help me acknowledge you?

586

No, about Navis Well-being...

Did I...

595
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,477
just find myself a connection?

596
00:44:33,877 --> 00:44:37,917
I was sick of having my son move schools...

597
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:40,647
and being a weekend couple.

598
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:44,286
I thought that I could do something to impress you...

599
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:46,386
to get the perfect attendance award or something.

600
00:44:48,056 --> 00:44:49,056
And I found a connection.

601
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:55,466
So, what I did wasn't the point.

602
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:58,006

Sorry.

Why are you apologizing to me?

626
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:13,306
Because when I was helping others at the expense of my career,

627
00:47:14,736 --> 00:47:18,377
you were the one who brought me to the firm to stop me.

628
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:22,215
When I was suffering, you found me a therapist,

629

635

You were cured, and one client got to you,

636
00:47:46,937 --> 00:47:50,306
so you were still helping her even after your suspension?

637

638
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:56,417

00:48:17,337 --> 00:48:19,305
What's the point of being a useless lawyer...

647
00:48:19,306 --> 00:48:22,006
when I don't even know how long it will take to cure me?

00:48:22,176 --> 00:48:23,176

I decided to accept myself for who I am.

Can you tell Ro Um...

662
00:49:21,997 --> 00:49:25,567
that I'm going to be late with the thing that she asked?

00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:26,736

00:49:30,406 --> 00:49:31,477
All right.

Ro Um,

670
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:10,479
you have absolutely no trust in me.

671
00:50:11,048 --> 00:50:12,487
What are you talking about?

672
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:14,648
You told me that there would be a better ending.

673
00:50:15,218 --> 00:50:17,289
Yet, you still look for that revolver...

674
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:20,829
and trust that man for willing to bring you that.

675
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,028
Doesn't that mean that you don't trust me?

676
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:27,929
Why can't you answer me?

677
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:31,068
What answer do you want?

678
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:33,338
That I trust you?

679
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:36,838
Yes. That's the answer I want.

680
00:50:39,148 --> 00:50:41,377
That I trust you when you say that you can take down...

681
00:50:41,378 --> 00:50:43,019
the president without any bloodshed?

682
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:44,749
Why can't you believe it?

683
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:51,257
See how many people...

684
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:53,729
are sympathizing with what you started.

685
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:57,429
Do you still not get that there are people who care about you?

686
00:50:58,128 --> 00:51:00,368
If emotional nonsense got you revenge,

687
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:02,439
all this would've ended long ago.

688
00:51:02,738 --> 00:51:04,768
How much longer will you do...

689
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,567
as you were trained at Jeokmok?

690
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,639
How much longer will you believe that's right?

691
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:10,209
I told you that...

692
00:51:10,709 --> 00:51:12,209
I was always like this.

693
00:51:13,209 --> 00:51:14,849
No, you weren't.

694
00:51:18,918 --> 00:51:20,988
When did we meet that you dare say that about me?

695
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:23,619
The sympathizing that you say you do.

696
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:26,828
Does it make you set fire to parents you met after ten years,

697
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:28,088
or does it make you...

698
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:30,599
dream of it every night for ten years?

699
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:34,398
Were you in my shoes?

700
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:38,638
Do you think you know me because you read my file...

701
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:39,909
and knew me for a few months?

702
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:42,479
You're mistaken.

703
00:51:42,979 --> 00:51:44,638
It's imagination, not sympathy.

704
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,308
It's not what you feel, it's a delusion.

705
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:47,878
That's why it's an illness.

706
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:53,519
The revenge I'm after.

707
00:51:54,648 --> 00:51:56,959
Jay at least respects and understands.

708
00:51:57,818 --> 00:52:00,159
That's the kind of help I need right now.

709
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:12,108
You remember the code.

710
00:52:13,068 --> 00:52:14,269
What were you doing?

711
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,579
Take a shower.

712
00:52:19,979 --> 00:52:21,108
Shall we watch a movie?

713
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:22,948
Is something wrong?

714
00:52:24,148 --> 00:52:26,918
Something needs to be wrong to make you care.

715
00:52:34,329 --> 00:52:35,858
I think I found a way.

716
00:52:37,628 --> 00:52:38,769
What way?

717
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:40,869
I realized that...

718
00:52:42,568 --> 00:52:44,099
I always survived.

719
00:52:45,968 --> 00:52:47,607
I will again this time.

720
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:48,738
What are you planning?

721
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,608
I should prove my worth too.

722
00:52:56,718 --> 00:52:57,878
To the president.

723
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:02,918
What will you do?

724
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:08,729
What about you?

725
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:11,769
What are you up to with Ro Um?

726
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,668
We just talked because of you.

727
00:53:19,939 --> 00:53:20,968
Me too.

728
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:23,639
I'm doing this for us.

729

00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:31,519
But you should...

731
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:34,619
not see her.

732
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:37,289
I might...

733
00:53:42,528 --> 00:53:44,198
do something to her.

734
00:53:48,499 --> 00:53:51,269
Ms. Jang took it.

735
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:54,269
The revolver.

736
00:53:55,008 --> 00:53:56,679
Ms. Jang asked for it.

737
00:54:04,988 --> 00:54:06,648
Why are you out here?

738
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:10,818
I need you two to do recon.

739
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:12,829
To tap into the system.

740
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:27,809
(CEO Jang Kyung Ja)

741
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:05,108
(Director Ma Kang Soo)

742
00:55:23,729 --> 00:55:25,968
Get out and wait. I'll park the car.

743
00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:30,698
Did you hear me?

744
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:33,468
Why don't you like Jay?

745
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,309
What is it you want to say?

746
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:45,019
- Are you angry? - Yes.

747
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:47,948
Fine.

748
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:49,959
I get why you felt that way as a kid.

749
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:51,888
You might have had no one...

750
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:55,499
to understand you or treat you as an equal.

751
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:56,959
There was someone.

752
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,628
Just one person.

753
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,468
While everyone else considered me a clown.

754
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:04,869
Good.

755
00:56:06,508 --> 00:56:08,338
Remember that person from now on.

756
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:10,039
Not people like Jay.

757
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:13,349
Whoever you like and need,

758
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:15,548
that's up to you, and I respect that.

759
00:56:15,979 --> 00:56:18,749
But the one who'll stay to the end and help you.

760
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:21,548
It's me, not Jay.

761
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:27,258
So you'd better not talk to me...

762
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:30,059
like we'll never meet again.

763
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:42,809
What does the ring look like?

764
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,749
It's an ordinary ring, but it's important to me.

765
00:56:47,008 --> 00:56:48,479
You said it was an engagement ring.

766
00:56:48,648 --> 00:56:49,818
Do you not have a photo of it?

767
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:53,048
We can look for it. You don't have to worry.

768
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,619
I can't let you in. It's against the rules.

769
00:56:55,918 --> 00:56:58,258
We just want to look around the room.

770
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,558
Will you write down your details...

771
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,429
and when and where you lost it?

772
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:05,099
Okay.

773
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,999
Where's the ladies' room?

774
00:57:45,238 --> 00:57:47,508
Ro Um, it's me.

775
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:49,139
Are you in there?

776
00:57:55,778 --> 00:57:56,878
Are you done?

777
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:00,218
Ask the front desk if anyone reported something they found,

778
00:58:00,349 --> 00:58:01,487
and just in case,

779
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:03,358
check the restrooms too.

780
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,168
Let's get out of here. I know a place you can hide.

781
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:23,209
Let's get out of here.

782
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:33,818
Ro Um.

783
00:58:33,819 --> 00:58:36,317
Our final guest is number 25.

784
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:39,428
What can you tell us about number 25,

785
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:40,459
Lee Ro Um?

786
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,798
Do you remember...

787
00:58:47,128 --> 00:58:49,039
picking my number?

788
00:58:51,338 --> 00:58:52,409
What is it?

789
00:58:53,008 --> 00:58:54,168
It is you.

790
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:02,148
It's you, isn't it?

791
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:04,619
Number 25.

792
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:11,119
Yes.

793
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:28,168
(Delightfully Deceitful)

794
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,838
(Special thanks to actor Ahn Nae Sang.)

795
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:51,998
Starting with the party,

796
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:53,628
we'll cause a rift between them.

797
00:59:53,898 --> 00:59:56,099
So that eventually, the investment falls through.

798
00:59:56,439 --> 00:59:58,668
It looks like game over, so quit trying.

799
00:59:58,968 --> 01:00:01,269
That guy. It's not just business, is it?

800
01:00:02,008 --> 01:00:04,909
If Min Kang Yoon doesn't pay up today,

801
01:00:05,108 --> 01:00:07,548
you and Kyung Ja die at my hand today.

802
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:11,217
I shouldn't give the money to Ma Kang Soo?

803
01:00:11,218 --> 01:00:14,088
I have a bomb I plan to drop on the wrap-up day.

804
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:16,659
I'm considering making a deal with you.

805
01:00:24,258 --> 01:00:25,258
Who called?

806
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:26,268
(I discern lies for you.)

807
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:27,567
A liar hunter?

808
01:00:27,568 --> 01:00:29,397
I became able to discern lies.

809
01:00:29,398 --> 01:00:30,398
It's this person.

810
01:00:30,399 --> 01:00:31,968
It's true. It's a lie.

811
01:00:32,238 --> 01:00:35,007
You can tell truth from lies just by listening?

812
01:00:35,008 --> 01:00:37,338
It is what I say it is.
