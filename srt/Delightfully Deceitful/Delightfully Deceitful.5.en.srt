00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:30,805
Father.

2
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:49,625
Tell him to come home!

3
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:55,965
Han Moo Young!

4
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:58,994
Wait, please. Excuse me.

5
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,494
Who are you?

6
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,334
If you want to talk, talk to me.

7
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,235
Talk to me, please!

8
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,884
Let's do what you're doing together.

9
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:25,394
What am I doing?

10
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:26,924
Fraud.

11
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:31,224
What does that mean?

12
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,265
Quite literally,

13
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,435
let's do it together, whether it be revenge or fraud.

14
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,065
Revenge...

15
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:40,375
or fraud?

16
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:42,944
Let's do it your way.

17
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,614
I'll join in the revenge you want to get.

18
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:53,055
You talk as if you know what I'll do.

19
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:00,853
Da Jung.

20
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,525
It's so frigid. They're icy.

21
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,935
Is that why you lied?

22
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:09,703
You said you'd report it,

23
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:11,805
but then you want to defend Ring Go.

24
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,473
You told me to get Ring Go,

25
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:16,574
but send the teenagers free.

26
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:19,774
You were never near a police station,

27
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:22,283
but you said the cops were on their way...

28
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:23,685
and tracing us.

29
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:27,615
Tell me.

30
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:30,025
Yes.

31
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,724
I lied.

32
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,125
So...

33
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,664
what makes you think I can trust you?

34
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:43,565
Because you need me.

35
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:48,604
When it's all done and you get arrested,

36
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,474
I will be there.

37
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,474
As the only lawyer...

38
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,845
who will defend you who knows the full truth.

39
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:10,724
Suing for compensation was the last nail in the coffin.

40
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,394
(Episode 5)

41
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,534
The Bar Association doubts your judgement.

42
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,204
They doubt...

43
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:21,935
the judgement of our firm's ace, Moo Young...

44
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,543
I'm fine. I really am.

45
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:32,154
This won't shake me,

46
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,453
and I won't blame you either because I'm better than that.

47
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,555
I'm Park Cue, a managing partner of Park and Cue Law Firm.

48
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:40,694
I recently picked up meditation.

49
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,163
I rein myself in.

50
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:44,565
I'm in full control of myself.

51
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:48,065
There's a 3-3-3 breathing technique. Inhale for three seconds,

52
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,935
exhale for three seconds,

53
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:52,204
then moan for three seconds.

54
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:02,384
It's fine. We just have to be prepared.

55
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:03,944
Let's prepare for it.

56
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:05,144
How?

57
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,185
How do you think?

58
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:09,125
Quietly.

59
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,653
Don't cause or get involved in trouble or get nosy.

60
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:15,625
Stay out of other people's business and lie low.

61
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:19,865
Lie low.

62
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,334
We can clean this up.

63
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:25,774
We must.

64
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,305
Get out. Inhale.

65
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:33,675
Get out. Exhale.

66
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,444
Get out, it's fine.

71
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:24,824
Oh, the lawyer.

72
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,194
Da Jung told me.

73
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:29,334
You said you'd represent me.

74
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,935
- Yes. - Why?

75
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,305
Because I'm interested.

76
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,175
Ro Um does have a lethal charm.

77
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:43,744
I admit that.

78
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:47,584
Not just in Ro Um, but you and Da Jung too.

79
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,584
I'm interested.

80
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,894
What the heck? Why?

81
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:54,855
It's a disease.

82
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,125
I need your help.

83
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,435
I have lots of questions.

84
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,134
Three questions.

85
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,274
That's all you're allowed.

86
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:12,174
You helped Ro Um and Da Jung...

87
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,214
and said you'd defend me in an emergency.

88
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,615
- Deal? - First,

89
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:21,485
how and why did Ro Um and Da Jung become "we" to you?

90
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:26,225
Do you know the Jeokmok Kids?

91
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,794
Ro Um got the nickname...

92
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,324
when the foundation gave her a scholarship.

93
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:32,435
Right. You know well.

94
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:35,165
Number one, Lee Ro Um.

95
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,375
Number two, Jung Da Jung.

Excuse me.

I'm Jung Seung Ho, Professor Shin's secretary.

115
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:41,094
Professor Shin said he wanted to repay you.

116
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:45,935
This contains what you've been looking for.

117
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,374
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:59,944
I couldn't tell you.

119
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,645
It's been a while since I stopped taking my meds.

120
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:09,354
Once I could feel again, I remembered...

121
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,185
what kind of person I was in the past.

122
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:15,494
It hurt so much that I even collapsed.

123
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:18,065
I was a complete mess.

124
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:20,864
I got nothing done,

125
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,435
but I could feel at ease for a change.

126
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,204
It's comforting to know...

127
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:30,374
that you can just be yourself even if you're a nobody.

128
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:35,275
I decided to become a lawyer because I wanted to help others.

129
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,285
And I thought my hyper-empathy syndrome wouldn't help me at all.

130
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:43,685
But I may be able to turn the tables.

133
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,395
I may be able to pull off both.

134
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:57,364
Okay. And have you figured out a way to do that?

135

You see, there are some scary guys in there.

00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,604
But there's no one inside.

188
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,714
Hey, you look great.

189
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:36,984
Hi, Ro Um. It's been a while.

190
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,124
I told the loan sharks to leave.

191
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:43,295
And they just left?

192
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:45,124
How much did you borrow from them?

193
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:49,935
I'm paying them back. It's not that much. For real.

194
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,704
How? How will you pay them back?

195
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:55,204
Well...

196
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,275
You know, I'll fix cars and...

197
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,244
Without a backer?

198
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,884
What? What are you talking about?

199
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,184
No way. Trust me.

200
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,515
(Auto Repair)

201
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:11,724
Ro Um.

202
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:15,425
I guess you two already met. That was quick.

203
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,895
- Na Su Ho. - Yes, Ro Um.

204
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:23,905
Let me use this space.

205
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,474
What? What do you mean?

206
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:31,944
I landed myself a target, and I need a house.

207
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:42,614
My gosh.

208
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:59,164
(Auto Repair)

209
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:00,274
Park Jong Gu.

210
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:01,703
He and his wife...

211
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:03,905
run a waste management company in Northern Gyeonggi.

212
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:06,613
Gambling, sexual harassment, and assaulting his employees.

213
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:07,844
He's got a long track record.

214
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:10,243
The police got him a few times,

215
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,083
but he just paid some fines and got out.

216
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:15,213
His last house tour was in the winter of 2021.

217
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:17,623
He narrowly escaped the recent gambling house mop-up operation...

218
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:18,925
in the northern region.

219
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,993
Because of the operation, all the houses in the area got shut down.

220
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:24,593
My, he must be itching to gamble.

221
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:27,535
I'll bring our target here. Ring Go will help me.

222
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:29,064
Okay, got it.

223
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:30,804
Na Sa, build a house here,

224
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:33,405
connect all the communication equipment, install cameras...

225
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,775
so we can see everyone's cards.

226
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,805
You'll help me and Ring Go craft new identities.

227
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:41,874
Collect info on Park's clients, personal schedules, and assets.

228
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:44,185
All of it. And...

229
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:46,114
But why Park Jong Gu?

230
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,055
Because he has a lot of money.

231
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:51,555
Why do you need money?

232
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:55,354
What kind of question is that? We're living in the capitalist era.

233
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:59,165
Why do you need money if you're after Jeokmok?

234
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:16,984
For goodness' sake. Da Jung, am I the only one feeling awkward now?

235
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,185
Of course, we need money.

236
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,954
Jeokmok isn't some corner store.

237
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,824
Why does it have to be Park Jong Gu's money?

238
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:32,964
You're full of questions.

239
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:38,704
If we take Park Jong Gu down, we'll get a bonus.

240
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,005
Got it?

241
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:43,045
We can talk more once we take him down.

242
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,315
If you're here to play detective, quit now.

243
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:49,715
And our engineer here is in debt.

244
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:55,614
It's not a lot.

245
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,025
For real. It's not that much.

246
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:07,864
Well, thanks. I appreciate it.

247
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,704
We'll play cards.

248
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:11,864
In teams of 4 and 3 teams in total.

249
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:14,373
We'll bring in some actors on top of our player.

250
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:15,705
Bring your gambler friends.

251
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:18,505
Who's our player?

252
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:20,545
He's right here.

253
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:27,684
He'll even bring our bet money.

254
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,785
Are you talking about Myung Hoon's insurance money?

255
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:32,485
Sure, if you can get it.

256
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,324
What does that money have to do with this?

257
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:37,525
It has to be that money.

258
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:40,565
This way, we'll have evidence that you're an accomplice.

259
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:42,195
Ro Um.

260
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,934
You said you wanted to do it. Fraud.

261
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:49,174
If you're scared, just peace out.

262
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,344
Are you out?

263
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:59,758
Myung Hoon's adoptive parents still believe in you.

264
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:03,327
They said that they should send their son to the US to study...

265
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:05,287
even in lock-up.

266
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:08,027
If they hire a lawyer...

267
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,427
and find out what situation they're in,

268
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,168
it's only a matter of time before they find you.

269
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:14,597
I'll send them a few pamphlets.

270
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,116
They'll be busy with the trial,

271
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:29,417
and the insurance company will only sue them after they're sentenced,

272
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,648
so it's not that urgent.

273
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,317
But you'll give it back when the work is done.

274
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:37,658
You seem to have a hard time taking someone's money.

275
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,428
Are you sure you can...

276
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:41,198
lie to Park Jong Gu?

277
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:42,958
Gambling is up to the individual.

278
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,827
This is fraudulent gambling.

279
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:46,537
And you're only justifying yourself.

280
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:58,408
Not now.

281
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:02,418
I'll take it to the repair shop that day. Is that all right?

282
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:06,658
Make sure to practice.

283
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:08,388
Don't ruin it for me.

284
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,738
(I get sensitive when someone gets too close to me.)

285
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,178
What are you doing?

286
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:31,076
Come outside when you're finished.

287
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,306
I'll walk you to the bus stop.

288
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:33,317
No, I...

289
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:41,188
Oh, right.

290
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:43,527
Do you know a hacker, by any chance?

291
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:47,728
I mean,

292
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:50,567
this is my phone.

293
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,867
I think it was hacked.

294
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,367
- You can't turn it on? - That's not it.

295
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,637
- You lost your bank account? - No.

296
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:58,668
Then what?

297
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:03,978
It's just strange.

298
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:06,277
Then, just use it.

299
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:10,148
Right. What would you know about machines?

300
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:13,817
Go.

301
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:15,658
I'll take the bus here.

302
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,988
Where are you going? I have to go somewhere too.

303
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,367
Aren't you going to ask me where?

304
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:25,067
Where are you going?

305
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:27,067
You see, a man such as myself...

306
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:07,178
Name, Lee Se Hwa. The second daughter of Geotteun Food.

307
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:09,007
You were attending an art college in the US,

308
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,707
and you returned to Korea to learn how to run the company.

309
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,477
You're there to find out the cost of waste disposal...

310
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:14,478
before the factory relocation in South Gyeongsang Province.

311
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,418
All right.

312
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:24,257
I'm Yoo Il, and he's Yoo Neung.

313
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:26,027
Ring Go's left and right-hand man.

314
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:27,658
We're his both arms.

315
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:29,327
And we're valuable.

316
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:31,067
Sure.

317
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:32,627
And this is our manager.

318
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:34,167
Hi.

319
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:36,097
My name is Han Moo Young. It's a pleasure to meet you.

320
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:40,138
The rules are the same.

321
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:41,438
Now,

322
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,708
let's check out the cards.

323
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:01,527
It must have been tough coming all the way here.

324
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,968
I know how remote this place is. Follow me.

325
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,138
Here.

326
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,708
Don't you have iced Americano?

327
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:16,408
Who drinks instant coffee these days?

328
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:21,277
Are you the CEO?

329
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:26,148
I'm Junior Managing Director Sim Kyung Hwa.

330
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,817
Where's the CEO?

331
00:23:30,428 --> 00:23:31,658
He's on his way.

332
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:35,958
Excuse me while I make a phone call, then.

333
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:41,968
Right.

334
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:09,397
This feels bad.

335
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:10,427
(An Yoon Sik)

336
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:11,968
I'm the only one who gets older.

337
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,448
Don't drink too much.

338
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:33,557
You have a bad back.

339
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:49,438
Jong Gu's taste in women is consistent.

340
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:52,008
He likes young women who are cheerful and smiley.

341
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:55,738
But he doesn't like to have it too easy.

342
00:24:57,148 --> 00:24:58,977
He prefers high risk with high return,

343
00:24:58,978 --> 00:25:00,017
just like in gambling.

344
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:03,988
Hello, you're...

345
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:08,988
Sorry. Give me a minute.

346
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:12,027
Yes.

347
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:13,857
Are gambling houses that easy to find?

348
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:16,898
I'm so disappointed in you.

349
00:25:17,597 --> 00:25:18,627
Whatever.

350
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:20,837
Okay. Hang up.

351
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:25,468
I've studied the rules,

352
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,907
but do you mind playing a practice round first?

353
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:28,908
Sure.

354
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:31,208
Shall we?

355
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:35,718
I'm so sorry.

356
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:38,388
I mean,

357
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:41,718
a lawyer friend of mine is into gambling.

358
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:45,527
I get it, though.

359
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:47,797
Do you play hwatu?

360
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:49,228
Me?

361
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:52,267
Oh, my.

362
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:55,867
You're an ethical type, aren't you?

363
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:58,767
Like a public official.

364
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:01,837
Well, I wouldn't say that.

365
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:04,977
He's the only son for three generations in his family,

366
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:06,407
so he always believed that men were superior than women.

367
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:08,116
But he wasn't capable of doing anything...

368
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:09,678
compared to his competent wife,

369
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,787
so he clearly has an inferiority complex.

370
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,218
I mean,

371
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:17,087
your wife wanted to talk to me about our contract.

372
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:20,597
But what's the point of talking to a woman?

373
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:23,468
You're the boss here.

374
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:27,998
That's true.

375
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,168
So, what will it be?

376
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:32,168
- Call. - Call?

377
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:34,138
Are you folding?

378
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:35,877
Shoot. Fold.

379
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:37,277
- You? - Check.

380
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:38,547
Really?

381
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:40,116
All right.

382
00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:43,517
We show all our cards on the count of three.

383
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:44,917
- Okay. - All right.

384
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:47,017
In 1, 2, 3.

385
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,158
Is that good?

386
00:26:57,498 --> 00:26:59,998
Where did you get this card?

387
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:04,337
My dad told me to check this place out.

388
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:06,877
It's neater than I imagined.

389
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:08,776
I dressed lightly...

390
00:27:08,777 --> 00:27:10,448
because it was a waste disposal facility.

391
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:14,978
This is our office.

392
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:17,587
We dispose of the waste at a different site.

393
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:20,087
I see.

394
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,658
I hear that waste disposal is very promising nowadays.

395
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,728
How did you get into this business?

396
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:30,527
I love listening to the stories of successful men.

397
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:32,127
Goodness.

398
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:34,738
Well...

399
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:36,297
Excuse me.

400
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:37,468
Go ahead.

401
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:40,008
What now?

402
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:42,877
Yes?

403
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:44,577
You found it?

404
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:47,648
I see.

405
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:49,178
Me?

406
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:50,617
I'm...

407
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:52,718
Do I have to be there?

408

I'm your lucky charm only when you're gambling.

409
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:58,027
I don't believe in that.

410
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:00,057
Fine.

411
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:03,597
Isn't that the countryside?

412
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:06,698
All right.

413
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:09,597
I get it.

414
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:11,337
Okay.

415
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:13,576
Did he find one?

416
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:15,277
Find what?

417
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:17,478
A gambling den.

418
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:21,247
Oh, I guess so.

419
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:23,247
The police are all over the places up north,

420
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,187
so he found one in Moran City.

421
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:26,958
There's no stopping him.

422
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:29,488

Darn it. I'm done.

Play Sutda. You kept winning...

428
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,066
- with the other game. - He doesn't get it yet.

429

00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:10,027
Don't you have any friends?

435
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:12,797
I had one but he died.

436

438
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,138

- You won't hang up? - Me?

440
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:36,087
Is something wrong?

441
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:38,327
No.

442

What's this about?

443
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:50,738
Hadn't we agreed to be friends?

444

What about you?

I asked you most recently.

453

When I was in high school,

You don't even have 50 cents?

476
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:42,877
Look in your pockets. What about ten cents?

477
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:54,658
Okay.

Here's my retainer.

Now I'm your lawyer.

480
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:11,347
You were helped by a lawyer and so became a lawyer.

481
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,248
You were lucky.

482
00:32:17,188 --> 00:32:18,448
I was.

Da Jung's always eating cup noodles too.

554
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:18,607
Jeokmok was...

555
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:21,348
an agency that carried out crimes...

556
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:23,277
for money.

557
00:38:25,218 --> 00:38:27,147
From the outside, it looked like an academy.

558
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:31,288
It took in kids who had nowhere to go, fed them, clothed them,

559
00:38:31,388 --> 00:38:33,727
and even educated them. Like an alternative school.

560
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,856
In the basement, the Jeokmok kids received...

561
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,627
a totally different kind of education.

562
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:02,957
We were an elite group of sorts.

563
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:06,888
They thought, if they raised and groomed us from a very young age,

564
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:09,797
they'd be able to create an elite group of criminals...

565
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:12,567
who would always obey them.

566
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,337
That's why they did it.

567
00:39:26,178 --> 00:39:27,877
We did our very best.

568
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:30,647
We knew we'd be abandoned once they deemed us useless.

569
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:33,218
But then again,

570
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:35,388
being abandoned wasn't the worst of it.

571
00:40:07,817 --> 00:40:08,917
I guess that's why...

572
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,527
we're all kind of messed up.

(Send it in 3 days.)

574
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:29,837
(Send the money.)

575
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:38,047
We all have trouble falling asleep.

576
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:51,868
We still have nightmares often.

577
00:41:02,738 --> 00:41:04,977
We're still living in that nightmare.

578
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:23,857
It's a very risky decision.

579
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:27,598
If I decide to move on to the next step with his treatment,

580
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:29,337
what would you do?

What should come first? And what is the best solution?

586
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:48,218
I'm not sure.

587
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:51,527
Why did you ask for me?

588
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:54,058
I want to go public with it.

589
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:58,468
Is that so?

590
00:41:58,598 --> 00:42:00,828
Revealing the truth. You said we should do it.

591
00:42:01,337 --> 00:42:04,198
I'll tell you everything I know about that day.

592
00:42:05,738 --> 00:42:07,876
Why did you have a sudden change of heart?

593
00:42:07,877 --> 00:42:10,238
Those jerks duped me!

594
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:16,577
You see, I have no idea how the police found out...

595
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,586
about me threatening Shin Ki Ho at gunpoint.

596
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:19,687
I really don't know,

597
00:42:20,348 --> 00:42:23,087
but Shin Ki Ho promised me something in return for my arrest.

598
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:26,356
I said I'd keep my mouth shut and take the fall for what happened...

599
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:29,226
if they paid off my debt and send me enough commissary money.

600
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:33,127
But those jerks won't give me the money they promised.

601
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,837
Is Shin Ki Ho your accomplice?

602
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:37,167
That's right.

603
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:39,768
The director of Jeokmok. He was there with me that day.

604
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:41,977
- Jeokmok? - Jeokmok...

605
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:47,207
There's a foundation called Jeokmok. Lee Ro Um was in that foundation.

606
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:50,317
They were behind everything. The president.

607
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:54,347
- The president? - Yes, that's right.

608
00:42:54,348 --> 00:42:56,457
The hand that moves Jeokmok.

609
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:59,328
He's so high up that someone like me can't even dare to approach him.

610
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:01,658
The request came directly from him.

611
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,667
That night, he even called himself.

612
00:43:04,828 --> 00:43:06,027
- He called? - Yes!

613
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:10,497
Watch and see the outcome of your choice.

614
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,547
Keep in mind. I'll always be watching.

615
00:43:28,558 --> 00:43:31,287
So we were just like gig workers. Shin Ki Ho and I.

616
00:43:31,288 --> 00:43:33,157
Oh, there was someone else.

617
00:43:33,158 --> 00:43:34,697
It was someone I had never met before.

618
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,456
In any case, we aren't the real culprit!

619
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:39,627
We only did what we did because they said we'd get paid.

620
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:42,537
You killed someone for money?

621
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:44,837
Who'd say no to money?

622
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:49,237
You know full well that the one who ordered it should be punished.

623
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:51,948
So go out there and catch the real culprit.

624
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:53,678
Get them!

625
00:43:53,977 --> 00:43:55,517
Gosh, those jerks.

626
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:57,316
They didn't even keep their promise.

627
00:43:57,317 --> 00:44:00,288
I'm locked up in jail now and can't even get out!

628
00:44:01,488 --> 00:44:02,488
What?

629
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:04,988
You said it.

630
00:44:05,587 --> 00:44:07,957
You said I still had a chance.

631
00:44:08,598 --> 00:44:10,726
Darn it! I agreed to come here because of money.

632
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:14,067
Without the money, how could I stay hopeful here?

633
00:44:14,328 --> 00:44:15,337
"Hopeful?"

634
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:17,098
Darn you!

635
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:19,738
I'll tell you everything I know.

636
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:21,836
Let's help each other out.

637
00:44:21,837 --> 00:44:23,078
We'll work together.

638
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:27,477
You are...

639
00:44:28,618 --> 00:44:30,877
in here because you killed two people.

640
00:44:32,218 --> 00:44:33,747
It's not my fault,

641
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:36,357
nor is it because of the people whom you resent so much.

642
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:38,658
"Hope?"

643
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:41,727
You certainly don't deserve it.

644
00:44:46,997 --> 00:44:48,167
Hey, what's with you?

645
00:44:48,638 --> 00:44:49,738

647
00:44:52,808 --> 00:44:54,678
Have you heard of "the president?"

648
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:57,178
- President of what? - It sounded like a nickname.

649
00:44:57,377 --> 00:45:00,147
Ye Chung Sik said he was the real head of Jeokmok.

650
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,218
Jeokmok?

651
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,047
There's no president at Jeokmok.

652
00:45:06,718 --> 00:45:08,387
The head was An Chae Hong, the chairman.

653
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:09,558
He took his own life.

654
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:10,987
He killed himself?

655
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:12,586
Yes, it caused quite the stir.

656
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:15,598
There were rumours that his wife killed her.

657
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:19,296
But it was revealed that he embezzled the company's money,

658
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:21,337
so it was concluded as suicide.

659
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,667
I'll look into it and call you back.

660
00:45:33,508 --> 00:45:34,508
Hey.

661
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:40,288
Who is the president?

662
00:45:42,988 --> 00:45:44,258
Is that your last question?

663
00:45:44,857 --> 00:45:45,857
Yes.

664
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:47,558
I'm sorry.

665
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:49,658
That I cannot answer.

666
00:45:50,198 --> 00:45:51,227
Why not?

667
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:53,868
No one knows who it is. That's why.

668
00:45:54,738 --> 00:45:58,138
All we know is that the face of Jeokmok changed ten years ago...

669
00:45:58,437 --> 00:46:01,707
from Chairman An Chae Hong to his wife, Jang Kyung Ja.

670
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:06,707
What I can promise you is simple.

This was installed to monitor an individual.

685

It's not a general app.

What does that mean?

687
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,319
It doesn't have a specific purpose.

688
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,560
There aren't any complex functions. It only tracks your location.

689
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:43,029
You agreed to give them your location info, right?

690
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,359
Yes.

691
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,500
This isn't hacking or smishing.

692

It's a simple app.

693
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,839
But it collects your location info, unlike its original use.

694
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,549
So,

695
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,880
they wanted to know where I was going?

Something like that.

Five. And five more.

734
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,810
Fine. All-in.

735
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:48,350
Call.

736
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,690
Oh, boy.

737
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:55,560
I'm sorry.

738
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:00,489
You know what?

739
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,500
I got another pair.

740
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,638
Poor guy.

741
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,068
Can I carry all these chips?

742
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,409
Man, they're heavy.

743
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,080
So heavy.

744
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,949
- Let me get a beer! - Coming right up.

745
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:30,989
How much did he lose in a week?

746
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,560
A little less than 50,000 dollars.

747
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,499
That's not good enough.

748
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,658
Don't let him play for a few days,

749
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:38,469
and tell him at dawn that the house is back open.

750
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,230
Okay.

751
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,298
Moo Young, I, and Jong Gu will be here.

752
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:45,639
Na Sa will be at our workroom.

753
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:48,279
You'll download the video at the comic book store.

754
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,040
Ring Go, leave the players here and wait outside.

755
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:52,279
Roger.

756
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,319
This plan is foolproof, right?

757
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,449
Only you'll know.

758
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,319
You're the lawyer here.

759
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,759
(Auto Repair)

760
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,909
There are two entrances to the bunker.

761
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,650
The one from below the workroom.

762
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,020
And the back door through the waterway.

763
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,448
We'll conceal the house by having the guests enter...

764
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,089
through this entrance.

765
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:11,888
The game will be played by four people.

766
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,888
There will be three teams in total.

767
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:17,929
At our table are me, the pushover, Moo Young, and a frontman.

768
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,198
In a game as small as this,

769
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:21,869
it's a piece of cake to prey on a pushover...

770
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,370
if we have a hoodwinker.

771
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:26,810
But since we don't have an expert, we're going to use equipment.

772
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,880
Na Sa reads the hands and tells our players.

773
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,819
Then, we go around to win the money in each round.

774
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,460
Our goal is to get all the money from the pushover.

775
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:44,060
At least, 500,000 dollars.

776
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,029
Se Hwa!

777
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,269
It's been a while, Mr. Park!

778
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:56,339
We must be destiny.

779
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,469
He's the guy that I mentioned.

780
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,480
The lawyer?

781
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,980
Don't look so scary.

782
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,689
You can sit there.

783
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:14,750
Okay.

784
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,999
We'll keep your phones while you play.

785
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,069
Please put them here.

786
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,469
Okay.

787
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:46,520
Let's see. Eight and five?

788
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:48,460
Gosh.

789
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,440
(NASA Auto Shop)

790
00:55:12,279 --> 00:55:13,310
Who's there?

791
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,560
Who is it? Someone's here.

792
00:55:22,759 --> 00:55:24,060
Answer me!

793
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,630
Let's take a break.

794
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,270
Why?

795
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,469
I have a headache.

796
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,370
Let me get some fresh air.

797
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,109
Okay.

798
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,339
You must be bored.

799
00:55:44,779 --> 00:55:47,508
You two can have fun by yourselves.

800
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:49,279
We have some history.

801
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:57,719
Someone's up there.

802
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,460
Are you sure we can leave Na Sa there alone?

803
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,830
Go upstairs and check.

804
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,029
Okay.

805
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,838
- Na Sa... - We were notified...

806
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:18,310
of an illegal gambling house!

807
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,178
- Ro Um. - Speak.

808
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:24,048
If you do not open it, we'll force open it in ten seconds.

809
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:25,219
I think it's the police.

810
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,589
We can all hear you.

811
00:56:30,859 --> 00:56:32,389
- Ten. - Na Sa.

812
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,129
It's fine as long as they don't see the entrance, right?

813
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,130
Nine.

814
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,729
I'm an ex-convict. I'm screwed if they see it.

815
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,400
- Eight. - I'll stay here. Calm yourself.

816
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:42,839
Seven.

817
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,908
- Moo Young. - Ro Um, how's the back door?

818
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:47,239
- Six. - Can you exit through there?

819
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,940
Yes.

820
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,810
- What about the others? - Five.

821
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:52,109
They can't.

822
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,579
What do you mean? Why not?

823
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,880
Because I locked it.

824
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,779
- What did you say? - Four.

825
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:00,889
It has to be that money.

826
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,819
This way, we'll have evidence that you're an accomplice.

827
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:05,630
Three.

828
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,040
Han Moo Young.

829
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:18,339
Two.

830
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,670
Turn yourself in.

831
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,980
One.

832
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,350
We're coming in!

833
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,040
Guards!

834
00:57:57,239 --> 00:57:58,980
Guards!

835
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,679
Get over here!

836
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,020
Guards!

837
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,750
Let me out!

838
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,120
Guards! Help!

839
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:10,659
Hands up.

840
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,810
(Delightfully Deceitful)

841
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:52,500
What's a lawyer doing here?

842
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,440
What on earth is going on?

843
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,670
Jung Da Jung!

844
00:58:56,671 --> 00:58:58,540
Let's beg for our lives.

845
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:01,940
Lee Ro Um, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.

846
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,279
I knew you'd end up in here, being the psychopath you are.

847
00:59:06,779 --> 00:59:08,250
I'm not just any lawyer.

848
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,580
I'm a useless lawyer.

849
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,750
Don't you want to know...

850
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:14,620
if I really killed them?
