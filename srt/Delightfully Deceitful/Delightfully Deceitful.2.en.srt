memorize the personal details...

00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:06,643
of nine people we chose at random...

7

out of the 100 people in the audience.

8
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:11,183
That's right. We're down to the last person.

9
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:12,925
The last number is...

10
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:14,585
Let's see.

11
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,564
It's number 25.

12
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,325
Will you please stand up?

13
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:25,164
Our final guest is number 25.

14
00:01:25,464 --> 00:01:28,364
What can you tell us about number 25,

15
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:29,405
Lee Ro Um?

("Surprise 100")

17
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,754
It looks like Ro Um is nervous.

18
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:52,493
It's very possible.

19
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:56,163
Number 25 is a little boy who's quite handsome.

20
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:57,235
He is.

21
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:01,534
However, the date can wait until after the show.

22
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:02,535
Yes.

23
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:06,505
Ro Um, will you tell us about number 25?

24
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,413

25
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:49,455

27
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:02,765
Come here.

28
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:06,434

29
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:08,164

30

Why did you suddenly lose track?

31
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:13,105
She must've gotten nervous.

32
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:14,675
I feel sorry for her.

33
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:16,874
Is this all rigged?

34
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,284
It's not.

35
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,314
Whether it is or not,

36
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:24,313

37
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:25,754
They must make a fortune.

38
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,124
Life is so unfair.

39
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:33,395
Are kids like her born randomly?

40
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,594
I wonder what our son will grow up to be.

41
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:40,365

71
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:23,934
February 14, 2012,

72
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:25,965
a derelict camping ground in Geumseong.

73
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,775
Two burned corpses were found,

74
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:31,774
and so was...

75
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:34,105
a 19-year-old girl with proof she'd committed arson.

76
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,943
The girl confessed she'd killed her parents...

77
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:40,845
and lit the fire to erase the evidence.

78
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,985
The corpses had gunshot wounds,

79
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,285
but no gun was found at the scene.

80
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:51,425
When a regional paper revealed the girl was Lee Ro Um,

81
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:55,425
who had captivated the nation with her incredible memory,

82
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,394
a crowd...

83
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,105
flocked to see the re-enactment and to mock her.

(Gasoline canister)

85
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:05,074
The girl who was marvelled at for her great memory...

86
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:08,574
became the most evil girl in history who had killed her parents.

87
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,943
And now, ten years after, she's back in the limelight.

88
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,883
To destroy evidence...

89
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:17,254
The victims had no ties to the crime scene,

90
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:20,253
and their residence showed no signs...

91
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:23,525
of a daughter, which was deemed odd,

92
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:26,295
but no one followed that up.

93
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:29,164
Lee Ro Um graduated from a middle school...

94
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,494
run by a now non existent foundation.

95
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,235
Where she lived and was educated since then,

96
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,834
and why she committed murder,

97
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:40,774
Lee Ro Um refused to explain or make excuses for.

98
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:42,105
She kept quiet.

99
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:46,444
She was given the maximum sentence for a juvenile offender...

100
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:48,115
and went to prison.

101
00:07:58,095 --> 00:07:59,795

00:14:36,094 --> 00:14:37,693
had to manage over 120 criminal offenders.

188
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:40,364
My gosh. How did you know?

189
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:41,694
Did you look it up?

190
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:44,264
I wonder what you used to look it up.

191
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,295

192
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,474

196
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:11,094
You verbally abused your probation officer.

218
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:40,275
you thought they looked suspicious from the get-go.

219
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:43,244
You had time to check their wallet.

220
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,544
You checked their pockets and phones too.

221
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:46,891
But they said they had no money after they finished the food?

222
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:50,215

It's one of the two.

Either Ye Chung Sik killed them, or it was Lee Ro Um.

260

Why just them? It could be someone else too.

261
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:16,163
That is the worst-case scenario.

262
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,265

275
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:55,265
of Ro Um going to an alternative school.

276
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,505
That school is managed by Jeokmok Foundation.

277
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,534
It was founded during the IMF crisis,

278
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:02,144
the student of their talent discovery program...

279
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:03,674
was Ro Um.

280
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:07,314
Room, board, and school fees. It was the whole package.

281
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,691
That's why there was no trace of her living at her house.

282
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:12,475
Because she was locked up at the foundation.

284
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:16,285

What were the investigators doing anyway?

286
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,394
A teenage girl was suspected of murdering her parents,

287
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,265

294

She wasn't the murderer.

295
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:43,714

297
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:47,154
How would you know that?

298
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:50,105
It only gets complicated when there's a third party.

299
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:54,094
Then, keep a close eye on Ro Um.

300
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,775
Why wouldn't she confess when she knew the murderer?

301
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,104
She'll go and get rid of them now that she's free.

00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:06,742
Once I empathize with other people's pain or sorrow,

367
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:09,573
I feel them too, rather excessively.

368
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:13,212
I'm getting treatment and taking medication.

369
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:18,922
You already knew about this.

370
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,593
No, I didn't.

371
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:25,222
You just didn't know the exact name.

372
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:27,491
But you already noticed...

373
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:29,692
that I related to you and pitied you excessively.

374
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:33,603
That's why you chose me as your defender.

375
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:36,273
You knew that I'd be on your side no matter what,

376
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:40,073
aside from the legal fees and the truth.

377
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:46,283
We have the date of the the hearing.

378
00:26:48,313 --> 00:26:49,353
Ro Um.

379
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:53,023
Do you trust me?

380
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:01,263
Then, trust my illness.

381
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,132
That will take your side whatever happens.

(Seoyoung Studio)

383
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:32,123
Oh, gosh.

384
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:50,803
- How have you been? - Pretty well, thanks to you.

385
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:55,873
What do you want?

386
00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:57,783
What else...

387
00:28:58,212 --> 00:28:59,783
do you have to screw me over?

388
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:01,382
Mr. Ye.

389
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:02,813
What?

390
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:05,152
Did you really shoot the couple?

391
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,892
Are you joking with me?

392
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:11,722
On the scene were Ro Um, you,

393
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:15,661
the two victims, and no one else.

394
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:17,262
I ought to...

395
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:18,863
Where did you get the money in custody?

396
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:21,231
I know you have a huge private loan.

397
00:29:21,232 --> 00:29:23,503
Why does that matter after all this time?

398
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,212
Were you this tenacious when you defended me?

399
00:29:29,343 --> 00:29:31,813
You recorded everything I said like a little rat.

400
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:33,882
You're the one who sold me out.

401
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:39,053
This is not about you, Mr. Ye.

402
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:43,152
Lee Ro Um is my client now.

403
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:46,363
We'll sue the government for compensation.

404
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:49,392
She was wrongfully imprisoned,

405
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,263
and her case was even reported overseas.

406
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:55,773
With you behind bars now, it's a given that we'll win.

407
00:29:58,972 --> 00:30:01,013
Do you know how much she'll get?

408
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:06,843
First, we apply the minimum wage to her time in prison.

409
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:08,912
For ten years,

410
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,652
it's 229,732 dollars and 80 cents.

411
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,593
That's the bare minimum.

412
00:30:16,492 --> 00:30:18,523
My client will ask for one million dollars.

413
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:19,863
Wait.

414
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:24,932
Lee Ro Um will get a million bucks?

415
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,603
Do you think it's worth it?

416
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:32,573
How long do you think you'll serve?

417
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,942
You're currently 53 years old.

418
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,742
The average life span is 79.3 years.

419
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:42,782
You'll be here for at least 30 more years.

420
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:43,783
Darn it.

421
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:46,382
You must live off the money someone sends.

422
00:30:47,093 --> 00:30:48,793
It could stop coming at any time.

423
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:51,863
You can barely afford thermal underwear and snacks,

424
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:53,623
and you're stuck behind bars.

425
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:55,892
Do you think your appeal stands a chance?

426
00:30:57,462 --> 00:30:59,602
The whole country heard you...

427
00:30:59,603 --> 00:31:02,003
speak with no regret or remorse.

428
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:05,201
For you to win your appeal...

429
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:07,212
despite being found with the murder weapon,

430
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:10,912
you must give up your accomplice.

431
00:31:14,253 --> 00:31:17,182
If you don't do that, I can sleep in peace.

432
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,922
Because the man who deserves to be in prison now is.

433
00:31:22,853 --> 00:31:25,093
People don't sympathize with a forgotten case...

434
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:27,563
unless there's something of interest.

435
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:31,563
This might be your last chance...

436
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:34,033
to publicize your story.

437
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:36,303
If there are others,

438
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:40,472
the wench will kill them.

(Information)

440
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:33,691
Do you know the story of the man...

441
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:35,962
who turned a paper clip into a two-floor house?

442
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:38,961
He swapped a paper clip with a pen, the pen with a door handle,

443
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:40,672
and eventually he got a house.

444
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,273
This is my paper clip.

445
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:46,472
- Park Ji Soo. - Pardon?

446
00:32:46,873 --> 00:32:48,672
I'm Consultant Park Ji Soo,

447
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:51,912
here to see Professor Lee Jin Ho.

448
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:53,881
Professor Lee Jin Ho?

449
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:55,753
What business do you have?

450
00:32:57,982 --> 00:33:00,592
There's a hospice seminar scheduled for this October,

451
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:02,692
and he requested I be a consultant.

452
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:04,793
Were you not informed?

453
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:07,332
No, I was not.

454
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,461
Let me call the professor...

455
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:10,662
My gosh.

456
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:14,732
You people are so ineffective when it comes to communicating.

457
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:18,141
I flew in from Illinois at 3am,

458
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:21,843
and lost my heel to a darn hole in the pavement.

459
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:25,312
Must I wait in the lobby because a desk worker wasn't informed of...

460
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:28,083
something they should have been at the morning meeting?

461
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:31,721
Do you know how many consultations...

462
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:33,952
I cancelled just to come here?

463
00:33:34,323 --> 00:33:36,221
I apologize.

464
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,421
- But I... - Is this something...

465
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:40,461
that should be happening at a hospice...

466
00:33:40,462 --> 00:33:42,763
commended by the Ministry of Health and Welfare?

467
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:47,033
I apologize, ma'am.

468
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:50,003
I'll help you instead.

469
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:55,713
First, go after someone on the bottom rung.

470
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:57,841
Not only because they're easy prey...

471
00:33:57,842 --> 00:34:01,153
but because you can then use the dynamic of the intervening boss.

472
00:34:01,682 --> 00:34:04,182
She's afraid, she's calm.

473
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:06,482
She'll try to become calm,

474
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:09,623
and she'll try not to lose her calm.

475
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:12,462
Because one's higher than the other,

476
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:14,032
they'll be wary of each other.

477
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,963
They'll have to go off-topic.

478
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:21,432
- What position are you? - A manager.

479
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:28,572

00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:36,143
(Why did you call? Oh, right, to give me your number.)

482
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:42,023
I'll say this just one more time.

483
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:45,992
I'm here to see Professor Lee Jin Ho.

484
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:58,472
(Visitor Pass)

485
00:34:58,903 --> 00:35:00,673
- Do you see it? - Yes.

486
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:04,011
Before Shin Ki Ho was dismissed as a professor,

487
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:06,282
he worked at the Jeokmok Foundation.

488
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:09,182
He was on the board of directors,

489
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:12,122
and it turns out he's currently...

490
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:14,193
at a hospice, fighting for his life.

491
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,352
They say he's at death's door.

492
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:18,321
He's the easiest man to find...

493
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:20,391
out of everyone on the Jeokmok board.

494
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:21,432
The rest,

495
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:25,162
I need to do some hardcore digging.

496
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,472
The links are all broken,

497
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:29,233
and it smells fishy.

498
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:32,173
Thank you. I'll be in touch.

499
00:35:36,313 --> 00:35:38,312
Why wouldn't she confess when she knew the murderer?

500
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:41,611
She's impulsive, aggressive, violent, rash,

Han Moo Young, I see you sensed the chemistry,

522
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,603
but we're not like that at all.

525
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,071

- No. - As if it's not.

532
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:10,762

00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:36,853
Yes, she was here.

548
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:40,153
We can't tell you anything else,

549
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:42,821
but she has to pass through the lobby to leave,

550
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:44,662
so I'm sure she's still here.

551
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:46,162
I see. Thank you.

552
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,833
(Admission)

553
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:53,762
Hello.

554
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:55,502
I'm the one who sent the photo earlier.

555
00:39:55,503 --> 00:39:58,103
You're sure that woman is still somewhere in the hospital, right?

556
00:39:58,403 --> 00:39:59,443
Yes.

557
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,011
We're certain that it's her.

558
00:40:02,012 --> 00:40:04,072
She was certainly very memorable.

559
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:06,293
She went to the VIP ward, didn't she?

560
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:08,082
May I enter the ward?

561
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,083
We're sorry,

562
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:10,813
but the visiting hours are over and...

563
00:40:20,892 --> 00:40:21,932
Excuse me!

564
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:23,463
Wait!

565
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:30,233
(Mugunghwa Hospice)

566
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,782
You should thank Ye Chung Sik.

567
00:41:14,313 --> 00:41:16,583
I got out early to get you.

568
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:18,182
The photo.

569
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:21,822
Ro Um.

570
00:41:26,293 --> 00:41:27,392
The photo.

571
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:32,532
(Draw your unlock pattern.)

572
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:33,903
It's already...

573
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,801
out of my hands.

574
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:40,142
(Recents)

575
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:42,363
I see that you have no strings left to pull.

576
00:41:47,512 --> 00:41:50,883
You already deposited money into Ye Chung Sik's commissary account,

577
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:54,322
which tells me you really don't want to go to jail.

578
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,742
You see, it's not as bad as you think.

579
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,833
Besides, they'll never give you the death penalty.

580
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,032
You don't need to do this, Ro Um.

581
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:10,932
I'm...

582
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,043
already dying.

583
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:26,952
No, you are alive.

584
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:29,123
For now.

585
00:42:42,873 --> 00:42:44,373
What are you doing here, Ro Um?

586
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:46,642
What are you doing here?

587
00:42:46,802 --> 00:42:48,142
Is this why you got out?

588
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:52,443
Do you think this is a wise thing to do?

589
00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:59,721
Even if someone in a hospice facility dies,

590
00:42:59,722 --> 00:43:00,983
it's nothing strange.

591
00:43:02,023 --> 00:43:03,452
So? You'll kill him?

592
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,963
I'd really appreciate it if you could leave before I do it.

593
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:15,003
Put that down.

594
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:16,429
I thought it was odd.

595
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:19,897
You didn't seem curious as to why...

596
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:21,298
Ye Chung Sik killed your parents.

597
00:44:22,938 --> 00:44:24,639
You must know...

598
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:27,539
why your parents died.

599
00:44:29,978 --> 00:44:31,618
That is why you never asked a question...

600
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:33,708
or seemed interested.

601
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:38,648
If you know why they died, it means you know who killed them.

602
00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:41,659
If no one else was involved other than Ye Chung Sik,

603
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:44,118
you wouldn't be out and about,

604
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,989
doing what could be seen as attempted murder.

605
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:50,858
Did Shin Ki Ho kill them?

606
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:52,568
Or...

607
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,599
was he an accomplice?

608
00:44:57,539 --> 00:44:58,608
Please tell me.

609
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:02,139
If what you did at the hospice becomes a problem,

610
00:45:02,938 --> 00:45:04,849
I'll defend you.

611
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:10,018
I hired you to represent me in a civil suit,

612
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:11,789
not a criminal suit.

613
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:15,719
So you want me to shut my mouth and get you the compensation.

614
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:17,259
Did I sound like that?

615
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,429
Well, you're right. That is what I meant.

616
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:27,278
I heard about the things that happened while you were in jail.

617
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:31,539
What on earth happened to you at Jeokmok?

618
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:35,009
What made you become like this, Ro Um?

619
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:48,389
I was...

620
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:52,259
born like this.

621
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:55,929
Jeokmok didn't make me like this.

622
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,338
Whatever I did, you're now an accomplice.

623
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:05,368
So if you don't want to be tried as a defendant,

624
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:07,369
just do your job well.

625
00:46:08,438 --> 00:46:10,039
Don't be nosy.

626
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:34,997
(Done)

627
00:46:34,998 --> 00:46:38,509
(Done)

628
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:52,648
- What about Mr. Han? - No idea.

629
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:54,759
He hasn't stepped out of his office.

630
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:56,978
Leave him be. The damages trial is around the corner.

631
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:00,159
The million-dollar case! Oh, boy.

632
00:47:00,628 --> 00:47:01,659
I'm jealous!

(Attorney Han Moo Young)

634
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:13,039
(Complaint, Lee Ro Um)

635
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:24,248
Don't worry.

636
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:26,018
I won't stab you.

637
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:28,418
My goodness, Ms. Lee Ro Um.

638
00:47:29,188 --> 00:47:30,389
What is this?

639
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:32,789
How did you get my address?

640
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:33,958
Through hacking.

641
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:36,498
There's nothing a criminal can't do.

642
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:38,068
What is this?

643
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:39,329
Trying to get back at me?

644
00:47:40,498 --> 00:47:42,938
I didn't think you were the type to hold grudges.

645
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,438
So? Okay, you're here. So what? What will you do?

646
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:51,408
You know what? I was bored, so this is good.

647
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:52,878
I got to see you.

648
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:55,548
How about you watch me drink a beer?

649
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,619
I'm not a beer drinker.

650
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,719
You sure hold grudges.

651
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:05,958
I bet you'd be very good at taking revenge, Ms. Lee.

652
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,497
So you do nothing but work,

653
00:48:09,498 --> 00:48:11,528
Probation Officer Ko Yo Han.

654
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:12,668
Why? What?

655
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:15,099
Ta-Da.

656
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:24,909
Oh, this?

657
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:29,179
This...

658
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:33,949
Gosh, this is...

659
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:37,917
You witnessed him committing a crime.

660
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:39,758
If you can let him be off,

661
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:42,329
you'll have no problem letting me go.

662
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:45,029
Gosh... What?

663
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:49,199
Look at how sharp it is! Did you use a long-range camera?

664
00:48:50,168 --> 00:48:51,199
Geez.

665
00:48:54,938 --> 00:48:56,338
What do you want?

666
00:49:00,548 --> 00:49:02,179
Stop bothering me.

667
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:05,288
Stop following me.

668
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:07,518
Stop calling me for no reason.

669
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:09,789
And stop asking me to call you.

670
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:14,358
Otherwise, I'll have to call the police.

671
00:49:15,298 --> 00:49:16,358
Understood?

672
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,969
I'm still your probation officer!

673
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,207
Don't have too much fun.

674
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:30,909
And we'll see each other every once in a while. Okay?

675
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:38,289
(Court)

676
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:44,759
Are you nervous?

677
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,588
Not really.

678
00:49:49,398 --> 00:49:50,628
I am.

679
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:55,768
This is a sure win, though.

680
00:49:57,898 --> 00:49:58,969
Exactly.

681
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:02,279
That's why I'm nervous.

682
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:11,119
The 2022-2435, plaintiff, Lee Ro Um.

683
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:15,418
Counsel, Park and Cue Law Firm. Attorney Han Moo Young?

684
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:16,958
Yes, Your Honour.

685
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:18,828
Defendant, Republic of Korea.

686
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:20,058
Representative, Prosecutor Min Sun Min...

687
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,474
of Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office.

688
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:23,529
- Present? - Yes, Your Honour.

689
00:50:24,228 --> 00:50:26,728
Plaintiff, make your argument about the complaint.

690
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:31,909
On February 14, 2012,

691
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:35,138
the plaintiff was suspected...

692
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:37,420
of the murder of a married couple and arson in Geonseong,

693
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:41,378
received the maximum sentence in juvenile court, 15 years,

694
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:43,949
and had served her time until September 1 this year.

695
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:47,849
The victims of the murder were her biological parents.

696
00:50:48,188 --> 00:50:50,418
She was falsely accused...

697
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:53,429
of murdering her own parents and served her sentence.

698
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,699
July 5, 2022,

699
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:59,469
the true culprit, Ye Chung Sik, confessed to the murder.

700
00:50:59,898 --> 00:51:02,668
August 15, he was sentenced...

701
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:10,779
Order!

702
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:14,207
Mr. Han, what are you talking about?

703
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,547
(Judge)

704
00:51:15,548 --> 00:51:17,918
Are you sure you're reading the complaint?

705
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:20,489
No.

706
00:51:21,188 --> 00:51:23,318
It's quite different from the complaint.

707
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,029
In the retrial,

708
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:28,659
they admitted to the fact that she was a victim...

709
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,627
forced to commit arson and was a witness to the crime.

710
00:51:31,628 --> 00:51:34,067
But that doesn't mean...

711
00:51:34,068 --> 00:51:36,168
that it's entirely true.

712
00:51:36,938 --> 00:51:37,938
Excuse me?

713
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:41,238
The culprit of the Geumseong murder is still undergoing...

714
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:42,779
court of appeals.

715
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:44,838
If the truth is yet to be revealed,

716
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:47,079
it will be solved there.

717
00:51:47,509 --> 00:51:49,518
I don't think that it's your decision...

718
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:52,449
to make in this court at this time.

719
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:55,529
Without the retrial, there wouldn't have been a damage claim suit.

720
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:59,628
The true culprit's appeal of the retrial is still ongoing.

721
00:52:00,128 --> 00:52:03,797
Until the plaintiff's innocence is relevant...

722
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:07,429
or until the plaintiff's original sentence ends,

723
00:52:07,768 --> 00:52:10,539
I request to adjourn this trial.

724
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:22,719
What a lunatic.

725
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:25,018
Order!

726
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:28,219
Mr. Han,

727
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:30,889
you could have discussed this with your client...

728
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:33,929
and filed the lawsuit at the time of your choice.

729
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:36,298
I apologize.

730
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:39,969
Everything about today's trial has been recorded.

731
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:44,139
This may be used against you in the future.

732
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:45,809
Do you understand that?

733
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:47,969
Yes, Your Honour.

734
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,648
The court is adjourned.

735
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:54,248
Attorney Han. Prosecutor Min.

736
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:56,179
See you in my office.

737
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:11,699
You told me to trust your illness.

738
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,199
That it'd take your side.

739
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:18,338
This is me taking your side.

740
00:53:25,648 --> 00:53:28,309
They target kind people and know exactly what to do...

741
00:53:28,518 --> 00:53:30,047
to use them.

742
00:53:30,048 --> 00:53:32,849
Highly empathetic people like yourself...

743
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:35,559
make perfect prey...

744
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:38,318
for them.

745
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:43,929
Ro Um!

746
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,728
Ro Um!

747
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:49,268
Do you know how many people are waiting?

748
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,639
You can't have the adults wait for you.

749
00:53:51,909 --> 00:53:52,938
Ma'am.

750
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:56,107
Ro Um!

751
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,179
("Surprise 100")

752
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:00,509
- Where is she? - This is absurd.

753
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,048
Ro Um!

754
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:07,147
- I told you to stick with her. - Gosh.

755
00:54:07,148 --> 00:54:08,758
Check the restroom.

756
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:10,259
I'm going down to the parking lot.

757
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:14,759
I'm sorry. Coming through.

758
00:54:28,168 --> 00:54:29,779
(Utility Room)

759
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:02,179
You were tired earlier, weren't you?

760
00:55:02,438 --> 00:55:03,708
You didn't fail to memorize it.

761
00:55:05,779 --> 00:55:06,949
How do you know that?

762
00:55:11,048 --> 00:55:13,789
Tell your parents...

763
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:15,289
that it's too tough.

764
00:55:16,518 --> 00:55:17,588
Then what?

765
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,228
They'll listen.

766
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:24,329
Do your parents let you do whatever you want?

767
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:27,929
No.

768
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:33,668
But no one will know unless you tell people.

769
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,878
It's too scary by yourself.

770
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:39,779
And it's lonely.

771
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:44,619
My family can eat meat if I do this.

772
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:48,518
It's not a bad deal.

773
00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:53,829
Let's get out of here.

774
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:55,998
I know a place you can hide.

775
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:06,608
Dad.

776
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:09,337
The girl was here.

777
00:56:09,338 --> 00:56:11,418
Do you know that all the adults are looking for you?

778
00:56:13,009 --> 00:56:14,478
- Come here. - Ro Um!

779
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:16,048
Gosh.

780
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:17,918
Come on.

781
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,259
("Surprise 100")

782
00:56:22,889 --> 00:56:23,889
Did you find her?

783
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:26,529
Follow me. Hurry!

784
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,228
Come on!

785
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:36,337
This is part of their scheme.

786
00:56:36,338 --> 00:56:38,239
She's not worth watching. Let's go.

787
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,739
Moo Young, let's go.

788
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:52,789
I won't be eaten up that easily.

789
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:55,958
Neither will I run...

790
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,518
nor look away.

791
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:18,079
(Attorney Han Moo Young)

792
00:57:20,509 --> 00:57:22,219
(Attorney Han Moo Young)

793
00:57:25,248 --> 00:57:27,248
Whatever it is you're hiding,

794
00:57:27,918 --> 00:57:29,318
I'm going to find out.

795
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:36,159
I'd like you to bog off now.

796
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:37,798
That won't be easy.

797
00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:41,329
Just like how I can't let you go,

798
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:44,168
you won't be able to let me go.

799
00:57:44,539 --> 00:57:47,568
Because I'm probably the only one who will empathize with you...

800
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,079
after you show your hostility.

801
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:54,849
I don't know what your purpose is, but let me help.

802
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:56,219
But...

803
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:59,018
you must learn how to empathize as well.

804
00:58:00,148 --> 00:58:02,158
Before you hurt others,

805
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:03,918
you'll learn to hesitate.

806
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,187
And you'll learn...

807
00:58:06,188 --> 00:58:08,388
to find another way instead of avenging evil with evil.

808
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:13,099
I'll help you become that person.

809
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:19,039
You're...

810
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,539
fired.

811
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:44,659
(Unknown number)

812
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:59,147
(Unknown number: Welcome back)

813
00:58:59,148 --> 00:59:01,349
(Delightfully Deceitful)

814
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:33,809
Ro Um.

815
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,619
How long will you keep staring?

816
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:37,179
What?

817
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,148
The case was closed?

818
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:42,989
It was concluded an accidental death.

819
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:45,389
I'll do what I can as a lawyer.

820
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:49,228
A trial won't bring out the truth.

821
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:51,858
That doesn't mean revenge is justice.

822
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:54,998
We have a very special guest.

823
00:59:55,228 --> 00:59:56,937
I'm a child psychology specialist,
