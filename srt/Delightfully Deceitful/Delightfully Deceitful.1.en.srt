24
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:45,258

33
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:08,748
Who do you mean?

34
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,818
You just got here two hours ago.

36
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,408

Of all the lawyers I know,

45
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:01,999
he's the best.

46
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:06,167
Why do you think...

47
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:08,339
people keep bringing their cases to him?

48
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,108
I don't know.

"To defend."

50
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:15,918
It's a great word.

51
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,519
"To help others..."

52
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,519
"with their speech."

53
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,458
A card sharp who bet their wrist...

54
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,288
on a game and won one million dollars.

55
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,628
With 16 priors, he's addicted to gambling,

56
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,658
and he's a con man.

57
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:28,798
Wouldn't that guarantee him a prison sentence?

58
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:30,629
However,

59
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:32,168
despite that...

60
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:36,499
If your lawyer...

61
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:39,809
is Han Moo Young, that changes everything.

62
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:45,848
Defendant.

63
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:48,379
- Yes? - Are you a card sharp?

64
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:50,717
(Witness)

65
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:51,749
Yes.

66
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,249
What does a card sharp do?

67
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,158
When gambling,

68
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,059
I use slight of hand to con others.

69
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:07,268
Then on April 11, did you use your skills...

70
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,999
as a card sharp against the victim?

71
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,079
Yes.

72
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:18,949
And you were aware that it would be considered fraud.

73
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:22,278
Yes.

74
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,348
I rest my case.

75
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,218
Defendant.

76
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,588
- Yes. - Did you use your skills...

77
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:33,829
in the first half of the game?

78
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,597
No, the latter half of the game.

79
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:36,759
(Witness)

80
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,139
Let's compare the 1st and 2nd half of the game.

81
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:47,608
Please pay attention to Ms. Jung and the defendant's little finger.

82
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:50,738
Ms. Jung was wearing the ring during the first half of the game,

83
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:53,908
but the defendant was wearing it in the second half of the game.

84
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,718
Was that ring a part of your card tricks?

85
00:06:58,749 --> 00:06:59,788
No.

86
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,118
Of course, it wasn't.

87
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:03,988
That ring...

88
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,959
was a token of love, not a tool.

89
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,297
The defendant has been accused of a six-figure gambling fraud,

90
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:14,069
but here's something we should be really curious about.

91
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,769
The question is why, not how he did it.

92
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,168
Who was it for?

93
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,708
As you all saw in the video,

94
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,848
in the first half of the game, Ms. Jung lost a million dollars.

95
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,448
The victim even mentioned...

96
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,318
a physical rights waiver to Ms. Jung and threatened her.

97
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,518
The video clearly shows it.

98
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,589
Defendant.

99
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,488
Is it true that Ms. Jung gave you the ring during the break?

100
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,559
- Yes. - Why did she do that?

101
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,967
She said to remember her as I might not be able to see her again.

102
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:48,439
Did you not think you'd be put in danger...

103
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:51,568
if you used your skills and got caught?

104
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:53,209
I knew that, but I really wanted...

105
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,268
to win some money and clear her debt for her.

106
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:05,689
That was the moment when the defendant decided...

107
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:09,657
to use his skills as a card sharp, which he hadn't used...

108
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:11,117
for ten years.

109
00:08:11,118 --> 00:08:13,889
He did not do it for his personal financial gain,

110
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,728
nor was it a gambling addict's reckless act.

111
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:20,728
He instinctively wanted to protect the woman he loves.

112
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:26,569
That was the motivation behind his decision to use his skills.

113
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,548
The defendant is guilty of fraud.

114
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:40,288
Ergo, the defendant is sentenced to two years in prison.

115
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,617
Even though he engaged in illegal gambling,

116
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:48,058
he did not commit fraud with malicious intent.

117
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,328
Hence, the court has decided to suspend his sentence...

118
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,069
for three years.

I'm Woo Young Ki.

122
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,727
You turned a crime drama into a romance.

123
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,568
How did you come up with the idea?

124
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:27,529
Do you take public speaking classes or something?

125
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,897
I've made it clear to you that I don't want to do any interviews.

126
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:31,967
Well, we are a small local newspaper,

127
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:34,038
but I can guarantee you that you'll be on the first page.

128

I'm Woo Young Ki. I have that much power.

129
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,007
If you don't get any media exposure with that face,

130
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:43,378
it's such a waste.

131
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,617
Fine. I'll be sure not to include...

132
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:49,589
any provocative nicknames such as Vampire.

133
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,959
You're not getting it, are you?

134
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,379
There will be no interview, so no need to worry about what to write.

What...

136
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:00,528
I heard he was rude.

137
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:03,398
What? Rude?

138
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:06,638
I heard the rumours. Vampire.

139
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,079

I'm sorry.

00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:15,749
- It's okay. - You were going to the restroom.

142
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,848
Go on.

143
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:23,289
Hasn't Byeol grown a lot?

144
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:28,898
Byeol's dad's appeal trial is today.

145
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:31,258
That's great.

146
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:32,799
It's "great?"

147
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,918
Do you know how my life has been for the past three years?

148
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:39,809
You said you'd help us through this difficult fight,

149
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,309
then gave up on him.

150
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,518
I heard he was very cold and heartless.

151
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,388
And he picks and chooses his clients.

00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,458
(My son died a year after he was adopted.)

153
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,499
(At age 18, Myung Hoon couldn't even go to school.)

154
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,529
So clearly, he won't take on my case.

155
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,799
Well, you're right.

156
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,008

157
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:16,878

Yes.

160
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,617
Did the trial go well?

161
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:31,617
Yes, he got a suspended sentence.

162
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:32,628
I knew it.

163
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:36,098
I've told you about him. He is Chairman Jung's younger son.

164
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:42,069
Are you familiar with my case?

165
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,939
You know, the taxi driver.

166
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,939
It's not that hand.

167
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:47,568
Sorry?

168
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:51,008
In your first statement, you said you hurt your right hand.

169
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,638
You should wear the cast on your right hand.

170
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,248
Come with me.

171
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,029
He's taking on my case?

172
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:11,828
I thought he was picky with his clients.

173
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,329
Right, you fit the bill.

174
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:16,318
He always picks clients like you.

175
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:35,888

according to the company's needs.

185
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:19,298
He had an office job. You forced him to accept the field position...

186
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,698
and treated him unfairly for four years.

187
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,538
Plaintiff's counsel. What are you doing now?

188
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:25,909
We never treated him unfairly.

189
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:29,107
He was an odd one for being unable to handle what everyone else does.

190
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,339
What? "An odd one?"

191
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,007
Are you done talking?

192
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:35,078
You used him! Then when you were in a pickle,

193
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:37,847
you threatened to fire him when he did nothing wrong!

194
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:41,318
Plaintiff's counsel is defaming the witness...

195
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,217
with his reckless, abstract remarks.

196
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:45,828
Who is defaming whom here?

197
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:47,988
Plaintiff's counsel, please calm down.

198
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:49,727
We're examining the witness at the moment.

199
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,498
He was a responsible man.

200
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,628
Do you not know...

201
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,498
how hard he worked...

202
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,309
for the past ten years?

203
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:03,637
For shameless people like you,

204
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:04,978
he went through...

205
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:16,988
How many times have you fainted...

206
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,128
in the past six months?

207
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,398
Will you quit being a lawyer after this case?

208
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:24,998
You've done enough.

209
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,228
Against a former prosecutor who's now working for that big company.

210
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:31,339
Hey.

211
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:35,108
Are big companies allowed to kill people after using them?

212
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,409
I'll fight to the end.

213
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:40,408
Byeol's mother is also...

214
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:42,148
No, you shouldn't. Moo Young.

215
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,877
You need to drop this for your own sake.

216
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:45,888
And stop.

217
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:48,918
Stop calling your clients like that.

218
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,257
Sure, it's great and admirable to sympathize with your clients.

219
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,029
But you need to live too, you know?

220
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:56,358
Only then can you help them.

221
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,298
I'm not saying you can't help them at all now.

222
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,198
You don't have to only help people in need...

223
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,968
to be a true lawyer.

224
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:09,179
I've found someone who can help them.

225
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,549
And I'm trying to find another doctor for you.

226
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,648
Let's get you treated first. Please.

227
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:22,388
I should accept it.

228
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,199
Gosh.

229
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:56,189
- My gosh. - Goodness.

230
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:59,987
There's nothing I loathe more...

231
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:02,097
than people who disrespect their parents.

232
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:03,998
I may have killed my husband,

233
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:06,128
but I still paid for my parents' trip.

234
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:07,569
Do you know that?

235
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,539
You ungrateful wench.

Are you looking for Seo Gye Sook?

240
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:04,688
The adoptive parents...

241
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,487
sued her for defamation.

242
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:08,459
With Cho and Son Law Firm.

243
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:12,328
I heard from the prosecutor, and there was no evidence.

244
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,799
If the case is closed at this rate,

245
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,839
she won't be able to do anything.

246
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:20,809
People ask,

247
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:23,408
"Why did she put a grown son up for adoption?"

248
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,848
"She should have known better about this cold world."

249
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:27,949
His adoptive parents...

250
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:31,018
paid 2,000 dollars a month for Myung Hoon's insurance.

251
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:32,748
Last year only,

252
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:36,289
they took out about 13 or 15 insurance policies.

253
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:39,059
Some of them were the exact same policies.

254
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:40,888
Fishy, right?

255
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:45,998
So what? It's all circumstantial.

256
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,998
They claimed that they raised him with their biological children,

257
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,367
and while their kids were looking all plump,

258
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:52,908
Myung Hoon was so skinny.

259
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,908
Why are you saying this?

260
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,538
Sorry?

261
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,509
Why are you telling me this?

262
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,979
I thought you'd be curious.

263
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,488
You've been staring at where Ms. Seo used to stand...

264

for five minutes.

265
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:09,618

Ye, who was arrested for carrying an illegal weapon last month,

turned out to be the true culprit...

278

of the controversial murder in Geumseong.

279
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:52,328
The problem is...

280
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:55,499
that the formerly accused person has been in prison for ten years.

281
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:57,338

Inside the bungalow were two bodies of a married couple,

305
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:40,147
shot in the heads and scorched black.

306
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:41,986

307
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,116
their only daughter, Lee Ro Um.

308
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:46,487
Lee Ro Um was on the scene...

309
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:49,227

sentenced to 15 years in prison,

315
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:11,217

316

Ten years have passed after that,

317

we have the true culprit of the Geumseong murder.

318
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:18,687
It was Ye,

319
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:20,969
who was arrested for carrying illegal weapons last month.

320
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,896

between Ye's gun and the bullets...

322
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:29,497
found on the murder scene in Geumseong 11 years ago.

323

Ms. Lee, who was referred to as a genius,

324
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:34,637
was falsely accused of parricide...

325

A mother who lost her son.

333

Why do you think she's in your head?

334
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:24,816

335

disregard or repression,

339
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:39,206

- Yes. - and found a revolver.

- the married couple who were... - I wonder who'll take the case.

- arrested Ye. - It'll be a public defender, right?

and when a prosecutor questioned you about the Geumseong case,

406

you confessed.

00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:23,896
That woman...

548
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:25,637
Hey, she hired you.

549
00:35:27,706 --> 00:35:29,436
- What? - The damage suit.

550
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:33,646
- She wants you to represent her. - Me?

551
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:36,106
Why me?

552
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:37,746
Of course, she'd want to hire you.

553
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:39,475
You betrayed your client and saved her.

554
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:40,847
She knows you're a pushover.

555
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:48,827
Since this has already happened,

556
00:35:49,287 --> 00:35:51,167
we'll say we're all about fighting for justice.

557
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:53,895
I'll be sure to stop the disciplinary committee,

558
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:55,656
so you need to pull this off no matter what.

Hello.

563
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,706
Are you cold?

564
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:37,507
A little.

565
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:39,476
I don't have other clothes, so...

566
00:36:40,476 --> 00:36:43,007
You gave me this too, remember?

567
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:46,546
Then, first...

568
00:36:53,226 --> 00:36:54,287
Here.

569
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:56,697
Thank you.

570
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,367
Have you ordered yet?

571
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:08,606
No, how do I...

572
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:11,876
- That one. - This here?

573
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,007
I'll go order something for us.

574
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:23,487

Thank you.

576
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:40,606
I'm sorry.

577
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:47,447
It's been so long since the last time someone treated me this nicely.

578
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,246
No one helped me.

579
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:03,697
Seriously, no one believed me.

580
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,197
While being behind bars for ten years...

581
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,166
because of something I didn't even do,

582
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:17,677
I was always scared...

583
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:20,177
and lonely.

584
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:26,746
In there, I had to find a way to survive...

585
00:38:28,887 --> 00:38:30,117
every single day.

586
00:38:57,976 --> 00:38:59,017
Thank you.

587
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:02,186
You can do it.

588
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:05,816
You don't need me.

589
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:10,126
Even if you tackle this alone, you'll win.

00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:20,637
a witch.

00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:22,307
They say I'm evil.

593
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:28,007
They say similar things about you too.

594
00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:31,376
"Cold-blooded Vampire."

595
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:37,157
You chose justice over your own reputation...

596
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,257
and gave clothes to someone like me...

597
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,296
who has no family or friends.

598
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:50,967
Anyone can say things.

599
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:58,007
I believe...

600
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:02,546
that actions speak louder than words.

601
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:09,217
So how was it?

602
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:13,856
You risked your career to help her.

603
00:40:15,586 --> 00:40:16,927
Do you think it was worth it?

Yes.

607
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,987
there was a certain type of people I should avoid at all costs.

608
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:29,666
Right.

609
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:40,585
People who are unable to sympathize with others' emotions...

610
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:43,316
and habitually lie.

611
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:45,956
And they do whatever it takes...

612
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:48,557
to achieve their goals.

Antisocial personality disorder.

614
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:56,296
They're also called sociopaths or psychopaths.

615
00:40:58,267 --> 00:40:59,736
They target kind people...

616
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:02,066
and know exactly what to do to use them.

617
00:41:11,476 --> 00:41:14,546
Highly empathetic people like yourself...

618
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:17,186
make perfect prey...

619
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:20,287

Hello, is this Ms. No?

623
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:27,427
So you want to know about her?

624
00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:32,106
I didn't even know that her name was Lee Ro Un.

625
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:34,767
It's Lee Ro Um.

626
00:42:35,296 --> 00:42:36,795
I don't care.

627
00:42:36,796 --> 00:42:38,236
I didn't even want to know her name.

People talk about psychopaths often these days.

629
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:43,906
Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure she's a psychopath.

630
00:42:44,907 --> 00:42:45,936
You think so?

631
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:48,245
On her first day,

632
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,126
she stabbed a correctional officer in his neck.

636

Finish all your food.

637
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:23,717
Eat everything on your plates!

638
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,616
Finish your side dishes too.

639
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:30,987
Don't leave a single grain of rice.

641

Eat everything...

642
00:43:51,537 --> 00:43:52,606
Why did she do that?

643
00:43:53,206 --> 00:43:54,407
No reason.

644
00:43:54,577 --> 00:43:56,706
He told her to eat everything, and she stabbed him.

645
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:00,237
You don't believe me, do you?

646
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:03,316
Right, she's very pretty.

647
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,287
I think that's why all the officers favoured her.

648
00:44:07,827 --> 00:44:09,057
But she was young back then.

649
00:44:09,456 --> 00:44:12,026
I mean, she's probably changed.

650
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:14,795

This is a clear, toxic, flammable liquid.

661
00:44:57,376 --> 00:44:59,276
Namely, methanol.

662
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:01,177
Once absorbed into the body,

663
00:45:01,347 --> 00:45:04,376
it turns into a substance called formaldehyde.

664
00:45:04,816 --> 00:45:07,746

The book you tore?

670
00:45:30,537 --> 00:45:32,206
I could memorize it if I wanted to.

671
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:37,447
Do you know why I'm doing this?

672
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:45,356
Because I haven't finished memorizing that book yet.

673

That new inmate was a woman who collected the insurance...

She got a taste of her own medicine,

684

685
00:46:45,476 --> 00:46:47,217
How did she acquire methanol?

686
00:46:47,787 --> 00:46:48,847
It was water.

We don't keep ethanol nor methanol in our prison.

688
00:46:54,257 --> 00:46:55,257
But...

689
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:58,827
she was already too terrified to figure out it was water.

690
00:46:59,097 --> 00:47:02,026
She even claimed that she smelled alcohol.

691
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:05,266
Even after Lee Ro Um was released,

692
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:07,907
she slept with her eyes open, so she got drugs for insomnia.

693
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:14,476
Even if she tore up her book,

694
00:47:14,646 --> 00:47:16,807
what kind of psychopath pulls such a prank?

695
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:22,117
They're all saying that she's not the culprit, right?

696
00:47:23,017 --> 00:47:24,656
You must know better...

697
00:47:24,657 --> 00:47:26,117
as you defended the true culprit.

698
00:47:28,456 --> 00:47:30,597
I still think that she killed her own parents.

699
00:47:31,856 --> 00:47:33,496
You must have heard.

700
00:47:34,126 --> 00:47:36,296
She turned herself in at first. If she hadn't done it,

701
00:47:36,526 --> 00:47:38,795
why would a girl with an IQ score of 180 volunteer...

702
00:47:38,796 --> 00:47:41,767
to go to prison? What's to gain from it?

703
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:43,166
That's what I think.

704
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:45,875
I would never know, though.

705
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:47,646
Maybe she bought off a fake criminal.

710

Do you think there are a lot of those in prison?

711
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:03,887
Well, there aren't as many as you think.

712
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:06,957
But I can tell you for sure that Ro Um had those qualities.

713
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:11,537
She never got to lose her yellow name tag during her sentence...

714
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:13,436
because she was too dangerous.

715
00:48:16,336 --> 00:48:20,436

00:48:48,267 --> 00:48:49,367
What are you doing?

724
00:48:50,507 --> 00:48:52,436
- Pardon? - Why did you just scan me?

725
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:54,277
Am I on probation or something?

726
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,717
I'm the probation officer, not you.

Yes.

00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:13,396
Okay.

731
00:49:14,226 --> 00:49:15,296
You can go.

732
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,867
I'll see you in front of your house at 8pm tonight.

733
00:49:18,396 --> 00:49:19,467
Excuse me?

734
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,407
Why?

735
00:49:22,867 --> 00:49:24,276
Do you have other plans?

736
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:29,246
Tonight at 8pm,

737
00:49:29,606 --> 00:49:33,447
I'll see you in front of your house. And buy a phone before that.

738
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:34,987

Hi. Please put me through to Lee Ro Um in Room 309.

She left?

745
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:44,557
When?

746
00:50:54,526 --> 00:50:56,566
I know what you're going to say.

747
00:50:56,767 --> 00:51:00,267
"Why would a girl who wasted ten years in prison..."

748
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:02,037
"and is on probation go to gamble?"

749
00:51:04,776 --> 00:51:05,936
Be quiet and watch me.

Let's go.

Hello. How may I help you?

I'm in the Intellectual Crime Investigation Squad.

768
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:09,629
There's stolen property in the nearby vintage jewellery shops,

769
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,170
so I'm collecting evidence.

770
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,469
Have you dealt with any goods that seemed stolen this year?

771
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,670
What? No, I haven't.

772
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,739
We only accept jewellery from identified people.

773
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,639
Keep pressing...

00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,909
until he succumbs.

775
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,449
Haven't you heard of Kim Woo Young, Cha Yo Hwan, and Park Jae Hyuk?

776
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:34,589
They stabbed a pedestrian in Busan.

777
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,659
What?

778
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:39,489
No. I've never heard of them.

779
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:42,199
I honestly don't know anything, Officer.

780
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,270
Mr. Shin Bo Sung, let me identify you first.

781
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:48,069

00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,639

I'll have to cross-reference the lists of goods.

786
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,019
Will you show me your ledger for the first half of the year?

787
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,889
The first half of the year? Okay.

Not that one. The one behind that.

802
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,980
Yes, that.

803
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:08,249
On May 15,

804
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,619
you got a set of jewellery.

805
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:22,159
The shoes...

806
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:23,699
I'll take them for now.

807
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:25,469
I need to check the sizes.

808

It's conning.

811
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:56,599
Wait, then...

812
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:58,900
From the far right.

813

"a homeless man was caught stealing,"

"and an arrest warrant was issued."

817
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,250
- Yes. She got it right again. - Oh, my.

818
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:15,678
- You're crazy. - This is just...

819
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,419
- It's incredible. - Geniuses exist.

820
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,550
You won a million dollars doing this?

821
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,090
A long time ago, in the US.

822
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,229
No way...

823
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,360
The funny thing is,

824
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,300
Royal Casino has no rules to prevent card counters.

825
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,999
So before flying back,

826
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,670
I came over to have some fun.

827
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:38,110
Talk to her.

828
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,279
Let's talk about you.

829
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,250
How much did you win?

830
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:49,719
It's more like we donated.

831
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:52,590
Come on, that's heartbreaking.

832
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:56,460
I should get going.

833
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,190
Come on.

834
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,759
Keep what I said between us.

835
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:03,360
I'll give you a gift.

836
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,869
Wait.

837
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,028
Can we...

838
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:10,000
sponsor you to play a few games?

839
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,409
We happened to cross paths.

840
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,579
Can't we have some fun too?

841
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,480
Please?

842
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,249
In Blackjack, the first round...

843
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,649
affects the second round.

844
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,348
When the same deck is used,

845
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:30,520
the longer the games go on and the more cards are played,

846
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:33,189
the more data you have to use to your advantage.

847
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,529
In other words, you know what card will come next.

848
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,828
Of course, you must memorize all the cards that were played.

849
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,300
And do some math.

850
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,869
Let me correct myself.

851
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,409
Now this is no longer a con.

852
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:11,599
Miss.

853
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,230
I need you to come with us.

854
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:15,099
Why? I'm on a roll.

855
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:16,900
Come with us.

856
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,210
Wait.

857
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,250
I'm not playing with my money.

858
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,920
Talk to them. Go on.

859
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,289
No. We met only today.

860
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,889
- What's she on about? - What's wrong with her?

861
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,089
I think she's a con artist.

862
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,500
- She is. - Isn't she?

863
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,029
Come with us quietly.

864
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,539
We'll retrieve the chips you used.

865
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,610
Come with us.

866
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:53,309
Let go.

867
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,809
Let go of me.

868
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,679
Take her.

869
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,809
Let go! What are you doing?

870
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,750
As I told you. It's not a con.

871
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,190
The casino can't sue me.

872
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,129
They have no choice but to hope...

873
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,860
I'll cut a deal and walk.

874
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,659
Will this be enough?

875
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:22,440
We'll pay you in cash.

876
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,269
Would you mind taking it...

877
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,340
and leaving the casino?

878
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,689
The addresses are on each bag.

879
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,530
Tell them that Hyosung Nambu Police Station...

880
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:44,759
appreciates their help.

(Seoyoung Studio)

882
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:52,889
You took a taxi.

883
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,130
Did you play golf?

884
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,199
I worked part-time as a caddie.

885
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,699
They got me the cab.

886
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,969
Don't caddies usually stay at the club?

887
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,739
- It was short-term. - For how much?

888
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:08,409
A hundred dollars.

889
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,579
That's such a strange number.

890
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,949
It's so very strange.

891
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:19,989
Let's see inside.

892
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,259
Open the bag.

893
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,829
It'll be your caddie gear.

894
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:31,829
The bag.

895
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,130
Open it.

896
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
What for?

897
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:42,679
Stop it.

898
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:45,610
It's invasion of privacy.

899
01:00:55,759 --> 01:00:57,619
I'm Han Moo Young, Ms. Lee's lawyer.

900
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,630
Give the bag to her.

901
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:03,300
I'm Ko Yo Han, her probation officer.

902
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:05,900
What right do you have to give orders?

903
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,599
Do you have the legal right to seize...

904
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,570
and search the belongings of your charge?

905
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,578
If there's a danger the charge will break the rules,

906
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:16,579
the probation officer...

907
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,779
Name the said danger.

908
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,750
To be honest, I don't know how Lee got out.

909
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,050
They must've released her because the media was going crazy.

910
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,559
Regardless of what she did in prison.

911
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,290
However,

912
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,758
being on probation means the punishment was delayed.

913
01:01:32,759 --> 01:01:34,130
It doesn't mean she was cleared.

914
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:36,130
She's a criminal.

915
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,099
To me, Lee herself is a source of danger.

916
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:42,639
Keep an eye on her.

917
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,868
Not just winning in court,

918
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:47,670
but making sure your client doesn't break the law...

919
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:49,738
is your duty...

920
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,509
as a person in the legal field.

921
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:54,349
I'll do that.

922
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:56,219
Okay.

923
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,050
Then...

924
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,119
here's your dear client's dear belongings.

925
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,959
Call me on your phone tomorrow.

926
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,000
Okay?

927
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:10,460
I'll do that.

928
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,369
I didn't mean you.

929
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,170
I'll do that.

930
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,570
Fine, then.

931
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:23,509
I'll see you again at this time tomorrow.

932
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,050
Your caddie job.

933
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,849
Sign an employment contract...

934
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:30,179
and report to me.

935
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:16,159
You asked if it was worth it.

936
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,040
It might be.

937
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,610
I know...

938
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:34,650
the woman.

939
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,040
(Delightfully Deceitful)

940
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,050
(We thank Kim Woo Seok and Kim Han Na for their special appearances.)

941
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,210
Did you kill them?

942
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,121
Why are you asking me that when you said you believed me?

943
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,079
Did you buy a cell phone?

944
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,579
Stop bothering me.

945
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,679
I discovered something interesting.

946
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:45,449
"Jeokmok Kids."

947
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:49,920
That man, Shin Ki Ho, worked at Red Eyes Foundation in the past.

948
01:04:50,259 --> 01:04:52,529
Do you think this is a wise thing to do?

949
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:55,299
Even if someone in a hospice facility dies,

950
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,800
it's nothing strange.
