Do you have any final comments?

8
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:24,487
I realized I was ill...

9
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:26,557
when I was a judicial officer.

10
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:30,828
Once I sympathize with someone enough to get shaken up,

11
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:32,997
it disrupts my everyday life...

12
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:34,767
to the point where I can't function.

13
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:36,967
That's why I took on cases...

14
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:39,108
that others found hard to sympathize with.

15
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,778
I thought that turning away from the poor,

16
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:44,748
weak, and unfortunate...

17
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:48,676
was the only way I could function as a lawyer.

Lee Ro Um was imprisoned for parricide,

20
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:53,787
a dreadful thing to do.

21
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,686
But when I realized...

22
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,058
she'd been framed and had spent ten years behind bars,

23
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:00,998
I betrayed Ye Chung Sik,

24
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:04,528
the real killer who happened to be my client.

25
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:08,067
I believed doing so would help Lee Ro Um,

26
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:12,237
and for the first time, I felt that I'd served justice.

27
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:14,808
During the process, I realized...

28
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:17,478
the law...

29
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:21,347
isn't fair and equal to everyone.

30
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:23,677
Unlike a court sentence,

31
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:27,957
the world isn't black or white, guilty or not guilty.

32
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,927
I harmed my client on my own accord.

33
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:36,897
I will not ask you to let me off.

00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,968
I will accept whatever you decide to do.

00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,707
I will now announce the disciplinary committee's decision.

36
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:52,348
Mr. Han, we sympathize with your passion for justice...

37
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:55,546
and your personal values as a lawyer.

38
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:57,687
However, you caused significant damage to your client...

39
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:01,217
and violated your duty. This, we cannot take lightly.

40
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:04,986
But considering your psychological condition,

41
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:09,427
we have concluded that you should be suspended for three months.

42
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:21,508
Here's the entire sum the former CEO had brought with him.

43
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:24,207
It's 500,000 dollars. Would you like to check?

44
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,747
No, it's fine.

45
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,918
Then get back safely, ma'am.

46

You see,

47
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,997
had I known you hated spending their money that much,

48
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,438
I would've never gotten money from them.

49
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:54,978
It's not like I'm going to side with them.

50
00:03:55,408 --> 00:03:57,948
I was in a pickle,

51
00:03:58,448 --> 00:03:59,947
so I borrowed a little bit of money from them.

52
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,277
I didn't know it'd make you this upset.

53
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,317
And let's be honest. To them, it's chump change.

54
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,056
If you truly thought of me as your brother,

55
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:09,956
you could've helped me clear my debt,

56
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:11,427
but you...

57
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,557

58
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,367

59
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,367
You need me.

60
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,267
You need me, Ro Um.

61
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,207
That's why you tracked me down.

62
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:34,517
Shall I tell you why you haven't managed to break Jeokmok's grip?

63
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:36,347
Ro Um, I was just...

64
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:37,918
It's because of your servile nature.

65
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,147
You'd better stay focused.

He's not like us.

119

I know he's suspended now, but he has a place to go back to.

120

He's not someone you can just use and ditch.

124
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,748
Why don't you go ahead and tell him?

125
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:57,747
Tell him who committed fraud at age 14...

126
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:59,787
and destroyed his family.

127
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,698
There's only one reason why you can't tell him.

128
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,128
You were an accomplice in it.

129
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,657
You don't have the courage to tell him,

130
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,628
so you're whining to me as if you're worried about him.

00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:30,616
and the details of their transactions,

183
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,417
which could be used as leverage against them.

184
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:40,798
These will keep our lives safe.

185
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:44,798
Find the useful ones as soon as possible...

186
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:46,808
and put them in the bag.

187
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:52,148
An Chae Hong's ledgers of ten years.

188
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:54,607
Those were all I needed.

189
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,427
Get your passport ready and pack your bag.

190
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:07,028
You'll leave the country at dawn.

191
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:10,357
Before the plane took off at dawn,

192
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,727
I only had one option left.

193
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:16,268
Jang Kyung Ja.

194
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:25,448
("Shinseora Show")

195
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:26,808
Long time no see.

196
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:28,977
We finally met.

197
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:30,518
Has it been ten years?

198
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:32,587
Yes. Already.

199
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:40,457
What are you standing there for? Hurry!

200
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:41,798
I mean,

201
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,597
you can at least tell me what's going on.

202
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:49,798
Just shut your mouth!

203
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:53,137
Where's your bag?

204
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,737
- Me? - You want me to go alone?

205
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,578
Whose wife are you?

206
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:02,177
So, tell me what's going on.

207
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:03,678
What's making you leave so urgently?

208
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,957
I won't go without an explanation.

209
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:13,028
Explain to me what's actually going on, and...

210
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:18,828
I finally learned today...

211
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:21,467
who the president is.

212
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:23,737
I saw him today.

213
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:27,268
I ran into him.

214
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,438
Also, he knew that I had been investigating him.

215
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:33,308
He won't just let me live.

216
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,217
Why would he when I know who he really is?

217
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:41,148
I must leave Korea before they come for me.

218
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:46,658
To Jang Kyung Ja, An Chae Hong's escape was a crisis.

219
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:50,298
Because she had given her all...

220
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,397
to another man.

221
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:53,927
("Shinseora Show")

222
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:54,967
Good.

223
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,697
I believe that we've talked long enough...

224
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,607
and gotten pretty close.

225
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:03,607
We learned so much about you today, ma'am.

226
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:06,077
("Shinseora Show")

227
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,078
Lastly, I'll ask you a crucial question.

228
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:12,018
As a career woman...

229
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:15,587
and a successful female CEO,

230
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:18,058
what drives you...

231
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,857
and motivates you in life?

232
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,497
My loved ones, of course.

233
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:28,568
Great.

234
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:35,038
Jay.

235
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:39,207
He was already a Jeokmok Kid when I joined them.

236
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:41,278
The first-ever Jeokmok Kid.

237
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:46,788
Jay was the last person to leave Korea for a woman.

238
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,057
Jang Kyung Ja hated me...

239
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:51,957
just because I knew Jay,

240
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,757
so my escape was an opportunity for her.

241
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:56,957
So,

242
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,298
I'd say it was...

243
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:02,298
a reasonable offer.

244
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:08,257
(We've been living in the same house since you left.)

245
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:11,977
(Calling)

246
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:20,548
Hello?

247
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,257
This is Lee Ro Um.

248
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:25,188
Why are you calling me?

249
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:27,457
Director An brought a black bag, right?

250
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,997
Hand over that bag to me,

251
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,058
and you won't have to leave Korea.

252
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:33,967
Are you up for it?

253
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:36,798
What are you going to do with it?

254
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,798
I'm going to make a deal with the president.

255
00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:41,607
I want to quit everything...

256
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:45,247
and go home now.

257
00:16:46,877 --> 00:16:49,047
Hand me that bag at midnight,

258
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:51,477
and the president will take care of Director An himself.

259
00:16:58,987 --> 00:16:59,987
But...

260
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,627
just because it was a reasonable offer,

261
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,997
it didn't always lead to a reasonable outcome.

262
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,637
It's going to be heated today as well.

263
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,078
That's not exactly what I mean.

264
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:54,008
But some people are there for you...

265
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:57,248
when you think it's the end.

266
00:17:58,447 --> 00:17:59,988
They could be your family members...

267
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,258
or friends.

268
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,426
So, it's someone who you want to...

269
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:09,697
rely on and spend your life with.

270
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:11,528
I see.

271
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:15,797
Now that you mention it,

272
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:18,968
that reminds me of a company's motto of prioritizing...

273
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,707
the notion of staying well-connected with people...

274
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,377
over the corporate's well-being.

275
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:36,187
Ms. Jang?

276
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,828
I still need to read the closing line.

277
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,288
Will you please wait?

278
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:45,188
Why don't you take your seat?

279
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:57,508
("Shinseora Show")

280
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:12,157
It's been a long time.

281
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:14,728
Yes.

282
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:16,397
It has been.

283
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:18,058
Jay?

284
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:20,396
Ro Um told you about Jay?

285
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:21,917
She said he was the first Jeokmok Kid.

286
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:23,867
Did she tell you anything else?

287
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,207
She told me about what happened ten years ago.

288
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,078
I've always been curious about their relationship.

289
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:35,478
They seemed to have a bond for some reason.

290
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:39,017
Jay had always listened to Ro Um,

291
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:41,147
and Ro Um seemed comfortable around Jay.

292
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,327
Of course, they spent the longest time together...

293
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,028
in Jeokmok, so that'd be natural.

294
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,896
Then again, Da Jung joined them...

295
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,298
around the same time as Ro Um, but they weren't that close.

296
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:52,597
Both of them.

297
00:19:53,197 --> 00:19:56,897
I did realize that Kyung Ja and Jay had something going on between them,

298
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,907
but I could understand...

299
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,738
why she hated Ro Um so much.

300
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:04,538
Maybe they have similar vibes.

301
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:06,708
About that guy, Jay.

302
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:09,417
When Ro Um tried to leave Jeokmok,

303
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:11,278
how did he help her?

304
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:15,357
Jay was the same, after all.

305
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,087
He stood by his girlfriend.

("Shinseora Show")

307
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:30,998
Is it over?

308
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:32,808
Who was that earlier?

309
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:38,238
Who?

310
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:49,617
Where were you? I've been looking for you.

311
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,958

313
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:08,771
Right.

and gotten pretty close.

316

We learned so much about you today, ma'am.

317
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,351
Why do you watch this stuff?

318
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:22,752
Lastly, I'll ask you a crucial question.

319
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:25,511
As a career woman...

320
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:26,911
- Hello? - and...

321
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,181
a successful female CEO,

322
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:31,023
what drives you...

323
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:36,123
Yes.

324
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,293
That's the information I needed.

325
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:41,293
The connecting link.

326
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:43,932
Can you give me the address?

327
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:50,573
That's not exactly what I mean.

328
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:52,873
Yes.

329
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,859
But some people are there for you when you think it's the end.

330
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:57,442
They could be your family members...

331
00:21:58,212 --> 00:21:59,812
What about what's in your inside pocket?

332
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:01,083
Why won't you show me that?

333
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:10,893
You want to see this?

334
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:23,742
Read this and you end up in the fiery pit as well.

335
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:27,172
Do you know who I saw today?

336
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:29,512
The president.

337
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:35,252
Who the president is...

338
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:37,853
will be my secret.

339
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:41,553
Just know I'm saving your life.

340
00:22:43,823 --> 00:22:46,562
The notes of An Chae Hong who tracked...

341
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:48,262
the president until the very end.

342
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:51,603
The red notebook that the president...

343
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,803
has no idea about...

344
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,002
that contains the president's identity.

345
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:07,852
(Hyemyung Hotel)

346
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,323
(Hyemyung Hotel)

347
00:23:18,393 --> 00:23:20,393
Jang Kyung Ja hid it,

348
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:23,833
and now I will steal it.

349
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:34,043
Hyemyung Hotel.

350
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:37,383
Built in the 1980s, it has a pretty long history.

351
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,613
Jang Kyung Ja's parents were VIP clients.

352
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:43,282
After her parents' business flopped and they died,

353
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:45,952
she did all she could to hang onto this hotel's membership.

354
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,961
That's because the VIPs get access...

355
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:50,662
to the hotel's special vault level.

356
00:23:57,033 --> 00:24:00,732
Recently, at Greendale Hotel,

357
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,272
- tooth... - Toilet brush.

358
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:06,613
With the toilet brush...

359
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:09,182
The cup.

360
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:13,181
The cups. You saw the news about the cleaners...

361
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:16,383
who used that to wash the cups, didn't you?

362
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:20,053
Yes, but that would never happen at our hotel.

363
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:22,422
I heard you have mice.

364
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,563
We had what? Where?

365
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,593
It was... Where was it?

366
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,563
- The parking lot? - Basement level five.

367
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:34,501
Basement level five is where our vaults are.

368
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:37,043
Yes, there. Right there,

369
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:40,142
was it a cockroach or a mouse?

370
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:41,812
Was it a lug worm or...

371
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,012
Ma'am.

372
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:48,181
We never received any such complaints.

373
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:50,452
We disinfect and sanitize against vermin thoroughly.

374
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,922
Do you keep them in the hotel, then?

375
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:55,623
As pets?

376
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:58,523
Why would you say something like that?

377
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:01,093
I must see for myself.

378
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:04,103
Okay. Go ahead.

379
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:08,201
You must go through security here...

380
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,242
to take the exclusive elevator to the vault level.

381
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,842
I'll help you.

382
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:15,712
Can I see your ID?

383
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:19,682
(Civil Servant ID)

384
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,252
Thank you so much for attending the sudden interview.

385
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:29,022
Why apply as a contract worker...

386
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:31,921
with your background and experience?

387
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:34,362
I was actually looking for contract work.

388
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:36,662
I plan to move abroad again.

389
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:38,502
Okay.

390
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:43,102
Oh, you worked in Spain's DAP Hotel for a long time.

391
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:47,242
You must know Nicki Pojo, then.

392
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:51,982
I'm sorry.

393
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,382
Can you not ask personal questions...

394
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:58,221
and stick to work-related ones?

395
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:01,053
We broke up not long ago.

396
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:03,692
Nicki is a guy.

397
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,002
My apologies.

398
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,701
Apology accepted.

399
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:15,803
We don't have any kind of bias or prejudice.

400
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:18,773
- Not at all. Right? - Right.

401
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:20,873
Then...

402
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:24,482
Here are security's movements and the staff schedules.

403
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:26,612
I'll check the power distribution boards and wiring...

404
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:28,012
and test them.

405
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:35,692
As you can see, there's no way pests can get in.

406
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:41,133
The president's identity...

407
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:43,902
is in there.

408
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,512
Oh. Up there.

409
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:55,672
A mongoose could get through that.

410
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,842
Ma'am, you saw for yourself...

411
00:26:58,843 --> 00:27:00,951
how hard it is to get inside.

412
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,112
The two-factor authentication,

413
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:04,783
not to mention the OTP password you need to get in...

414
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,393
A mongoose?

415
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:09,492
How could something like that get in?

416
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:14,962
Then let's see if you're right.

417
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:30,012
What's this?

418
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:37,482
The vault level isn't completely airtight.

419
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,822
- How come... - If the smoke got in,

420
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:41,552
I bet pests can too.

421
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:42,863
How could this be?

422
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,562
Ma'am. It's not usually like this.

423
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:47,762
Of course it'll leak.

424
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,961
That fan room isn't a fan room.

425
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,303
The exhaust pipes are fake.

426
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:57,442
The digitized the vaults in the early 2000s.

427
00:27:57,702 --> 00:28:00,542
They added a sensor here and a cooling system here,

428
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:02,472
which meant they needed more space.

429
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:05,981
This section, the wall by the fan room...

430
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:07,553
is as thin as a fake wall.

431
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:09,782
If we can get into the fan room...

432
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:10,853
"Fan room."

433
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,093
"Pan room?"

434
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,422
"Fan."

435
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:17,792
"Fan room."

436
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,232
Whatever.

437
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:21,491
Get me into the fan room...

438
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,931
and I can get you into the vault.

439
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,802
(Work in Progress, Staff Only)

440
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:29,402
You actually have to make it pest-proof?

441
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:34,543
Oh, then shall we say we're fixing the vault level's vent?

442
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:38,442
No, we can't do that.

443
00:28:38,942 --> 00:28:41,812
Oh, do you remember the smoke from before?

444
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:44,721
It could leak outside.

445
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:46,652
Of course, it's not harmful to humans.

446
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:50,722
Darn it.

447
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,792
We can't have that.

448
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:54,893
Seriously?

449
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:58,701
There are sensors inside the vault that I mentioned before.

450
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:01,133
They go off if more than one person enters.

451
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:04,201
They go off if they sense unnecessary tremors.

452
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:05,573
I'll only clear a path,

453
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:08,373
then break through the last wall on D-day.

454
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:11,512
That means only I can go in and only I can break in.

455
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:12,783
My two assistants?

456
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:37,742
Security cameras?

457
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:40,411
Twelve in the lobby,

458
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,313
above ground, there are 132, and 56 underground.

459
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:46,029
The Security Office is on the fourth floor.

460
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:47,211
If I work all night,

461
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:50,083
in 48 hours, I can make you copies to replace the footage with.

462
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:52,383
It's easier for the quieter vault level.

463
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:55,793
They don't film inside the vault for privacy reasons.

464
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,221
Even if we get inside, to open Jang Kyung Ja's vault,

465
00:29:58,222 --> 00:29:59,661
we need her OTP code.

466
00:29:59,662 --> 00:30:00,962
That's the problem.

467
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:04,032
We must either access her Wi-Fi account...

468
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:05,402
or get into her phone.

469
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:08,972
Who here could do that?

470
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:17,143
We're not that close.

471
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,783
Jay passed me the cash.

472
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:21,813
I'll do it.

473
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,553
How? With what excuse?

474
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,593
I'm a suspended lawyer...

475
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,393
because of you, Ro Um.

476
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:40,833
Okay, then. Han Moo Young can do his part as himself.

477
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:44,002
On December 9, a week from now,

478
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,972

481
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,463
Will you go to the studio apartment?

482
00:31:01,323 --> 00:31:02,652
Where's my revolver?

483
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:04,162
What do you need it for?

484
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,033
What else would I need it for?

485
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:12,603
Naturally, I would want to kill the person.

486
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:17,442
But not everyone does what they would like to.

487
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,241
Because they're incapable of it.

488
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:20,712
Because it's not worth it.

489
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:24,613
It's not worth risking your life on people like that.

490
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:27,252
The premise is wrong.

491
00:31:27,383 --> 00:31:29,113
Not all lives are worthwhile.

492
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,053
Is your life not even worth that much?

493
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,593
That's right. What do you expect? I know what I did.

494
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:39,762
I will never ask to be forgiven as someone who has harmed others.

495
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,191
So I expect those who ruined me...

496
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,103
to have at least that much of a conscience.

497
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:47,972

You're okay in the lounge, right?

516

Or would you prefer somewhere more private?

00:34:45,443 --> 00:34:48,012
you were suspended because of her.

547
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,083
I was curious as to why you'd want to meet me.

548
00:34:51,153 --> 00:34:53,592
The suspension will end if I just wait it out.

549
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:58,623
There were some questions I wanted to ask you in person.

550
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:01,833
There are things I can answer?

551
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:04,532
There are questions that only you can answer.

552
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:06,472
For example...

553
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,802
About Director An Chae Hong.

554
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:11,972
And the truth about Jeokmok.

555
00:35:15,273 --> 00:35:17,083
So you're still hung up on it.

556
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:20,083
Seeing how you're still curious about stuff like that.

557
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:23,853
How much do you know about Ro Um?

558
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:25,483
Not much.

559
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:29,293
All I know is that she received a scholarship from the foundation.

560
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:31,923
The two of you have a lot in common.

561
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:35,233
You both lost your families on the same day in 2012...

562
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,403
and were accused of it.

563
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:38,903
The only difference is that...

564
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:41,571
Ro Um has been acquitted,

565
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,643
whereas the suspicion is still following you around.

566
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:48,043
Is that why you're here?

567
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,012
You want to know if I really killed my husband?

568
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:53,313
No.

569
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,952
What I want to know is who killed him.

570
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,693
Do you know who the president is?

571
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:07,563
"President?"

572
00:36:07,893 --> 00:36:09,902
Ye Chung Sik was arrested for the murder in Geumseong.

573
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:11,003
Before he died,

574
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:14,373
he told me about the real power behind Jeokmok.

575
00:36:15,432 --> 00:36:17,472
He said the president was behind...

576
00:36:17,702 --> 00:36:19,043
the murder in Geumseong.

577
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:22,673
Do you know the president?

578
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:28,042
Who is this "president" you're talking about?

579
00:36:29,882 --> 00:36:32,322
He said the president was the hidden leader of Jeokmok.

580
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:34,492
Your husband never told you?

581
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,193
This is my first time hearing about this "president."

582
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,333
I believe that the president...

583
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:42,963
had something to do with your husband's death too.

584
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,273
What if it gets disconnected?

585
00:36:57,643 --> 00:36:58,943
Then we'll have to start over.

586
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,682
With this button.

587
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:07,322
Okay.

588
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:08,753
What about when we're done?

589
00:37:08,754 --> 00:37:10,562
I'll set it up so it vibrates when we're done.

590
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:11,592
Don't worry.

591
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:15,782
You don't even have the person's name.

592
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,032
With a mere nickname,

593
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:21,673
you want to tackle a case from ten years ago and turn the tables?

594
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:23,993
I'd say that's reckless. Wouldn't you agree?

595
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,813
I figured you'd want to uncover...

596
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,213
the truth behind your husband's death.

597
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:32,643
Me?

598
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:33,912
I watched the show.

599
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:37,083
You talked as though you'd do anything for those you love.

600
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:41,222
Please sit. I believe...

601
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:45,793
that you will tell me the truth about Jeokmok.

602
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:50,963
If I tell you, then what?

603
00:37:52,963 --> 00:37:54,132
Will you keep it to yourself?

604
00:37:55,503 --> 00:37:57,423
If you need an attorney, you got one right here.

605
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:17,023
To me, Jeokmok was just where my husband worked.

606
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:20,463
I didn't really know what was going on within the organization.

607
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,931
After my husband died like that,

608
00:38:22,932 --> 00:38:24,502
I had to recover the losses from the embezzlement,

609
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,833
and the foundation got disbanded.

610
00:38:26,362 --> 00:38:28,682
But I never heard anything about this so-called president.

611
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:31,702
That's all I know. I'm sorry.

612
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:35,972
So you had no idea what was going on inside the organization...

613
00:38:36,412 --> 00:38:40,353
and just thought it was an ordinary scholarship foundation?

614
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,282
Why? Did Lee Ro Um say something to you?

615
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:48,491
A scholarship foundation...

616
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,423
that didn't let its students see their families for ten years.

617
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,431
That's not normal. Don't you agree?

618
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,132
Why would you blame it on the foundation?

619
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:58,603
It was probably her own decision. That's what I think.

620
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:02,873
To kids like Ro Um, family means nothing.

621
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:06,813
You said you didn't know much about Ro Um.

622
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:09,842
There are things you can tell by just looking at someone.

623
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:12,242
Even as a kid, she acted like she knew everything.

624
00:39:12,282 --> 00:39:14,812
I think that smart brain of hers is a curse,

625
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,282
knowing how she ended up.

626
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:22,152
Now, I understand why not a single adult in Jeokmok...

627
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:25,361
intervened and spoke out...

628
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,602
for the scholarship recipients.

629
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:28,562
A mature adult...

630
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:30,323
would never berate a teenage girl like that.

631
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,654
People change as they grow up and throughout their lives.

632
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,071
I'd never be prejudiced against a young girl...

633
00:39:38,072 --> 00:39:40,043
whom I barely know.

634
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:43,882
And I'd feel guilty about blurting it out like that.

635
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,123
That must be it, your illness.

636
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:54,123
Hyper-empathy syndrome?

637
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:57,222
I heard you couldn't walk past pitiful people.

638
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:59,662
And that's why you helped Ro Um.

639
00:40:01,492 --> 00:40:03,252
I see that you did a background check on me.

640
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:05,632
Of course, I did.

641
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:07,532
I'm selective with who I meet.

642
00:40:07,932 --> 00:40:10,172
I told you to come see me because I thought it'd be fun.

643
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:18,583
Your phone's buzzing.

644
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,753
You should answer it. It's fine.

645
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:35,563
My car keys were stuck.

646
00:40:42,802 --> 00:40:44,471
I took up too much of your time.

647
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:46,342
I apologize. I'll get going.

648
00:40:53,813 --> 00:40:56,182
And just so you know, I don't help everyone.

649
00:40:57,023 --> 00:41:00,052
I sympathize with those who deserve my sympathy.

650
00:41:03,322 --> 00:41:04,563
Mr. Han.

651
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,603
Don't be so rude.

652
00:41:33,253 --> 00:41:35,423
You should say hi to Mr. Park Cue for me.

653
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:38,862
Do you know Mr. Park?

654
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:42,492
Didn't you know? We played golf together.

655
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,173
He seemed to adore you.

656
00:41:50,443 --> 00:41:53,673
He knew to care for his people in this cold world.

657
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,242
We should meet again.

658
00:41:57,043 --> 00:41:59,983
When your suspension ends.

659
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:02,412
Sure.

660
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:13,762
Feel free to call me whenever.

661
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:17,563
I'd love to see you more often.

662
00:42:49,432 --> 00:42:50,463
Hi...

663
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:53,572
(Park and Cue Law Firm)

664
00:43:00,373 --> 00:43:01,943
Did you talk to Jang Kyung Ja about me?

665
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:03,742
What?

666
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:07,182
The CEO of Navis Well-being. How do you know her?

667
00:43:07,882 --> 00:43:11,052
We played golf together a few times and got acquainted.

668
00:43:13,182 --> 00:43:15,492
She's pretty nice.

669
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,722
Did you tell her about me?

670
00:43:18,123 --> 00:43:19,722
A couple of things about you.

671
00:43:20,362 --> 00:43:22,192
You've gone through a lot of things.

672
00:43:22,193 --> 00:43:24,732
So, I told her some things...

673
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:26,403
about my employees.

674
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,242
Never do that again.

675
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:32,153
And don't get involved with her.

676
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:58,762
(Attorney Han Moo Young)

677
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:03,972
What?

678
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:06,403
Where are you? At the studio?

679
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,072
Have you eaten?

680
00:44:13,143 --> 00:44:15,083
- No. - Do you want to eat ramyeon?

681
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:17,182
I'll come to your place.

682
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:20,083
No, I'll come.

683
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:22,592
Okay, then.

684
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:40,125
Why?

685
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:44,065
I'm worried that you'll ask me questions after ramyeon again.

686
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:46,093
Have I done that before?

687
00:44:46,094 --> 00:44:47,165
You never missed a chance.

688
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:49,904
Eat up. I won't ask you anything.

689
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:09,154
Aren't you going to ask me?

690
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:11,653
I wasn't going to ask you questions.

691
00:45:11,654 --> 00:45:13,125
I just wanted to cook for you.

692
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,705
What's the cause of your syndrome?

693
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:28,344
- My syndrome? - Yes.

694
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:31,244
I was wondering if you bumped your head when you were little.

695
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:34,884
No, it's just...

696
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:38,054
that I've been sensitive since I was a child.

697
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:41,334
When I was in the military, I was a judicial officer.

698
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:44,495
They let you serve as an officer when you pass the bar exam.

699
00:45:46,225 --> 00:45:48,385
I realized that it was worse than I thought back then.

700
00:45:51,035 --> 00:45:53,495
I didn't know you'd ask me questions too.

701
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:01,375
I know that you didn't ask,

702
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:03,745
but I became a lawyer for one reason.

703
00:46:04,214 --> 00:46:07,444
Because I met a wise adult who gave me hope while I was weak.

704
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:16,754
If only one of them had been there for you...

705
00:46:18,455 --> 00:46:20,194
that day,

706
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,795
things could have been different.

707
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:25,895
I sometimes think that.

708
00:46:27,504 --> 00:46:30,475
But you only blame yourself rather than the environment.

709
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:32,674
That's what bothers me.

710
00:46:35,674 --> 00:46:39,045
And that's why I can't give you the revolver back.

711
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:42,415
I promised to help you with your revenge,

712
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:45,214
but I believe that there's a better ending.

713
00:46:48,785 --> 00:46:50,254
What's your better ending?

714
00:46:53,254 --> 00:46:54,795
Punishing the president...

715
00:46:56,924 --> 00:46:58,835
by law, not with your own hands...

716
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:00,634
so that it's public and safe.

717
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:03,634
That's as much as a mere attorney can go,

718
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:07,404
and that's what will keep your life safe.

719
00:47:18,054 --> 00:47:19,685
It's certainly an illness.

720
00:47:21,185 --> 00:47:24,424
You have such a syndrome because you're too nice.

721
00:47:25,955 --> 00:47:27,725
Sometimes, just look away when you can.

722
00:47:28,924 --> 00:47:31,194
What you do won't make this world any better.

723
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:45,545
I'm not nice.

724
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:47,884
Nor am I that ethical.

725
00:47:49,045 --> 00:47:50,685
You don't know me that well.

726
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:52,855
Plus,

727
00:47:53,754 --> 00:47:56,824
I'm way past looking away, thanks to you.

728
00:47:58,295 --> 00:47:59,795
I've never told you this before,

729
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:02,725
but my symptoms have lessened since I met you.

730
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:07,335
You're taking advantage of me?

731
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:10,304
That's not...

732
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:12,705
Do take advantage of me. What's the harm?

733
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:14,975
I'm also taking advantage of you.

734
00:49:03,585 --> 00:49:04,625
This is fun.

735
00:49:09,524 --> 00:49:12,234
A clever girl like you must know...

736
00:49:12,864 --> 00:49:15,434
about the theory that all people are...

737
00:49:15,435 --> 00:49:17,774
six or fewer connections away from each other.

738
00:49:18,404 --> 00:49:20,204
I know you,

739
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:22,843
I know Attorney Han Moo Young through you,

740
00:49:22,844 --> 00:49:25,074
he knows Mr. Na Su Ho,

741
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:28,145
and I'm Mr. Na's probation officer.

742
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:30,815
But you know what?

743
00:49:31,415 --> 00:49:33,454
I, who knows Na Su Ho, who knows Han Moo Young,

744
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:36,054
who knows Lee Ro Um, who knows me,

745
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:39,794
am here to talk to a hacker who runs a comic book store,

746
00:49:39,795 --> 00:49:41,765
and I ran into you.

747
00:49:45,364 --> 00:49:49,404
Now, that hacker turns out to be one of your acquaintances.

748
00:49:50,535 --> 00:49:53,475
I know that Korea is a small country,

749
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:57,375
but we are, in fact, six or fewer connections away.

750
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,465
And we have one extra connection remaining.

751
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:04,114
What will be your relationship?

752
00:50:04,855 --> 00:50:07,054
Friends?

753
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,384
Not really. Family?

754
00:50:11,254 --> 00:50:12,995
No, that's not it.

755
00:50:13,725 --> 00:50:15,824
Then,

756
00:50:17,665 --> 00:50:18,694
a prisoner?

757
00:50:20,705 --> 00:50:23,605
That wouldn't be too absurd.

758
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:25,875
Perhaps...

759
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,804
you were scholarship students of the same foundation.

760
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:31,714
Something like that.

761
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:37,654
What are you?

762
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:44,125
Don't you know me?

763
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,324
I'm your probation officer.

764
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:53,165
Call him.

765
00:50:56,004 --> 00:50:57,634
Your lawyer.

766
00:50:58,535 --> 00:50:59,574
Call him.

767
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:40,714
Why am I hiding?

768
00:51:53,554 --> 00:51:54,694
Did you know...

769
00:51:56,024 --> 00:51:57,895
they're all a gang?

770
00:51:58,964 --> 00:52:00,665
Are you with them too?

771
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:05,634
Is it a problem that I know them?

772
00:52:07,475 --> 00:52:08,705
What do you want?

773
00:52:10,304 --> 00:52:12,074
What do you think I want?

774
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,185
My duty as a probation officer...

775
00:52:15,484 --> 00:52:18,915
requires me to observe and protect my charges.

776
00:52:20,214 --> 00:52:21,824
I plan to share...

777
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:24,725
everything I know with my organization.

778
00:52:25,154 --> 00:52:27,565
I will track every movement...

779
00:52:27,824 --> 00:52:30,765
and every breath Ms. Lee makes and takes.

780
00:52:31,134 --> 00:52:32,194
It will start with...

781
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:34,564
what happened...

782
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:37,265
at NASA Auto Shop on November 22.

783
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:44,074
Lawyer dude.

784
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:47,384
Convince me.

785
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,614
Make your case.

786
00:52:51,254 --> 00:52:53,685
Why should I let you off?

787
00:53:09,964 --> 00:53:12,134
How come you're working late in the office?

788
00:53:12,404 --> 00:53:13,804
I'm typing up some stuff.

00:53:24,315 --> 00:53:26,714
I'm typing them up in advance.

794
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:28,424
All of them.

795
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:29,855
What?

(Probation Office)

797
00:53:59,254 --> 00:54:00,355
What are you making?

798
00:54:03,024 --> 00:54:04,054
Can I help?

799
00:54:12,594 --> 00:54:15,665
Do you know why lots of comics have characters called Yo Han?

800
00:54:21,504 --> 00:54:22,545
Do you know why?

801
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:24,874
I'm asking in case you know...

802
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:26,344
since you own a comic book store.

803
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,915
I'd wanted to know since I was a kid.

(Potato snack)

805
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:50,034
Just kill me.

806
00:54:50,035 --> 00:54:51,404
Don't say that.

807
00:54:52,274 --> 00:54:53,503
Let's talk.

808
00:54:53,504 --> 00:54:55,645
Oh, right. You were suspended.

809
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:01,344
I'm not making any progress.

810
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:02,943
I need to shake him...

811
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:04,685
for half a day to work at the hotel.

812
00:55:05,554 --> 00:55:06,654
What a nuisance.

813
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:10,455
My boys are getting IV drips.

814
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:15,424
Can the probation officer really get Ro Um or Na Sa arrested?

815
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:17,295
If he gets an arrest warrant.

816
00:55:18,935 --> 00:55:20,964
He's such a nuisance.

817
00:55:21,304 --> 00:55:22,335
What if...

818
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:25,174
he makes a move on our D-day?

819
00:55:25,674 --> 00:55:27,273
Until now, one of us was bait...

820
00:55:27,274 --> 00:55:29,375
while the rest could get some work done.

821
00:55:29,844 --> 00:55:31,674
That day, we must all get together.

822
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:35,515
Can you look into Ko Yo Han for me?

823
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:37,685
What for?

00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:29,105
They're all hiding.

827
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:32,504
I was about to head to the studio apartment.

828
00:56:33,274 --> 00:56:34,474
Will they not be there either?

829
00:56:35,274 --> 00:56:37,645
No. I'm the only one left.

830
00:56:40,174 --> 00:56:41,444
Come and see me.

831
00:56:54,154 --> 00:56:55,194
Welcome.

832
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:57,194
Mr. Han.

833
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:01,565
Take a seat.

834
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:03,335
What are you up to?

835
00:57:03,804 --> 00:57:05,205
You told me to make my case.

836
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:08,444
So I will.

837
00:57:21,185 --> 00:57:22,955

I'm set.

Let's do this!

00:58:28,185 --> 00:58:29,185
Begin.

(Delightfully Deceitful)

844
00:58:56,444 --> 00:58:57,585
Spit it out.

845
00:58:57,815 --> 00:58:59,254
We have to start over.

846
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:01,754
How far out is Jang Kyung Ja?

847
00:59:02,324 --> 00:59:03,524
Mr. Han?

848
00:59:04,495 --> 00:59:07,495
The Jeokmok scholarship students. You selected them, Mother?

849
00:59:08,165 --> 00:59:09,995
They care too much about the result.

850
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:12,094
They're bound to mess up.

851
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:14,964
Find the notebook and get out.

852
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:16,734
Make sure no one gets in.

853
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,535
