1
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:51,813
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:53,083
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,384
(Child actors filmed in safety.)

4
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:56,884
I will make my case.

5
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:07,734
You'll do as I asked?

6
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:11,563
It was An Yoon Sik's death anniversary.

7
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:15,004
The day we had a beer outside the store.

8
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,774
I told you about myself,

9
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:20,404
but you didn't.

10
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:23,374
Other than the few jokey remarks.

11
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,584
Don't you have any friends?

12
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,743
I had one, but he died.

13
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:32,124
He's the reason...

14
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:35,054
you became a probation officer.

15
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:43,594
What does that have to do with this situation?

16
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:45,863
It's related.

17
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:47,904
Because you and I...

18
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:51,774
share the yearning to save people who were...

19
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:54,004
so dreadfully unfortunate.

20
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:56,274
Tell me what you couldn't that day.

21
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:59,543
Then I'll tell you...

22
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,114
the connection you must know...

23
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:04,754
before you go after Lee Ro Um.

24
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:27,103
His family was on benefits,

25
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,373
and his mom served men at a karaoke bar.

26
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:33,144
His father abused her every day and eventually killed her.

27
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:35,653
He first ran away from home in elementary school,

28
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:37,754
went to juvie in his early teens and in his late teens...

29
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:41,754
He was already branded a delinquent.

30
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:45,524
He was released at 20 and worked in construction.

31
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:48,834
He had to work three jobs to pay off his parents' debts.

32
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,203
He dozed off on a site and hurt his back on a rebar.

33
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,504
He had no money for treatment,

34
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:55,874
and his debt ballooned.

35
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:57,874
He signed off the rights to his organs...

36
00:02:57,874 --> 00:02:59,474
and started committing insurance fraud.

37
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:02,944
You know what that is.

38
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:07,284
Jumping out in front of cars to get paid for treatment.

39
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:11,553
He flew ten meters before landing on a guardrail, breaking every bone.

40
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:16,293
I was the only outgoing call on his phone.

41
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:18,923
He'd come to see me a week before he'd died.

42
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:22,263
Not knowing he needed money,

43
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:24,404
I took him to drink with my college friends.

44
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:29,904
All we did was talk about travelling or women.

45
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:38,184
I suffered since I was young because of my famous mother.

46
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,714
Yoon Sik was my only friend.

47
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,423
I was a model student.

48
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,154
I did as my mother said.

49
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:51,624
Until Yoon Sik died.

50
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,594
Once I saw the life he had led,

51
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:56,393
I couldn't go to school as if nothing had happened.

52
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:58,733
I fled life and joined the army,

53
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,303
and there, I decided.

54
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:01,773
What if the unfortunate...

55
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:05,744
were given a choice?

56
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:10,143
What if criminals could be corrected?

57
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,314
I wanted to see that happen.

58
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:17,113
That's it.

59
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:20,083
Now it's your turn.

60
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,154
What is...

61
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:22,853
the connection?

62
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:32,203
Can you not guess?

63
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,073
Just tell me.

64
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:40,573
I'm ready.

65
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,573
I'll hear you out, then decide...

66
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:46,513
if the case you made is any good.

67
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:22,413
(Psychiatrist Mo Jae In)

68
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,624
No, wait.

69
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:29,153
I really don't get it.

70
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:31,823
This is a really great opportunity.

71
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:35,194
Do you honestly think this makes sense?

72
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:39,234
We're about to break into a hotel vault...

73
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,804
that was set aside for the VIP clients.

74
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:44,773
Does it make sense that you want to get in...

75
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:47,004
and take just one notebook?

76
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:50,314
Am I the only one who finds this weird? Am I the only greedy one?

77
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:51,713
- Su Ho. - What?

78
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,944
I told you to focus.

79
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,314
Okay.

80
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,783
I must listen to the boss lady.

81
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:06,924
Yoo Il, Yoo Neung.

82
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:08,934
Do you remember what I said?

83
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:11,734
If you think it's risky or at all dangerous,

84
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:12,934
you two are to run.

85
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,703
Don't try to save me.

86
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,804
I'll save Ro Um too.

87
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:18,773
And I'll save myself too.

88
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:24,814
We have less than an hour left.

89
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:26,684
Will you go over the timeline again?

90
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:30,354
Jang Kyung Ja booked to enter the vault at five sharp.

91
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:32,354
(Jang Kyung Ja)

92
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:35,323
Concierge Office will confirm her identity.

93
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,734
She'll exit the elevator at the vault level.

94
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,044
She'll scan her palm veins and the barcode.

95
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:09,754
An OTP code is sent to her phone in front of the vault.

96
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:12,093
We'll turn her phone into a useless brick...

97
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:13,864
and steal the OTP code.

98
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:15,494
(Input complete)

99
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:16,694
If she can't get in,

100
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:18,763
Jang Kyung Ja will leave immediately.

101
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:21,163
There's no going back in without her phone.

102
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:25,203
Ring Go will cut the emergency hotline to Concierge Office.

103
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,843
Her only solution will be the elevator,

104
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:30,944
but as soon as she gets in, we'll freeze that too.

105
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,384
The next vault booking is 30 minutes later.

106
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,814
Everything must be done by then.

107
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,283
Da Jung.

108
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:42,994
("Navis Well-being to Get 100-million-dollar Investment")

109
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:45,723
The deal's done.

110
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:55,004
She should leave about now.

111
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:00,203
She's headed to the office. What's going on?

112
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:02,874
Turn on the audio.

113
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:04,713
Hold on.

114
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:13,453
(Slide to power off)

115
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,153
(Power off)

116
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,634
Jang Kyung Ja turned her phone off.

117
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:27,463
I'll try connecting to the Wi-Fi network.

118
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,843
Found one. Hold on.

119
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,814
We should prepare enough PR materials in advance.

120
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:43,254
Wouldn't it be best for both companies' sakes?

121
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,754
We have to monitor the investors' reactions too.

122
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:49,424
I must say, celebrity marketing was more effective than anything else.

123
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:50,854
- Ring Go. - Yes?

124
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:55,163
How may I help you?

125
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:56,533
- One moment. - One moment, please.

126
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,694
I need you to translate this.

127
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,763
Just let me know, if there's anything you need.

128
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:03,234
What do you say?

129
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:05,374
I'll keep that in mind.

130
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:07,944
Let's go to the hotel and sign the second contract.

131
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:12,244
We already consulted our advisor regarding the dual contract.

132
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:16,683
Are we getting what we had requested?

133
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:19,954
They're signing their second contract.

134
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:21,954
A dual contract. It'll be signed in Jang Kyung Ja's hotel room.

135
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:24,864
They were talking about a 12kg gold bar.

136
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,023
I guess that's why they booked the vault.

137
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:30,263
What? A 12kg gold bar? Then would it be 900,000 dollars?

138
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:34,634
The problem is that security will be extremely tight.

139
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:37,273
On top of that, they said Mr. Yoon would enter the vault too.

140
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,974
Only one person can enter the vault because of the sensors.

141
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,943
But he could reach the entrance.

142
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,114
Mr. Yoon must have a cell phone too.

143
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:46,214
What if he uses it to contact the hotel?

144
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:52,454
He'll have to take the elevator if he can't reach the front desk.

145
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:55,053
What if he calls the bodyguards?

146
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,854
It doesn't matter because we'll stop the elevator anyway, right?

147
00:09:57,854 --> 00:10:00,423
So you want Ring Go to stay in front of the power distribution board?

148
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:02,364
What does that change?

149
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:04,094
Ring Go is in greater danger now.

150
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:06,803
Gosh, that's enough. It's fine.

151
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,303
I got this.

152
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,334
I'll give this a shot.

153
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:13,043
I don't know how many bodyguards are here, but they don't know my face.

154
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:15,074
I'll only have to hold out for a few minutes.

155
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,344
I know you guys got this.

156
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,714
Don't worry, okay?

157
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:25,153
Ro Um, are you sure you want to push ahead with this?

158
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,584
Stop making such a fuss.

159
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:30,393
All's fine if you and Na Sa get your jobs done in a timely manner.

160
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:35,494
I've arrived at the hotel.

161
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,163
Everything's good, right?

162
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,244
Can you hear me?

163
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:47,943
What happened with Ko Yo Han?

164
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:49,344
The talk went well.

165
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:52,413
I'll head over to the van now.

166
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:56,053
Wait!

167
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,653
Jang Kyung Ja's phone turned on, and updates are being installed.

168
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:05,023
The update will render the program useless.

169
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:06,393
The phone will be like a useless brick.

170
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:08,494
What? Can't we stop it?

171
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,604
After reboot, it takes a while to get access.

172
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,734
The update is almost complete.

173
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,033
So what's the conclusion?

174
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:18,173
We have to start over.

175
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:22,714
What Mr. Han did. We have to do it all over again...

176
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,374
to regain access to Jang Kyung Ja's phone.

177
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,783
Darn it. Are you kidding me?

178
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:29,754
We can't do this today. Let's pick another day.

179
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,454
How far out is Jang Kyung Ja?

180
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:02,153
Please leave.

181
00:12:05,053 --> 00:12:06,384
Please leave.

182
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:09,454
Who are you?

183
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:12,094
Do you know me?

184
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:13,923
Please leave at once.

185
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,393
Yo Han.

186
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:27,744
Yo Han?

187
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:30,374
You must be her son.

188
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:32,413
Now, you know. So leave at once.

189
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:36,214
I need a one-on-one with my mother.

190
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:37,783
If it's not urgent...

191
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:40,624
Have you ever seen me setting foot in this house in the past ten years?

192
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,023
If it's not urgent, then what?

193
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:45,193
Must I make an appointment to see you, Professor?

194
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,604
(Hyemyung Hotel)

195
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,084
This way.

196
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,153
Okay.

197
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:25,763
This way, please.

198
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,143
Ms. Jang.

199
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,643
(Hyemyung Hotel)

200
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:40,584
Mr. Han Moo Young?

201
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:43,254
Hello.

202
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:48,393
What brings you here?

203
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,854
I had to take care of something.

204
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:52,824
What a coincidence.

205
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:56,693
Are you here because of Ro Um too?

206
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:06,303
I can't stall her for as long as I did the last time.

207
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,903
Is there a quicker way?

208
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,413
We could send a text message.

209
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:12,513
But we'll need Jang Kyung Ja to open the link.

210
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:20,484
Care to elaborate?

211
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,693
What does Lee Ro Um have to do with this hotel?

212
00:14:24,494 --> 00:14:26,023
She said...

213
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:29,693
she'd tell me the truth behind the murder ten years ago.

214
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,204
She told me that I'd find the real culprit here.

215
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,303
The culprit behind a murder?

216
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:46,683
Was she talking about her parents' death?

217
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:48,884
No.

218
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:51,824
Director An Chae Hong.

219
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:01,793
I just got a text from Ro Um.

220
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:04,063
Did you get one too?

221
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:28,854
(December 9, 2022)

222
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,043
This won't open.

223
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:48,443
Do you see something?

224
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,214
The real culprit behind the murder?

225
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:07,324
Mr. Han Moo Young.

226
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:11,334
(Jung Da Jung: Done.)

227
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:15,334
I can't open it either.

228
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:23,913
I won't keep you.

229
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:26,013
I'll contact you if I find out something.

230
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,224
Make sure he leaves the premises.

231
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:43,193
Don't let him enter again.

232
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:45,763
Is it true?

233
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:47,864
What?

234
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:50,074
The Jeokmok scholarship students.

235
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:51,844
You selected them, Mother?

236
00:16:52,673 --> 00:16:54,574
I heard you were their counsellor. You analysed...

237
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:56,313
their criminal tendencies and submitted your reports.

238
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:57,443
Is it true?

239
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:02,584
I did work for the foundation as their advisor.

240
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:05,384
I heard Lee Ro Um had been assigned to you.

241
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:07,023
Who told you?

242
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:08,624
She was like that as a kid too.

243
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,693
Insensitive and dark.

244
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:13,293
How do you know that?

245
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:15,834
She was on my show once.

246
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:18,803
Everyone called her a prodigy with eidetic memory.

247
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:22,074
Right, you never watch my shows.

248
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:26,643
Back then, I thought she was a dangerous kid.

249
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:30,173
And she killed her own parents in the end.

250
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:32,813
She's been acquitted.

251
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:36,653
The people you manage as a probation officer...

252
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,954
are all criminals. Am I wrong?

253
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:43,293
Just be careful. Don't fall for her.

254
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:47,324
I know you're immensely interested in those in the gutter.

255
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,834
How could you be so shameless?

256
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,364
Watch what you say.

257
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:56,203
You've become rude because you've been spending time with criminals.

258
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,134
Because of your judgement,

259
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:01,243
a few kids were raised to be criminals.

260
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:02,574
Taking your advice,

261
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:04,413
they disciplined the kids using violence...

262
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:07,483
and raised true criminals.

263
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:09,913
Do you still feel nothing?

264
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,084
I told you not to grow attached.

265
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:16,423
I guess you did in the end.

266
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:19,423
Why?

267
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:21,193
Do you pity them?

268
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:39,344
I don't think we can go back to the hotel.

269
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:40,413
I'll go to the van.

270
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:43,614
- No, go home. - Home?

271
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,753
You said you wanted a better ending.

272
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:48,624
That's where that ending is.

273
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:54,223
Da Jung, disconnect Moo Young.

274
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:07,574
What's going on?

275
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,673
What? How long did you think he'd be with us?

276
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,354
(Hyemyung Hotel)

277
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,064
I'm going to the restroom.

278
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,042
You've been confirmed, ma'am.

279
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:51,663
Please follow me.

280
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:10,453
Jang Kyung Ja and Mr. Yoon have passed by the front desk.

281
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:12,124
They'll take the elevator to the vault soon.

282
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:27,433
(VIP Basement Vault)

283
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:31,703
(VIP Basement Vault)

284
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,614
(Concierge Office)

285
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,104
(Recognition complete)

286
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:09,713
Jang Kyung Ja is entering the vault.

287
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:22,324
I got the codes.

288
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,324
Five minutes.

289
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,003
(Hyemyung Hotel, VIP)

290
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:35,003
(There has been an error while running the app.)

291
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,804
(Confirm)

292
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:20,183
Jang Kyung Ja just left. You may enter.

293
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:47,804
(Authorized Personnel Only)

294
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,683
I'm at the panel board.

295
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:02,723
Signal me.

296
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:21,374
Be careful.

297
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:28,443
Call the hotel.

298
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:37,354
Put me through to Concierge Office.

299
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:42,223
Hello?

300
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:48,404
(VIP Basement Vault, Concierge Office)

301
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:06,923
How long?

302
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:08,993
Jang Kyung Ja is in the elevator.

303
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:17,493
I need the OTP!

304
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:29,314
It's unlocked!

305
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:37,513
(VIP Elevator)

306
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,733
(Input complete)

307
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,304
Are you doing it?

308
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:31,074
Be quiet, everyone.

309
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:34,003
They were the gifted...

310
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:35,814
born in the gutter.

311
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:39,384
Having far too high IQ means...

312
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:41,013
that you're different from others.

313
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:42,884
Being different from others means...

314
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:45,554
that you cannot live in an average environment.

315
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,854
And if your family is underprivileged,

316
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:50,294
you're naturally unstable.

317
00:25:51,723 --> 00:25:53,594
I merely analysed those signs.

318
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:57,134
They weren't capable of normal thinking in the first place.

319
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:59,503
I didn't make them that way.

320
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,904
They were already like that, and I simply analysed them.

321
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:05,604
(December 9, 2022)

322
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:07,604
No.

323
00:26:07,604 --> 00:26:08,773
(December 9, 2022)

324
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:12,584
Ring Go!

325
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:17,614
Jay.

326
00:26:24,723 --> 00:26:25,723
Shoot.

327
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:30,733
Spare my life.

328
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:35,564
Jay, please...

329
00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:45,773
Wait.

330
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:47,544
Please spare...

331
00:26:47,544 --> 00:26:49,513
Spare my life... Jay...

332
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:52,013
Please.

333
00:26:58,794 --> 00:26:59,824
Jay.

334
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,233
Jay. Spare my life.

335
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:12,134
Spare my life. Jay, please.

336
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:13,804
Jay.

337
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:19,013
Open the door. Jay.

338
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:35,993
Hae Dong. Do you hear me?

339
00:27:58,384 --> 00:27:59,423
No.

340
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:10,594
Ring Go.

341
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:14,564
A group of ticking time bombs.

342
00:28:14,763 --> 00:28:16,233
Of course nothing worked out.

343
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:19,243
Jay's here.

344
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:22,973
He locked Hae Dong up. Do something.

345
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:26,483
Na Sa, are you not done yet?

346
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,154
Did something happen to Ring Go?

347
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:40,624
Can I go inside?

348
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:43,163
Na Su Ho, report to me.

349
00:28:56,913 --> 00:28:57,913
Na Su Ho!

350
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:00,483
Darn it.

351
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:16,693
They're reckless...

352
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:19,404
and care too much about the result.

353
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:23,134
They're bound to mess up.

354
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:24,334
Lee Ro Um!

355
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:25,773
Answer me, Na Su Ho.

356
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:27,904
Do you have the notebook?

357
00:29:31,374 --> 00:29:32,884
(VIP Elevator)

358
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:37,683
Yes.

359
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:39,923
It's here.

360
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:47,064
What are you doing?

361
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:49,993
Ro Um.

362
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,733
I did some research.

363
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:55,663
You can't use the revolver against me.

364
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,433
What will it prove?

365
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:03,943
Gosh.

366
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:06,983
What? I have a slave mentality?

367
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:08,284
Na Su Ho.

368
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:11,453
Say that again. I dare you.

369
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:14,124
Say it again, Ro Um.

370
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:15,824
Am I still a pushover?

371
00:30:17,624 --> 00:30:19,993
Find the notebook and get out.

372
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:23,094
You'll be in danger too if you stall.

00:30:25,864 --> 00:30:29,433

The notebook.

389
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:50,884

391

Get it out yourself.

392
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,634
Will you shoot me?

393
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,374
Go ahead.

394
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:13,243

- Lee Ro Um. - It was a gunshot, right?

403
00:32:42,104 --> 00:32:43,534
I think we should back out.

405
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:47,943

00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:55,213
Okay.

409
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:59,384
I need you to get Ring Go.

410
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:01,084
Staircase B will be the quickest.

411
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:02,124
Okay.

412
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,364
There are lots of ordinary people.

415
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:11,963
I'll get him and regroup with Yoo Il.

416

I'll be in touch.

00:33:37,794 --> 00:33:39,124
Are you insane?

424

We'll head to a nearby university hospital.

425

Okay, I'll move too.

426

Did you come for this?

428
00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:20,123
Sorry.

429

In the underground parking level. And outside.

534
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:54,183
Do you believe that this is the right thing to do?

542
00:43:18,174 --> 00:43:20,643
I'll be the one fighting alongside her...

543
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:23,853
if she ever falls into a muddy swamp.

544
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:29,223
What's the right thing to do? Keeping someone out of the mud?

545
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:30,694
Or going in there with the person?

546
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:34,424
Keeping them out...

547
00:43:34,623 --> 00:43:36,163
or playing in there with them.

548
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:37,933
Pick one.

549
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:41,964

550
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:45,304
Like the Boryeong Mud Festival?

551
00:43:46,273 --> 00:43:47,404
If you are close...

552
00:44:17,473 --> 00:44:20,373
(General Ward A)

553
00:44:22,003 --> 00:44:23,074
Mr. Han.

554
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:24,844
What happened to everyone?

555
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:27,984
Where is Ro Um?

556
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:31,484
I heard a gunshot.

557
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:35,424
Then I heard Na Sa scream.

558
00:44:36,484 --> 00:44:39,023
I don't know what happened after that. Ring Go is badly hurt.

559
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:42,223
- Does that mean Ro Um... - Did she shoot Na Sa?

560
00:44:43,123 --> 00:44:44,134
Probably.

561
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,103
Once something becomes useless, she ruthlessly ditches it.

562
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:50,734
There's a flash drive.

563
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:53,473
On the flash drive,

564
00:44:55,174 --> 00:44:56,344
I found a file.

565
00:45:01,384 --> 00:45:02,543
Please leave.

566
00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:04,614
Da Jung.

567
00:45:10,154 --> 00:45:12,154
You still have no idea.

568
00:45:14,393 --> 00:45:16,764
Ro Um can betray us. I get it.

569
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:18,833
We betrayed her first, after all.

570
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,304
She can use us. We deserve it.

571
00:45:23,364 --> 00:45:24,904
But that's not the case for you.

572
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:28,873
She doesn't need a reason to deceive others.

573
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:30,973
You must remember that.

574
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:33,884
She and the president have a lot in common.

575
00:45:34,143 --> 00:45:36,744
The president knows that too. Hence the obsession with her.

576
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:39,714
When she has goals to achieve,

577
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:42,054
she can use others.

578
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:44,494
How much do you know?

579
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,734
How much of it was planned in advance?

580
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,634
When did you start planning for it?

581
00:45:57,534 --> 00:45:58,703
Did you guys do it?

582
00:46:00,203 --> 00:46:02,404
The fraud case at the factory of Moyang Foods in 2007.

583
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:05,844
Was that your doing?

584
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:12,413
Yes, it was.

585
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:17,353
It wasn't even one of the big ones we'd done.

586
00:46:18,054 --> 00:46:21,964
We were aware that the incident shattered your family.

587
00:46:21,964 --> 00:46:22,994
Ro Um and I both knew.

588
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:25,534
So...

589
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:29,464
stop getting involved with us, and go.

590
00:47:28,523 --> 00:47:30,264
- Is that you, Ro Um? - Ro Um.

591
00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:39,773
Hang in there!

592
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:07,134
Are you a prodigy with eidetic memory?

593
00:48:08,364 --> 00:48:10,333
But you seem to keep forgetting...

594
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:12,734
how you failed.

595
00:48:16,904 --> 00:48:20,813
What should I do to get you out of my life?

596
00:48:23,244 --> 00:48:24,683
I gave you a chance.

597
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:30,453
You should have let me go when I asked to leave.

598
00:48:32,654 --> 00:48:35,793
Why should everything in this world go as you want?

599
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:38,163
Why on earth? Who do you think you are?

600
00:48:39,764 --> 00:48:41,264
When you blackmail me,

601
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:44,933
am I supposed to bring you a bag as you want?

602
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:47,603
What makes you think it's fair to have it your way?

603
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:51,473
Did you think that everything in this world would go...

604
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:53,984
as the plan you made with that insignificant brain of yours?

605
00:48:54,543 --> 00:48:56,844
As if you were a higher being making every decision for us?

606
00:49:03,994 --> 00:49:05,853
That's why you can't win.

607
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:09,793
Because of your arrogance.

608
00:49:10,663 --> 00:49:13,793
Because of that rash judgement of a 19-year-old girl who thought...

609
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:17,264
she could have three adults wrapped around her finger.

610
00:49:17,804 --> 00:49:19,203
Because of that stupidity...

611
00:49:19,804 --> 00:49:23,244
that made you believe you could still make everything work...

612
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:25,043
as planned even after a decade.

613
00:49:25,473 --> 00:49:28,214
In reality, you couldn't even handle your group,

614
00:49:28,214 --> 00:49:31,183
so they all left you alone to die.

615
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,753
Still, you got yourself a pretty good lawyer.

616
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:41,994
Or a loyal one, should I say?

617
00:49:47,293 --> 00:49:48,364
Do you want to call him?

618
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:51,074
Maybe he'll come to save you.

619
00:49:57,944 --> 00:49:59,344
Still too proud.

620
00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:02,784
You never learned ten years ago.

621
00:50:03,984 --> 00:50:05,784
You can't do this by yourself.

622
00:50:07,683 --> 00:50:09,054
Give me some time.

623
00:50:11,753 --> 00:50:13,623
After I tear you into pieces,

624
00:50:15,924 --> 00:50:17,994
I'll chew up the president myself.

625
00:50:19,793 --> 00:50:23,833
I'll help you realize that you're a mere plaything.

626
00:50:27,543 --> 00:50:29,003
Just like we were.

627
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:32,074
"We?"

628
00:50:35,384 --> 00:50:38,714
Who's here other than you?

629
00:50:52,563 --> 00:50:53,734
You see,

630
00:50:55,534 --> 00:50:57,003
you're right.

631
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:59,674
Maybe they'll be suspicious of me.

632
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:04,413
But what can they do?

633
00:51:20,054 --> 00:51:21,893
When there isn't even proof?

634
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,844
Welcome home,

635
00:51:43,913 --> 00:51:44,913
Ro Um.

636
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:52,333
Attorney Han!

637
00:55:05,784 --> 00:55:07,154
Attorney Han!

638
00:55:12,023 --> 00:55:16,094
(Ko Yo Han, Probation Officer)

639
00:55:19,634 --> 00:55:21,833
The person you reached is unavailable.

640
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:24,404
Darn it.

641
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:50,464
Strictly speaking,

642
00:55:51,234 --> 00:55:54,063
Ms. Lee is a perpetrator who created victims.

643
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:57,973
We were aware that the incident shattered your family.

644
00:55:57,973 --> 00:55:58,973
Ro Um and I both knew.

645
00:55:58,973 --> 00:56:00,734
I don't mean to be forgiven, though.

646
00:56:01,143 --> 00:56:02,273
As an assailant.

647
00:56:02,643 --> 00:56:03,643
Use me.

648
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:05,444
Who cares?

649
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,784
I'm using you too.

650
00:56:10,043 --> 00:56:11,654
You said you wanted a better ending.

651
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:14,453
That's where that ending is.

652
00:57:24,594 --> 00:57:25,824
I'm sorry I took so long.

653
00:57:31,893 --> 00:57:33,694
Let's go back home.

654
00:58:19,043 --> 00:58:21,214
(Delightfully Deceitful)

655
00:58:40,293 --> 00:58:42,304
Why are you doing this to me?

656
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:43,964
She'll need time.

657
00:58:44,134 --> 00:58:45,933
She will come back, won't she?

658
00:58:46,134 --> 00:58:47,203
Why are you here?

659
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:49,373
Can't we be a team of our own?

660
00:58:49,543 --> 00:58:50,944
Ro Um will kill me first.

661
00:58:51,043 --> 00:58:52,643
You've been looking after Ro Um.

662
00:58:52,844 --> 00:58:54,014
"Look after?"

663
00:58:54,014 --> 00:58:55,244
She's not a child.

664
00:58:55,714 --> 00:58:57,784
The connection you mentioned, Mr. Han.

665
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,014
I think I found it.

666
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:02,054
I'll start exactly where you left off, Ro Um.

667
00:59:02,183 --> 00:59:04,223
Han Moo Young. Do you trust me?

668
00:59:04,523 --> 00:59:05,594
I'll wait.

669
00:59:05,953 --> 00:59:06,994
Come back.
