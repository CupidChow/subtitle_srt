(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,220
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:58,630
Police identified a woman in her 40s who was found dead...

4
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,201
in a temp agency office in Busan.

5
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,771
It was Navis Well-being's CEO Jang Kyung Ja...

6
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:06,370
who was wanted for fraud and conspiracy of murder.

7
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,370
With Jang found dead,

8
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,880
police suspect Jang's death was a murder...

9
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
and identified a suspect based on evidence...

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,181
found at the scene, as well as witness statements.

11
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:19,520
Lee Ro Um, you are under arrest for Jang Kyung Ja's murder.

12
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,720
Did you kill her?

13
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,839
I want an answer.

14
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:31,299
Jang Kyung Ja.

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,210
Did you kill her, Ms. Lee Ro Um?

16
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,379
(24 hours ago)

17
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,350
We got a report that the suspect...

18
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,619
was seen at Sangjin Hospital an hour ago,

19
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:46,850
and we arrested her.

20
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,089
She had no belongings,

21
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:49,619
and the NFS took her clothes.

22
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,660
What a mess.

23
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,490
The victim's autopsy report?

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,930
We should have it in the morning.

25
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,469
Here's a preliminary report.

26
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,540
Let's leak it to the press it was Lee Ro Um.

27
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,210
Why leak the identity of a suspect...

28
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,850
before we get a warrant?

29
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,880
Who wouldn't give us a warrant for this?

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Prosecutor Kim.

31
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,719
We must use the media to earn some time,

32
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,290
to use as cover if need be.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,889
Be sure to keep it under wraps.

34
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,490
This is no time for trickery.

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,160
What's your priority?

36
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,900
We didn't locate their funds...

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,400
nor catch Navis' CEO.

38
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,529
We should at least let people know...

39
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,440
we have the CEO's killer.

40
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,570
I'll get evidence and statements,

41
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,109
and then an arrest warrant.

42
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,880
Our situation...

43
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,309
and the suspect's identity doesn't change anything.

44
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,689
Lee Ro Um agreed to a late-night interrogation.

45
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,990
She'll come to Interrogation One in 30 minutes.

46
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:56,819
I'll question her myself.

47
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,029
(Case Report)

48
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,770
Does Special Investigations look into murders too?

49
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,270
Because it's the murder of Navis Well-being's CEO.

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,279
You really don't need a lawyer?

51
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:27,689
That's you, isn't it?

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,990
And you have a gun.

53
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,890
You went to see the victim with an illegal firearm...

54
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,330
right around the victim's time of death.

55
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,400
And your prints were found at the scene.

56
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,170
Did you bring a gun to the meeting with the victim?

57
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,010
Was Jang Kyung Ja shot?

58
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,409
Where did you get the gun? Where is it now?

59
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,610
What's her cause of death?

60
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,450
Why did you meet her?

61
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,520
If she wasn't shot, did something I did before kill her?

62
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,920
Arson?

63
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,960
If it wasn't a gunshot or a fire,

64
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,960
how did I beat her in a physical altercation?

65
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,159
She's 10cm taller than me.

66
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,800
Was there a physical altercation?

67
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,430
You took my clothes.

68
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,230
Did you find something on them?

69
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:14,999
They're being tested.

70
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,069
Do you admit to meeting her?

71
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,740
Was I really the only person you caught on camera?

72
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,710
Yes.

73
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,550
You want to put me away, don't you?

74
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,749
What did you talk about?

75
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,219
Why did you bring a gun?

76
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,789
Would that incriminate you?

77
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:38,159
You're not answering.

78
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,099
You agreed to a late-night interrogation.

79
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,300
Didn't that mean you'd cooperate?

80
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:55,309
I can only help you...

81
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,880
until an arrest warrant's issued.

82
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,810
You must know the procedure.

83
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,880
You went through it before.

84
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,549
Tomorrow,

85
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:10,219
I'd like you to start with admitting you met the victim.

86
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:13,929
Put her in a holding cell.

87
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:15,760
Yes, sir.

88
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,890
I don't need it anymore.

89
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,450
She didn't request legal representation.

90
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,820
I know that.

91
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:15,190
She won't cooperate.

92
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,289
She'll end up getting detained.

93
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,229
You only have circumstantial evidence.

94
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,659
Even if it's only circumstantial,

95
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,859
she can be detained if it fits the criteria.

96
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:23,859
You know that.

97
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:26,599
The biggest problem is she has no fixed address and...

98
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:27,830
Because she's a criminal.

99
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,799
As you saw for yourself.

100
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,710
I wouldn't bring in what I saw in a private setting.

101
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,370
I know where to draw the line.

102
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,510
Don't get me all wrong.

103
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,310
Detaining her isn't the only option.

104
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,580
Unless you need to lock up someone for show.

105
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,710
Will you keep this up?

106
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,979
Taking her side?

107
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:44,650
Why did you stop?

108
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:45,950
What do you mean?

109
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,620
Must I tell you how powerless I was,

110
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,729
and how hard I tried despite that?

111
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,529
Must I explain until you understand?

112
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,799
You can't condemn me.

113
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,700
And what? I must lock up someone for show?

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,799
I need evidence to do that.

115
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,099
The Jay guy you told me about?

116
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,210
All I have on him is a payslip from his bodyguard days.

117
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:10,909
Right now, the likeliest suspect...

118
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:13,250
I can see that's within reach whom I can prove guilty...

119
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,049
is Lee Ro Um, not Jay.

120
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:17,620
Is there proof against it?

121
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,890
Bring it to me, then.

122
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,349
Fine.

123
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,520
I'll find you that proof.

124
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,539
- Hello? - Da Jung filled me in.

125
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,109
That Ro Um was arrested.

126
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:40,109
Yes.

127
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:42,940
If you were going to represent her,

128
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,679
I think you should pass.

129
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,679
Why would you say that?

130
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,020
An article will go out tomorrow.

131
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,320
My paper caught on...

132
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,849
that Han Jae Seok is your father.

133
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,460
I tried to stop them,

134
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,859
but I'm powerless. Sorry.

135
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:03,029
I understand.

136
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,969
- Thanks. - Sure.

137
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,770
(Park and Cue Law Firm)

138
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:27,820
Do you regret it?

139
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:29,589
Regret what?

140
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,219
Hiring me.

141
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,859
That's so long ago.

142
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,299
I knew what you were like.

143
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,870
It's already years ago now.

144
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,870
When I came back to campus, some freshman...

145
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:49,239
That female student harassment case.

146
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,909
You took the lead to fight for it, and I thought,

147
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:55,109
"I get he's a law student,"

148
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:57,150
"but how is it that he's taking it so seriously?"

149
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,450
You even shed tears. You lunatic.

150
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:04,390
I was born into a rich family,

151
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,830
so I had no sense of vocation.

152
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,859
I asked my parents to send me to the States so I could study law.

153
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,299
Then I had all the fun until I returned...

154
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,469
and saw that sight.

155
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,770
It was quite awesome.

156
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,439
The strength you had...

157
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,640
felt like a special limited edition.

158
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,250
Something that one couldn't gain even with power or money.

159
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,020
I thought, "Right."

160
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,850
"I'm going to start a law firm as soon as I pass the bar exam."

161
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,319
"That guy could be the conscience of my law firm."

162
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,620
That's how...

163
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,289
I got you on board. Regrets?

164
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,529
I rather cherish you.

165
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,970
I'm just bothered if you weren't happy...

166
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,039
because of me.

167
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,939
You helped me hold out thus far.

168
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,240
Thanks.

169
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:58,340
Right?

170
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,350
An article about my father will be released tomorrow.

171
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,220
My name will be included.

172
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:07,819
Once it's out,

173
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,620
Ye Chung Sik's case will be criticized first.

174
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,590
It will seem like the client was forced down...

175
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,789
so that my father's case could be buried.

176
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,799
They will criticize the company too.

177
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:26,709
I'm telling you in advance this time, so forgive me.

(Letter of Resignation)

179
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,740
What is the truth?

180
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,480
When you accused Ye Chung Sik, did you know about your father?

181
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,520
Is that the truth?

182
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,189
I'm also an attorney who seeks concrete truth.

183
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,319
I have the duty to uphold...

184
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,360
the truth I know. It's not just your job.

185
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:47,659
To give up on my conscience just to avoid...

186
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,799
rumours and false news reports, I'm just so...

187
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,630
- Look. - rich.

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,029
You'll regret this.

189
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,169
Even so.

190
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,439
Hey.

191
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,539
I'm filthy rich.

192
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,949
If anyone tries to pounce on you,

193
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,779
be yourself and fight until the end.

194
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:19,059
I finally got to tell you this.

195
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,760
So that's decided.

196
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:27,199
I at least mean this much to you, don't I?

197
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,669
You do.

198
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,610
Now take this away.

199
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,640
It's giving me gastric juice.

200
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,919
It's the list of Navis's spot benefits...

201
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,189
including gift certificates.

202
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,289
You wanted to divert them all overseas,

203
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,860
so I'll do accordingly.

204
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:52,319
What about the seizure and search on the domestic bank accounts?

205
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,329
We suffered a loss there, but it was an expected amount.

206
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:56,959
The search will stop with Ms. Jang.

207
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,529
They won't be able to track further.

208
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,770
I've prepared two tickets,

209
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,699
and the departure is in a week.

210
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,610
Can you meet the deadline?

211
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,709
As Han Jae Seok turned himself in,

212
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,150
they now have my composite sketch.

213
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,549
- It won't be easy to hide... - I know.

214
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:19,890
What I mean is...

215
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,459
Can you take care of the Kids before you get caught?

216
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,529
You have to get arrested if Lee Ro Um is to be bailed out.

217
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,799
We better hurry.

218
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,699
Things could come out if we act in a rush.

219
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,740
I wish Ro Um has no other choices when she's out.

220
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,039
That's what I want.

221
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,640
Hereby,

222
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:16,480
the court sentences the defendant as follows.

223
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,779
The defendant, Lee Ro Um,

224
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:24,079
is sentenced to 15 years in prison.

237
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,789
Hello?

238
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,600
This morning, the police arrested Han who turned himself...

239
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,500
for being the real culprit of the Geumseong case.

240
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,299
The police are suspected to have attempted...

241
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,909
to close the case at the internal investigation.

242
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,980
And countless assumptions are being made about Han's attorney son.

243

People are paying attention to see if the truth...

244

behind the Geumseong case will be revealed.

It's me, Da Jung.

00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,390
Are you at the comic book place?

248
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,860
Why do you ask?

249
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,770
I have a question.

250
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,870
Where is Ring Go hospitalized?

251
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,770
I'm sorry. I have no hard feelings against you kids,

252
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:40,409
but Ro Um can't seem to focus because of you.

253
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:49,819
Da Jung.

254
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,419
Jay...

255
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,289
is planning to take Ro Um for real this time.

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,529
That's why he put her behind bars.

257
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,529
Once we're taken care of, everything will go as he wants.

What do we do?

259
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,709
We're running out of time.

260
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,279
But I have no way whatsoever to save Ro Um.

261
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,549
I have a way.

262
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,880
I'm going to save her...

263
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,650

271
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,309
Okay.

Yes, Moo Young.

00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:08,769
It's okay.

279
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,669
I've read the article.

280
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:12,810
It got exaggerated too much. Are you all right?

281
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,370
I am.

282
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:16,679
I have a favour to ask of you.

283
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,880
We need a new hospital.

284
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,650
This is about Ring Go's safety.

285
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,919
Do you know any place that can help us?

286
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,350
Yes, my older cousin runs a hospice.

- Mr. Na! - Help!

288
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,719
Gosh!

289
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Get in the van!

290
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,169
What?

291
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,840

292
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,280
They're...

293
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:26,009
I'm dizzy.

294
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,519
What about Ro Um's clothes?

295
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,449
We missed it as it was black, but they detected blood.

296
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:35,390
We sent it for a DNA test.

297
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:37,259
Here are the forensic results.

298
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:43,729
(Autopsy Result)

299
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,330
Let's listen to a recording.

300
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,140
I have a huge bomb that can expose everything.

301
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,169
I'm going to cut a deal with you.

302
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:57,040
The investment briefing...

303
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,310
where Navis Well-being's network was hacked...

304
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,110
and the files exposing...

305
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,709
the stock price manipulation by Ma Kang Soo.

306
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,850
This is the call between you and the victim that day.

307
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,949
You have a good memory,

308
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,419
so I'm sure you remember what you said.

309
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:11,019
The stock manipulation exposure.

310
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,959
Did you do it?

311
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:16,659
Did you do it alone, or were there accomplices?

312
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,929
Even if I had done it,

313
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,530
that exposure unveiled Navis Well-being's fraud,

314
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,939
and you were promoted to the leader of Special Investigations, right?

315
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,840
Is that so?

316
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,610
Were you the one who made me the head of the team?

317
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,979
Putting aside the violation of information network law,

318
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,150
this file tells us a few things.

319
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,380
That you and Jang Kyung Ja didn't get along.

320
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,850
That's a motive for murder.

321
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,519
Also, it tells me that you're capable...

322
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,459
of hacking into the network system of Navis Well-being.

323
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:48,630
Just like acquiring an unregistered firearm,

324
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,030
it implies that you're capable of crimes.

325
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,560
Also,

326
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:55,429
you asked about the president in the recording.

327
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:56,999
Who's the president?

328
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,540
Why are you acting like you've never heard of it?

329
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,540
I've never heard of it.

330
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,380
Please explain.

331
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,850
The true owner of Navis Well-being.

332
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:11,949
I heard you had been tipped off...

333
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,850
that Jay was the president.

334
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,320
We interrogated 36 people who were involved,

335
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,090
and we imprisoned three of them.

336
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:23,100
They pointed at Jang Kyung Ja as the main culprit,

337
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,199
and the evidence...

338
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:27,370
proves that Jang Kyung Ja is the benefiter of Navis Well-being.

339
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,530
That's why it was safe to say...

340
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,969
that apprehending Jang Kyung Ja was the goal of this investigation.

341
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,780
Before someone murdered her.

342
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:44,780
I understand your claim.

343
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,019
Then, why are you looking for the president?

344
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,189
The president was the leader of the foundation I was once in,

345
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,030
Jeokmok Foundation,

346
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,560
and was the one who turned me into this.

347
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:58,860
Of course, you must've never heard of it.

348
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:02,030
So, you went to talk to the victim to ask about the president...

349
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:03,699
that day.

350
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:12,409
Your phone was found on the scene of the crime.

351
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,179
You looked up drugs...

352
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:15,350
to give to the victim, right?

353
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:18,550
You had a motive and the ability to murder the victim,

354
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,550
and you met her at the estimated time of death...

355
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,719
with a gun, at that.

356
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,219
The victim was drugged by the one you searched,

357
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,090
was unable to resist, and was strangled.

358
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,560
It's plausible even with the size difference.

359
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:29,999
What happened that day?

360
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,469
Do you still lock people up...

361
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:36,900
with only circumstantial evidence?

362
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,269
Do you think this is all I have?

363
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Lawyer.

364
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,479

Don't you know...

368
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,590
that his father is related to the Geumseong case?

369
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,459
Who says so?

370
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:04,530
The articles were out this morning.

371
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,400
That Attorney Han was...

372
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,969
the son of the true culprit of the Geumseong case.

373
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,769
Were you trying to call him, knowing that?

374
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:20,409
People are accusing him...

375
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,979
of releasing Ye Chung Sik's recording...

376
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:25,280
to cover up his father's crime.

377
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,919
Of course, I know that he didn't mean to.

378
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,130
But I'm doing everything I can...

379
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,630
to stop people from knowing that you're arrested.

380
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,999
We're actually trying to protect you.

381
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,459
I'm just letting you know...

382
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,070
that the reporters have their eyes on you.

383
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:55,934
There were three of them, and they had knives.

384
00:23:57,573 --> 00:23:59,033
Are you all right?

385
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:01,144
I'm fine.

386
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:03,273
Su Ho must have been startled.

387
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,083
I'm going to apply for police protection.

388
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:08,914
Although we got away this time.

389
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:11,583
Will this be good enough? What do you think?

390
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:13,954
It's probably not enough.

391
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,353
Then what?

392
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,154
I'll have to ask you to take care of Ring Go.

393
00:24:17,394 --> 00:24:18,994
Dr. Mo will be there as well.

394
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,464
Okay. I'll call you.

398
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:46,853
This will cause you problems.

You can't recover from this when you're caught.

What if they strip you of your law credentials?

406

- why you and Ro Um... - Why did you cancel...

- to protect your father? - Did you know he did it?

They'll determine the validity of the warrant tomorrow at 8pm.

They're normally hard on perps with unknown residences.

438
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:41,904
You're denying the accusation,

439

suspected of possessing firearms,

440
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:46,404

Perhaps this is for the better.

Rather than a person who's involved with the case,

453
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:28,583
you'll need an attorney who's rational and objective.

Do you admit to the charges?

465
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:15,164

Cross-examine them.

00:32:21,144 --> 00:32:24,313
Why would I turn myself in if there's no evidence?

549
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:32,583
Ro Um says she'll confess if her accomplices do,

550
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,954
and they say they'll turn themselves in if Ro Um confesses.

551
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,724
What kind of game is this?

552
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:41,523
But they won't ask to be let go.

553
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,263
Where's the search and seizure warrant?

554
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,043
Sir, I just confirmed something.

555
00:32:55,043 --> 00:32:58,474
Na Su Ho and Lee Ro Um have the same probation officer.

556
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:02,384
- Bring him in. - Okay.

557
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:15,464
I thought I'd be sent to a room...

558
00:33:15,464 --> 00:33:17,464
with the magic window I saw on TV.

559
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:24,073
Lee Ro Um and Na Su Ho are your cases, right?

560
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:25,204
Yes.

561
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,503
You know Lee was arrested two days ago?

562
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,603
Yes.

563
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:31,073
Na was questioned as a person of interest today.

564
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:33,244
As a possible accomplice of murder.

565
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:35,043
As their probation officer,

566
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:37,313
were you aware they colluded to commit murder?

567
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:39,283
I'm offended.

568
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:41,083
Do you take me for...

569
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:44,224
a probation officer who wouldn't report it if I'd known?

570
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:48,424
Did you have any issues with them so far?

571
00:33:48,563 --> 00:33:49,994
Lee or Na both.

572
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:53,803
Why did you put out a BOLO for Lee?

573
00:33:53,963 --> 00:33:55,903
There was no problem with the procedure.

574
00:33:57,004 --> 00:33:59,173
Lee and her accomplices...

575
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:01,704
broke the law by hacking Navis Well-being.

576
00:34:01,704 --> 00:34:03,474
Shouldn't Special Investigations...

577
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,374
be looking into the con Navis has been running?

578
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:10,483
Why are you looking into the people who were looking into that?

579
00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:11,754
With what right?

580
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:15,053
What right did they have to look into Navis Well-being?

581
00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:18,224
Are they police or prosecutors?

582
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:19,894
Who gave them the right to go digging?

583
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:21,863
Whose side are you on, then?

584
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:24,963
I'm not on the murderer's side.

585
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:29,104
Aren't they innocent until proven guilty?

586
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:35,044
Mr. Ko. If you were unaware, that makes you incompetent,

587
00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:38,044
and if you turned a blind eye, that makes you an accomplice.

588
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:40,684
Because of what you do,

589
00:34:40,684 --> 00:34:42,744
just an oversight could be a problem.

590
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:47,724
If you tell me right now everything you know,

591
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,724
I'll make sure you don't suffer.

592
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:51,854
This is your last chance.

593
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,394
I don't want to.

594
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,923
As my mother's son,

595
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:59,963
I must share the burden and responsibility...

596
00:35:00,193 --> 00:35:01,334
for what went on.

597
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:05,334
What do you mean?

598
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:10,274
My mom raised the Jeokmok Kids...

599
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,744
including Lee Ro Um and turned them into criminals.

600
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:14,544
Professor Shin Seo Ra.

601
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:16,483
Yes, it's the woman...

602
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,553
you saw on TV if you ever had one since the 90s.

603
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:20,653
Ro Um and Su Ho both...

604
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:23,224
can't be explained unless you look into Jeokmok.

605
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:24,894
The crimes they committed...

606
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:27,224
and everything you suspect they did.

607
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:28,294
So that means...

608
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:31,494
Professor Shin is a person of great interest.

609
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,104
She won't come for no reason,

610
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,943
but if you say you're questioning her son...

611
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,343
for helping the Jeokmok Kids,

612
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:45,374
she'll rush over.

613
00:35:56,184 --> 00:35:57,354
You're Professor Shin, right?

614
00:35:57,354 --> 00:35:59,754
Is it true you consulted for Jeokmok Foundation?

615
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:01,863
Are you here to answer questions about Jeokmok?

616
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,294
Is it true you used the kids?

617
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,193
Any comments?

618
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:21,213
How involved was my son in this case?

619
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:23,744
Is it serious?

620
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:37,794
How dare you make me come here?

621
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,763
Why must you act out?

622
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:44,504
You're that displeased about it?

623
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:47,774
When you had kids locked up for over ten years?

624
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:50,343
You're here because of me, right?

625
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,544
Because you care about your own.

626
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:57,113
From now on, everyone...

627
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,684
will associate you with Jeokmok.

628
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:04,653
Did you...

629
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:06,754
call the reporters?

630
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:22,604
Once they have the arrest warrant,

631
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,513
you'll be moved to the detention center.

632
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:38,653
Defence attorney, do you have anything to say?

633
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:40,454
No, sir.

634
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:43,494
Are you sure?

635
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:45,834
Yes.

636
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,474
Do you feel wronged in any way or have anything to say?

637
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:57,573
Wait until the decision is made.

638
00:37:58,173 --> 00:37:59,613
Even if the arrest warrant is issued,

639
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:01,343
you'll have a way to object.

640
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:04,283
Put her in cuffs.

641
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,823
(Prosecution)

642
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:40,513
Could I use the restroom?

643
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:47,923
- Did the patrol wagon arrive? - Yes.

644
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:50,963
Did you hear it, Ms. Lee?

645
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:53,334
The arrest warrant has been issued,

646
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,064
and we'll take you to the detention center.

647
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:58,104
Come out.

648
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,500
You're taking me yourself.

649
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,069
I wished you would cooperate a little more.

650
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:16,939
All day, I asked people if they helped you...

651
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:18,779
and why they helped you.

652
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,080
I got nothing out of it.

653
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,720
That was probably their way of helping me.

654
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,759
Aren't you curious?

655
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,589
Why do people help others?

656
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,160
To pay off a debt?

657
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:35,000
Because they share common interests?

658
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,729
To avoid being a villain?

659
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:38,729
Or...

660
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,600
because of this thing called empathy?

661
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,810
Why...

662
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,709
did you help me?

663
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:53,750
I'm Ryu Jae Hyuk.

664
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,620
I'm part of Criminal Trial Division at Central Prosecutors' Office.

665
00:39:56,879 --> 00:40:00,220
I wanted my help to change the result.

666
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,459
Instead of the result changing me.

667
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:10,330
That day,

668
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,169
I went to kill Jang Kyung Ja.

669
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,979
There are people I want to protect...

670
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,049
even by doing this.

671
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,669
I never wanted you dead.

672
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:49,669
I just...

673
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,770
I just wanted you...

674
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,680
to help me. Was it that hard?

675
00:40:58,209 --> 00:40:59,450
It was the same for me.

676
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:03,779
Actually,

677
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,850
I'm not sure.

678
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:08,759
Maybe I didn't want to.

679
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,430
I was glad to hear that you'd leave,

680
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:16,229
but it was very humiliating.

681
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,000
While you were locked up in prison,

682
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,040
that night confined me too.

683
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,169
What was it like for you?

684
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,040
I never regretted it.

685
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,549
I killed my husband because I wanted to.

686
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:37,080
I took what I wanted to have.

687
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:40,790
Was it worth it?

688
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,220
Was that scum worth doing so?

689
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:45,430
I gave him...

690
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:47,700
the worth.

691
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:51,299
I gave him everything.

692
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,839
Do you know why I detested you?

693
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:03,009
You're a lot like Jay.

694
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:06,779
You understand him naturally.

695
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:08,520
You easily get...

696
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,520
what's in his complicated head.

697
00:42:11,419 --> 00:42:13,919
But not me. I needed to try.

698
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,490
I needed to pay the price.

699
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:20,129
If blackmailing could get me what I want,

700
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,000
I should do just that.

701
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,700
You call that a reason, lunatic?

702
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,640
What about my parents?

703
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:35,109
What about the kids?

704
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,810
While you were protecting that scum who was worthy only to you,

705
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,819
so many people had to die.

706
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:46,390
I get that you didn't kill them yourself,

707
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:48,220
but didn't you feel guilty?

708
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,430
My innocent parents died.

709
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:57,029
At least,

710
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:02,000
you should've given them time...

711
00:43:03,169 --> 00:43:04,240
to regret and repent.

712
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:15,379
I'm sorry.

713
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,220
Do you want an apology?

714
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,229
Forget it.

715
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:38,009
In order to meet the president again,

716
00:43:39,669 --> 00:43:40,839
I need to kill you.

717
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,580
That's our current situation.

718
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,709
It's the only way.

719
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,819
So if you don't want to die,

720
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,549
think of a way...

721
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,790
for me to kill that jerk without having to kill you.

722
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,430
I'm not leaving until then.

723
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,040
Are you sure?

724
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:12,169
Now that things turned out this way,

725
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,410
you have no reason to lie to me anymore.

726
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:19,549
Did Jay really tell you...

727
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
to kill me?

728
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:44,970
(Ha Gil Young)

729
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,379
(Jang Kyung Ja)

730
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,290
Someone will be there.

731
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,890
She will have my phone...

732
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:04,359
and the attorney's business card with my autograph on it.

733
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:05,689
When she gets there,

734
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,560
open my safe for her.

735
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:11,629
Give her everything inside.

736
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,500
Yes, without any conditions.

737
00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:20,470
Even more so if I die.

738
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:27,979
That was the manager of Hyemyung Hotel.

739
00:45:29,419 --> 00:45:31,180
Open my safe with these...

740
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,990
and take everything.

741
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,720
There's only one thing you can prove with it.

742
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,290
That Ji Seung Don is above me.

743
00:45:40,729 --> 00:45:42,560
You'll have to prove yourself...

744
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,899
that Jay is using his name.

745
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:46,899
Whether you investigate or hack computers with it,

746
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,370
it's up to you.

747
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:57,950
I'm not doing this for you.

748
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,609
And it's not because I can't trust Jay.

749
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,319
I need to hear it from him myself,

750
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:05,319
not from you.

751
00:46:06,149 --> 00:46:07,490
I deserve that much.

752
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,430
I'm curious.

753
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,330
With no reason to spare me, will he...

754
00:46:19,729 --> 00:46:21,029
I hope we never see each other again,

755
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,600
Lee Ro Um.

756
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,879
What you just said, is it true?

757
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,149
Why didn't you tell me when I asked?

758
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:36,580
Had I told you, would you have believed me?

759
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,689
Also, I still have a lot of things left to do...

760
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,419
to give you the evidence back.

761
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:44,459
I'll give them back to you soon...

762
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,160
in a way that you wish.

763
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:49,799
I once had a bad experience with the prosecution,

764
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,299
so excuse me for not trusting you guys 100 percent.

765
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:54,799
You arrested me just like this ten years ago...

766
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,040
with only circumstantial evidence and a suspicion.

767
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,479
I never thought I would,

768
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,580
but I kind of hoped...

769
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:08,979
that you'd acknowledge the truth...

770
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,049
without me having to deceive you.

771
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:16,419
So, this is...

772
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,330
partly your fault too.

773
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:22,959
Excuse me?

774
00:47:50,689 --> 00:47:52,089
Once they have the arrest warrant,

775
00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:53,660
you'll be moved to the detention center.

776
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,899
She must have locked it from the other side.

777
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:07,810
Ro Um is on the emergency stairs going down from the fifth floor.

778
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,979
Stop her from leaving the building.

779
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:13,350
Close the staircases and the gates!

780
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:18,220
(3 hours before the emergency arrest)

781
00:48:51,419 --> 00:48:54,149
So, you took Ms. Jang's phone.

782
00:48:55,189 --> 00:48:56,520
What are you planning to do with it?

783
00:48:57,589 --> 00:48:58,629
What did you do...

784
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,259
to her?

785
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:05,500
Take a guess.

786
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,339
What do you think will happen from now on?

787
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:12,410
Ro Um.

788
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:14,740
I meant it...

789
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,439
when I said that I wanted you back.

790
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:33,060
Kyung Ja is dead.

791
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:34,689
I might be arrested.

792
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:38,500
Why you?

793
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,029
They're going to make it that way. They've done it before.

794
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,339
No. We have Mr. Han, and...

795
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,270
It's not like I have an alibi. And I'm an ex-convict.

796
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:47,970
I'm more likely to be arrested.

797
00:49:49,709 --> 00:49:50,740
In the meantime,

798
00:49:51,979 --> 00:49:53,279
I need you to do something.

799
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:01,319
It's everything about Ji Seung Don that Jang Kyung Ja had collected.

800
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,220
Proof that it connects to Jay...

801
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,890
No, it doesn't have to be that.

802
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,930
Find as much as you can...

803
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:10,029
so that I can offer the president a deal.

804
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,970
This is...

805
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,600
the only chance we've got.

806
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:17,899
This will be my last favour.

807
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,109
Help me...

808
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:26,109
end this, Da Jung.

809
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:36,890
How far along are you with Ro Um's favour?

810
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,259
I can finish it tonight.

811
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,060
Will Ro Um be arrested?

812
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:44,529
Will they issue a warrant?

813
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:48,129
I must get her out.

814
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,270
What do you mean?

815
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,009
I'm going to help her escape from the Prosecutors' Office.

816
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,910
So, turn yourself in.

817
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,740
When you do,

818
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,549
tell them that Da Jung and Su Ho are your accomplices...

819
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,350
so that they'll be summoned the first thing tomorrow.

820
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,319
Those two will come and get ready to bail you out.

821
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,720
The route to the underground parking lot is our best option.

822
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:12,330
When they issue an arrest warrant,

823
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,589
you can walk out through that.

824
00:51:14,189 --> 00:51:17,560
Once you're out, those two will be immediately arrested,

825
00:51:18,129 --> 00:51:20,299
hence being safely protected.

826
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,770
I'll get you what you asked for.

827
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,669
Go and finish it yourself.

828
00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:33,109
I thought you'd stop me from going in alone.

829
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:36,580
Because this is a job that you must finish.

830
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,689
And only you can do it.

831
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:43,959
Thanks for your support.

832
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,830
Tell them that I forced you to do it.

833
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,629
Okay.

834
00:51:53,899 --> 00:51:54,930
Mr. Woo.

835
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,339
Do you still have the pass for Central Prosecutors' Office?

848
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:04,439
Could I use the restroom?

849
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:18,080

What do you mean, you can't find them?

853
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,319
Watch the security footage, and check...

854
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,720
where Jung Da Jung and Na Su Ho went within the building.

855
00:54:51,709 --> 00:54:52,779

856
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:53,850
Freeze!

857
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:02,490
We'll move Ring Go to a different ward in the same hospital.

858
00:55:02,919 --> 00:55:05,629
Da Jung and Su Ho, you go to the hospice.

859
00:55:05,759 --> 00:55:07,490
Bring Yoo Il and Yoo Neung instead of Ring Go.

860
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,830
Once you finish admitting them under Ring Go's name,

861
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:11,870
I'll call the police.

862
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,810
They might...

863
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,109
call you too...

864
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:27,209
to ask about your research or something.

865
00:55:29,479 --> 00:55:32,649
Sorry for gathering the reporters on a whim.

866
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,149
I apologize.

867
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,120
It's all because of my temper.

868
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:38,830
That's fine.

869
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,759
If you ever feel guilty about your mother...

870
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:45,430
because of what happened today,

871
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,029
give me a call.

872

I'll give you a therapy session.

873
00:55:54,339 --> 00:55:56,609
Don't you have to go?

874
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,339
I should.

875
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:03,020
I hope everyone stays safe.

876
00:56:12,759 --> 00:56:13,790
I was telling you the truth...

877
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,629
about the important files.

878
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:20,370
I meant it when I said that they'd be released...

879
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,439
when I died.

880
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,770
Every document with Ji Seung Don's name on it.

881
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,839
You laundered the profits of Navis using his name.

882
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:31,779
When they go through his name,

883
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:33,279
they'll figure out that it's all fake.

884
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:37,250
If they look into who used that identity to run the funds,

885
00:56:38,049 --> 00:56:39,290
the police...

886
00:56:40,089 --> 00:56:41,120
will move in on you.

887
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:50,430
Come with me.

888
00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:52,899
I'm giving you a chance.

889
00:56:55,399 --> 00:56:56,669
Are you threatening me?

890
00:56:57,169 --> 00:56:59,470
This isn't an attack on you.

891
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,580
I wanted to protect myself and you.

892
00:57:02,939 --> 00:57:06,009
The same goes for the notebook. I kept it in the safe.

893
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:09,580
I hid it from you, but I didn't show it to anyone else.

894
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,649
That was me protecting us both.

895
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,660
Kyung Hye.

896
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,160
Do you believe what you say?

897
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,259
Don't you? Why wouldn't you believe me?

898
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,529
Who would you believe if not me?

899
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:27,770
Then do you...

900
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:29,439
trust me?

901
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:33,040
I do.

902
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,479
So you can trust me too.

903
00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:38,609
Drink it.

904
00:57:41,049 --> 00:57:42,149
You said you trusted me.

905
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:43,879
Prove it.

906
00:58:09,709 --> 00:58:10,740
Did you actually...

907
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,180
send Ro Um to kill me?

908
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,879
You didn't care enough to kill me yourself?

909
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,890
Is that all I am to you?

910
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,689
How could you send Ro Um?

911
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:41,310
Who do you think would love you this much?

912
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:46,879
Can you...

913
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,250
live without me?

914
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,220
Can you really...

915
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:00,629
manage without me?

916
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,359
You scumbag.

917
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:33,589
Jung Da Jung.

918
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:36,490
You're under arrest for helping Lee Ro Um escape.

919
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:38,620
- Arrest her. - Okay.

920
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,140
Na Su Ho.

921
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,910
You're under arrest for helping Lee Ro Um escape.

922
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:17,560
There's no reply from the messenger.

923
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,709
(I'll go back to where I belong.)

924
01:01:47,629 --> 01:01:49,629
On Ro Um's new phone,

925
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,299
put a GPS tracker.

926
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,200
Not an app, a physical device.

927
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,370
What for?

928
01:01:55,939 --> 01:01:58,470
I'll go wherever she's going.

929
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,339
I won't let her fight alone.

930
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,240
You said...

931
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,649
you'd be there when I end it.

932
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,609
(Delightfully Deceitful)

933
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:36,080
(Special thanks to actress Lee Tae Ran.)

934
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:56,899
If it's me the president wants...

935
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,660
We do have some kind of weapon.

936
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,169
Meet Jay for yourself...

937
01:03:00,169 --> 01:03:02,470
and see the proof that it's him.

938
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,470
Are you insane?

939
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:06,140
You did something this reckless for that small probability?

940
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,609
When Ro Um sends a signal, try not to be too late.

941
01:03:08,609 --> 01:03:09,910
Unlike Ro Um,

942
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:12,279
I don't care if you live or die.

943
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:14,350
Do you think I'm like you? Me?

944
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:16,049
That's what you hoped.

945
01:03:16,049 --> 01:03:17,580
You can never be free of me.

946
01:03:18,279 --> 01:03:19,549
Isn't this exhilarating?

947
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:21,290
You love making a choice.

948
01:03:27,859 --> 01:03:30,160
Actually, I can hear lies.

949
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,859
(A woman who sees the hidden truth)

950
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:33,229
You hear what you hear.

951
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:34,430
Aren't you afraid?

952
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:35,430
(And a man with a secret he can't reveal)

953
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,569
I can't hide it from you.

954
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:40,970
You like me, don't you?

955
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:42,140
