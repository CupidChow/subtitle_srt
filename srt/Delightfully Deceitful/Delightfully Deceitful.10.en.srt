should I trust your illness?

Just trust me.

40
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,632
I'll map the whole organization.

52
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,811
provide lodgings, and help them grow.

53
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,181

The contents of Jeokmok's ledgers that Ro Um compiled.

62
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,262
I heard about it from Mr. Woo.

63
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:19,592
I wondered why I didn't get a copy.

64
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,262
I thought you and Mr. Woo...

65
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,501
might have a different take on it.

66
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,272
How so?

67
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:35,241
The Prosecutors' Office is a big reason...

68
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:37,111
Jeokmok lasted this long.

69
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:39,542
You helped us so far,

70
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:43,551
but things might not go the way you expect from now on.

71
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,181
I bet no one can expect what'll happen.

72
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,121
If you want out, now's the time.

73
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:52,861
I wanted to give you an option.

74
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:07,741
Of course. I'm a selfish guy.

75
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,171
Every two years, I have to...

76
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:13,082
pack up my things and relocate as I am a civil servant after all.

77
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:16,481
I gave you that spiel because I know the rope is there,

78
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,551
but it's invisible to my eyes.

79
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:22,751
I thought I had caught it, but then I'd get thrown out.

80
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,751
Or I'd suddenly get lost.

81
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,792
I feel like I'm trying to catch a tiny fish with bare hands.

82
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,431
I don't see it. It's just slippery.

83
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:30,491
So I'm frustrated.

84
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,602
If I turn this country upside down,

85
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:35,972
will it still be slippery?

86
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:39,342
Seeing how you're scaring me like this,

87
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:42,241
is it big enough to turn the country upside down?

88
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:44,111
It's not that different over on this side.

89
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:47,912
You must map out your moves and plan your game when you can't see it.

90
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,282
Then what?

91
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:51,722
Then you'll be able to see it.

92
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,321
What you want to see.

93
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:03,191
Fine. Hand it over, then. Let me take a look.

It's an honour to meet all of you.

I'm Woo Young Ki from Moran Daily.

101
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:30,152
Hello, I'm Ryu Jae Hyuk...

102
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,061
from the Criminal Trial Division at the Central Prosecutors' Office.

103
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,392
I've heard a lot about you.

104
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:35,931
I'm the prosecutor who handled Ye Chung Sik's hearing.

105
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:40,632
So we've got a new member?

106
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,632
The more the merrier, I guess.

107
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:46,372
But he is a prosecutor.

108
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:49,242
We're technically kind of criminals, you know.

109
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:52,711
Well, don't worry about that.

110
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:54,811
You've all been excused.

111
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,612
You see, it's hard for us not to worry...

112
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,951
because we all have criminal records.

113
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,282
Right, I'm aware.

114
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:04,022
At times, we must let go of small things to achieve greater goals.

115
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:06,392
So I understand.

116
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,292
They will help us from now on.

117
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,502
I've shared all the info with them...

118
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:15,801
and will continue to keep you all updated.

119
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:17,632
Let's begin.

120
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,071
Jeokmok is the organization we're up against.

121
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:23,471
A criminal ring that has taken many shapes and forms for 20 years.

122
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:26,782
The president is the head. His identity is unknown.

123
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,282
The messenger is the main point of contact,

124
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:29,752
and the banker manages their money.

125
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:32,652
They're the only ones who can meet the president in person.

126
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:37,321
As recorded in An Chae Hong's ledger,

127
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,122
the president has been growing funds through pyramid schemes...

128
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,461
while fostering cushy relationships with politicians and businessmen.

129
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:44,232
Navis Well-being is a great example.

130
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:47,301
What's his goal, then? Getting into politics?

131
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,532
Bringing the entire country under his control.

132
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:52,872
Jeokmok was established to train elite criminals.

133
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:55,012
And Darusa was established to fund Navis.

134
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,112
Navis is like a showcase.

135
00:10:58,142 --> 00:11:00,012
They have successfully crafted a good public image...

136
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:03,152
and work closely with many politicians and business leaders.

137
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:05,622
(Navis Well-being)

138
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,821
So we can say that Navis Well-being is a very successful project.

139
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,762
The end is near.

140
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:16,091
Navis has reached the end of its lifespan.

141
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,402
- "Lifespan?" - It's about to go bankrupt.

142
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:21,162
It's a Ponzi scheme, which uses funds...

143
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:22,601
from recent investors to pay earlier ones.

144
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:26,471
It may look like it's doing well, but it's like a ticking time bomb.

145
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:30,571
When we were at Jeokmok, we designed a process map for pyramid schemes.

146
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:34,181
According to that, Navis is in the final stage now.

147
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:37,081
- They're wrapping up. - "Wrapping up?"

148
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,752
Now, they'll try to squeeze out all they can.

149
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:45,622
They'll squeeze out every penny before they run off.

150
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,262
So they'll wrap up the job and run off with the money?

151
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:49,762
Yes.

152
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:01,002
The president has been hiding behind puppet CEOs and scammers...

153
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:03,112
while strictly concealing his identity.

154
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,581
At the moment, putting a stop on Navis Well-being...

155
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:06,941
and uncovering the truth behind them...

156
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:08,681
is the only way to find the president.

157
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:10,711
Jeokmok has survived to this day...

158
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:12,421
using corrupt politicians and the media,

159
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:16,292
so I figured the two of you, Mr. Woo and Mr. Ryu, could help us out.

160
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:24,892
A rift has been created within Navis Well-being.

161
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:28,201
Ma Kang Soo is the only link among Jeokmok, Finance Corp,

162
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:31,002
and Darusa.

163
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:33,042
And the president called him to Navis Well-being.

164
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,071
(Ma Kang Soo)

165
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:36,441
Clearly, this is a move to humiliate Jang Kyung Ja,

166
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:38,542
who has been running the business for the past five years.

167
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,482
It also means Jang Kyung Ja no longer calls the shots.

168
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:46,882
We must put a stop on Navis' final project, Wrapping Up,

169
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:49,992
which will be rolled out under Ma Kang Soo's leadership.

170
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:51,591
Yes.

171
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:54,662
Right.

172
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,801
What would they do without me?

173
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:06,142
But how exactly will they "wrap up?"

174
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:07,502
Through stock price manipulation.

175
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:12,081
Ma Kang Soo's people are already on the move.

176
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:14,112
And that's why we need an informant.

177
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:16,012
An informant? Inside Navis?

178
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:17,382
We'll send someone.

179
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:22,691
The problem is that none of us can remain anonymous...

180
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,321
at Navis.

181
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:26,561
Our informant must be a new face.

182
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:30,091
It has to be someone we can trust.

183
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:31,961
How could we trust a stranger?

184
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,132
We can, if they share the same goal with us.

185
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:41,142
Mr. Woo discovered this blogger.

186
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,571
This blogger has been targeting Darusa and Navis...

187
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,412
and specializes in pyramid schemes.

188
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:47,841
Yes, let me... Thank you. I suspect that this blogger...

189
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:51,982
is the father of Yeon Ho Jung, who took her own life because of Darusa.

190
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,051
His name was...

191
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,152
Where was it? Hold on.

192
00:13:57,851 --> 00:13:58,892
Gosh.

193
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:02,461
Yeon Tae Hoon. Born in 1963.

194
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,431
His registered address is in Gyeonggi Province.

195
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:07,132
I already have his cell number, so we can track him.

196
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:10,272
Oh, my. You're cool, hacker.

197
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:14,941
Da Jung hacked into his blog...

198
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,142
and went through all the private data as well.

199
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,311
We believe he's a great fit for the informant role.

200
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:21,912
That's right.

201
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,851
He's an expert when it comes to Ma Kang Soo.

202
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,882
He's been persistently investigating Ma Kang Soo.

203
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:29,921
He has a clear goal, and we have enough information on him.

204
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:32,591
Until Yeon Tae Hoon joins us...

205
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:35,492
Mr. Ryu, please find out if anyone within the prosecution...

206
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,732
is working with Jeokmok.

207
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:44,301
I'm personally investigating Jeokmok for something.

208
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:47,902
Well... Da Jung, would you be able to help me out?

209
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:52,482
Sure, just contact me.

210
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:54,612
Gosh, you're so cool.

211
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:22,012
Do you not have my number, Ms. Jang?

212
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:40,792
(CEO Jang Kyung Ja)

213
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:09,091
It's the president.

214
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,912
All right. Then I'll keep you in the loop.

215
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:30,311
- Okay. - Get back safely.

216
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:31,471
- Talk soon. - Bye.

217
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,282
- Could you check the cable? - Sure.

218
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:37,282
About Yeon Tae Hoon...

219
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,392
Do you think he'll help us out?

220
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:47,091
I know it won't be easy for him to work with Ma Kang Soo,

221
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:50,132
but he's been running risks for years for the sake of his daughter.

222
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:52,601
I think he'll help us.

223
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,101
Shall we go together tomorrow?

224
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:01,502
Sure, why not?

225
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:08,542
(Court)

226
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:16,091
- Look at you. - Mr. Kang.

227
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:18,091
My gosh.

228
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:23,762
Gosh, you look dashing.

229
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,502
How have you been?

230
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:28,132
I've been well.

231
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,301
You still like pork rinds.

232
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,571
You must eat pork rinds.

233
00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:36,071
It's filled with nutrients.

234
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:41,412
Park Cue told me...

235
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:43,752
that you got suspended...

236
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:45,652
because of some evil woman.

237
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:47,622
What happened?

238
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,992
Oh, that's not true.

239
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:55,462
I just want to stop running away from things.

240
00:17:57,692 --> 00:18:00,262
Don't worry. I'm fine.

241
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:03,401
I don't have a son, you know.

242
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:06,202
Three months won't be long.

243
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,942
Or you can help me out.

244
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:10,811
I'm already busy.

245
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,411
You brat.

246
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:14,982
When are you going down?

247
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,381
I'm not.

248
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:19,321
I have something to do.

249
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:21,121
Here?

250
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:25,022
I thought I dealt with others' lives my whole life.

251
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,422
But it turned out to be my own.

252
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:35,032
Moo Young.

253
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:38,672
I've found your father.

254
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:43,972
He misses you very much.

255
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,881
Make some time...

256
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:54,522
for dinner this weekend.

257
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:25,111
No.

258
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:31,922
Why not?

259
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,861
And why must I do that?

260
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,861
As I said, Navis Well-being...

261
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:40,002
Navis Well-being has nothing to do with me.

262
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,232
If we leave them be,

263
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:44,472
much more people will be victimized.

264
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:47,841
I thought you ran a blog to stop that.

265
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,242
Right, I did.

266
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:55,311
I spent years on it.

267
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,911
I visited the police station numerous times...

268
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,922
and protested for days.

269
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:01,922
But no one bothered to care.

270
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,292
Online posts were deleted,

271
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,891
and I was sued for protesting.

272
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:10,032
Everyone ignored me and didn't care to listen.

273
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,262
And he was released on parole.

274
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:21,242
This world has no intention to punish...

275
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,512
scum like Ma Kang Soo properly.

276
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:26,782
I don't need this.

277
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:29,752
I've found a way.

278
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,792
What is that way you've found?

279
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:40,561
One and only sacrifice...

280
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,232
for Ho Jung.

281
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:49,601
Not some house-playing you're talking about.

282
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:52,942
So you're going back...

283
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,442
to being a pathetic father.

284
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:57,611
What did you say?

285
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:58,712
Ho Jung...

286
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,212
worked part-time since high school.

287
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:03,811
Without having a proper job,

288
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,581
you just took sit-down money...

289
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:08,222
and wasted all that on drinks.

290
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:11,121
Your wife became sick while working alone,

291
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:12,992
but she couldn't be treated because of money.

292
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:15,361
And Ho Jung must've borne the responsibility.

293
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:19,561
Because it was probably too worthless for you.

294
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,262
Hey, you punk.

295
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:23,301
You'd drink soju first thing in the morning,

296
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,742
but to see your daughter's cooking, you'd feel bad sometimes.

297
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:29,071
You'd come home with a few mandarins in a plastic bag.

298
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,411
Then you'd probably tell yourself...

299
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:34,742
that you were quite the decent dad.

300
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:35,782
What...

301
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:38,512
Shut your mouth, punk.

302
00:21:38,512 --> 00:21:41,321
Ho Jung tried to do something through that pyramid...

303
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:44,522
because she supported the family on your behalf.

304
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,522
For Ho Jung, you said?

305
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:50,861
What do you even know about your daughter?

306
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:53,762
Hey, you little...

307
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:28,801
I thought you liked appealing to emotions.

308
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:30,232
I never did.

309
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,871
If I had, I wouldn't have gotten the illness.

310
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:51,761
It's the draft of your inauguration speech...

311
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,200
for the investment briefing in the first half.

312
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,230
It's the first draft, so give me feedback.

313
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,871
The executives worked hard on it together.

314
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:01,371
I'd like you to review it fast.

315
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,170
(Dear respected members of Navis Well-being...)

316
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,611
(First, I will achieve constant development of techniques.)

317
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:08,880
It's more of an apology than a speech.

318
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:12,980
You'll be making a public speech.

319
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,251
It's only right to redeem your past mistakes, isn't it?

320
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:21,621
Navis Well-being has upheld the people-friendly reputation.

321
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,831
An executive with a fraud conviction is a big risk.

322
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,331
Come in.

323
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,630

327
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,321
A risk, you said?

328
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:24,351
Didn't I tell you?

329
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,890
I have my own assistants.

330
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,230
I'll have them work on my speech too.

331
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,361
So, where's my office again?

332
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,170
I guess you're shocked.

333
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,341
Well, I can deal with that too.

334
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:52,581
I wonder why you keep going for a psychological war.

335
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,291
I'll be leading the investment briefing.

336
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,660
And I'll be calling you.

337
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,430
Keep your phone with you.

338
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:11,101

342
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:44,130
Shall I tell you why you haven't managed to break Jeokmok's grip?

343
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,311
It's because of your servile nature.

344

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,521

00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,861
Darn, look at you...

00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:51,130
seated in that corner...

348
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,301
for a man.

349
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:56,670
How pathetic.

350
00:26:57,071 --> 00:26:59,940
Do you want to run away from home like your mom?

351
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,910
Darn this family!

352
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,751
Do you still feel uneasy...

353
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:13,591
when you think of your father?

so he brought back his old team.

362
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:45,751
The only opening he needs to fill is a biotech researcher.

363
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:48,591
I think he's going to play around with a biotech company's stocks.

364
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,930
I'm creating a profile for our informant.

365
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,601
When can I meet Mr. Yeon? Yes.

366
00:27:57,071 --> 00:27:58,230
Okay.

367
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,210
What?

368
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:07,710
Your attorney thinks Mr. Yeon's a no-go.

369
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,621
(White Village Dorim Nature Apartment)

370
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,190
Explain the situation so I can accept it.

371
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,450
Or I'll flip the direction we take.

372
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,111
I thought you liked anyone who was pitiful.

373
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,341
I guess he wasn't pitiful enough.

374
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,180
He lost his family to Jeokmok...

375
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,980
and is fuelled by revenge.

376
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm saying Yeon Tae Hoon is not that different from me.

377
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:56,390
I told you there was just one adult in my life who was on my side.

378
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,331
I met him again after a long time.

379
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:02,630
He'd found my dad who'd left home when I was 19.

380
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:07,700
He told me to see my dad because he wants to see me.

381
00:29:10,341 --> 00:29:11,341
So what?

382
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:15,740
Early on in my consultations with my shrink, she asked me...

383
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,910
what came to mind when I thought of my dad.

384
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:21,821
It was soju.

385
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,051
The soju he used to pour me.

386
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:28,121
Whenever he had a bad day,

387
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,390
he'd sit across from Mom and me and pour me a shot.

388
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:38,970
Soju laced with a pesticide.

389
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:53,821
Hey.

390
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,190
Darn you!

391
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:02,291
What are you looking at in such a daze?

392
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,031
(Pesticide)

393
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,900
I hated my dad.

394
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,210
I hated him like crazy.

395
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
The con you pulled...

396
00:30:22,011 --> 00:30:25,051
was a slight waft of wind that blew on a matchstick house.

397
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,581
My mother ran away from home...

398
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,490
to get away from my dad.

399
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:36,531
Yeon Tae Hoon's not like you. He's more like my father.

400
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:41,761
A rude and emotional alcoholic.

401
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:44,031
He talks about family,

402
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:46,001
but he's utterly self-centered.

403
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,740
He's impossible to sympathize with.

404
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,871
You said you forgave your parents who came back for you.

405
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,940
I can't forgive my father...

406
00:30:58,351 --> 00:30:59,480
or Mr. Yeon.

407
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,630
I didn't care if they'd dropped dead somewhere.

408
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,960
They held my hand and cried after we met after ten years,

409
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,630
and I didn't feel much.

410
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,001
I wondered what the fuss was about.

411
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,470
But they mentioned ramyeon.

412
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:23,670
They asked if I still liked it.

413
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,841
That's what they asked me after ten years.

414
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,311
We were so poor,

415
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:32,410
when other families ate out on weekends,

416
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:34,521
we stayed home and ate ramyeon.

417
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,621
They made it look like it was a special treat,

418
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,990
as if it were rare.

419
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:43,831
But they didn't have the guts to lie to my face.

420
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,730
They kept glancing at me as we ate.

421
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,071
Watching them make a fuss...

422
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:52,670
over instant noodles made me so uncomfortable,

423
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:55,900
so I pretended to like ramyeon.

424
00:31:57,071 --> 00:32:00,380
And they thought I actually liked it.

425
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:04,081
They said...

426
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:08,051
they'd wait for me with a pot of ramyeon.

427
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:11,551
(Pando-Ri 118-3)

428
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:12,791
(Our address never changed.)

429
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,390
(The same house since you left.)

430
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,761
(We'll wait with ramyeon. Let's eat ramyeon together.)

431
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:23,501
Isn't that funny?

432
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,400
Why would they wait for me with a pot of something...

433
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,041
that'll go cold and soggy?

434
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,710
I guess it's because it's so preposterous,

435
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:37,611
but sometimes...

436
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
I wonder.

437
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:46,021
Did they really wait for me with ramyeon that day?

438
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,291
How cold and soggy did it get?

439
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,791
Who found it?

440
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
The police?

441
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,730
Did they throw it away with the other belongings?

442
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,710
I've never been home in 20 years,

443
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,541
but for some reason,

444
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,680
I get the feeling...

445
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:17,621
there will be a pot of hot ramyeon waiting for me.

446
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,920
Human beings are so weird.

447
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:25,390
We want to punish others for the smallest things,

448
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,831
and want to forgive...

449
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:31,301
for the most insignificant things.

450
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:59,260
(Mr. Kang)

451
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,671
The call cannot be connected.

452
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:33,961
We should go.

453
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:35,561
You waited for an hour.

454
00:34:37,331 --> 00:34:39,530
I doubt you can see the messenger for a while.

455
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,941
He'll switch locations.

456
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,570
There were no other instructions...

457
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,981
for you, ma'am.

458
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,950
Do you want some water?

459
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:31,691
I want whiskey.

460
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:40,831
Where have you been at these days?

461
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:47,371
Are you looking for Lee Ro Um?

462
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,041
Ice?

463
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:57,010
I asked a question.

464
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,811
Are you looking for Lee Ro Um?

465
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,820
Why would I look for her?

466
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:09,160
What did you talk about that day?

467
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:14,530
The day of the talk show. Why did you lie?

468
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,570
Why didn't you answer truthfully?

469
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:24,211
What did you two talk about?

470
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,831
What did Ro Um come for?

471
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,731
Did An Chae Hong really leave behind one last notebook?

472
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:55,941
There was no such thing.

473
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,811
That day...

474
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:07,881
I'm right by your side.

475
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,621
Just like that day.

476
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:17,961
I think I gave him too much.

477
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,200
He won't wake up.

478
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:22,331
Really?

479
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,800
You know, I just...

480
00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:26,700
I just...

481
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:29,171
He kept yelling at me...

482
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,070
and tried to hit me again.

483
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:34,010
He hounded me to hurry up and pack my things.

484
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,981
I told you I didn't want to leave.

485
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,950
I can't leave now!

486
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,220
I can't leave you.

487
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:43,490
Why would I leave Korea,

488
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,691
not even knowing where we'd go?

489
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:46,890
I told him I couldn't leave,

490
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,860
and he kept yelling at me!

491
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,941
Did you book your flight?

492
00:38:11,381 --> 00:38:12,481
Will it depart in the morning?

493
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:15,780
Yes, at 6am.

494
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:19,351
Wait at the airport with your suitcase.

495
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:22,660
You booked your flight as per Director An's instructions...

496
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,461
and waited for him all night at the airport.

497
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,461
Keep calling him on his cell phone.

498
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:40,211
What about you?

499
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,811
Can't we just...

500
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,180
get on the plane together and leave?

501
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:52,191
Let's go.

502
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,621
If we leave now, we can pull this off.

503
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,800
Do you want to be on the run forever?

504
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:06,601
You're doing this because of her.

505
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,970
Because of Lee Ro Um.

506
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,140
It is because of her, isn't it?

507
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,851
Who am I doing all this for?

508
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:26,921
Keep your eyes wide open...

509
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,760
and watch what I do to help you.

510
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:55,780
Go dry your hair.

511
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,191
You'll catch a cold.

512
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,101
Let's just wrap this up...

513
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:13,740
and go where you want to go.

514
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:17,871
Wherever it may be.

515
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:47,300
Excuse me?

516
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:50,541
Yes.

517
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,381
Hello.

518
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,450
The next ones are over there.

519
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,090
Lee Ro Um?

520
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,890
Aren't you Ms. Lee Ro Um?

521
00:41:14,961 --> 00:41:17,401
I'm Mo Jae In, a psychiatrist.

522
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,470
I know about you.

523
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,941
Are you here to give me gibberish?

524
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:34,280
Let me warn you.

525
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,050
Don't think that you can persuade me.

526
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:42,590
You said you had investigated various pyramid schemes...

527
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,731
and fought alone for the past five years...

528
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,331
for Ho Jung.

529
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:51,700
I already told you that it was all useless now.

530
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:53,070
Is killing Ma Kang Soo...

531
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,101
really the best way to avenge Ho Jung's death?

532
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,811
Or do you want to do it to relieve your anger?

533
00:41:57,811 --> 00:41:59,240
Think carefully.

534
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,711
Killing Ma Kang Soo won't change anything.

535
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,851
If you truly wish to avenge Ho Jung,

536
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,691
make everyone connected to her death pay for what they did.

537
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:13,521
Just like we need your help,

538
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:16,820
you can use us too.

539
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,631
To ensure that everyone who drove Ho Jung to suicide...

540
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:22,501
pays for what they did,

541
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,200
we will help you.

542
00:42:31,871 --> 00:42:32,941

I just...

548
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,860
would like to apologize to the others too, if I could.

549
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,631
Is this the latest trend? Making apologies.

All right.

551

00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,667
Do you trust her?

726
00:53:58,037 --> 00:54:00,207
Do you, because you aren't guilty of her?

727
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,776
She scares me more than Jeokmok does.

728
00:54:05,446 --> 00:54:08,077
I haven't done anything wrong to Jeokmok, but I have to her.

729
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:09,247
Twice, at that.

730
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:11,446
Then just apologize properly.

731
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,687
Don't trust her too much.

732
00:54:15,787 --> 00:54:17,756
Or you could sob for getting stabbed in the back.

733
00:54:21,597 --> 00:54:23,897
- I'll walk that way. - Su Ho.

734
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,526
I won't tell anyone about your meetings and all.

735
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,637
Just take care.

736
00:54:29,897 --> 00:54:31,236
And don't try to reach me.

737
00:54:32,466 --> 00:54:33,867
Now I'm in danger.

(Dajung Comic Books)

742
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:50,216
I wonder why it shows.

743
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,557
Whether someone hurt you...

744
00:54:55,026 --> 00:54:56,827
or you hurt someone in the past,

745
00:54:57,926 --> 00:54:59,466
you could just get over it...

746
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:01,696
and move on.

747
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:04,537
You could just put it all behind.

748
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:08,376
Why does it have to show...

749
00:55:11,147 --> 00:55:13,176
and make things an unending nightmare?

750
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,486
I'm not sure if this will work.

751
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,057
I feel so weak.

752
00:55:27,586 --> 00:55:29,626
Nothing seems to have gotten better.

753
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:33,897
It seems too hopeless.

Yeon Tae Hoon got the job.

755
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:01,756
He'll be starting in two days.

756
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:08,167
What are you doing?

757
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,077
Stop staring at me.

758
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,546
You're speaking informally now.

759
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,017
You won't make up with Na Su Ho?

760
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:04,156
Shall I tell you what he's up to?

761
00:57:04,856 --> 00:57:06,057
Listen.

762
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,756
We're all on the same side now.

763
00:57:08,756 --> 00:57:11,267
Why is Su Ho's repair shop still closed?

764
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:13,566
Han Moo Young's so busy he never calls,

765
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,736
and you didn't report since you got back.

766
00:57:16,336 --> 00:57:17,397
I did.

767
00:57:18,267 --> 00:57:19,267
Just now.

768
00:57:19,466 --> 00:57:22,276
Only because I threatened to come look for you.

769
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:25,077
I want us to be slightly closer.

770
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:27,776
I could report you for something else.

771
00:57:28,147 --> 00:57:30,316
That's not what I mean.

772
00:57:40,187 --> 00:57:41,227
Did you...

773
00:57:41,957 --> 00:57:44,026
get a visit from a psychiatrist?

774
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,167
How do you know that?

775
00:57:49,997 --> 00:57:51,066
Don't even ask.

776
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:53,566
It's six degrees of separation.

777
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,106
You're right.

778
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:00,747
Professor Shin's student and son.

779
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:03,917
Still, she tried to apologize...

780
00:58:04,216 --> 00:58:05,847
and take responsibility.

781
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:08,756
I'm pretty sure she didn't hit you.

782
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,957
She offered to consult me instead.

783
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:17,426
Do you know that as your probation officer,

784
00:58:17,426 --> 00:58:19,267
I have the authority to recommend help?

785
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:28,437
You should think about it.

786
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,247
Us broken human beings...

787
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:34,577

Your father waited for two hours.

789
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:01,906
Is it that hard to face him?

790
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,606
Sorry.

791
00:59:05,176 --> 00:59:06,707
Let's reschedule.

792
00:59:07,776 --> 00:59:09,077
I'll call you.

You won't have met. Say hi.

825

It's Jay.

Why do you dislike me?

830
01:02:41,026 --> 01:02:42,426
Must I like you?

831
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,526
Don't see her.

832
01:02:43,656 --> 01:02:45,327
She might do something.

833
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:48,397
I wish you'd bring him back. Not Jay but Na Sa.

834

You're not the kid you used to be.

Bite their leg if they beat you up.

836

Do you still not get that there are people who care about you?

837
01:02:54,606 --> 01:02:56,236
It's imagination, not sympathy.

838
01:02:56,236 --> 01:02:57,906
It's not what you feel, it's a delusion.

839
01:02:57,906 --> 01:02:59,276
That's why it's an illness.

840
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,276
