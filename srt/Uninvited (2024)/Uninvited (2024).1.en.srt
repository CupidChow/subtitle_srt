1
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,381
Lily?

2
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,743
Lily?

3
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,206
Lily?

4
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,300
Lily?

5
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,939
Sweetie?

6
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,484
Sweetie?

7
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,127
<i>Hello.</i>

8
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,670
<i>How are you?</i>

9
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,465
<i>Got it, Mom?</i>

10
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,886
<i>We've covered this before.</i>

11
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,264
<i>Always look on the bright side.</i>

12
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,935
<i>You're familiar with this, right?</i>

13
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,313
<i>Good luck.</i>

14
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,940
Thank you.

15
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,651
Thank you, just straight ahead.

16
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,838
Thank you, ma'am.
To security check, please.

17
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,558
<i>Glad I don't have a gun with me.</i>

18
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,978
<i>Security is tight and risky.</i>

19
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,481
<i>I'll just wing it.</i>

20
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,457
<i>So she's a knockout, is she?</i>

21
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,376
What the fuck, Ballesteros.

22
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,795
You think I'm on a dry spell?

23
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,588
How would I know?

24
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,507
Asshole.

25
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,218
What the fuck.

26
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,096
I can't stomach cleaning such a mess.

27
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,056
Take it easy.

28
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,767
Have you forgotten who your boss is?

29
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,936
I'm not like him.

30
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,188
- Have mercy, we have kids.
- Forgive us, sir.

31
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,898
- Please spare us.
- I’m begging you.

32
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,151
- You stepped onto the wrong turf.
- Please, have mercy.

33
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,279
- Boss Jigger, bossing.
- We didn't do anything.

34
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,282
Where'd you find them, Batac?

35
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,449
I did find them.

36
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,326
At the pool hall.

37
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,287
I'm the breadwinner.

38
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,998
- Only a fool would let them go.
- Please spare us.

39
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,125
My grandma needs me.

40
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,209
She needs me.

41
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,544
- Don't kill me, please.
- Hey, calm down.

42
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,838
- I'm all she has.
- Easy, calm down.

43
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,091
Fuck you. I'll make sure
your life ends with mine.

44
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,009
Calm down!

45
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,803
Sir, have mercy on me.

46
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,389
Sir, don't point the gun at me.

47
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,850
- Calm down.
- And the kids?

48
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,394
- In the car, boss.
- I'll leave you to it.

49
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,896
- This is too much for me.
- You’re dead when I get out of here.

50
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,023
Take care of them.

51
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,399
Say less.

52
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,109
See you, boss.

53
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,736
Please, sir.

54
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,070
Please, sir.

55
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
- Otso, calm down.
- Sir!

56
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,116
They’re counting on me.

57
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,534
Stop crying.

58
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,119
They’re…

59
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,329
Otso!

60
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,915
Have you eaten?

61
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,835
- Let's go.
- Not yet.

62
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,920
Let's go.

63
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,725
Are they looking for me?

64
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,398
Are you hiding?

65
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,361
I figured if I stayed here,

66
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,573
my age would pass me by.

67
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,870
They say age is all in your head.

68
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,624
It's in your knees too.

69
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,667
Oh, man.

70
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,711
I heard it's in here too.

71
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,799
That doesn't count, dumbass.

72
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,054
How did I fucking last this long?

73
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,933
Like bad weeds, boss.

74
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,269
Remind me, what's this celebration for?

75
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,398
To show off your wealth.

76
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,359
Fuck all of them.

77
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,486
Make them drool over it.

78
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,595
Did you just see a ghost, Zulueta?

79
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,016
I just wasn't expecting you, Colonel.

80
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm here to pay respects.

81
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,981
Red.

82
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,317
Do you still need me, boss?

83
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,653
It's Red.

84
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,738
No sweat, I've got this.

85
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,754
I didn't expect the invite.

86
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,174
Why wouldn't I?

87
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,302
I thought we were enemies.

88
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,053
Enemies?

89
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,600
What else would you call it?

90
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,810
<i>A spat?</i>

91
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,939
A spat where guns were drawn?

92
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,984
That's the thrill of it.

93
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,655
Is this your apology?

94
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,449
Fuck, Red.

95
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,868
I don't apologize.

96
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,370
Don't think too hard about it.

97
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,997
You've made it here.

98
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,499
It's my birthday too.

99
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,834
We'll talk business later.

100
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,587
We haven't worked together
in a while, Guilly.

101
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,842
And by the way, it's Colonel.

102
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,262
Only my friends call me Red.

103
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,985
See you downstairs.

104
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,154
For sure, we'll meet down there.

105
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,624
<i>It's packed in here.</i>

106
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,751
<i>It reeks so bad.</i>

107
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,919
<i>I can't--</i>

108
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,422
<i>Oh my god. Who's this?</i>

109
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,221
<i>Massive.</i>

110
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,098
Massive.

111
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,187
Guilly's a little over-the-top sometimes.

112
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,439
Glad you could come tonight.

113
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,983
<i>Why does she know me?</i>

114
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,986
So, when did you come back?

115
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,821
<i>Back from where?</i>

116
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,948
Last night.

117
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,575
Nice of you to be here.

118
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,451
I would not miss this.

119
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,204
Marjorie?

120
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,330
Karla!

121
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,545
Have you guys met?

122
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,257
<i>Go on, say my name.</i>

123
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,341
Karla Ochoa.

124
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,135
Eva Candelaria.

125
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,262
Eva, of course!

126
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,471
How are you?

127
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,641
I'm just going to look around.

128
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,518
Okay. Sure.

129
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,229
- Eva.
- Eva.

130
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,522
Eva.

131
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,958
Before Dad shows up and starts flexing
to his kiss-ass guests.

132
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,710
You're harsh on your dad.

133
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,548
What's that about, Mark?

134
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,258
I mean,

135
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,760
I think he's cool.

136
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,732
That's not what I meant.

137
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,112
I can only stand him
when he does the right thing.

138
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,195
Right here, babe?

139
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,970
<i>Celso Batac.</i>

140
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,598
<i>Found one, Junior.</i>

141
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,393
<i>This guy's huge.</i>

142
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,479
Were you waiting for me?

143
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,319
I know that look, Guilly.

144
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,406
Actually, you don't.

145
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,413
I don't?

146
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,252
You don't know why I have this look.

147
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,017
And you still don't know anything.

148
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,022
But me,

149
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,526
I know everything.

150
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,121
Dolled up for me?

151
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,918
Isn't it your birthday?

152
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,217
You don't want it?

153
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,101
I can't let it go to waste.

154
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,983
The night's young.

155
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,215
I'll head downstairs.

156
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,138
Why didn't you fucking finish it?

157
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,932
Did you do this?

158
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,684
We did, boss.

159
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,604
I'll back him up. He's my cousin anyway.

160
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,692
So, you're in on this too?

161
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,735
Well…

162
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,570
You don't turn down a good fortune.

163
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,626
I'll call it in.

164
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,301
The fuck--

165
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,399
<i>Nicolette Chantal Remigio Vega.</i>

166
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,159
I've quit.

167
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,247
I really should quit too,

168
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,376
but it's tough when you live here.

169
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,044
<i>She's alone, Eva.</i>

170
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,921
<i>But now's not the time.</i>

171
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,839
<i>Take it slow.</i>

172
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,092
<i>Too soon.</i>

173
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,636
Were you invited by my mom or dad?

174
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,721
Your mom.

175
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,811
Foundation people, right?

176
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,647
Foundation, yeah.

177
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,486
Your house is lovely, <i>hija</i>.

178
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,865
I don't think living here is that bad.

179
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,284
<i>Hija</i>…

180
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,997
My grandma was
the last one to call me that.

181
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,419
Words from grandmas

182
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,254
are sweet.

183
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,424
But I'm not saying you're a granny.

184
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,343
Still a mom.

185
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,303
Of how many?

186
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,472
Just one.

187
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,935
She's probably your age.

188
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,770
Does she have a boyfriend?

189
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,855
Yes.

190
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,985
Tell her not to rush things.

191
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,071
And don't let her learn to smoke.

192
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,541
<i>Cheer up.</i>

193
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,620
Sir, wine.

194
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,885
Thanks!

195
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,192
Thank you.

196
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,662
- Thanks.
- Happy birthday.

197
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,830
Thank you, ma'am!

198
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,292
- Happy birthday, sir.
- Wow, thank you.

199
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,967
Is this a kids' party?

200
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,011
Waiter.

201
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,390
Hibiki. Neat.

202
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,725
Get me a proper drink.

203
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,313
Didn't you bring someone?

204
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,439
Nope.

205
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,607
I can't afford it.

206
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,822
Do you have to be my shadow?

207
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,074
You may need me.

208
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,951
Then I'll call you.

209
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,423
How have you been? All alone?

210
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,136
Jigger told me not to bring anyone.

211
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,345
Do you need one?

212
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,935
Just checking on
your wife and daughter, Elise.

213
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,562
She's all grown up, isn't she?

214
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,440
She's only seven.

215
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,942
Having a trip in the States.

216
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,527
Isn't she 15 years old?

217
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,281
- She's still seven.
- I'm just kidding.

218
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,116
Come on.

219
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,619
That drink's no good. Here.

220
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,037
It's virgin.

221
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,080
I haven't touched it yet.

222
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,792
- Thanks, boss.
- Cheer up.

223
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,878
I'm just messing with you.

224
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,964
You're fucking pathetic, Batac.

225
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,552
<i>Guilly Vega.</i>

226
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,763
<i>The most evil of them all.</i>

227
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,402
It's you, chief.

228
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,612
Straight ahead.

229
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,352
<i>Lily.</i>

230
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,270
<i>Mom!</i>

231
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,647
<i>Sorry, we're late.</i>

232
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,941
Finally, you're here.

233
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,986
Hey, Tofy.

234
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,363
- Auntie.
- Okay.

235
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,827
So sorry, it's my fault this time.

236
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,664
Mama gave me something
to do last minute, as always.

237
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,499
And your junior hadn't bought
the flowers yet.

238
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,751
That's all right, I just got here too.

239
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,295
Speaking of, Mom.

240
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,672
Go, give it to your dad.

241
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,927
Tofy, you never miss, right?

242
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,762
You're always around

243
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,682
for death anniversaries,
birthdays, and All Saints' Day.

244
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,350
I thought

245
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:54,062
you were courting her again,
like you used to.

246
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,189
He still is.

247
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,359
I thought you two were together.

248
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,485
We are.

249
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,363
You get the idea.

250
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,490
I really do get it.

251
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,249
<i>Mom, are you all right?</i>

252
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,084
Are you thinking about Dad?

253
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,130
No, not really.

254
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,841
I don't know, probably.

255
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,845
Mom.

256
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,097
Hey.

257
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,227
Don't leave me, sweetie.

258
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,105
Mom, Tofy and I are just going to study.

259
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,399
We might see a movie after,
but I'll be home later.

260
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,901
I know.

261
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,028
I know, but that's not what I meant.

262
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,154
Then what?

263
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,533
You're happy with me, right?

264
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,661
Mom, that's more for a partner.

265
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,248
Mom.

266
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,459
Come on, tell me.

267
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,797
I'm so happy, Mom.

268
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,472
I'm so happy…

269
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,435
I feel like I personally chose you.

270
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,606
Sweetie.

271
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,984
I'm doing my best.

272
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,487
Even if

273
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,907
I'm alone, but it's tough.

274
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,991
I feel like--

275
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,245
- It's okay.
- I feel like something's missing.

276
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,208
Mom, do you mind if I borrow your card?

277
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,127
I'll give it back later.

278
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,257
- So cheeky!
- You're good now, aren't you?

279
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,134
- You're so cheeky.
- You're fine now.

280
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,010
So, it's my card you're after?

281
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,971
- Sit down.
- You laughed anyway.

282
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,977
You're a little too spoiled.

283
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,896
Don't splurge too much, sweetie.

284
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,857
Sweetie.

285
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,568
Don't splurge too much.

286
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,654
- I love you, Mom.
- What?

287
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,115
I love you, Mom.

288
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,366
Sa-- What?

289
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,410
I've already taught you that.

290
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,953
Sa…

291
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,205
I love you,

292
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,541
my daughter.

293
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,962
I love you so much, Mom.

294
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,257
<i>If only I knew that</i>
<i>we wouldn't speak again, Lily,</i>

295
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,968
<i>I would've dragged the conversation on.</i>

296
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,428
I love you too, my sweetie.

297
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,018
<i>We should've talked about something else.</i>

298
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,853
You're really pretty today.

299
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,937
Mom…

300
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:46,526
<i>I should've just acted like</i>
<i>I needed you that day.</i>

301
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,320
Come on, take a selfie.

302
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,488
You look amazing! That makeup is perfect.

303
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,406
There you go.

304
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,366
- That's enough.
- One more, come on.

305
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,622
<i>I should have picked you up.</i>

306
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,541
<i>You could've still been here.</i>

307
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,254
<i>I shouldn't have been here.</i>

308
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:17,474
Ly, how old were you when your dad passed?

309
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,603
And your mom?

310
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,273
Just fifty?

311
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,694
You were both so young then.

312
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,949
Did that upset you?

313
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,371
Maybe…

314
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,206
Maybe?

315
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,501
Maybe it's when Mom's gone

316
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,630
that I'll truly know the pain of sadness.

317
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,430
But that's still a long way off.

318
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,140
We're not in a hurry.

319
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,642
Still a long way off.

320
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,060
This isn't wood.

321
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,731
- That's not how it works.
- Let me focus on this.

322
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,066
Fine, go ahead.

323
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,495
Shh…

324
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,622
Okay, sorry.

325
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,419
Do you have any memories left of your dad?

326
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,337
I meant the real ones.

327
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,299
Or at least what feels like a real memory?

328
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,220
It's fine if there isn't any.

329
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,267
He took me to the Ferris wheel
in their hometown.

330
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,395
<i>Then Mom was furious.</i>

331
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,814
<i>Because we got stuck at the top.</i>

332
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,400
It felt like I could reach the sky.

333
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,236
I even thought I could fly.

334
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,197
What's so--

335
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,033
Hold on.

336
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,162
- Stay put.
- Tof…

337
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,663
- What do you want?
- Tof.

338
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,956
- What do you want?
- Tof!

339
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,041
Run, Lily!

340
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:06,958
Bro!

341
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,084
Tof!

342
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,129
What the hell?

343
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,717
- Fuck you!
- Here.

344
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,553
- Lily…
- Come here!

345
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,682
Help!

346
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,059
- Help!
- Hurry up!

347
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,478
- Help us!
- Lily!

348
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,520
Get in!

349
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,646
Let's go!

350
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,731
Help!

351
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,358
Help us!

352
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,068
Let us go!

353
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,999
<i>Here they are.</i>

354
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,171
<i>The gang is complete.</i>

355
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,387
<i>Jigger Zulueta, right-hand man.</i>

356
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,602
<i>Randall Ballesteros, fixer.</i>

357
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,649
Are you bored too?

358
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,568
I just got here.

359
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,954
Really that bad?

360
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,706
Got a thing for hypocrites?

361
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,000
Nope.

362
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,589
Neither do I.

363
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:43,471
Honestly, I want to spit
on everyone down there.

364
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,974
But I have to smile.

365
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,559
So I do.

366
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,644
Which makes me a hypocrite also.

367
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,315
So, do you agree with me?

368
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,026
You bet, my jaw's locked up.

369
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,615
Katrina.

370
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,534
Vega.

371
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,620
Li…

372
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,206
Eva Candelaria.

373
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,293
Eva Candelaria?

374
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,339
I've heard that name somewhere.

375
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,216
Eva Cande…

376
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,019
He's just using it
to boost his reputation.

377
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,812
Just between us girls, okay?

378
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,951
What brought you here, Eva?

379
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,999
I run a few small foundations too.

380
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,879
We care for victims

381
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,424
of different sexual violence cases.

382
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,219
Oh, so you're networking?

383
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,808
Word is, your catering here is impressive,

384
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,267
especially the food.

385
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,646
I like you.

386
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,191
I like you because you don't belong here.

387
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,778
I knew there was a reason I came to you.

388
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,743
Stay away from these parties
as much as you can,

389
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,121
no matter how many invites roll in.

390
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,207
Watch out,

391
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,000
you might catch it from them.

392
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,462
You can't cure something like that.

393
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,673
Thank you.

394
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,145
<i>The fuck. Here.</i>

395
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,815
Come on.

396
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,775
Come on.

397
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,587
What did I say about knocking, Batac?

398
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,089
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

399
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,888
Come.

400
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,806
Hold on.

401
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,100
What's the matter?

402
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,226
Come.

403
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,352
It's fine.

404
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,146
You'll be fine.

405
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,996
What happened?

406
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,539
Tell me.

407
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,374
What--

408
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,085
Who hurt you?

409
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,879
Please don't.

410
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,631
Tell me. Who hurt you?

411
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,008
Who was it?

412
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,189
What did you do?

413
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,401
She struck me first.

414
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,862
Struck you first?

415
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,114
Yes, sir. She went straight for my face.

416
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,994
Okay.

417
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,538
Are you all right?

418
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,748
Does it hurt?

419
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,667
Why'd you have to…

420
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,844
Come here. You'll be fine, come.

421
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,513
Please don't, sir.

422
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,390
Yeah, you'll be fine.

423
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,766
Please don't, sir.

424
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,102
Don't worry.

425
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,937
Skip the formalities.

426
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,231
Skip the formalities.

427
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,691
Drop the "sir."

428
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,693
I'm going home.

429
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,236
- Hold on.
- I'm going home.

430
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,531
Come here.

431
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,077
Hey.

432
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,745
You'll be fine.

433
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,126
Do you want to go home?

434
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,460
We're going home, okay?

435
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,712
We're going home.

436
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,548
Okay? You'll be fine.

437
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,135
We're going home.

438
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,261
Stop resisting.

439
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,763
Stop resisting. Let go.

440
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,889
There.

441
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,641
We're going home.

442
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,063
Do you want to go home?

443
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,364
Don't resist.

444
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,704
You'll enjoy it when you don't resist.

445
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,389
Let's go home, come on.

446
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,183
You'll be fine.

447
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,142
Let go of me.

448
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,643
- You'll be fine.
- Let go of me.

449
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,896
Hey. Another round?

450
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,109
Fuck.

451
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,195
Why did you stop?

452
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,708
I didn't tell you to stop.

453
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,796
Tough when it's over too early.

454
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,014
Can you leave us alone?

455
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,226
Mark, sir.

456
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,393
Mark, sir.

457
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,520
Markser?

458
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,278
Would you mind leaving me
and my only daughter alone?

459
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,656
I haven't held her in ages.

460
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,132
Yes, sir.

461
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,985
Is that for me?

462
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,324
New guy?

463
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,163
Is Markser your new fling?

464
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,835
New fling?

465
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,467
Two years, so it's just one of two things.

466
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,970
Either he's a huge coward

467
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,307
or it's physical between you.

468
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,699
If you two are hooking up…

469
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,130
I hope he's as lucky as I am.

470
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,050
Fuck you.

471
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,594
Hey, easy on the language.

472
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,055
Fuck you!

473
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,057
Fuck you!

474
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,399
We have guests.

475
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,408
Nicole!

476
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,995
Can't we have a regular conversation?

477
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,341
You really think
you know everything about me?

478
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,077
No birthday kiss?

479
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,879
<i>Where's Lily?</i>

480
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,266
Someone's calling.

481
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,351
Answer it.

482
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,270
Come on, answer it!

483
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,024
Answer it!

484
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,449
Fuck you!

485
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,498
Motherfucker!

486
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,510
Stand up!

487
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,305
Let me go!

488
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,057
Let me…

489
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,384
Hello, Norms?

490
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,512
I'm not liking your tone, Lilia.

491
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,223
<i>I was actually about to call you.</i>

492
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,059
Is Lily still not home?

493
00:39:56,602 --> 00:40:00,439
I tried to call Tofy's phone,
and it got cut off.

494
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,732
Was that you?

495
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,984
I've been trying to reach Lily.

496
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:11,033
They have no reason to elope, do they?

497
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,244
No one does that anymore.

498
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,039
I wish they had just eloped instead.

499
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,625
I'm getting nervous, Lilia.

500
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,839
Do you know any police officers?

501
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,676
I know someone.

502
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,594
He's reliable.

503
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,012
I'll call you again, okay?

504
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,403
Do you want some?

505
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,326
It got pretty intense earlier.

506
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,415
Is that how things are with your dad?

507
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,507
I think you'll be better off

508
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,343
once you're out of here.

509
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,265
Babe, I have no idea.

510
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,851
I don't know anything.

511
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,062
Your dad's a real jerk.

512
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,817
But aren't all dads jerks?

513
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,240
But…

514
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,566
The fuck.

515
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,027
Asshole.

516
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,320
Your dad is evil.

517
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,865
But I mean…

518
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,034
Are you being serious?

519
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,253
He's not hiding anymore.

520
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,797
Because he knows he can get away with it.

521
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,717
Excuse me, I'll just mingle.

522
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,100
I didn't recognize you.

523
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,519
Fuck you too, Zulueta.

524
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,277
I have a bad feeling.

525
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,154
Why, how many did you have?

526
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,032
Do you know what happened to Maitem?

527
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,118
Maitem? Who's that?

528
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,912
Jomar.

529
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,164
Oh, Jomar.

530
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,208
Didn't know that fucker has a surname.

531
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,295
Celso called me,
said it was a hit-and-run.

532
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,881
Fuck that hit-and-run.

533
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,008
Is Boss Guilly aware?

534
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,429
I don't want to bother him,
it's the guy's birthday after all.

535
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,181
He doesn't really care.

536
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,974
Especially about Jomar.

537
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,643
Was it actually a hit-and-run?

538
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,520
I saw the body.

539
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,522
It was intentional.

540
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:55,192
It's like you don't even know
who Jomar is.

541
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,653
That bastard has scores to settle.

542
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,698
It was just a matter of time
before someone took him down.

543
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,660
Who would've thought
he'd make it this far?

544
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,162
So true.

545
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,265
Unless of course,
my husband gives his speech, right?

546
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:36,859
My incredibly handsome husband,
our birthday boy, Guilly.

547
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,698
- Happy birthday, Guilly!
- Seriously?

548
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,630
What the fuck, 55!

549
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,302
Let me share this.

550
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:18,358
His dad passed at the age of 48.

551
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,862
Both of them died from cancer.

552
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,533
So when I turned 50,

553
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,955
I made sure I was ready.

554
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,335
It's in the family, we don't live long.

555
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:41,006
It's somewhat reassuring, though.

556
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,675
I figured if I make it to 70,

557
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,179
it'll be tough because no boners for me.

558
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,893
But here we are.

559
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:11,411
It's hard being a Guilly Vega.

560
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,874
And no Guilly Vega is ever complete

561
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,918
without these two.

562
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,837
Katrina.

563
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,714
Nicole.

564
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,354
<i>So friends and partners,</i>

565
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:41,316
<i>this isn't just a birthday.</i>

566
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,770
After this, you're going home. Okay?

567
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,983
<i>So this isn't just a party.</i>

568
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,193
<i>This isn't just a celebration.</i>

569
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,235
Tofy!

570
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,030
Tof!

571
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,533
You're not yet done with him?

572
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,327
- Tof.
- I'm sick of him.

573
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:17,996
Ly…

574
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,212
Lily.

575
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,588
Please stop.

576
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,340
Don't fight back.

577
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,342
- Enough…
- Fuck you.

578
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,718
They said enough.

579
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,719
Enough!

580
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,096
Enough, please.

581
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:35,931
Enough, please.

582
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,310
Fuck you all!

583
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,562
Fuck all of you!

584
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,483
Motherfucker.

585
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,326
Finish it off. I want to go home.

586
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,002
<i>Thanks to all of you.</i>

587
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,255
<i>So I told my staff,</i>

588
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,632
<i>just invite them,</i>

589
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,219
<i>skip the RSVP.</i>

590
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:20,684
<i>If they don't come, fuck, so be it!</i>

591
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,312
<i>It's a gift to have all of you here.</i>

592
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:29,151
So allow me to give back with a gift.

593
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,194
To all of you.

594
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,024
Fuck.

595
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,315
Norms?

596
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,237
Norms?

597
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:57,906
<i>They're…</i>

598
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,408
<i>They're gone.</i>

599
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,227
- You can't go in, ma'am.
- Where's my daughter?

600
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,770
Ma'am, you can't.

601
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,063
Where's my daughter?

602
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,022
My son…

603
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,482
Tofy!

604
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,025
- Is Tofy there?
- Lily!

605
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,652
We're so sorry, ma'am.

606
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,863
- Lily, Lily!
- Ma'am, you can't be here.

607
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,198
- What did they do to my daughter?
- Tofy!

608
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,908
- You're not allowed here.
- Let go of me!

609
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,494
- I need to see him!
- Who did this to my daughter?

610
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,662
Lily!

611
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,955
Is Tofy in there?

612
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,373
Lily!

613
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,376
My Lily!

614
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,878
Lily!

615
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,672
My Lily!

616
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,176
Please.

617
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,720
What…

618
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,889
What have they done to my child?

619
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,265
Lily!

620
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,626
How much is this going to cost this time?

621
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,253
This won't cost us.

622
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,882
Batac will deal with it.

623
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,345
Are you seriously leaving a mess?

624
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,348
There's no mess if someone cleans up.

625
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:32,394
Batac and Sarge leave no trace.

626
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,187
Very much like you.

627
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:38,984
Jigger.

628
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,905
You could stay out of this.

629
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,156
It's all right.

630
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,741
I won't take it personally.

631
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,785
If you want to leave, that's fine.

632
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,706
But of course,
you're welcome to lend a hand.

633
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,251
Hey.

634
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,946
Are you really leaving?

635
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,326
I don't have a choice, Lil.

636
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,955
I might lose it if I stay here.

637
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:40,837
I might lose it in Canada too,
but at least I'll be with family.

638
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,551
Don't you have a family to go to?

639
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,054
They're all gone.

640
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,224
They're all gone, Norms.

641
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,607
Take this.

642
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,362
Who are these names?

643
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,785
I got that from my cousin, the officer.

644
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:17,582
Guilly Vega allegedly paid
these families to remain silent.

645
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,134
I don't think I can do this.

646
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,679
Tofy's gone.

647
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,528
Is this your place?

648
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,494
Lils…

649
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,873
In case you…

650
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,877
If you change your mind…

651
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,632
and use the insurance

652
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:12,011
to rebuild your life, to start over…

653
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,728
you're always welcome with me.

654
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,109
Thank you, Norms.

655
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,696
Thanks for everything.

656
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,282
I wouldn't be here

657
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,784
if it weren't for you.

658
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,962
WOMAN DIES IN A HIT-AND-RUN

659
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,465
A WOMAN WAS FOUND DEAD
AFTER BEING HIT BY A CARGO TRUCK

660
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,133
<i>Tanya Gatdula?</i>

661
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:41,100
ACCORDING TO THE WITNESSES,
TANYA GATDULA, 25…

662
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,647
<i>Tanya Gatdula.</i>

663
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:51,069
At least, you had
plenty of time with Tanya.

664
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,906
But Lily…

665
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,991
I'm sorry for your loss.

666
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,577
I read about it.

667
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,872
It hurts, but at least

668
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,042
her suffering is over.

669
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,087
I hope so.

670
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,552
I mean this with respect…

671
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,846
but…

672
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,935
I believe you're more fortunate.

673
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,312
Because…

674
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:32,443
how they ravaged my daughter…

675
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,328
was no different from killing her.

676
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,919
They left nothing but a lifeless body.

677
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,300
Like a ghost.

678
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,056
There may be a bribe,

679
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,852
but what could be worth

680
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,896
the life of my daughter?

681
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,617
I hope you don't mind me asking.

682
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,744
I don't want to pry,

683
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,498
but are you planning something?

684
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,461
I'm sure it's Vega.

685
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,797
No doubt about that, Mr. Elmer.

686
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,968
Also, Jigger Zulueta.

687
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,347
His right-hand man.

688
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,059
And Celso Batac.

689
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,686
His bodyguard.

690
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,733
Randall Ballesteros.

691
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,776
Yes.

692
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:59,197
He's the police officer handling the case

693
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,367
of my daughter, Lily, and Tofy.

694
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:08,581
You're missing one, Mrs. Lilia.

695
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,208
Who did I miss?

696
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,181
Jomar Maitem.

697
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,436
He's the pimp, the sniper.

698
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,941
He's the captor.

699
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,779
Of all the victims.

700
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,075
Mrs. Lilia.

701
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,870
Whatever you're up to,

702
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,581
could you not

703
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,293
forget about Tanya?

704
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,382
I hope your lawyer's up to it.

705
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,595
A lawyer won't be necessary for my plans.

706
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,309
I've been working on this for a while,

707
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,770
Mr. Elmer.

708
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,692
Mom?

709
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,491
Please don't leave anyone alive.

710
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,814
Promise you'll be back?

711
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,858
You were amazing earlier.

712
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,277
- You're so great.
- I'll see you soon.

713
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,781
See you soon.

714
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,110
Lily Nieves Capistrano.

715
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,364
Christopher John Almario.

716
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,410
Don't you dare forget

717
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:17,580
the names of those
who will send you to your grave.

718
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:18,664
Ma'am.

719
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,083
I'm not as evil as you, Jomar.

720
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,209
Ma'am, please…

721
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,878
If you can run…

722
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:26,088
- Ma'am…
- …go for it.

723
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,214
Sorry, ma'am.

724
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,133
Sorry. Fuck this.

725
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,135
Help!

726
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,471
Ma'am!

727
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,097
Forgive me, ma'am!

728
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,558
Ma'am.

729
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,165
<i>Just four left, sweetie.</i>

730
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,251
Have you seen my knife?

731
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,587
You just brought one?

732
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,255
I have a backup.

733
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,548
I left it here.

734
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,915
This is who you're going
after now, Ballesteros?

735
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:44,792
Come on, Colonel.

736
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,586
Have you forgotten what I'm into?

737
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,673
I know exactly what you're into.

738
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,968
You're no different
from your boss, are you?

739
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,679
He's your boss too, sir.

740
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,850
I don't have a boss.

741
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,570
Fuck you.

742
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,485
Finally.

743
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,034
Do you think he noticed?

744
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,788
He's drunk by now.

745
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:33,979
When were you ever safe?

746
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:39,652
Fair point.

747
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,525
Fuck.

748
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:33,956
Where are we off to?

749
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,462
Aren't you drunk yet? Well, I am.

750
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:56,979
Yeah, I'm just going
to get myself a drink.

751
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,221
You're not my type.

752
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:17,893
Boss, come on.

753
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,144
How much have you had?

754
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:22,940
Relax.

755
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,487
It's me, Jigger.

756
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,074
Fuck, Jigger.

757
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,618
I'm with you. What's going on?

758
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,705
Let's talk it over. Come on.

759
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,376
I know everything.

760
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:49,508
Not everything.

761
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,343
Not everything.

762
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:53,971
- What?
- Randall mentioned that

763
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:55,764
Capistrano's mom is at your party.

764
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,768
I'm not sure what she's up to,

765
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,146
but I bet it's not good.

766
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:03,480
Particularly for you.

767
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,025
Don't worry, I'll take care of her.

768
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,194
I'll finish her. I will.

769
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,493
Why are you telling me all this?

770
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:17,995
Why?

771
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,292
Loyalty, I'm all you've got.

772
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,130
You know, I've been thinking.

773
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,175
So you're avoiding the mess

774
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,972
because you're messing around
with someone else.

775
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,391
I've been keeping tabs on you two.

776
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,560
And you mess around on my birthday?

777
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:43,645
What the fuck, Jigger.

778
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,524
I thought you were into guys.

779
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,235
I really thought so.

780
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,138
Fuck you.

781
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:06,436
Speedball?

782
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,521
It died.

783
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,442
Fuck.

784
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,087
Randall!

785
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,800
What the fuck.

786
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:47,019
You're evil.

787
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,593
Nicole!

788
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,515
Let's get this over with.

789
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:33,231
Lily Nieves Capistrano.

790
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,359
Lily?

791
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:37,986
She's just like you.

792
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:41,907
She had big dreams.

793
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,661
She wanted to finish her studies.

794
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,162
She wanted to work.

795
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:51,041
She wanted to take me to Korea.

796
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:54,211
We were going for a trip.

797
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,258
She and Tofy were supposed to get married.

798
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:05,389
But your fucking father ruined everything.

799
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,976
He defiled Lily.

800
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,104
He treated my daughter like an animal.

801
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:17,984
So you're paying for it.

802
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:21,279
An eye for an eye.

803
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,490
Child for a child.

804
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:38,255
l knew my dad would eventually pay
for everything he did.

805
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:44,594
But I never thought I would pay for it.

806
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,348
Your life isn't enough.

807
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,852
Because of you,

808
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,062
because of your mother,

809
01:18:55,564 --> 01:19:00,444
because of all of you who turned
a blind eye to your father's monstrosity,

810
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:05,157
your lives aren't enough
to repay the victims.

811
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,209
Victims?

812
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,237
As I grew up,

813
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:47,532
shit got worse.

814
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,097
I promised my daughter.

815
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:16,269
I won't leave anyone alive.

816
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,445
Child for a child.

817
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,121
Mrs. Eva Candelaria?

818
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,875
I'll fucking blow your brains out.

819
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:40,460
Lilia Capistrano?

820
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,003
Turn around!

821
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,384
Nicole.

822
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:48,552
Get it.

823
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,303
The gun!

824
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:05,986
Fuck.

825
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,620
Jigger and your mom are fucking.

826
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,080
Do you want me to do nothing?

827
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:19,040
Of course, I had to kill him, right?

828
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:33,263
And you!

829
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:35,891
It's my fucking birthday
and you're causing trouble.

830
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:38,351
Fuck you.

831
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,228
Hey, stop swearing!

832
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,149
How will your students fucking react?

833
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:46,818
How will Lily react?

834
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,487
Don't you dare mention
my child's name here!

835
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,907
Lilia Nieves Capistrano.

836
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,491
Why Lily?

837
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,702
Why my child?

838
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:56,828
Fuck it!

839
01:21:56,912 --> 01:22:00,206
You wouldn't ask that if you knew me!

840
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:02,918
It's my day, and you're ruining it!

841
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,670
So fuck it, I'd really kill you.

842
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:09,925
Come on!

843
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,700
She really takes after me.

844
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,704
Fuck, I'm just getting so excited.
Fucking shit.

845
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,711
You'll finally be reunited
with your daughter.

846
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,182
Nic…

847
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,105
Fuck you, bastard!

848
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,402
You're a devil, a monster!

849
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:11,528
Fuck you!

850
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:18,284
Fuck you!

851
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:49,858
Lilia.

852
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:11,981
<i>I left no one alive, my child.</i>

853
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,610
<i>My life is in their hands now.</i>

854
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,322
<i>They can do whatever they wish.</i>

855
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:21,783
<i>I won't fight back.</i>

856
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,083
<i>Rest now, my child.</i>

857
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,211
<i>I can fly now, Mom.</i>

858
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,131
<i>Thank you.</i>

859
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,299
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

860
01:25:42,178 --> 01:25:43,596
<i>I love you so much.</i>
