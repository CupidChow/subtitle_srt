1
00:00:01,756 --> 00:00:02,618
Ha..

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,421
Bastard..

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,132
That bastard..

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,259
Chew... up..

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,302
You piece of trash

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,305
Sigh..

7
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,101
Huh?

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,687
It's pretty Jaehee

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,235
Another glass, please

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,571
What are you saying..

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,907
If I drink too, who's going to take you home?

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,410
Come on, drink alone?

13
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,328
That's no fun..

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,122
I'm disappointed

15
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,084
It's not even a fun atmosphere today

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,004
What's up today?

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,635
Minjae..

18
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,391
Cheated on me

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,769
What?

20
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,355
He said he was busy with exams

21
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,983
Why did he cheat with another girl at the academy?

22
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,902
Ah..

23
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,653
So?

24
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,406
What do you mean so?

25
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,282
Of course..

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,409
I begged him

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,911
Ah, really..

28
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,789
Why beg?

29
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,666
I really begged him pathetically

30
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,586
That I would do better

31
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,588
Not to leave me

32
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,218
Holding onto his pants

33
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,303
I begged so pathetically

34
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,266
But Minjae wanted to break up

35
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,783
Hey, why are you taking my drink?

36
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,748
You really... never listen to me, do you?

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,291
What?

38
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,336
Since he started changing academies

39
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,004
Didn't I say something was off?

40
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,965
He said he was studying

41
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,966
But instead of studying

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,050
He was hanging out at PC rooms

43
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,927
Didn't I say something was up?

44
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
You did..

45
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,306
I said he looked like a weasel, didn't I?

46
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,185
Hey, don't criticize his looks

47
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,688
He's quite cute and delicate looking

48
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,316
You still say that after what happened?

49
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,945
Ah, seriously..

50
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,532
Why are you so bad at judging guys?

51
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,075
What?

52
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,452
You're not a trash collector

53
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:42,996
Hey

54
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,249
Don't talk like that

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,835
Minjae was nice at first too

56
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,087
I'm not an idiot

57
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,922
Why would I collect trash?

58
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,843
What do you know about love?

59
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,886
I'm leaving

60
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,220
Don't follow me

61
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,225
Ah!

62
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,103
Are you okay?

63
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,524
Are you okay?

64
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,404
Can't you get up?

65
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,866
I think I sprained it

66
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,994
It's swollen here

67
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:26,915
I'm fine

68
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,375
I hate you. Go away

69
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,713
Ah

70
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,261
Okay

71
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,305
I'm sorry

72
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,099
Huh?

73
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,479
Calm down

74
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,440
I was too harsh

75
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,569
Do this quickly

76
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,248
Why?

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,376
You..

78
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,254
What perfume do you wear?

79
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,341
I don't wear perfume

80
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,595
I see

81
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,932
Can you get up?

82
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,948
Ah, it's cold

83
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,618
Cold packs help right after a sprain

84
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,412
Bear with it a little

85
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,471
Why have you been staring at me?

86
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,473
Huh?

87
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,475
Nothing

88
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,063
But..

89
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,065
Yeah?

90
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,193
Why did you like him so much?

91
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,071
Well..

92
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,448
Just..

93
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,824
Because he was nice to me?

94
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,994
I'm nice to you too

95
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,246
Huh?

96
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,915
Even at school

97
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,876
I showed you all my homework

98
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,711
Bought you bread

99
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,423
Wasn't I the nicest to you?

100
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,426
Yeah, you were

101
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,563
Can I take a shower?

102
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,648
Yeah, go ahead

103
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,778
Want to shower together?

104
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,405
Gross, what are you saying

105
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,268
Stop crying in front of me

106
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,687
Huh?

107
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:38,856
When you cry..

108
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,527
I want to hug you

109
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,873
Are you going to avoid me?

110
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,543
You..

111
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,172
Do you like me?

112
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,384
Are you asking because you don't know?

113
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,706
Jaehee, wait

114
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,541
Huh?

115
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,294
I also..

116
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,091
I think I like you

117
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,583
Are you awake?

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,837
Sorry

119
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,591
Hey

120
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,092
I haven't brushed my teeth yet

121
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,427
It's okay

122
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,054
I haven't brushed mine either

123
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,224
Do you know?

124
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,017
What?

125
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,103
You have really long eyelashes

126
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,731
And a really high nose

127
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,234
Why didn't I notice?

128
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,653
You always say I'm pretty

129
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,238
Were you just saying that?

130
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,989
No

131
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,576
I just never looked at you so closely

132
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,163
Do you know?

133
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,623
What?

134
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,376
Your lips are really soft

135
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,086
What?

136
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,631
Your tongue is really soft too

137
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,801
You're saying weird things in the morning

138
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,803
I want to sleep for 5 more minutes

139
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,179
Okay

140
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,776
Aren't you answering?

141
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,281
Who is it that you're not answering?

142
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,495
What?

143
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,706
You haven't blocked him yet?

144
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,208
When would I have had the time?

145
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,377
Want me to do it?

146
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,378
No

147
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,338
If I don't answer, he'll hang up

148
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,052
Why?

149
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,847
Yeah

150
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,640
It's Jae-hee

151
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,725
I heard you broke up with Hye-soo

152
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,351
Why are you calling in the morning?

153
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,853
Hey, stop it

154
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,314
If you cheated, just quietly disappear

155
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,608
Before I really grab you and beat you up

156
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,444
What are you doing!

157
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,321
What are you doing?

158
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,699
Why are you still hesitating?

159
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,492
It's not hesitating

160
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,498
It's obvious

161
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,876
It's clear that you're still shaken by one call from him

162
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,628
It shows that you're still shaken by his call

163
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,463
Hey, Yoo Jae-hee

164
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,174
Who are you to tell me what to do?

165
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
What?

166
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,763
Even though you're my friend

167
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,765
I've been with Min-jae for over a year

168
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,768
Do you think it's easy to end it like that?

169
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,063
What made it so easy for him to cheat on you?

170
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:48,856
What?

171
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,233
Don't be mistaken

172
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,736
He's not sincere with you

173
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,488
Are you stupid?

174
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,491
You said you liked me

175
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,409
Isn't that enough?

176
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,244
Why are you wavering?

177
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,413
Yeah

178
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,123
I like you

179
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,792
As a friend

180
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,587
What, a friend?

181
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,964
Don't exaggerate

182
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,592
I only think of you as a friend

183
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,017
I'm sick, buy me some medicine

184
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,107
I can't go now, I have a test tomorrow..

185
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,883
I can't walk

186
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,737
Hye-soo

187
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:01,989
Hye-soo

188
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,783
Yeah

189
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,577
I bought some medicine

190
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,580
Take the medicine

191
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,938
You'll feel better soon

192
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,939
Get some more sleep

193
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,942
How did you come?

194
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,985
How else

195
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,697
I was worried about you so I came home

196
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,408
With such a high fever

197
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,118
You should have called an ambulance

198
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,871
Or called me

199
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,415
How could I call you

200
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,417
I have no face to show you

201
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,213
At least you know you have no face to show

202
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,550
I'm glad

203
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,635
That I found you

204
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,388
I'm sorry

205
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,306
For what?

206
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,891
Just

207
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,977
For everything today

208
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,566
It's okay, just lie down again

209
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,776
Stop talking

210
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,988
Lie down next to me

211
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,114
I'm cold

212
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,164
I'm cold

213
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,666
Hold me

214
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,260
Jae-hee

215
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,052
Yeah?

216
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,388
Why do you like me?

217
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,141
Um..

218
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,935
Kind and

219
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,354
Innocent and

220
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,690
Something..

221
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,110
Feels like I need to protect you?

222
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,407
Is that really liking you?

223
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,534
Not just feeling sorry?

224
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,703
What?

225
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,371
Why are you pitiful?

226
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,917
Always meeting weird guys

227
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,835
Getting dumped and crying

228
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,836
Right?

229
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,549
So you thought I liked you?

230
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,637
Actually

231
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,640
I like you because you're pretty

232
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,644
You're so pretty

233
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,609
I'm weird

234
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,610
Hm?

235
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,614
I feel tingly from head to toe

236
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,700
My heart is beating too fast

237
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,162
Is it because of a fever?

238
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,835
How about now?

239
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,004
It's gotten worse

240
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,325
Take a picture of me.

241
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,410
Okay.

242
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,873
Pretend you're looking somewhere else.

243
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,375
Naturally.

244
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,710
Like this?

245
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,211
Yes, that's right.

246
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,839
As if you're lost in thought.

247
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,757
Good.

248
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,137
Think of a funny story I told and laugh.

249
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,017
It's so funny.

250
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,768
Did it turn out well?

251
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,811
Yes.

252
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,480
Awesome.

253
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,107
They all turned out well.

254
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,110
I took it without a filter.

255
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,070
You look prettier without the filter.

256
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,698
Oh, Yoo Jae-hee.

257
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,699
Come here.

258
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,952
Let's take a picture together.

259
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,546
Hey, someone is watching.

260
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,798
So what?

261
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,675
I'm going to the bathroom.

262
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,201
Congratulations on your acceptance -UBC Admissions-

263
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,554
What is it?

264
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,140
Ah.

265
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,977
Actually, I've been preparing to be an exchange student.

266
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,563
So?

267
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,691
I got a text saying I was accepted.

268
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,277
Isn't that a good thing?

269
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,570
Then why do you look like that?

270
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,619
I'm not going anyway.

271
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,287
I've decided not to go.

272
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,082
Why?

273
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,460
Just because.

274
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,255
Aren't you hungry?

275
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,840
Should I buy you a cake?

276
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,093
It's really hard to get accepted, right?

277
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,929
You worked hard and got accepted, so why not go?

278
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,348
Just because.

279
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,058
It costs a lot of money to go.

280
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,272
Don't worry because I'm not going.

281
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,743
Why is mom making a fuss when I'm not going?

282
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,457
Plans can change.

283
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,252
Why feel sorry for what you prepared?

284
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,088
Even if you go, it won't be much of a credential.

285
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,136
I'll look for something else to do here.

286
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,763
Stop worrying.

287
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,779
Jae-hee.

288
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,572
Yes?

289
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,783
Exchange student.

290
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,622
I think you should just go.

291
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,669
I said I'm not going.

292
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,424
The school you got accepted to is really good.

293
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,719
I'm sure it will be good for you if you go.

294
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,721
Why are you doing this?

295
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,890
I already decided not to go.

296
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,185
So why? When?

297
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,063
Ah, that...

298
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,107
Don't tell me...

299
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,736
Are you not going because of me?

300
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,530
No, it's not that.

301
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,449
I knew it.

302
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,368
You're not going because of me, right?

303
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,745
What if it's because of you?

304
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,330
Is it wrong?

305
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,706
Yes, it is.

306
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,292
Why waste such a good opportunity because of me?

307
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,255
I'm wasting it because of you.

308
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,422
Because it's you.

309
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,716
Why are you doing this?

310
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,509
What?

311
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,636
If I don't go, it would be good for you too, right?

312
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,513
We can go on more dates.

313
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,350
You don't trust me, do you?

314
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,810
What?

315
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,356
You're worried that I'll meet someone else if you leave.

316
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,401
That's why you're not going, right?

317
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,864
Because there's still no trust between us.

318
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,408
I know you're doing this.

319
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,743
But this is not right.

320
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,081
Don't postpone your plans because of me.

321
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,292
I feel pressured.

322
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,627
Pressure?

323
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,673
You and I are on different paths.

324
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,968
I'm not even attending school.

325
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,971
You're smart and have a lot to do.

326
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,600
I don't want to be a bad influence on you.

327
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,853
Does this make you feel pressured?

328
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,272
That's not what I meant.

329
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,484
You really don't know how I feel.

330
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,737
So it is burdensome.

331
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,991
Honestly, I think you're right.

332
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,578
I'm worried about leaving you here alone.

333
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,621
I worry you might contact your ex because you're lonely.

334
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,373
Or that you might drink and cry again,

335
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,500
and end up with another guy.

336
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,128
Are you done talking?

337
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,296
Why?

338
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,297
Are you confident?

339
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,757
Even after showing me that side of you?

340
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,634
Even after showing me that side of you?

341
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,223
I'll go.

342
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,867
Oh.. the smell of alcohol.

343
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,412
I hate you.

344
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,331
Yeah.

345
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,957
I'm sorry.

346
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,252
I spoke too harshly.

347
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,129
I don't know..

348
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,845
Don't try to brush it off.

349
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,182
You caught me?

350
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,892
I said I'm sorry.

351
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,893
What?

352
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,187
So what are you going to do?

353
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,901
I'm not going this semester.

354
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,529
I'll spend this semester with you.

355
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,531
I'll go next semester.

356
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,698
Really?

357
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,699
Yes.

358
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,244
I already talked to the school.

359
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,246
Don't worry.

360
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,540
Even if you cry and tell me not to go then, I'll go.

361
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,041
I won't cry.

362
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,635
I'm sorry too.

363
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,637
For what?

364
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,516
For saying it was a burden.

365
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,479
I felt bad for having a negative impact on you.

366
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,609
But you...

367
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,362
Why do you look pretty even when you're angry?

368
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,364
What are you talking about?

369
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,747
What are you doing?

370
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,834
You look like a goldfish.

371
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,773
Ah...

372
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,484
I have to go to work.

373
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,736
Is it that time already?

374
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,697
Looks like it.

375
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,991
When are you going home?

376
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:54,868
Me?

377
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,078
Should I not go?

378
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,414
Want to stay at home?

379
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,290
Yeah.

380
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,918
I have to take the bus for an hour.

381
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,169
I'm really tired.

382
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,088
Then do your homework at home

383
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,840
and sleep if you're sleepy.

384
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,425
I'll be back.

385
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,468
Take care.

386
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,204
I'm back.

387
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:21,830
You're back?

388
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,539
Yeah.

389
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,584
Wow.

390
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,586
What's this? Is this our house?

391
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,838
An elf must have come by.

392
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,382
What? When did you clean everything?

393
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,342
I did it quickly.

394
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,093
Are you tired?

395
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,136
Yeah.

396
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,805
Night shifts are so exhausting.

397
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,807
So many difficult customers.

398
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,267
Good job. Did you eat?

399
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,852
I did.

400
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,604
Wasn't cleaning hard?

401
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,314
Not at all.

402
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,816
Should we

403
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,651
live together?

404
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,486
What?

405
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,990
The school isn't too far.

406
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,991
Hmm...

407
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,702
It's hard to match our schedules.

408
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,079
If we live together, we can see each other more often.

409
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,997
I think it would be nice.

410
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,749
Oh.

411
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,293
And you,

412
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,628
How about going back to school?

413
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,338
School?

414
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,215
Yeah, it's too wasteful to spend your time like this.

415
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,343
I shortlisted some schools.

416
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,261
Your grades aren't bad,

417
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,638
So there are many places you can go.

418
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,932
How about this one?

419
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,017
It's close.

420
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,518
The tuition isn't expensive.

421
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,521
Jaehee, I'm not going to school.

422
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:29,773
Why not?

423
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,441
These days, cyber universities are good.

424
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,653
No, Jaehee.

425
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,072
I'm not going to school.

426
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,115
I'll be fine without going.

427
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,369
What's fine about it?

428
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,163
You might think it's okay now because you're young,

429
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,666
And you have some money saved up from part-time jobs.

430
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,919
But we won't be in our twenties forever.

431
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,797
Will you still be working part-time jobs in your thirties?

432
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,924
What's wrong with that?

433
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,217
What?

434
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,512
What's wrong with working part-time jobs forever?

435
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,807
I may be like this now,

436
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,141
But if I find something I want to do later,

437
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,559
I can do something else then.

438
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,270
To do what you want later,

439
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,855
You at least need to graduate from college.

440
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,524
That way, it'll be easier for you to choose later.

441
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,567
No, I said I'm not going.

442
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,404
Just because you want to work for a big company,

443
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,446
Does that mean I have to do the same?

444
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,407
That's not what I meant.

445
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,494
Do you want to live with me?

446
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,747
So I have to match your level?

447
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,459
There you go again.

448
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,128
You know that's not what I meant.

449
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,756
Sigh...

450
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,217
Alright, let's stop.

451
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,386
I'm tired too.

452
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,408
Do you have a lot of homework left?

453
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,701
Huh?

454
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:05,869
A little.

455
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,162
Why?

456
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:08,997
Then can I

457
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,707
Go meet a friend nearby?

458
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,001
A friend?

459
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,835
Who?

460
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,003
Someone you don't know.

461
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,964
I have a friend you don't know?

462
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,299
Yes, of course.

463
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,135
The ones I worked with at the buffet before.

464
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,058
Okay.

465
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,313
I'll be back.

466
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,256
What's this?

467
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,884
Why hasn't there been any contact?

468
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,726
Hello?

469
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,186
Yeah.

470
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,437
Where are you?

471
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,730
Why aren't you coming?

472
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,399
I'm here at the bar with my friends~!

473
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,692
Did you drink?

474
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,152
Yeah! Just a little!

475
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,695
Did you finish your homework?

476
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,696
Yeah.

477
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,989
I finished it.

478
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,034
You should at least tell me if you're going somewhere.

479
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,954
Sorry. Do you want to join?

480
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,914
No.

481
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,125
I'll go to your place first then.

482
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,378
Okay, I'll be back soon!

483
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,647
You weren't sleeping?

484
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,067
Don't you have work in the morning?

485
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,318
Yeah.

486
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,570
Right.

487
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,031
But how can you drink so much?

488
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,074
Oh my...

489
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,367
Are you my mom?

490
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,828
Why do you keep nagging?

491
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,371
It's fine.

492
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,212
You don't like me, do you?

493
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,548
What?

494
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,385
Always working part-time, hanging out, drinking,

495
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,055
Living like a loafer, it frustrates you, right?

496
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,100
I know everything.

497
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,061
It's all written on your face.

498
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,815
I've never said that.

499
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,651
What's written?

500
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,488
You want to live with me.

501
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:48,907
Right?

502
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,326
That's because...

503
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,369
I like you.

504
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,290
Do you think we can live like this together forever?

505
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,375
Do you think we can live like this together forever?

506
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,461
What do you mean?

507
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,965
Do you think we can live like this together forever?

508
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,301
If we like each other?

509
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,890
Oh, you're so smart...

510
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,099
You

511
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,810
Later, when you get older,

512
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,729
You'll be pressured to get married.

513
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,232
Can you endure that?

514
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,859
What will you say?

515
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,153
I'll just say I'm a non-marriage advocate.

516
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,200
So let's say you live with me.

517
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,288
Working part-time jobs all the time,

518
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,540
Eventually, you won't even be able to do part-time jobs.

519
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,669
Can you handle that?

520
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,253
That's why I keep telling you to go to school.

521
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,255
That's why I keep telling you to go to school.

522
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,759
The point is different.

523
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,845
You're trying to change me

524
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,640
To keep me by your side.

525
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,108
I'm not going to change.

526
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,695
As you know,

527
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,699
My world is narrower than yours.

528
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,160
That's who I am.

529
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,373
What will you do?

530
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,960
Will you quit now?

531
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,920
What?

532
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,301
Are you serious?

533
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,804
Yes.

534
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:39,017
You know the saying "truth comes out when you're drunk," right?

535
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,812
I'm telling you with courage.

536
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,815
Won't you regret it?

537
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,067
No.

538
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,405
You're amazing, really.

539
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,825
Why are you always so confident and proud?

540
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,828
Do you think I'm easy because I like you more?

541
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,044
You have so many ways to hurt me.

542
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,923
Thanks to you, I've had a good experience.

543
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,887
Thank you.

544
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,543
If you cry...

545
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,172
I want to hug you.

546
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,926
I'm glad

547
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,136
That I found you.
