1
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,480
Master!

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,440
Master

3
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,880
It's all packed up.

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,200
When are we leaving?

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,160
Right now.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,160
Tonight,

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,040
the people of Jinshan will transport the gold out of the city.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,320
To be safe,

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,880
we'll go to Jinshan first.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,080
Let's wait for them there.

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,000
Well,

13
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,960
Miss Situ,

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't have time for her.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,440
That loser.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,080
Let's go.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:11,960
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,720
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,080
Is this the Qingcheng of Sheng Xuan State?

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,840
It's so special.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,600
Of course.

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,720
Yes, it is.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,400
Look. It's here. It's here.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,560
Look at this. Look at this. It's here. It's here.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,720
Look at these.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,759
Now, you're hitting their faces.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,240
I did.

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,200
I heard that the seventh princess

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,640
has also won

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,680
the best in the world.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,880
Of course.

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
Look who gave birth to her.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,240
Okay.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Go check it out.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,080
You two.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,200
What are you doing here?

37
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,200
Mutton skewers. Mutton skewers.

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,440
Barbecue.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Barbecues

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,680
Have a look.

41
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,800
Sir, take a look.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,040
What is this?

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,360
This is our new mutton skewers.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
Mutton skewers.

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,400
Roasted skewers

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,120
Have a taste

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,960
Have a taste.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,200
Give us one.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,320
OK.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,960
Here you go.

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,840
How do we eat this?

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
This is our new way of eating

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
You can just lift it up.

54
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,520
Enjoy.

55
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay.

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,400
Have a seat.

57
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,240
Do you want one? Yes.

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,960
Yes, I want it.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,680
One, please.

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,480
Okay.

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,160
Add more chili.

62
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,080
You want to add vinegar?

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,920
Okay.

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,560
Delicious.

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,640
This is better than

66
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,079
It's delicious.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,240
Boss, 50 more skewers.

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,360
Father's voice.

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
Father.

70
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,640
It's His Majesty!

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,600
It's His Majesty! It's His Majesty!

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,840
My peach!

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,520
I miss you so much, Father.

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,920
You finally came to see me, Father.

76
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,480
This is...

77
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,079
Who is this?

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,839
Who did this to my princess?

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,480
It's fine. Father has passed.

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,120
My peach.

81
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,360
Don't be afraid.

82
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,720
Father is here.

83
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,680
Father.

84
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
I won't let anyone bully you anymore.

85
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't even protect my own daughter.

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,480
What's the use of this empire?

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,960
Enough, Father.

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,320
I'm fine now.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Get up, everyone.

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,159
Thank you, Your Majesty.

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,440
They all went to the snack stall.

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
The street is empty now.

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,800
Guys, go!

94
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,320
Come on.

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,480
Go!

96
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,360
Stop. Don't move.

97
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,040
Get down. Get down.

98
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Hold your head. Squat down.

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,320
Hurry.

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,320
Why are you out in the middle of the night?

101
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,159
Aren't you going to eat snacks?

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,720
Take him down!

103
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,200
Father.

104
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Try this. This is my best fried rice.

105
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,400
Really

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,480
Let me try

107
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,200
How is it?

108
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,280
Delicious.

109
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
I didn't expect

110
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,440
I haven't seen my peach for so long.

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,920
has grown up.

112
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,840
Of course.

113
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,600
You can cook

114
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,120
And it's so delicious.

115
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,280
Your Majesty.

116
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,920
How is it going?

117
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,880
All the traitors of Kim have been wiped out.

118
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,360
All right!

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,120
Good job.

120
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,600
You two...

121
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,880
behind my back?

122
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,720
Here.

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,320
is a secret

124
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
between us men.

125
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,000
Tell me.

126
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,400
Do you have any secrets behind my back?

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,320
Don't worry.

128
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,320
I won't keep any secrets from you.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I told you.

130
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,440
love

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,000
needs to be cultivated slowly.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,640
fireworks.

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,400
Look.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
So beautiful

135
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,680
This is...

136
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,200
Father, you came at the right time.

137
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,120
Today is the day Seijoh is celebrating a great harvest.

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,040
Yeah?

139
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,400
So beautiful.

140
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,400
Okay.

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,720
Let's celebrate together.

142
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
Your Majesty.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,400
I...

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,600
I can't drink anymore.

145
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,760
Drink a hammer.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,680
Look over there.

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,960
Okay.

148
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,920
Is that His Majesty?

149
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,480
I think so.

150
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,320
By the grace of the heavens,

151
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,920
to open a trade route

152
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,880
to promote trade exchange.

153
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,640
And the whole country will launch a retirement policy

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
to help the people grow old.

155
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,720
and rely on the elderly.

156
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,640
Third, you're His Majesty's son.

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
He won't do anything to you.

158
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm leaving.

159
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
King, as the saying goes,

160
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,160
You've worked hard even without credit.

161
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,280
For the sake of my diligence,

162
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,800
I don't want much.

163
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,240
Just give me three boxes of gold.

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,760
How about this?

165
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,320
Give a big house

166
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,080
Two hundred and fifty sheep.

167
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,480
And ten cows.

168
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,680
to gather 500 animals.

169
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
That's enough.

170
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,280
King

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,240
King!

172
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,440
Erniang, you take care of this.

173
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,760
Take him out and feed the wolves.

174
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,600
Yes.

175
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,160
Why do you turn your back on me?

176
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:16,760
Let's go.

177
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,520
You can't do this.

178
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,680
You can't do this

179
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,560
You can't do this.

180
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,440
I did a good job.

181
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,160
Here we are.

182
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,040
What are you looking at? Get off.

183
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
Where am I?

184
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,400
Don't go.

185
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,840
Where is this place?

186
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,320
Give me some food.

187
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,480
Come on. Come on.

188
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,720
Brother.

189
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,480
Brother.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,440
Why are you demoted too?

191
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,720
Brother. Brother.

192
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,600
Brother.

193
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,880
Father, are you addicted to demoting a prince?

194
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,560
Your Highness! Your Highness!

195
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,960
This mission is harder than last time.

196
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,440
