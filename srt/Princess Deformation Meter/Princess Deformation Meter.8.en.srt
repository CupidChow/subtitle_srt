1
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,440
This way, please.

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,720
Princess, are you...

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,120
Sit down.

4
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,320
Have some cakes.

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,600
No, no, no.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,360
Let me give you a massage.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,440
Princess.

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,320
You've wronged me.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,000
Did I do something wrong?

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,560
Please tell me if I did something wrong.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,800
Officer Shan, get up.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,240
Come on, get up.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,680
If you need anything, just tell me.

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,280
I'll do my best.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,720
Let me ask you.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,640
after I came to Qingcheng?

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,920
After I opened this nursing home,

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
did I contribute to Seijoh?

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,200
As the magistrate of Seijoh,

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,160
Shouldn't you do something for Seijoh?

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,280
Lend me some money.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
Mo Li and I really don't have money.

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,520
We didn't expect

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,039
to open a nursing home.

25
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,000
But I really have no money.

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
I'm an upright official.

27
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,240
Why are you so stingy as a man?

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,160
I'm so angry.

29
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,160
Your Highness.

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,160
What do you think? Let me give you a suggestion.

31
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:45,960
Go ahead.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,039
If you can't do it, just do a side job.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
and set up a stall.

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,479
Are you crazy?

35
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,360
As a princess, you want me to run a stall?

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,120
Only when you get the money,

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,120
in your pocket.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,680
You have a point.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,640
Look. That's the point.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,280
You can drink anytime you want.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,720
How is it?

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,320
It tastes good.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,000
This design is quite delicate.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
How did you come up with this idea?

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,360
Rumor has it that I am a delicate and lazy cook.

46
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,079
In terms of eating,

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,480
in eating.

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,800
I'm ashamed.

49
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
I invented this

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,920
was invented in school.

51
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,920
You skipped class for convenience.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,440
You're really ignorant.

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
Let me guess.

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,440
it can make money.

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
It's related to science.

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,320
It's not enough to make money.

57
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,760
We need to promote it.

58
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,800
Look at this. Look at this.

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,280
Mr Mo.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
What am I to you?

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,360
You are my little green vase

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,160
So I'm a green bottle of milk tea.

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,960
Then I can hold you in my hands.

64
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,440
Green bottle milk tea.

65
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,960
Drink a sip until 99

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,680
It's worth it to have a drink.

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,640
Welcome.

68
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,800
Here you go. Here you go.

69
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,480
I'll buy it.

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,560
Here you go.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
Please.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,720
Me too.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,040
Give me one.

74
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,320
Save one for me.

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,200
Who are you to me?

76
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,360
You are my best friend.

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
You two are too sweet. What is this?

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,480
This is called green bottle milk tea.

79
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,480
It's the most popular in Seijoh. It's the best in the world.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,280
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

81
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,120
and you'll have to drink it. You'll have to drink it.

82
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,360
And then, we'll drink it. We'll drink it. We'll drink it. We'll drink it. We'll drink it. We'll drink it. We'll drink it. We'll drink it.

83
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
It's good. It's good. It's good.

84
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,600
Okay, I'll try it.

85
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,040
How is it? Is it good?

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
Yes.

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,040
Right?

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,920
Miss!

89
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,600
Miss, bad news!

90
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,040
Bad news!

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,080
What's the matter? Why are you in a hurry?

92
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,720
Miss, do you know who is selling the milk tea?

93
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,920
It has nothing to do with me.

94
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,280
The princess is selling milk tea.

95
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,640
What?

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,240
Is she out of her mind?

97
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,280
Uncle, you told me to look up.

98
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,520
That stupid princess opened a milk tea shop.

99
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,760
She's stealing business from us again.

100
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,080
It's just a stall.

101
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,680
Is it that serious?

102
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,560
Why not?

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,440
Uncle, I just can't stand her.

104
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,040
Uncle.

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,880
Help me.

106
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
Please help me.

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,760
Uncle is the best.

108
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,960
You're a lady from a noble family.

109
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,000
All of them.

110
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,080
Delicious

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,840
Give me one.

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay. Okay.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,560
A cup of red bean milk tea.

114
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,320
Give me a straw.

115
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay. Okay.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,400
Here you go. Here you go.

117
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,440
Here's your red bean milk. It's here. It's here.

118
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,960
A straw.

119
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,840
It's really good.

120
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,240
Thank you.

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,760
Take it.

122
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Drink more

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,720
Give me one

124
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,320
Here's your red bean milk tea.

125
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,680
Thank you.

126
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,800
Stop

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
Don't sell it

128
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,360
I suspect your milk tea

129
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,120
plagiarized and misled people to fall in love.

130
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,480
It affects family harmony.

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,760
Let me tell you now.

132
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,040
Don't set up stall on the street.

133
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
Take it away.

134
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,880
You...

135
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,280
Don't affect our law enforcement, okay?

136
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,840
Give it back to us!

137
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,600
Robbery in broad daylight

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,480
Let's go! Let's go!

139
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,920
Forget it.

140
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,160
I used to bully others.

141
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,400
I can only be bullied.

142
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,240
A soldier can be killed but not humiliated.

143
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Let alone a princess.

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,920
We share the same view. Let's go.

145
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,840
Ma has long heard that you're corrupted.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,159
How dare you bully me?

147
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,080
Princess, hurry up.

148
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,760
Get changed.

149
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,880
Get out!

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,400
You're killing me.

151
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,360
I can't stand it.

152
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
I want to hit him! I can't stand it!

153
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,760
I know.

154
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,280
Awesome!

155
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,520
Come on. Come on.

156
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,480
What should we do now?

157
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
Since we're not allowed to set up the commercial street,

158
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,720
it's more convenient for us to place it in front of our house.

159
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,520
But it's not as crowded as the streets.

160
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,520
You're just a magistrate

161
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,280
All right.

162
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,560
We'll find a way to get more people.

163
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,440
Yes, we can attract everyone

164
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
to create a business circle.

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,080
What circle?

166
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,360
Come here.

167
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,559
Let's eat. Let's eat.

168
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,159
I'm waiting for you.

169
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
I'll eat it.

170
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,120
I'll eat it.

171
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,480
Nonsense.

172
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,440
Princess Snack Street is open!

173
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,680
Okay.

174
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,680
Welcome to the princess's world.

175
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,320
Let's get to work.

176
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,800
Your fried rice.

177
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,680
Eat more.

178
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,280
The stir-fry dish we want

179
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,360
Coming right up.

180
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,800
Princess Snack Street

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,680
I'll give you a palace-like experience.

182
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,560
It not only stimulates your taste buds,

183
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,760
but also a visual feast.

184
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
That's it

185
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,960
This roast duck is good

186
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,920
Uncle.

187
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,520
Eat it

188
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,240
It's delicious

189
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,880
How does it taste

190
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,080
