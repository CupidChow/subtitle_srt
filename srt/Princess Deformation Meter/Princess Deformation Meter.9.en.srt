1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
What do you think?

2
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,120
Am I good at making money?

3
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,200
Whoever marries me in the future

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,280
he'll be lucky.

5
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,440
Why do you want to get married?

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,560
No.

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,320
This is a metaphor.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,240
Okay, it's late.

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,560
Let's call it a day.

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,600
Go back and rest early.

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,200
Okay.

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,600
Thank you.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,120
Thank you, princess.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,880
You're welcome.

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,240
Thank you.

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,240
Take care.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:16,840
Okay.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,360
So beautiful

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,160
The embroidery is better than the one in the palace.

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
It's left by my ancestors.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,920
It's a pity that it's in my generation.

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,039
It's going to break.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,600
Why?

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Young people have gone out to work

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,120
No one learns this nowadays.

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,200
Seijoh is famous for making clothes.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,520
used to be famous for making clothes.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
Now there's no glory of the past.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,120
What a pity.

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,200
Your Highness, why don't we recruit some apprentices?

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,840
Disciples?

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,960
Yes, culture needs to be passed down.

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,920
I think you can do it.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Look at you.

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
Okay, let's recruit apprentices.

36
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,840
Great!

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,720
This is also a way to make money.

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,160
Look.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,320
The princess wants apprentices to make delicious food.

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,120
The princess recruits young apprentices to make clothes.

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,600
to do business.

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,680
Miss, she has a new trick.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,079
The princess recruits young apprentices to cook delicious food.

44
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,400
The princess recruits young apprentices

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,360
and learn to do business.

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,360
Great

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,320
This is a good thing.

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
I have to find my sons

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,440
to learn how to do business.

50
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,240
Who can earn money from their own family?

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,280
You're right. Let's go.

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm so mad!

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,600
Sheng Tao Tao is so annoying.

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,360
She recruits apprentices and runs night markets.

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
Do you really think this is your home?

56
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,840
Uncle, do you care?

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,440
Calm down.

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
In order to deal with her,

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,520
Uncle specially made a three-step plan.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,960
Three steps?

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,079
Which three steps?

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,680
The first step.

63
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
Step two.

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,160
Step three.

65
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
What?

66
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,120
Princess, hurry.

67
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Have a taste of the new cake.

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm busy.

69
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,680
What are you doing?

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Seijoh Town!

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,680
Why are there so many small houses?

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,240
And a bridge!

73
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,120
This is a small version of Seijoh, right?

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
Yeah.

75
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,080
I'm building Seijoh!

76
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,839
The princess is amazing!

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,000
Of course.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,959
Princess.

79
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,839
Bad news!

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,720
What's wrong, Mrs. Wang? Slow down.

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,760
Someone sued us.

82
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,520
He said he ate the snack from our night market.

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,960
He had diarrhea.

84
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,760
What?

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
Magistrate Shan...

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,680
is heading this way.

87
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,480
Make a decision.

88
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,080
Let's go.

89
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,200
What happened?

90
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,880
Princess.

91
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,280
Someone reported that you are not hygienic.

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,120
We have no choice but to do it impartially.

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,280
So your night market will be closed for five days.

94
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,040
What?

95
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,040
Five days.

96
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
My ingredients are all broken.

97
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
Who reported it?

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
A warm-hearted citizen.

99
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,000
But I think he must have been instigated.

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
A poor family

101
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,680
suddenly began to wear silk clothes.

102
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,920
I'm sure he got something from him.

103
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,440
No.

104
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,960
Then why do you want us to close for five days?

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,200
I know.

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,760
There's no evidence.

107
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
And they said it was a gift from his aunt.

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,680
So I just followed the rules.

109
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,080
Not bad.

110
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,720
Princess,

111
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,440
We all saw the leaflets of recruiting apprentices.

112
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,000
and came back from other places.

113
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,600
I want to find a way out with you.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,960
and make money.

115
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
OK. OK.

116
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,320
Your Highness.

117
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,360
Our night market has just been closed down.

118
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,400
There are so many people here. What should we do?

119
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,400
Beautiful. The more, the stronger.

120
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,760
This time,

121
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,159
Let's play a big one.

122
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,400
Big one. Yes.

123
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,840
Does everyone have a good image?

124
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,120
Dongsheng.

125
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,920
Show them around.

126
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Ask them to choose a skill to learn.

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,320
After they master it,

128
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll personally

129
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
open a shop for you.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,160
After that,

131
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
we'll get 28.

132
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,600
28.

133
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,720
Who is the second?

134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,840
Who is the second princess?

135
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,840
Me. Me.

136
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,200
Princess Two

137
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,320
Princess Two will do.

138
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,800
OK.

139
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,880
Okay. Okay.

140
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,640
Go.

141
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,640
Thank you, princess.

142
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,760
Come with me.

143
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,320
Let's go.

144
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Come on. Study hard.

145
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,400
Okay.

146
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,800
Two.

147
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,960
Two.

148
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,120
Aren't you afraid that they'll learn how to cook?

149
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,400
you won't make money.

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,360
What are you afraid of?

151
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
I wish they

152
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,880
to make Princess Snacks famous.

153
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,159
It's best to open it to another country.

154
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,080
I see.

155
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,080
Then I can

156
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
I can earn money by lying down.

157
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,440
You're such a money-grubber.

158
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,480
What do you know?

159
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,480
This is called promoting economic development.

160
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,720
Two letters.

161
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,040
One.

162
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
is from the Noble Consort.

163
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,360
A letter

164
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,840
It's from the Princess of Jinshan.

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
Uncle, you have a wide way.

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,360
Are you familiar with these people?

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,440
The internal scroll is serious.

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,600
It's too hard for me.

169
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
It's too hard.

170
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,280
This...

171
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,320
Who knows

172
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,600
Who knows?

173
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
What is it?

174
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,680
Uncle.

175
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,800
Just tell me.

176
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
Uncle.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,920
Actually,

178
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,600
there is a gold mine

179
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
under Qingshan County.

180
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
gold mine.

181
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,000
What about them?

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,920
It means

183
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,760
quietly

184
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
to help them transport the gold mine.

185
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,520
This is a top secret.

186
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,600
You must keep it a secret.

187
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,120
Erniang!

188
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,039
When we get all the Mines from Seijoh,

189
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,840
I'll turn all my toys

190
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,440
into gold.

191
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,840
Not only toys

192
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,080
The whole house will be made of gold.

193
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
Great!

194
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,560
