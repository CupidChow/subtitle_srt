1
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,080
What are you doing?

2
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,440
This is my Fantasy City.

3
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:15,800
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,000
To see Miss Situ.

5
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:17,840
I...

6
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm here to apologize to you.

7
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,240
What's the point of an apology?

8
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,400
Don't stand here. You're in the way.

9
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,600
This...

10
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,320
Why are you so tired?

11
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,360
Really

12
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,880
Don't worry, people from Jinshan

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,560
Why are we in a hurry?

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,120
Uncle.

15
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,400
They are all tortured by the princess.

16
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,280
They have to dig mine after work during the day.

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,720
We can't handle the iron body.

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,600
We can't control it.

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,360
We can't control the people of Jinshan.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,680
Write a letter to their master.

21
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,720
Let's go home and sleep.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,320
Let's go.

23
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,960
Do you have humanity?

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
You do this every day.

25
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,400
Do you still want to live?

26
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,280
I quit.

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,800
Do whatever you want.

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,800
Your Highness. Your Highness.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,920
I heard that the seventh princess

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,320
as slaves.

31
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,240
Bitch!

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,640
Why don't we kill the seventh princess?

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,560
Aren't you afraid of war with Sheng Xuan State?

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,400
It's fine. You're here.

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,880
Send this to Qingcheng.

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,600
Find a way to make the peach drink it.

37
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,280
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

38
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,800
[It's called "The Talismans".] [It's called "The Talismans of the Talismans".]

39
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,120
This poison is called Wangchuan River.

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,520
Only the two of us have it.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Tell them it's from Noble Consort Wan.

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,600
Yes.

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,400
Go. Go. Go. Go.

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,400
Next one.

45
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,840
Open it and let me see

46
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,800
Look at this. Look at this.

47
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,280
Be sensible.

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,640
Come on. Next.

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,120
Come on.

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,600
Let's go. Next.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,520
Noble Consort ordered me to deliver this.

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,320
Find a way to make the princess drink it.

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,000
This is...

54
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,040
You don't need to know.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,440
Okay. Okay.

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
See you.

57
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,040
Not bad.

58
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,400
This embroidery is really good.

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,080
Thank you, princess.

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,480
Why do you have dark circles under your eyes?

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,159
It's like the national treasure in the palace.

62
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
Don't stay up late, young people.

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,880
Did you do something else

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,920
behind my back?

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,360
No, no, no.

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,200
Dongsheng

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
Go make some ribs soup for them.

68
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,280
Okay, princess.

69
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
Thank you, princess.

70
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,200
Keep it up.

71
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,159
Come on.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,640
Come on. Come on.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,120
Come on! Come on!

74
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,600
The princess is so nice to us.

75
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,240
Are you still angry?

76
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,480
This is for you.

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,680
Let me tell you.

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,520
Don't try to bribe me with something.

79
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Mo Li!

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,880
Look.

81
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
Are you kissing each other?

82
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,480
We've been through it.

83
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,159
It's okay. Don't be shy.

84
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,200
Don't misunderstand us.

85
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
We've been through this.

86
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,680
Don't be shy.

87
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,080
Yeah.

88
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,920
Let's go. Okay.

89
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,600
Thank you, boss.

90
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,720
Take care.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
Take care.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,680
Boss, did you make this jar?

93
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,600
Princess, this is a can made by my family.

94
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,120
What's wrong?

95
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,280
Your jar can magnify things.

96
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,840
I want to change it

97
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,200
a round thin piece.

98
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,040
Can I do it

99
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,720
Sure, wait a moment.

100
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,480
Okay.

101
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,040
You can do it, princess! You can do it!

102
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,120
Great.

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,520
Dongsheng is amazing.

104
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,680
Go over there.

105
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,080
What's in your hand?

106
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,200
None of your business.

107
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,720
I know even if you don't tell me.

108
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
magnifying mirror, right?

109
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,080
Look at the old people in the nursing home.

110
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,520
can't see clearly through the needle.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So I made this.

112
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Don't flatter yourself.

113
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
Our smart and cute princess.

114
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,600
We misunderstood you before.

115
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,600
Don't say nice things to me. It's useless.

116
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,320
Sorry, I was wrong.

117
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,920
What did I do wrong?

118
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,120
I shouldn't have ignored you

119
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
I shouldn't have ignored you.

120
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,040
And?

121
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,080
The princess is so kind and cute.

122
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,840
And?

123
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,200
And

124
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,480
the first time I saw you,

125
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,600
you were smart.

126
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,320
Really?

127
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,000
There's more.

128
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,560
And

129
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
you are so good at business.

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,080
And?

131
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,240
There's more.

132
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,480
And...

133
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,360
And this.

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm scared.

135
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,160
You scared me. You scared me.

136
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,480
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

137
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,640
They're here! They're here!

138
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Let's go! Let's go!

139
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,640
Let's go! Let's go!

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,320
Catch me

141
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,680
Uncle, what is this? It's so beautiful.

142
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,320
The more beautiful it is

143
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
the more dangerous it is.

144
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,720
Just like a princess.

145
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,920
She looks pretty,

146
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,840
but evil inside.

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,680
not only took away your business,

148
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,000
and your man.

149
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,640
And now you're taking my Seijoh!

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,760
No!

151
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Let's kill her.

152
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,760
Wait and see.

153
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm going to kill her.

154
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,040
