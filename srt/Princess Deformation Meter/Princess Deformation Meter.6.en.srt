1
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,680
Here are the deed and banknotes.

2
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,600
Have you seen enough snow clothes?

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,160
Yes.

4
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,520
I'll send it to Miss Situ later.

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
General Mo.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,240
General Mo, the princess is being chased.

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,480
Where is she?

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,680
It's at the back of the mountain

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,320
Where am I?

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,480
Why can't I get out of here?

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,560
This place is bad luck to me.

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,240
I'm just kidding. There's no ghost.

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,840
God of Mountain, please bless me.

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,440
I've been pure all my life.

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,200
I have never done anything bad.

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,160
Dongsheng.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,920
Father.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,400
Why aren't you coming to me?

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,240
I'm here.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,760
Father.

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,520
It's here. It's here. It's here.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Snake!

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,720
You don't need to be an official.

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
In your jurisdiction,

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,720
If anything happens to the princess,

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,680
you'll be beheaded to report to His Majesty.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm innocent.

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,640
Please help me, Mr. Ma.

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,320
However,

30
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,960
I think something is wrong.

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,840
Qingcheng County is small.

32
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,880
We haven't seen any assassins for so long.

33
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,880
And no outsiders have entered the city recently.

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,840
This must be done by the powerful.

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,440
A powerful person?

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,720
Isn't that you?

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,840
Who else?

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,000
in Qingcheng County?

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,360
than you?

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,320
How dare you suspect me?

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,560
You said it yourself.

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,120
I didn't say that.

43
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,680
Your Highness.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,560
Princess!

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
Your Highness!

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
I was bitten by a snake.

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,240
I'm really going to die this time.

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,320
It hurts!

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,680
It hurts.

50
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,680
It's okay.

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,200
I've sucked the poison out for you.

52
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,200
Why are you still holding my hand?

53
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
It's all your fault. Why are you so late?

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,960
I almost died here.

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
I thought you were not afraid of anything.

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm also a human. I'm afraid of death.

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,400
What about Dongsheng?

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,120
Did he die?

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,880
Dongsheng.

60
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,080
Stop crying. He's still alive.

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,440
He's really alive.

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,880
It's good that you're alive.

63
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,360
Where are you going?

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,320
Go home.

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,640
But I can't walk anymore.

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,800
Am I really that annoying?

67
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,800
Not really.

68
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,720
My mother was killed

69
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,960
when I was six.

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
At that time, I told myself

71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,200
as long as I'm fierce and powerful,

72
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,480
no one dares to bully me.

73
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,800
And no one will harm me.

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,320
But after I came to this shabby place,

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,200
I was bullied every day.

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,440
Now even snakes are bullying me.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,640
I miss my father so much.

78
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
I want to go home.

79
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,960
I'm your boss.

80
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,040
How dare you suspect me?

81
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,240
It's just a little bit...

82
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,480
a little bit.

83
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
a little bit.

84
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,760
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

85
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,560
Report!

86
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,480
We've found the princess.

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,640
Yes.

88
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,320
Yes, my lord.

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,280
Since you've found the princess,

90
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,080
I'll take my leave.

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
You...

92
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,080
Come here!

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,280
My Lord!

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,200
You're back.

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,800
Did you clean up

96
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,960
Have you cleaned them up?

97
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600
We've killed them all.

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,720
Since we alerted them,

99
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,520
we have to think about it.

100
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,920
It hurts. Be gentle.

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Your Highness.

102
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,360
I didn't even call you.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm just shouting for you.

104
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,960
All right.

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,280
Princess.

106
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,320
General Mo.

107
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm here to visit you.

108
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Officer Shan, are you here just because you're here?

109
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,880
Why did you bring a salted fish?

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,720
A fish to show my sincerity.

111
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,800
After all, it's my fault

112
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,040
because of my negligence.

113
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,680
Let's get down to business.

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,680
Have you caught the assassin?

115
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes, we did.

116
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,160
But they can't speak.

117
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,400
They can't speak.

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,680
They're all dead.

119
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,000
They're all dead.

120
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,840
They are all dead.

121
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,440
How could he kill the princess?

122
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,760
The mastermind must be something.

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,600
He must be cautious.

124
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,920
After they failed this time,

125
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,960
after this failure.

126
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,440
But we have to be careful.

127
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,640
Who hates me so much?

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
It's okay.

129
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,600
I have a bodyguard.

130
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,920
Stay close to me from now on.

131
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,800
and protect me.

132
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,120
Seventh Sister's handwriting is still the same as chicken feet.

133
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,600
I don't understand.

134
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,680
It doesn't matter.

135
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
As long as His Majesty can't see it.

136
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,080
How is it?

137
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
What is this?

138
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,880
This is the invitation I drew.

139
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,520
Tomorrow is my birthday.

140
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,240
I want to invite

141
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,920
to attend my birthday banquet.

142
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,720
Most importantly, they don't know you well.

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
So what?

144
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
We invited them to the princess's birthday party.

145
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
It's like an ancestral grave.

146
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,120
That's right.

147
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,440
Dongsheng.

148
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,559
I have a difficult task for you.

149
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,240
Send these invitations to all the people.

150
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,679
and complete the task.

151
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
And...

152
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,080
I have a favor to ask.

153
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,560
What is it?

154
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
Lend me some money.

155
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,360
What for?

156
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,600
Of course you need money for your birthday, right?

157
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
Otherwise, you'll lose face.

158
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,640
His Majesty didn't ask you to come here for money.

159
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,120
He wants you to get rid of the princess disease.

160
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
Lend me some. Lend me some.

161
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,240
Lend me some.

162
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
I've written the IOU for you.

163
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,760
Is it enough?

164
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,280
Enough

165
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Take the IOU.

166
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,680
Thanks.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,120
You'll never get your money back, right?

168
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Slowly.

169
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
[Your Highness!] [Your Highness!]

170
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,800
Your Highness, I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

171
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,440
Stop selling your official cavity.

172
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,520
What's going on?

173
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,880
A lonely old man is old

174
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
and his children are not around.

175
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,400
He died at home for many days.

176
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,320
until the body stinks.

177
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
Poor thing.

178
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,880
Yeah, our Seijoh is getting older.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
This isn't the first time.

180
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,480
Let's build a cold palace then.

181
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,240
Cold palace. Cold palace.

182
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,400
There are cold palace in the palace.

183
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Those old concubines and maids

184
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,960
They live together

185
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,680
and eat together.

186
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
In this case,

187
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,760
If an old man dies,

188
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,240
no one would ask.

189
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,120
That sounds like a good idea.

190
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,160
But how much does it cost?

191
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,760
You're the county magistrate. I've figured it out for you.

216

Isn't the tax unified in the country?

222
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,560
It must be because you're extravagant in the capital.

223
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,760
Money is like water.

224
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,560
