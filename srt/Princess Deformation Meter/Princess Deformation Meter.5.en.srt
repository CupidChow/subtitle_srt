1
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,680
Happy.

2
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,440
I finally got my revenge today.

3
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,080
Did something happen?

4
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,840
No.

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,120
It's not here.

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,800
No.

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm just in a good mood today.

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,640
I'll sign the engagement letter for you next time.

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,600
and set you free.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,800
Let's go. Let's go.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,200
Let's go. Let's go.

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,320
Go! Go!

13
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,360
Your Highness! Your Highness!

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,600
General Mo.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,960
Governor Shan, what brings you here so late at night?

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,240
We suspect that...

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,680
the princess is related to the injury of a snow robe.

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,920
Princess, do we have any evidence?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,760
Shut up!

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,320
What evidence do you have? It's here. It's here.

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,320
This...

22
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,400
Magistrate Shan.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,360
Although the princess was demoted,

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,320
she is still the seventh princess of Sheng Xuan State.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,479
If you don't have evidence,

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,080
you can't bear the consequences.

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,200
because you can't bear the consequences?

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,320
You...

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,640
You are that pregnant woman.

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,520
It turns out to be a man.

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Magistrate Shan, I'm totally sure that...

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,400
they did it.

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,000
They pretended to be pregnant and deceived me.

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,000
to attract my attention

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,479
and destroy my Snow Garment.

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,880
General Mo, what do you think we should do?

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,280
Is this why you're happy?

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,960
I didn't expect to be discovered so soon.

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
I'll take the responsibility.

40
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,440
It's just a piece of clothes.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,720
At the crucial moment,

42
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,560
at the crucial moment.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,440
That's right. It's just a piece of clothes.

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,160
That's right.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,960
Mr Mo, this is not just a piece of clothes.

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,000
This is the civilization of Qingcheng.

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,400
Seijoh was famous for making clothes.

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Later, it declined.

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,920
This is the only snow coat left.

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,920
Now the princess destroyed it.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,400
If the Emperor breaks the law, it's the same as the commoners.

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,240
You must pay for it.

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,280
I'll pay for it. I'll pay for it. I'll pay for it.

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,760
Please help me.

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,520
Situ, calm down.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,200
Calm down.

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,040
I will give you justice.

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,960
Although this is a princess,

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,720
we'll pay for it. Okay.

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,240
I’ll pay for it.

61
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,680
It’s not enough. The snow robe is worth 10,000 taels.

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,320
Are you done?

63
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,760
What are you talking about?

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,000
Magistrate Shan.

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,800
I'm going to sue her for extortion.

66
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,079
You're a good official who knows the law and the law.

67
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,760
Magistrate Shan.

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
I want to sue her for destroying the civilization of Qingcheng.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,840
You're an upright official who upholds justice for the people, right?

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,120
Then you must help me.

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,040
Help me! Help me!

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,400
Come on. Come on.

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,880
Come on. Come on.

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,280
Your Highness. Your Highness.

75
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,200
Miss Situ.

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,079
I am just

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,720
a lowly official.

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,720
There is no distinction between officials and officials.

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
You've been studying hard for ten years.

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,840
The gentlemen didn't teach

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
how to reason with women

82
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,000
Who can help me?

83
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Are we going?

84
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,920
The princess was bullied.

85
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,839
I think it's our princess's fault.

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,160
That makes sense.

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,920
I'm struggling.

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,160
I did see your loyalty today.

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,240
I misunderstood you before.

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
You're a general.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,120
You usually fight in wars.

92
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,200
there's no chance to be corrupted.

93
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,400
Then there's no money.

94
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,680
I'll take the responsibility.

95
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,920
Leave.

96
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,560
I won't implicate you.

97
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,720
Princess, what should you do next?

98
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,960
Why are you laughing?

99
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
I can find someone

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,920
to make her the same one.

101
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Isn't that enough?

102
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,440
Besides, I should go to jail.

103
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,080
I should be the first princess

104
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,400
in Sheng Xuan State.

105
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,040
It's okay, princess. I'll go to jail with you.

106
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
You're an accomplice too. You can't escape.

107
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
Uncle, I'm so mad!

108
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,760
There's a stupid princess from Qingcheng County.

109
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
She went too far!

110
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,960
She not only bullied me,

111
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,880
but also broke my snow coat.

112
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,360
Will you do anything, uncle?

113
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
If you don't,

114
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,320
I can't look up anymore.

115
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,760
Calm down.

116
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,960
Uncle will make you look up

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Dongsheng, how much longer?

118
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,480
You walk slower than the turtles in the palace.

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
Almost there, princess.

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,400
That's the mountain ahead.

121
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,480
I've asked around.

122
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,920
Uncle Erbai Li is on the mountain ahead.

123
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
He made the snow coat when he was young.

124
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,760
But it was flawed.

125
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,800
The Situ family was so shameless to go.

126
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,480
She didn't even give her a penny.

127
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,200
She was acting with me that day.

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
She cried so hard that I almost took it seriously.

129
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
She's really something.

130
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,760
She's not simple.

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,920
Don't mention her

132
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,960
Dongsheng.

133
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,840
We've been walking for so long.

134
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,240
There's no bird in this forest.

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Could there be any bad guys?

136
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,800
Princess, don't talk nonsense.

137
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,600
Your mouth is glowing.

138
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,680
Don't talk nonsense.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,320
It's like this. It's like this. It's like this.

140
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,320
What's that?

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,080
Listen to me

142
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
Dongsheng, put me down first.

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
Count to three before you open your eyes.

144
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,800
Footsteps.

145
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,920
Let's go! Let's go!

146
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,560
Oh, no!

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,159
Luckily I ran fast.

148
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,960
The bandits in this small place are quite imposing.

149
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,400
Dongsheng.

150
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,880
Take care of yourself.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,280
Let me fight.

152
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,200
Come on, one-on-one.

153
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,200
Didn't we agree to fight one-on-one?

154
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,440
Stop!

155
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,520
Please don't hit my face.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,880
You hit me so badly.

157
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,360
Shall we go up and help?

158
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,960
A hammer.

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,720
Our mission is to protect the princess.

160
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,799
You naughty girl.

161
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,880
Protect the princess. Yes.

162
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,919
Where is the princess?

163
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,760
Father.

164
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,480
Father, why haven't you come to me?

165
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,160
Snake.

166
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,360
Look at him. He's here.

167
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,680
