Come on. Come on.

2
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,160
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,920
Great Princess!

4
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,640
Seijoh has been planning for many years.

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,480
At this critical moment,

6
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,200
Shengtao suddenly came to Qingcheng.

7
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,760
Just in case.

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,800
I know what to do.

9
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,840
The letter

10
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,640
It's here. It's here.

11
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,960
Dongsheng

12
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,120

14

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,640
Dongsheng

17
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,440
Dongsheng, where are you going?

18
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,520
Are you done?

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,960
What can't a man see?

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,040
You pervert.

21
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600
Not bad.

22
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,000
What? Haven't you seen enough of me?

23
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,240
No, you misunderstood.

24
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,320
I want you to do me a favor.

25
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,640
Help me have a

26
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,600
with Situ Snow.

27
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,240
and fell in love at first sight.

28
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,640
and dumped her.

29
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,920
I'll take revenge.

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
for my revenge.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,640
You're right.

32
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,680
Wait.

33
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,120
If you promise to help me,

34
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,440
I'll break off the engagement.

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,120
That way, Father will have nothing to say.

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,920
Are you sure?

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,600
A promise is a promise.

38
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,320
Deal.

39
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,840
Miss Situ and this man

40
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,280
look perfect together.

41
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, they are a match made in heaven.

42
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
So handsome.

43
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
They look good together.

44
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,760
Do they look good together?

45
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm so bored. I'm so bored.

46
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,040
Your Highness.

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,120
Thank you for saving me.

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,800
May I know your name?

49
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm Mo Li.

50
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,440
Thank you for not embarrassing me in public.

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,440
Princess, wait for me.

52
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,760
Why are you angry?

53
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,400
The princess is angry.

54
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,680
Jealous?

55
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,840
How could the princess like him?

56
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
She's scheming.

57
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
You don't understand.

58
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,000
Love comes easily

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm so mad.

60
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
It's just the skin.

61
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,840
That's right. It's just the skin.

62
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
Princess, who are you talking about?

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,960
You...

64
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Here you go. Here you go.

65
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,720
No.

66
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,200
Take it. Take it.

67
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
Why are you in such a hurry?

68
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
You... You're in a hurry.

69
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
But I did everything you asked me to do.

70
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,800
But...

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,840
But this is just the first step.

72
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
You have to let her fall in love with you first

73
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,560
and then dump her.

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,320
That's enough.

75
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
She's innocent.

76
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,720
You're going too far.

77
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,680
Brother!

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
She bullied me first.

79
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,200
She dares to laugh at me for being poor.

80
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,040
The point is you don't have money.

81
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Why do you buy clothes if you don't have money?

82
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,360
Fine.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,480
Are you siding with me now?

84
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,920
Keep the buns for yourself.

85
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,040
Your Highness.

86
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm not in the mood. I'm not in the mood.

87
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
I'm not in the mood.

88
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm so mad.

89
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Princess, don't be angry.

90
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,560
It’s just a snow coat.

91
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,600
How can you not get it?

92
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,040
Come here.

93
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,360
Let me tell you. Let's go. Let's go.

94
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
It's unreasonable.

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
Why did this happen?

96
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,600
This is outrageous.

97
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,400
What's wrong?

98
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,080
What's wrong? What's wrong?

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
This is outrageous.

100
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,760
My husband ran away and I'm pregnant.

101
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,320
I'm so unlucky.

102
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,760
I didn't know there was such a scumbag in Seijoh.

103
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,280
There's such a man?

104
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,600
What is this?

105
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,400
I think I remember.

106
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
The mistress lives over there.

107
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,520
Over there. Where?

108
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Who's there?

109
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,760
It's him!

110
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,360
I didn't see it.

111
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
That's it.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,920
Look at that little girl.

113
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,440
I lost face because of you.

114
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,560
Look, over there.

115
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,840
Over there.

116
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,360
Over there!

117
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,880
Over there!

118
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,040
It's over there.

119
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,120
He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here.

120
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,840
Who is it?

121
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,039
Your Highness.

122
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,280
Are you bullying me?

123
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,320
Hammer. That's a princess.

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,640
You can bully her.

125
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
Then we don't need to protect each other.

126
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,960
It occurs to me that

127
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,760
my husband

128
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
I think he wants me to go home for dinner.

129
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,600
Bye.

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,120
She's a big liar.

131
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,960
She's a liar.

132
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,080
I told you she was a liar from the beginning.

133
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,720
Come on.

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,480

Alright, let's go.

137
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240

138
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,800
It's killing.

139
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
It's like this.

140
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,720
Look at me. Look at me.

141
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,920
Dongsheng, put me down first.

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,840
