1
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,800
Where am I?

2
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,200
I must not be awake.

3
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,360
Where is the ghost?

4
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,640
Go! Go! Go! Go!

5
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,080
Princess.

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,200
Where are we?

7
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,640
We're at Seijoh's house! We're at Seijoh's house! We're at Seijoh's house!

8
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,920
Home?

9
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,360
Where is the magistrate? He's here. He's here.

10
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,560
Sorry to keep you waiting

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,560
You're the magistrate here?

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm Shan Yu Ci, the magistrate of Qingcheng.

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,240
I didn't know you would arrive last night.

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,720
Please forgive me

16
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,880
Please forgive me.

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,440
Alright, get up.

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,160
On your knees.

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,039
Yes.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,120
I'm a princess.

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,600
How can you let me live in a place like this?

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,320
And...

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,760
Why was your town so dark yesterday?

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
Everyone's face is covered with white face.

26
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,920
Who are you trying to scare?

27
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,000
That's Seijoh's custom!

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,200
If you don't light the lanterns during the cold food festival,

29
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,840
Then why is my portrait

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,360
on each family's door?

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,880
Of course it's the princess's prestige.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,840
On one hand, show your respect.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,800
On the other hand,

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,880
What else?

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,120
It can repel ghosts and exorcise evil spirits.

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,440
Folks said

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,079
use me to exorcise evil spirits?

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,600
Please calm down, Your Highness.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Forget it. These are not important.

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
What matters is this damn place.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,400
I can't live here.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,720
You must change a place for me.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,360
I can't do it.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,400
I can't.

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,320
There's nothing I can do about the royal decree.

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,000
But...

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,880
squeeze your teeth.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,280
I can decorate it for you.

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,320
Redecorate?

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,400
That's more like it.

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
Alright, get up and talk.

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,480
I have prepared some food

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,120
I prepared some food for you.

55
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,960
Besides money,

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,720
if you need anything,

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,520
if you need anything.

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,680
Your Highness.

59
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,040
General Mo.

60
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,280
I have work to do.

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,560
Please excuse me.

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
Are you unhappy?

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,600
Father, you're too cruel.

64
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,360
Why do you eat chicken drumsticks and I eat these?

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,720
I only care about your safety

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,839
and not your life.

67
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,839
Let's go. Let's go.

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,079
Let's go.

69
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
Your Highness, don't be angry.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,000
Smile.

71
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,560
Let's go shopping.

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,200
I heard

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,880
there's a shop called Snow Garment Pavilion in Qingcheng.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,320
The clothes are very nice.

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Let me show you. Okay.

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,920
Okay.

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,200
This way, please.

78
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,440
Princess, this is it.

79
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,520
This is the famous Snow Garment Pavilion in Qingcheng.

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,040
Are you new here?

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,080
You're smart.

82
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,000
You are famous in Snow Garment Pavilion.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,520
All ladies with good taste

84
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,680
will come to our shop

85
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,080
We're all familiar guests.

86
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,760
This way, please.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,680
Here.

88
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,920
Like this. Like this.

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,880
The color is old-fashioned.

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,200
The fabric is also inferior.

91
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,680
How dare you say it's famous?

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,320
If it were in the capital, your shop would have gone bankrupt.

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,120
I think you're here to pick a fight.

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,400
Who do you think you are?

95
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,840
How dare you!

96
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,120
It's you, Your Highness.

97
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,640
Of course you look down on us.

98
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,840
Bring me your most expensive clothes.

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,880
Let me see.

100
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,440
It's here.

101
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
This is the seventh princess.

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,280
She doesn't look good. She looks ordinary.

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
You don't know

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
She was kicked out of the palace.

105
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,120
She's ignorant and willful.

106
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,400
So embarrassing.

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,080
Come on, pick some clothes.

108
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,080
This is our treasure.

109
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,040
It's called Snow Garment.

110
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,840
The embroidery is delicate.

111
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,520
The pearl is round and smooth. It's really nice.

112
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
It's really delicate

113
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,920
I didn't expect

114
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,840
in the countryside.

115
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,200
I'll take this.

116
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,200
Pack it up for me.

117
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,560
Dongsheng, check please.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,640
Your Highness.

119
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,360
Princess, we don't have money.

120
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,080
What?

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,960
You don't have money to buy clothes?

122
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Seventh Princess?

123
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,440
I think you're a fake.

124
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,280
How can we have no money?

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
Have you forgotten?

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,960
Our money was robbed by the robbers.

127
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,960
Why did you bring me shopping then?

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,400
You don't have money, but you come to buy clothes.

129
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
A princess is worse than a commoner.

130
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
Even ordinary people are inferior.

131
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,640
We can buy whatever we want.

132
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,400
Yes.

133
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,080
Your Highness.

134
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,200
I have no money to buy clothes.

135
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm so pissed.

136
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,159
When did I ever lack money?

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,920
A tiger falls into the Pingyang and is bullied.

138
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,000
Now even a country bumpkin

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
bully me.

140
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,160
If my brother knows,

141
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
he would wake up with a smile.

142
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,440
Princess, would you like to write a letter to His Majesty?

143
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,240
Yes, I want to write a letter to Father.

144
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,000
and ask Father to give me a lot of money.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,880
with money.

146
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,400
I feel bad for the princess.

147
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,080
Right. What should we do?

148
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,720
Go

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,480
Where are you going?

150
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,520
