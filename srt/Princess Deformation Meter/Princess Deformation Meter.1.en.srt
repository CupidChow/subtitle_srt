1
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,560
Here you go.

2
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,240
It's delicious.

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,040
The princess is here.

4
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,160
Run!

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,000
The princess is here!

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,800
The princess is here. Run!

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,760
Why are you running?

8
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,760
I'm not here for you. Boring.

9
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,400
Princess, don’t make it hard for me.

10
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,479
I'm here to deliver the wedding dress

11
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,920
to deliver this wedding dress.

12
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,280
How dare you mortals

13
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
How dare you worry about my marriage?

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,280
I think no one will dare to send me wedding dress again.

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,880
Oh my god, how could there be such a princess?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,160
This is the tragedy of Sheng Xuan State.

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,479
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

19
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,640
Ouch

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,479
What are you doing

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,320
Ouch

22
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,320
My waist

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,000
No.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
Why did you help him instead of me?

25
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,520
Why should I?

26
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,200
You...

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,480
Who are you?

28
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,600
How dare you not help me?

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,960
Father

30
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,920
selected by my father.

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,960
The future consort.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,560
Him?

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm not good enough. I'm not good enough for you.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
I don't deserve you.

35
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,960
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,960
You have to be careful.

37
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,720
You know

38
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,079
you don't deserve me.

39
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
All right.

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Stop talking.

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,440
Listen carefully.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,960
This matter

43
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,480
It's a deal.

44
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,079
Your Majesty, I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

45
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,800
Father.

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,320
Your Majesty.

47
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,720
Look at you two.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,120
At the beginning,

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,960
in the beginning.

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,600
This relationship

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,920
needs to be cultivated slowly.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,680
Father.

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

54
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,800
What should we do?

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Father asked me to marry him.

56
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,040
Dongsheng, are you done?

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
What's with the ink?

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,600
Hurry up.

59
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
The effect is good.

60
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Not bad.

61
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,159
But we need more gunpowder.

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,200
Princess.

63
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,400
His Majesty wants you to marry General Mo.

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,240
Didn't you say you don't want to marry him?

65
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,600
You still have the mood to play gunpowder?

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,360
Besides, His Majesty's birthday is coming.

67
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,240
You'd better think about a surprise.

68
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,480
This is the surprise I prepared for Father.

69
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,920
Come on, try again.

70
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
Come on. Come on.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,400
Come on.

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,760
Let's see who dares to marry me.

73
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,320
The seventh princess is here.

74
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,440
What took you so long?

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Xiao Qi.

76
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,560
What took you so long?

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,560
Father is waiting for you.

78
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,320
We'll be in trouble again tonight.

79
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,960
Long live Father!

80
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,159
I'm late.

81
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,480
Xiaoqi.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,880
What surprise did you bring to Father today?

83
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Father, just wait and see.

84
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay.

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
Father, look.

86
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,800
What did you prepare?

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,960
It's so big.

88
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
The workmanship is so rough.

89
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,920
Third Brother, I'll blink your eyes.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,880
Watch carefully.

91
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,160
Dongsheng

92
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,680
Did he cause any trouble again?

93
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,800
What is this?

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,720
It's here. It's here.

95
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,240
Okay.

96
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,560
This is so beautiful.

97
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,640
Look at this. Look at this.

98
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,320
Look at this. Look at this.

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,920
Okay.

100
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,400
Great! Great!

101
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a great omen.

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,280
Great!

103
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,160
Let's go! Let's go!

104
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,040
Great! Great!

105
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Long live Your Majesty!

106
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:39,520
Long live Your Majesty!

107
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,680
It's an auspicious sign.

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,600
You're indeed my Xiaoqi.

109
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,240
She's a blessed daughter.

110
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,040
Father is the son of the dragon.

111
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,800
Even God is celebrating Father's birthday.

112
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,560
OK.

113
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,040
You may rise.

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,159
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

115
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,120
Magic?

116
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,360
What's that smell?

117
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
My clothes! Fire! Fire!

118
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
Save my beloved consort! Bring me water!

119
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,720
Hurry up!

120
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,440
Hurry up!

121
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,560
Put out the fire! Put out the fire!

122
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,360
Let me get some water.

123
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,880
Hurry up.

124
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,400
Be careful.

125
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,440
Get some water

126
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,640
Coming

127
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,799
It's on fire

128
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,000
Come and put out the fire.

129
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,919
Okay, I'm coming.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Oh no, I'm in trouble again.

131
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
Why is the fire so strong?

132
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,800
Be careful, Your Majesty.

133
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
Hurry up! Put out the fire!

134
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,120
Over there.

135
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,360
Hurry up, my clothes.

136
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,920
Here's the water.

137
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,520
Here's the peach. Let's go.

138
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,400
You bitch!

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Father, don't blame me.

140
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,040
I didn't expect the fire to be so big.

141
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,280
Hurry up! Put out the fire!

142
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,280
Your Majesty, take care.

143
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,600
Peach.

144
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,200
By the heavens' blessing, His Majesty hereby declare...

145
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,720
The seventh princess Sheng Peach is arrogant and rude.

146
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,120
She's so naughty.

147
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,240
and ruined the Emperor's birthday banquet.

148
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,200
and demote him to Qingcheng

149
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
and reflect on his mistakes.

150
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,360
General Mo, we're here. We're here. Let's go.

151
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,440
Qingcheng

152
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
must protect the princess.

153
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,640
Your Majesty, I...

154
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,600
All right.

155
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,120
I...

156
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,800
planned to

157
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
at my birthday banquet.

158
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,880
I didn't expect such a mess to happen.

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,160
Let's put it off for now.

160
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,600
General Mo.

161
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,600
Although the princess is a little willful,

162
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,360
she is kind-hearted.

163
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
Take this opportunity

164
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,840
get to know each other.

165
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,960
Okay.

166
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,720
Also,

167
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,240
I have a more special task for you.

168
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,240
There's a gold mine in Qingcheng.

169
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,520
Jinshan State has been eyeing him.

170
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,520
I suspect

171
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,080
that Qingcheng County is haunted.

172
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,560
You must find out

173
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,480
find out the truth.

174
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

175
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,240
Go.

176
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,240
Your Majesty.

177
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,840
General Mo seems reluctant.

178
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
It doesn't matter.

179
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,520
Ma Yi. Ma Yi.

180
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,960
You two protect the princess in secret.

181
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,960
Remember what the princess does.

182
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,960
Remember it.

183
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,360
If anything happens,

184
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,880
if anything happens.

185
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,120
What are you looking at?

186
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,920
Go! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

187
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

188
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,400
These two are more unreliable.

189
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
I accepted the red packets and joined the Secret Guard Team through the back door.

190
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,400
Can my princess come back?

191
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,040
Father is wise.

192
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,040
She finally left.

193
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,960
