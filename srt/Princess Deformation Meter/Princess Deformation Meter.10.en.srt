1
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,160
You bitch acted on your own again

2
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,800
I've followed this line for six years.

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,640
I wanted to take it away.

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,000
Mother, what should we do?

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,800
A mantis catches a cicada.

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,240
I have my own plan.

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,480
Write it down.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,600
Register properly.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,680
Next.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,720
Why are there so many people?

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,080
At this rate,

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,920
Seijoh is under a lot of pressure.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,800
Next.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,920
Shan! Shan!

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,520
Princess.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,360
Don't call me that.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,120
It's embarrassing to have so many people around.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,440
Listen, I have a new idea.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,039
And Mo Li knows it.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,800
Don't worry.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,880
Another new idea?

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,960
Let me ask you.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,120
Do you want to be rich with me?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,240
Do you want to make money?

26
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,039
Do you want to get married and have a child?

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,520
Yes.

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
Okay, follow me.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,080
Okay.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,120
Princess, you haven't registered yet?

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,200
Hurry up.

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,880
Princess.

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,520
Not bad. Everyone is handsome and handsome.

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,400
No.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,200
It doesn't matter.

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,160
Listen, everyone.

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,840
I have a big picture.

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,000
Just listen to me.

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
I

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,600
will make a lot of money.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Understand?

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,320
Okay.

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,240
Louder.

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,560
Got it.

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,079
Dongsheng.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,280
Send the signature.

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,360
OK, princess.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,600
At ease.

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,960
Attention.

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,280
Raise your head and chest.

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,040
Inhale in your energy.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,360
Ready.

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,360
Action.

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,760
Welcome.

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,040
Smile out your eight teeth.

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,440
Smile sincerely

57
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,320
The final order of service is to smile.

58
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,160
Smile

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,079
Smile again.

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,160
I thought I could slack off

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,280
I could slack off and skip training.

62
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,960
I didn't expect it to be the same wherever I go.

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,320
Life is hard.

64
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,360
Like this.

65
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,120
Put this inside

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,640
Wear it like this

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,400
Young man.

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,560
All ten fingers are bleeding.

69
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,079
Why don't you go back and rest?

70
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,360
No.

71
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,960
I can hold on.

72
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,280
I didn't expect young people nowadays

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,640
are more persistent than we used to be.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,880
That's right. You're a fearful young man.

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,960
The inheritance is promising.

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,160
I'll endure it.

77
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,760
Bear with it.

78
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,120
Yes.

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
I think I...

80
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,280
Yes.

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,079
I can't help it.

82
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,520
Young man, are you asleep?

83
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,920
Stab him. Let him continue.

84
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,080
Poke.

85
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
Come on, young man.

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,240
Not bad.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,120
The days are getting better.

88
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
If this continues,

89
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,880
we'll surpass the capital.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
Princess, let's talk.

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,560
Go ahead.

92
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,640
Let's talk somewhere else.

93
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,880
Another one.

94
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,960
Sure.

95
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll take you to a very comfortable place.

96
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,680
Let's go.

97
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,360
Let's go.

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Awesome!

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,920
Mo Li, try it.

100
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,680
Get out!

101
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,080
Go on.

102
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,960
This is what you enjoy.

103
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,360
Get out!

104
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,960
Mo Li, why are you so angry?

105
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,360
I don't know what you're doing.

106
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,360
I thought you would change when you came here.

107
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,880
I didn't expect you to bring

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,960
in the capital.

109
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm spending the money I earned.

110
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,400
not my father's money.

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,680
So what?

112
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,680
I thought you would be responsible for the people on the fief.

113
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,159
I thought you would benefit the people.

114
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,760
I thought you knew

115
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
the responsibility and meaning of a princess.

116
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,520
Look at you. What are you doing?

117
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,159
Why am I not responsible for them?

118
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,880
I brought them to make money.

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,360
When we first came here,

120
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,240
you knew

121
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,640
What kind of remote place is this?

122
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,640
I brought them rich.

123
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,840
Besides,

124
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,280
What's wrong with massage?

125
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,120
Massages also make money by working.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,480
Why are you so angry now?

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you think

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
you don't have any presence?

129
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
I don't think so.

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,400
I think your nature changes easily.

131
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,200
What took you so long?

132
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,800
Don't mention it. I just got off work.

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,240
I'm exhausted recently.

134
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,600
You know what?

135
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
I've earned a lot of tips lately.

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,120
Why are you chatting? Dig quickly.

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,320
You won't be able to dig in the morning

138
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,440
Secretly every day

139
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
My little heart

140
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,800
It's killing me.

141
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,560
Dig quickly

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,400
Who is this bastard

143
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,760
The ground is covered with mud every day

144
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,560
A rat!

145
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,760
Princess.

146
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,320
You've been wandering here all afternoon.

147
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,880
What's wrong?

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm pissed off.

149
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,880
What?

150
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,840
Who is it?

151
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Stinky ice.

152
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,159
Stinky ice.

153
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,400
General Mo.

154
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,640
He is giving porridge to Miss Situ.

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,320
What? Pouring porridge?

156
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,240
My mouth is so bad.

157
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's go find them.

158
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,640
Your Highness.

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,760
Take it.

160
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Everyone has some

161
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Give me some porridge

162
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,280
Thank you.

163
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,280
What a princess!

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Qingcheng is developing so well.

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
It's because you've been helping her.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,840
Look at her.

167
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,520
She doesn't need anyone in front of her.

168
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,400
Miss Situ, you misunderstood.

169
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,039
Princess is not that kind of person.

170
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,600
I wanted to be alone.

171
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,240
Princess.

172
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,120
Let's go back.

173
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,559
Wipe your sweat.

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,480
Thank you.

175
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
There's enough for everyone.

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,200
Shameless.

177
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,920
Princess.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,480
You two are so kind.

179
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,200
Thank you.

180
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,640
Move.

181
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,600
Why are you so barbaric?

182
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,320
I'm barbaric? I'll show you

183
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,600
what a barbarian is.

184
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,360
Sheng Tao Tao, what are you doing?

185
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,000
How dare you!

186
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
How dare you call my name?

187
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,600
Mr Mo, look at her.

188
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,360
Sheng Tao Tao.

189
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
You've gone too far.

190
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,800
Me?

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,040
Are you trying to save her?

192
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,280
You can be lovey-dovey,

193
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,600
but not in my place.

194
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
We're not lovey-dovey.

195
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,880
We are distributing porridge to the people.

196
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
Look how pitiful they are.

197
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
I let Mr Mo

198
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,640
because I pity them.

199
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,160
Did I do anything wrong, Mr Mo?

200
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,680
That's right. They're such a good couple.

201
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,160
You're bullying honest people.

202
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,320
We haven't eaten for days.

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,760
Shut up!

204
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,240
How shameless!

205
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,600
Everyone has arms and legs

206
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
They don't know how to make money.

207
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,040
Old men and old ladies in their 70s

208
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,480
know how to make money with labor.

209
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
You always wear junk.

210
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,720
You only know how to beg for a bowl.

211
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,000
We don't know how.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,560
We don't know what to do.

213
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,960
Can't we learn if we can't?

214
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
You can make money by working.

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,520
but you begged with dignity.

216
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
Did you enjoy the meal?

217
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,760
Yeah, should we

218
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,920
make money with dignity?

219
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,800
That's right.

220
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
I promise you.

221
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,680
Don't be angry, Mr Mo.

222
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,960
As long as you work hard,

223
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,280
I promise to support your family

224
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,680
to support your family.

225
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,760
From now on,

226
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,920
I won't allow any beggars in Seijoh ever again!

227
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,600
All right!

228
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Yes, well said.

229
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,880
Well said.

230
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,960
You guys...

231
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Okay, we'll listen to you.

232
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,440
I open a nursing home to benefit the people.

233
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,600
It's free.

234
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,640
We can live here for free from now on.

235
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,560
The princess recruits young apprentices to make clothes.

236
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,200
and learn to do business.

237
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,080
After you master it,

238
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,640
I'll open a shop for you.

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,240
I promise

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,800
as long as you work hard,

241
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,720
I promise to support your family

242
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
to support your family.

243
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,760
Am I really wrong?

244
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,400
Are you peeking at our princess?

245
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,400
Judging from your expression,

246
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,680
it means you know you're wrong.

247
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,040
Although our princess is naughty,

248
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,760
she is kind-hearted.

249
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
Besides,

250
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,880
as a man,

251
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,120
can't you give in to her?

252
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,680
I just can't stand her being rude.

253
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm afraid she'll be like before.

254
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,320
That's not being rude.

255
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
It's called confidence and resolution.

256
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,920
And our princess has been doing things.

257
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,040
Look at Seijoh prefecture now.

258
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,240
It's very different, isn't it?

259
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,280
It's all thanks to our princess.

260
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,760

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,080
