1
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,200
I've never poisoned Mr. Ma.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,520
He said the poison was wrong.

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,480
He didn't poison Sheng Tao Tao to death.

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,320
She even wrote to me.

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,000
Could it be Aunt?

6
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,120
Only that bitch could do this.

7
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,880
She must have used the poison of the River of Forgetting

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,360
The dead will forget each other.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,360
Never meet again.

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,120
How vicious.

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,840
Mother, what should we do?

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,720
There are two bottles of poison in Wangchuan River.

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,440
Drink separately. It's poison.

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,560
Poisoned?

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,160
The other is the antidote.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,039
And the other is with us.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,760
That's our trump card.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
That's amazing!

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,240
But what about Seijoh?

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,240
Of course I'll help my good sister!

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,280
my good sister.

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,520
I'm her sister.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,440
My lady.

24
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,360
The governor sent a letter to the palace.

25
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,080
What did he say?

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
The governor asked me to tell you

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,440
the Noble Consort said she could save her heart blood for seven days.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,200
Seven days of heart blood.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,920
My Lady, I've found a way to use it. It's not that bad. It's not that bad.

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,880
Tell her

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,640
to the princess.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,800
She will save her.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,320
Someone will die.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,840
If she dies,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,080
she can help the governor solve the problem.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,360
Get the ink.

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,720
Yes, my lady.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,520
I haven't seen you for so many days.

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,240
Did something happen?

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,040
I haven't eaten your food these days.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,920
I've lost weight from hunger.

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,840
Did the princess go out to make money?

43
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
No way. She won't leave us alone.

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,320
Princess!

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
Where did you go?

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,640
Come here.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,200
Is the princess dead?

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,400
Your Highness!

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,680
You can't die!

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,880
You can't die.

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,320
You can't leave us alone.

52
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,040
Princess.

53
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,360
I'm not dead.

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm still alive.

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,360
The princess is back.

56
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,120
Princess!

57
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,040
Princess! Princess!

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,800
Princess, where have you been?

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,120
Yeah.

60
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
We all miss you so much.

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,880
I miss you so much.

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,360
What?

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,240
While I'm away,

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
you don't work hard

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,720
You're stealing materials.

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,760
No.

67
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,920
Well, since I'm back,

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,760
let's get to work.

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,079
Okay. Let's go.

70
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,079
Let's get started.

71
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,200
Let's go. Let's go.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,760
Who is it?

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,600
Dongsheng, I've found

74
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,680
to save Mo Li.

75
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Don't let anyone disturb me for the next seven days.

76
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,240
Okay?

77
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,520
Okay.

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,480
Ready. Ready.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,279
for seven days.

80
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,040
Your Highness.

81
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,560
Princess, once you exhaust your heart blood,

82
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,440
or your life is in danger,

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
or the green hair will turn grey.

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
Have you thought it through?

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,520
Mo Li.

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,280
As long as there's a little hope,

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,040
I must wake you up.

88
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
Tell me.

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,080
Is Taotao mad at me?

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,680
Why isn't there a letter?

91
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
Your Majesty, that's not possible.

92
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,320
I heard that

93
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,680
a eunuch from Qingcheng in his hometown said

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,080
Seijoh is doing well now.

95
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
It's all thanks to the princess!

96
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,920
Really?

97
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,360
Your Majesty, how dare I lie to you?

98
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,880
That's right. My peach?

99
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,680
Of course.

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
I always thought

101
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,400
my Taotao

102
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,080
is the smartest, kindest,

103
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,400
and bravest.

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Yes.

105
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,280
[It's time for you to come to the stage.] [You're here.]

106
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,360
It's been seven days.

107
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,400
Why aren't you awake?

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,040
The princess hasn't come out yet?

109
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,000
No.

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,280
It's been seven days.

111
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,600
We'll be in trouble if this continues.

112
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,720
I have to go inside.

113
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,120
No.

114
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,920
The princess said no one can go in.

115
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,960
Just let me in.

116
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,400
No.

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,480
What if something happens?

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,680
I only listen to the princess. You can't go in.

119
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,400
Get out of my way!

120
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,880
Dong Sheng

121
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,000
Let him in.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Princess.

123
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,920
Princess!

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,520
Your Highness.

125
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,720
Why are you doing this to me? I'm sorry.

126
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,520
It's all because of him.

127
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,280
It's all my fault.

128
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,560
Since then,

129
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,040
we

130
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,520
we are even.

131
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,200
Dongsheng

132
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,960
Give this letter to him when he wakes up.

133
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,120
after he wakes up.

134
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,040
Princess.

135
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,320
My lady.

136
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,240
Is she okay? Is she okay?

137
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,840
I don't know.

138
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,799
The whole Princess's room is blocked.

139
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,799
What about Mo Li?

140
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,240
I didn't mean it.
