1
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,640
You're haunting me.

2
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,240
Dog-skin plaster.

3
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,680
You're everywhere.

4
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,480
Don't try to be nice to me.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,280
I know. My father asked you to send me

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,560
to cultivate our relationship.

7
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,280
But I won't be fooled.

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,800
Princess, you think too much.

9
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,800
His Majesty is afraid that you might be in danger.

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,560
You don't have to.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,880
I don't need them.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,880
Are there bandits?

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,160
I'm the one who drove this road and I'm the one who's raising this tree.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,520
If you want to pass by, leave it to buy roads.

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,280
Princess, there seems to be a robber.

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,080
Well...

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,080
You have a job. A job.

18
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,520
You said you don't need it.

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,720
Didn't His Majesty send you to escort me?

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,960
Why are you sitting in my carriage?

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,080
You can beg me.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,759
Dream on.

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,040
Let me tell you, I can solve it myself.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,880
Watch carefully.

25
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,200
Dongsheng, pay me.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
It's easier to make than me.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,720
Brother.

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,880
This is called money ability.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,160
As long as you have money,

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,240
there is no problem that can't be solved.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,560
Eunuch! Princess! Princess!

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
What now?

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,440
Take the money and leave.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,680
Why are you still standing here?

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
We're waiting for the Spring Festival

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,640
We want the money.

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
We want the people too.

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,680
Don't come over!

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm warning you.

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,480
This is a princess.

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,600
We're hijacking the princess.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,680
No, you can't pay me back.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,200
Can you beg me?

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,560
You forced me.

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,120
General Mo, what are you waiting for?

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
Master!

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,720
Brother.

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,760
There's something.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,640
Retreat.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,480
Wait. Wait a minute.

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
My money.

52
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,240
You gave them all the money bags?

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,320
Yes, I gave them all.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,400
That's all we have.

55
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,160
Are you crazy, you stupid teammate?

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm so mad.

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,600
You didn't make it clear either.

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,960
No, don't be angry.

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
What are you waiting for?

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,920
Are you going or not?

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,200
Princess, I just saved you.

62
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,040
Aren't you going to thank me?

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,600
Hey.

64
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,720
Why are you so slow-witted?

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,440
Can't you see I'm angry?

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,320
I saw you

67
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,800
You're so boring.

68
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,560
When I get to Seijoh,

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,800
you should go back to the palace.

70
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
What's in it for me?

71
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,360
You want benefits from escorting me?

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,480
How about this?

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,200
I can't refute the marriage bestowed by His Majesty.

74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,080
Why don't you give me

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
to break off the engagement?

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
You don't want to get married either?

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,960
The princess doesn't want to get married anyway.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
It's called

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,280
Let's help each other out.

80
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,840
If you want to break off the engagement,

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,360
It depends on my mood.

82
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
Princess, I think we're here.

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,560
I think we went the wrong way.

84
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,120
Let's go home.

85
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,840
Look at these two words.

86
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
No.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
No one is welcoming us.

88
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,880
No.

89
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,880
Princess, shall I go in and take a look?

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,840
Go ahead.

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,480
Gum, why are you following me?

92
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,280
Give me the engagement letter and I'll leave right away.

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,560
I said it depends on my mood.

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,920
I'm in a bad mood now.

95
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Help!

96
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,920

Dongsheng

103
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,880
It's a ghost! It's a ghost!

104
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,560
Ghost! Ghost!

105
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,000
Princess, what are you looking at?

106
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,880
Where is the ghost?

107
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
What happened?

108
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,880
Why did she faint?

109
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,560
Yes, she fainted when she saw us.

110
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
Why didn't you sleep?

111
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,840
to scare people?

112
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,320
We're not. We're not.

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,960
Today is

114
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,920
We put on this makeup

115
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,800
because it's cold food festival today

116
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,200
Yes

117
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,760
So we dress like this

118
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,360
to welcome our family.

119
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,200
not a ghost.

120
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,640
Right.

121
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,960
We're celebrating the festival.

122
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,360
Yeah.

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,440
Go back and rest.

124
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,400
Okay.

125
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
It's here.

126
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,200
Where am I?

127
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm not awake.

128
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,760
Where is the ghost?

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,040
Help! Help!

130
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
Princess.

131
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,600
