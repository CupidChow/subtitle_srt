1
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,760
Seijoh's finally back to normal! Yeah!

2
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,840
It's finally back to the past!

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,560
Now that I think about it,

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm really grateful that Father brought me here.

5
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,200
This place really changed me a lot.

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,160
from doing nothing

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,440
to the people's recognition

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,720
to earn money.

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,880
I'm not afraid of you laughing at me.

10
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,560
I came here

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,800
I just wanted to stand here

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,440
But now,

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,039
I hope my people can be happy and healthy.

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,520
Come to think of it,

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,480
Father must have had a hard time managing the whole Sheng Xuan State.

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,320
I always quarreled with him.

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,480
People grow up in reflection.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,840
You are now the beautiful princess

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,640
you're a beautiful princess.

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,759
I didn't expect

21
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,320
this snow coat was made by an old man.

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,479
Uncle Li used to be a loving pitiful man.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
This dress was knitted by his loved one.

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,120
But on the day the clothes were made,

25
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,120
the person he loves left him

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,560
to save a child who fell into the water.

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,560
After that,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,960
[And then, he'll be able to move forward.] [He'll be able to move forward.]

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,560
He won't touch these anymore.

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Uncle Li is so pitiful.

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,560
Yeah.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,120
Seijoh has declined for ten years.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,600
Even the most famous garment-making industry

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,440
gradually declined.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,440
No.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
As long as I'm here,

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,320
I'll make this place full of sunshine.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,160
I gather you here today

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,680
to have a meeting with you.

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,440
I heard that ten years ago,

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,840
the best weaving plaque belongs to Seijoh.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,840
Why did it disappear now?

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,480
Jinshan won.

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,880
It was won by Jinshan Kingdom.

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,880
It doesn't matter where it is.

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,480
What's important is the Choochi Festival is next month.

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
The organizer, Kingdom of Kingdom,

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Seijoh will be the host.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,960
Now that I'm in charge of Seijoh,

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
I will lead everyone

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,840
to get back the plaque of the world's best weaving.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,640
No, Your Highness.

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,840
You received too much taxes back then.

55
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,400
We old men went down to do farm work.

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:10,960
Look.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
Our hands are already rough.

58
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,720
Princess, we are old.

59
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,079
Can't we do this?

60
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Yeah.

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,840
We can't do it in such a big competition.

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,040
By then,

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,880
the best dresser in every country

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,920
will come

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,040
Because people from all over the country are coming

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,480
We have to win.

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,640
Are we going to throw it in front of our house?

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,640
Yes.

69
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,120
Take back everything we lost.

70
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
That makes sense.

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:47,240
Take it back. Take it back.

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,280
Your Highness.

73
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,080
Look at the fabric. It's here.

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,360
Okay? Okay. Okay.

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,480
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

76
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,320
Be careful. Be careful.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,640
It's pretty. It's pretty.

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,840
Is it beautiful?

79
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
Is it beautiful?

80
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,840
Your Highness, look at my coat. It's so pretty. It's so pretty.

81
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,560
Next one.

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,360
It's too bad.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Look at the gauze, princess.

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,840
This is what I want.

85
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,200
that I want.

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
It's pretty,

87
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,600
But once this material is embroidered,

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
it will run yarn.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
It looks very rough.

90
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,440
What do you want to show?

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,040
Show me the scarf.

92
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,560
No need to embroider

93
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,960
Uncle Erbai.

94
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,040
Your Highness, what kind of clothes do you want to make?

95
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,800
Can I see the drawing?

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,280
Okay.

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Like this.

98
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,560
I understand what you mean, princess.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Your Highness.

100
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
Help! Help!

101
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,040
Let's go. Let's go.

102
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,480
We searched all the way

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,520
we finally found the maid who sneaked away.

104
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,840
There's something wrong with the investigation.

105
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Suddenly, a large sum of money

106
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
and bought a big house in my hometown.

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,200
Why did you poison me?

108
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,560
I've treated you well.

109
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,560
Your Highness, I was bewitched.

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,040
Please spare my life.

111
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
It's... It's...

112
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,280
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,120
How dare you!

114
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,080
Murdering the princess is a capital offence to the whole family.

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,200
You can't bear it.

116
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Tell me the truth.

117
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,800
It's Miss Situ.

118
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
Miss Situ gave me the poison and silver.

119
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,920
Situ Snow.

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,200
Go in and take a look.

121
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,280
Why is the governor in such a mess?

122
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,960
Yes.

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,080
She is so delicate.

124
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,320
Why is there no servant in the mansion?

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,760
My lord. My lord.

126
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,280
Go!

127
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,680
Go away.

128
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,360
Situ Snow, what are you doing?

129
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,640
Monster! You're a monster! Monster!

130
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,360
Go away!

131
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Go away! Go away!

132
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,440
If you're so timid,

133
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,680
why did you do something guilty?

134
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,680
I didn't do anything wrong.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

136
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,280
Mo Li didn't die because of me.

137
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,680
It wasn't me.

138
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,080
Snow, look at me. I'm not dead.

139
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,840
You're so pretty.

140
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,080
[You're not Mr Mo.] [You're not Mr Mo.]

141
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,160
You're not Mr Mo either. You're not Mr Mo.

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
You're not me either. You're not me. I'm not you.

143
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,440
You're a demon! You're a demon! You're a demon! You're a demon! You're a demon! You're a demon!

144
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,920
Monster

145
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,240
She's a monster! She's a monster!

146
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,680
Don't be with her.

147
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,360
She's a monster!

148
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,000
She's a demon! She's a demon!

149
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,800
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

150
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,640
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look! Look, look, look, look, look, look!

151
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,600
Don't! Don't! Don't!

152
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,400
Don't come near me.

153
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,040
Don't come near me! Don't come near me!

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Is she crazy?

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,240
She seems to have been stimulated.

156
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,160
I heard that her shop had a new owner.

157
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
When you were in a coma,

158
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,760
she told me with a note

159
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
It can save your life

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,919
It seems

161
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,200
Put it here. Put it here.

162
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,559
Let's go. Let's go.

163
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,640
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

164
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,600
He’s here! He’s here! He’s here!

165
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,560
He's here. He's here.

166
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,920
Come on, come on, come on

167
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,200
Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

168
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
Don't catch me!

169
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
Your Excellency, we haven't found the Governor Ma. We can't find him.

170
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,240
Princess, I think

171
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,760
there's something wrong with him.

172
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,760
It's like this.

173
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,960
[It's like this.]

174
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
Well,

175
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,840
He treats his niece like this.

176
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,400
Is he a human?

177
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Actually, I'm thinking

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,920
if Situ Snow

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,080
Can she get the poison?

180
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
After I woke up, I studied that poison.

181
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,240
was not from my state.

182
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,280
It's very strange.

183
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,400
I only found out that Mr. Ma was corrupted.

184
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,720
But I didn't expect him to kill you.
