20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,200
The bridge should be pink too.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,200
Isn't this pink too feminine?

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,360
I'm a princess.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,360

I can't do anything.

54
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,279
Doctor, is there really nothing you can do?

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
Doctor, try again.

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,520

There's no cure.

67
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,560

75
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,600
Please give it to her.

76
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,680

82
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
Leave me alone.

83
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,400
Princess, look.

84
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
With your leadership,

85
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,160

88
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,040
But look at you now.

89
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
You're immersed in your emotions.

90
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,400
Everyone is worried about you.

91
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,480
Without you,

92
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
Everyone is like a headless fly.

93
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,920
No direction.

94
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
What about the people of Seijoh?

95
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,240
What do we do?

96
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,280
Do you think

97
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,000
this is what General Mo wants to see?

98
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,280
Princess, we all need you.

99
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
We all need

100
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,320
happy and unrestrained.

101
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,000
I know.

102
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,480
I just need some time.

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Uncle.

104
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,440
Uncle, please save Mr Mo.

105
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,560
Uncle, Mr Mo doesn't deserve to die.

106
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
It's not Mr Mo who should die.

107
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,480
What can I do?

108
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,320
Uncle,

109
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,640
It's a poison! It's a poison! It's a poison! It's a poison!

110
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,240
Useless thing.

111
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,840
I don't know how to end it.

112
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,120
It's all my fault. I put the wrong poison.

113
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,240
Uncle, we have money.

114
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,280
There must be a way.

115
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
We can find the doctor.

116
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,760
We can find the antidote.

117
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,720
Uncle, please save Mo Li.

118
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,040
Uncle, please.

119
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,760
She's a grown girl.

120
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,480
With her look,

121
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm sure it'll be easy for her husband in the future.

122

My good niece.

123
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,000
There's still a way.

124
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,800
What is it?

125
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,960
What is it?

126
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,880
Medicine.

127
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,480
