1
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,200
She's here! She's here! She's here!

2
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,360
She's fine.

3
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,600
People grow up from reflection.

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,880
No one comes.

5
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,320
Maybe no one likes me.

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,960
So even Father doesn't like me anymore.

7
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,360
Liar.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,840
We have a free dinner.

9
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,680
Yes.

10
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,080
I'm not lying.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,880
Really?

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,760
Really.

13
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,280
Look how nice you are to me

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,920
Lady, please eat.

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,440
Here you go. Here you go. Here you go.

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,600
This...

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,840
Is it poisonous?

18
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,720
It's not poisonous. Don't worry.

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,400
You guys are so creepy.

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,600
I'm not eating.

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,720
I'll eat first.

22
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,680
Look.

23
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,240
Okay.

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,759
Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat.

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,480
I'll eat it.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,920
Lady, have some fish.

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,280
Have some shrimp

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,560
Thank you.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
Princess, you are so nice.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,960
Me?

31
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,200
Of course.

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,680
You're pretty and kind.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,079
and friendly.

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,120
I accept you.

35
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,720
From now on, I'll give you whatever I eat.

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Look.

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,800
I knew you're the best princess I've ever seen.

38
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,880
You've seen other princesses?

39
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,520
Nonsense.

40
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,120
Don't talk nonsense.

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
Don't talk if you don't know how.

42
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,560
I've decided.

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,760
What have you decided?

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,720
Today is my birthday.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280
I hereby swear

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,000
I've decided to be the best princess.

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
and be loved by the people.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay.

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,400
Why should the people love you?

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,880
You've never been married, have you?

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,520
You deserve it.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,880
You deserve to be single.

53
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,040
That's right.

54
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,240
No one wants him in the future.

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,280
Go on.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,240
So I decided

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,079
I will open the cold palace myself.

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,120
First, opening a cold palace is not a small amount.

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,560
Second, we need a big house.

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you have money?

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
Can you afford it?

62
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
No.

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,079
But you do.

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,600
I have. I...

65
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Why are you always picking on the princess?

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
You keep discouraging her.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,160
If there's no difficulty, just solve it?

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,960
Yeah.

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
You're short-mouthed.

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,560
I know a place that doesn't cost money.

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,720
Why not?

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,080
It's free. It's free?

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,720
Okay.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,600
Let's start.

75
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,320
Here.

76
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,880
Put it over there.

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,680
Let's move this over.

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,360
Move that over there.

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,920
Come on, over there.

80
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,680
Let me help you.

81
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,760
The broom.

82
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,400
What are you doing?

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,480
I heard that the princess

84
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,200
will build a nursing home for us.

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,160
What is a nursing home?

86
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,880
A nursing home?

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
What is a nursing home?

88
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,120
You want to make money again?

89
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,880
The tax isn't enough.

90
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,640
Are you trying to squeeze our Qingcheng Prefecture?

91
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,360
Money again?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,280
I open a nursing home to benefit the people.

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,320
It's free.

94
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,920
She's so kind.

95
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,720
That's right.

96
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
How is that possible?

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,800
Of course.

98
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,600
Well said.

99
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,080
OK.

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,680
Thank you, princess.

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,800
Congratulations.

102
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,440
OK.

103
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,920
Congratulations.

104
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,800
The nursing home is officially open today.

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

106
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,920
It's still free.

107
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, please come in.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,960
Please.

109
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,840
Thank you, princess.

110
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,960
Slow down.

111
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,240
Don't push.

112
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,120
What should we do?

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,040
Okay.

114
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,360
We can live here for free from now on.

115
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,800
We can live here for free.

116
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,760
Be careful.

117
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
Slowly.

118
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,640
The dishes are ready.

119
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Mr Mo.

120
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,080
Can I help you?

121
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,159
What are you doing here?

122
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,960
Aren't there volunteers at the door?

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She was hired.

124
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,720
Since you're leading the way to do good deeds,

125
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
how can Situ family be left behind?

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,040
Right, Mr Mo?

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,880
We need manpower in the nursing home.

128
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,520
Why don't you help me cut the vegetables?

129
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,600
Okay.

130
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,640
The weasel greets the chicken.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,480
He's up to no good.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,040
I cut my hand, Mr Mo.

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,760
It hurts so much.

134
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,040
You're bleeding.

135
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
I'll get you some medicine.

136
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,040
Watch the pot.

137
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,760
Tell me, what do you want this time?

138
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,560
Volunteer! Help!

139
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,680
You're only allowed to do good deeds.

140
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,960
I don't believe you.

141
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,440
When I opened a nursing home,

142
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
you were the strongest against it.

143
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,720
So what?

144
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,560
It's mainly because he's close to Mr Mo now.

145
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,360
He has a fiancee.

146
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,400
Fiancée?

147
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,560
You're not married yet.

148
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,880
I still have a chance.

149
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Shameless!

150
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,760
You're shameless!

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,240
Shameless!

152
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,480
Princess, you...

153
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,159
It's about the ladies.

154
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,800
Let's leave the servants alone.

155
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,960
Princess, can you eat earlier?

156
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,200
Yes.

157
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
It's taking so long to eat

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm hungry.

159
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,040
Let's eat

160
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,640
Dinner is ready

161
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,320
Dinner is ready

162
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
Eat mine first.

163
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,360
Eat mine first.

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
Eat mine first

165
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,680
Eat mine first

166
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,520
Eat my cabbage first

167
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,080
My radish helps digestion

168
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
My cabbage can grow taller

169
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
My radish can also be beautified

170
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
My cabbage can lose weight

171
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,920
My radish can grow hair

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,480
Mine can also lose weight and live long.

173
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,440
Stop arguing.

174
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,200
Let's eat together.

175
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,320
How is it?

176
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,080
It's so spicy.

177
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,360
It tastes awful.

178
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,080
I want to go home.

179
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,040
It tastes worse than the food I want.

180
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
It tastes terrible.

181
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,760
This is terrible.

182
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,840
It's awful. How can I eat it?

183
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,640
She made it.

184
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,480
She made it. She made it.

185
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,400
She made it.

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,680
You made it?

187
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,320
You did it.

188
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,760
Okay.

189
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,520
What are you doing?

190
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,560
I miss my mom.

191
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,800
How about

192
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
Let's try again.

193
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,800
Run!

194
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,120
