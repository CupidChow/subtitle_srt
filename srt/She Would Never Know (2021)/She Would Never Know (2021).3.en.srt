1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,370
(All places, characters, firms and events)

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,800
(depicted in this show are fictitious.)

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,200
So tell me,

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,080
what should I do?

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,200
If I don't do it my way,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,280
what should I do to get back at him?

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,170
To that jerk who made me an idiot.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,380
If I tell you the way,

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,490
are you going to do it?

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,620
Just tell me.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,500
Do it with me.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,820
Date me, Senior Yoon.

13
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,240
I must've been out of my mind.

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,490
Forget what I said.

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm not joking.

16
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,890
I'm not trying to make a move on you.

17
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,830
What is it then?

18
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,860
Do whatever you can
to get back at him, as you said.

19
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,770
So that he'll know how cruel he is.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,340
I'm not going to lower myself
to his level.

21
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,840
Are you still worried
that he might get hurt?

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,590
Just focus on your own pain.

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,430
Look at your wounds and nothing else.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,240
That's the only thing I can see.
Why can't you do the same?

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,750
What are you going to do then?

26
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,690
I'll figure it out.

27
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,030
Mind your own business.

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,360
What time is it already?
Why hasn't she called me?

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,300
(Song-ah's mother)

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,870
What is it this time?
(Song-ah's mother)

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,130
What is it this time?

32
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,770
Hello, ma'am.

33
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,610
Has Song-ah come home?

34
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,560
No, not yet. Why?

35
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:40,850
Did something happen to her?

36
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,350
I don't know. What's the matter?

37
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,950
You don't know either?

38
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,920
Oh, well...

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,980
Why don't you know?

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,920
Aren't you her only friend?

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,020
How come you don't know anything?

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,640
What is Song-ah going to do then?

43
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,190
What kind of friend are you?

44
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,950
What's going on with her tonight?

45
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,050
Is it Song-ah?

46
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,550
Oh, yes.

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,160
Maniac.

48
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,220
Those maniacs.

49
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
(Episode 3)

50
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,700
Have you decided what to do?

51
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,860
Take the next lift.

52
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,230
Just do that.
Also, for next month's policy meeting...

53
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,220
Sir,

54
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,170
this is for you.

55
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,630
Thank you for the drink.

56
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,820
You don't have to,

57
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,660
I'm just taking care of my boyfriend.

58
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,970
Boyfriend?

59
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,640
What are you talking about, ABM Yoon?

60
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,210
You should take care of yourself.

61
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,810
It must be a lot of work to cheat on me.

62
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,790
So, was it fun?

63
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,920
Was it fun making a fool out of me?

64
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,520
You piece of trash!

65
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,409
Congratulations, sir.

66
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,650
I heard your sister is getting married.

67
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,350
How did you know that?

68
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,060
But did you know about this?

69
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,860
He's been going out with me for 2 years.

70
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,930
He even asked me to go on a trip with him.

71
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,980
You dirty rascal!

72
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,750
Get up!

73
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,430
What? Do you have something to say to me?

74
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,330
No.

75
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,770
Oh, you didn't have to.
Thanks for the drink.

76
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,690
Will that be enough?

77
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,970
Song-ah, Hyun-seung.

78
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,770
Yes?

79
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,770
Is it okay if we leave at 11a.m.
for the career consultancy?

80
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,180
Yes, it's okay for me.

81
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,080
Me too.

82
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,050
You brought your car, right?

83
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,610
Yes.

84
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,680
Check the material and products
before we leave.

85
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,840
We'll be gone till tomorrow,

86
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,590
so deal with urgent matters now.

87
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,790
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

88
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,990
Where are you going?

89
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,790
-Samcheok.
-Samcheok?

90
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,260
Their pickled vegetables are good.

91
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
Give it to me...

92
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,290
-You're sitting at the back too?
-What?

93
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,750
One of us should sit shotgun,

94
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,930
Hyun-seung isn't the chauffeur.

95
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,760
You're more comfortable
with Song-ah, right?

96
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Yes.

97
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,770
Go sit in the front seat, Song-ah.

98
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,890
What's he doing?

99
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't know. What's up with him?

100
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,420
Sir.

101
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:13,830
Jesus!

102
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,040
Christ!

103
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,880
What are you doing?

104
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,240
Do you have a meeting here, sir?

105
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,450
Why would I have a meeting?

106
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,750
It seems like you're waiting for someone.

107
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,750
I'm not waiting for anybody.

108
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,350
I'm just trying to study the customers.

109
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,790
Don't mind me and get back to work.

110
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,390
Oh, studying the customers?

111
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,530
At this early hour
when we have no customers?

112
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,710
Alright then.

113
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,110
Hey!

114
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,960
Yes?

115
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,660
Single? Married?

116
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,250
That's personal info too, so

117
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,020
you can't disclose that.

118
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,560
How often do our regulars
come to our booth?

119
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
That's different for everyone.

120
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,890
Some come in once a week.

121
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,630
Some come whenever there's a new product.

122
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,660
It's up to the customer.

123
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,270
But if you look at the customer data,

124
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,000
you can figure out how often they come

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
or which day of the week they prefer.

126
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,610
Yes, but...

127
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,280
No way.

128
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,740
Is it because of...

129
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,750
Hey!

130
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,020
No, it's not. Get back to work.

131
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,630
What do you think about me?

132
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,700
What?

133
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,660
I'm pretty attractive
at first glance, right?

134
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,530
Well, you're not my type.

135
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,020
I can be categorized into a type?

136
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,470
It's the first time I heard about that.

137
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,100
This is the progress report
of the wedding dress.

138
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,080
(Lee Hyo-joo)

139
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,150
(Progress: Pending)

140
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,800
How should we deal with
Ms. Lee Hyo-joo's project?
(Progress: Pending)

141
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,820
How should we deal with
Ms. Lee Hyo-joo's project?

142
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,500
Right,

143
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,460
it's time to make a decision.

144
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,630
(I want to ask a favor of you.)

145
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,500
A favor? What is it?

146
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,700
Those people...

147
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,100
I don't want her
to wear your wedding dress.

148
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,300
That's a difficult request.

149
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,610
I know.

150
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,250
It's difficult for the shop,
for you, and for mom too.

151
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,750
I know it'll cause great losses.

152
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,790
Even so, you still want me to do it?

153
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,560
Does she mean that much to you?

154
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,590
Ma'am?

155
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,500
I'll take care of it.

156
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,230
How?

157
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,660
I'll try this on.

158
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,940
Okay, ma'am. Come this way.

159
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,580
Hyo-joo, your phone's ringing.

160
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,180
Tell them I'll call later.

161
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,310
Hello, this is Lee Hyo-joo's phone.

162
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,180
Is Ms. Lee Hyo-joo not there?

163
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,020
She can't come to the phone right now.

164
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,930
Leave your message, and I'll let her know.

165
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,100
Please ask her to call Hara

166
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,970
as soon as possible.

167
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,820
I haven't seen the ocean for so long.

168
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,310
Thanks, Hyun-seung.

169
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,670
You are so nice
for being our driver today.

170
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,420
You must be exhausted from driving.

171
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,040
It's okay, I like to drive.

172
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,660
I should really drive too.

173
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,750
Do you have a license, Song-ah?

174
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,750
I do.

175
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,600
I'll drive on the way back.

176
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,630
It's okay, it's better if I drive.

177
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,620
You made the right choice,
don't you think so?

178
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,200
What if you took the bus alone?

179
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,580
You'd have to transfer to another bus.

180
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,710
It would've been so exhausting.

181
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,670
You can just hand over your job
to someone else.

182
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,580
You're too responsible.

183
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,670
We can't travel much these days.

184
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,520
I'm just glad to see the view.

185
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,050
It's like we're on a trip. Let's enjoy it.

186
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,710
Okay.

187
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,960
But it seems like
Senior Yoon traveled a lot.

188
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,930
Really? You do, Song-ah?

189
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,840
Oh, well, I suppose...

190
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,040
I heard about your anniversary trip.

191
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,540
Are you still going for the trip?

192
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,440
Anniversary trip? What anniversary?

193
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,780
Are you going with your boyfriend?
Have you been dating secretly?

194
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,520
No, I'm not dating.

195
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm going with my girl friend.

196
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,820
Oh, with your girl friend?

197
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,500
Too bad.

198
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,280
Here's your bag, Manager Yoo.

199
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,550
Thank you.

200
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,010
I'll get mine...

201
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,380
Take it yourself.

202
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,330
And this. Take this too.

203
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,060
Let's leave after putting down the bags.
We'll be there on time.

204
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,350
I'll go check us in.

205
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,470
Park the car, Hyun-seung.

206
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,430
Okay.

207
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,680
What are you playing at?

208
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,920
How dare you bring that up in the car?

209
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,720
Is it because I didn't do as you said?

210
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,870
Did you find an excuse to come along?

211
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,270
No,

212
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,620
it's for my promotional quota...

213
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,280
You know that's too obvious, right?

214
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,890
Fine, I used an excuse to come along.

215
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,660
Nothing will change if you avoid it.

216
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,800
Same goes for you. Nothing will change.

217
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,090
So stop.

218
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,620
There's no way I'll do as you said.

219
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,110
We'll have to wait and see.

220
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,940
It's a new product.
Would you like to check it?

221
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,380
I'm sure there's no problem.

222
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,350
I'll wrap it up for you then.
Please wait for a while.

223
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,910
I'll pay.

224
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,750
It's your wedding gift.

225
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,490
She'll pay then.

226
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,690
Yes, ma'am.

227
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,790
Thanks.

228
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,590
I'll give you something better
when you get married.

229
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,190
What should I get for you?
What do you want?

230
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,700
Whatever you like.

231
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,930
What more could she want?

232
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,370
She's getting married,
that's what she wanted the most.

233
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,700
Right.

234
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,740
It's such a shame though.

235
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,220
A lot of guys like you.

236
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,940
You should've made some comparisons.

237
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,260
Just like you, my cousin
got married for love too and...

238
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,750
Hey.

239
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,390
It's okay, she's not wrong after all.

240
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,090
So what happened to her?

241
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,560
It didn't even last a year
before she got divorced.

242
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,030
Compromising has its limits.

243
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,690
Their lifestyles were too different.

244
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,760
Is that so?

245
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,970
Lee Hyo-joo?

246
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,830
Go pick something out.

247
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,840
Okay.

248
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,810
Long time no see, Hyo-joo.

249
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,780
You've gotten prettier.

250
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,950
Get to your business.

251
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,300
Don't be so sassy.

252
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,680
Let me take a seat.

253
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,690
I heard a weird rumor about you.

254
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,380
You're getting married

255
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,390
with an employee at your company.

256
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,380
Is that true?

257
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,690
Don't worry, I won't send you
the invitation card.

258
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,790
Is it true? Are you serious?

259
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,170
You really did have a weird taste in men!

260
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,900
I'm surprised you collect
those types of men.

261
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,020
Oh, sorry.

262
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,940
I should respect your cheap taste in men.

263
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,510
Why? Are you ashamed?

264
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,680
Why collect something you can't show then?

265
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,690
You should be grateful to your parents.

266
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,750
Not only did they raise an idiot like you,

267
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,390
but they also didn't break your bones

268
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,589
even if you're being a disgrace to them.

269
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,430
Or,

270
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,870
perhaps they have nothing to say

271
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,820
because that's all they taught you.

272
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,610
Hyo-joo, don't cross the line.

273
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,910
Just because I adore you...

274
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,550
Who are you to adore me?

275
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,550
See, Min-jung?

276
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,120
Lifestyles are indeed important.

277
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,850
But first, he must be
a decent human being.

278
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,930
My Jae-shin oppa makes me proud
whenever I'm with him.

279
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,750
Do you think it's easy
to find someone like him?

280
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,500
Have you packed everything?

281
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,700
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,500
Leaving already?

283
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,470
What a good match.

284
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,880
Birds of a feather.

285
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,780
We'll start the consultant training now.

286
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,940
First, let's talk about
KLAR's color concept.

287
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,220
Just like KLAR's skincare,

288
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,230
we focus on creating our own style.

289
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,100
The comfort of your skin, natural shade

290
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,540
and long-lasting effect

291
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,570
are the three basic elements

292
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,550
we focus on while working on
KLAR's foundation and cosmetic products.

293
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,050
Let me show you the base line.

294
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,180
The Actress Cream
and All-Day Pearl Compact

295
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,090
from the White Pearl base line.

296
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,990
Enjoy your meal.

297
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,990
Thank you.

298
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,080
Eat up.

299
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,160
You must be exhausted, coming so far.

300
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,620
Not at all, I had fun.

301
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,400
Felt good to get some fresh air.

302
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Hyun-seung must be exhausted
since he drove all the way.

303
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,470
He also led the training.

304
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,670
You did a good job, Hyun-seung.

305
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,370
You too, Song-ah.

306
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,880
Thank you.

307
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,470
Thanks.

308
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,000
You did so well on your first time.

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,580
He prepared thoroughly.

310
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,980
His material was chock full of notes.

311
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,890
Like senior, like junior.

312
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,420
Song-ah also works hard.

313
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,460
Of course.

314
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,800
But why were you staring at him?

315
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,590
Were you worried?

316
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,360
Did I? I didn't know.

317
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,070
You didn't even blink.

318
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,670
Were you aware of it, Hyun-seung?

319
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,570
She watched me with such focus.

320
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,440
Thanks to her, I was more alert.

321
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,080
She almost smacked me with her glare.

322
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,980
Seniors have to be harsh to the juniors.

323
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,820
I think I was too soft on him before.

324
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,290
He should learn
to be afraid of his seniors.

325
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,390
I'm scared, but I don't avoid it.

326
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,890
Because you are my senior,
not anyone else.

327
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm grateful that he thinks highly of me,

328
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,010
but he shouldn't
intermeddle with everything.

329
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,970
I have my own reasons

330
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,480
and I can take care of myself.

331
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,180
You two aren't fighting, are you?

332
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,550
-No, of course not.
-We're not fighting.

333
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,770
No,

334
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,590
they're not fighting.

335
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,890
There's no way they're fighting.

336
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,960
Right, there's no way.

337
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,630
Good night, see you tomorrow.

338
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,940
-Good night.
-Good night.

339
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,870
What are you two going to do?

340
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,810
I'm going to take a walk.

341
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,010
I'll go up to my room.

342
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,310
Me too.

343
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,780
Okay, don't mind me and get some rest.

344
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,180
Okay, good night.

345
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,180
Good night.

346
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,860
Go on ahead, I'm going to take a walk...

347
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
(Two years ago)

348
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,420
I'm giving it to you because you asked,

349
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,940
but do you really need this?

350
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,390
This is the last time.

351
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,580
I'm sorry for asking you this favor.

352
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,750
Will it really end here?

353
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,490
Your father can't be helped.

354
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,340
He came straight to you

355
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,790
once he heard you're back in Korea.

356
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,520
Do you want me to settle it for you?

357
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,960
I heard he's barely living a decent life.

358
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,130
No, that's not what I meant.

359
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,360
It's a lot of money.
I wonder how he'll use it.

360
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,740
I'll pay you back, but

361
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,540
I'll take care of him myself.

362
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,180
Wait, do you think I've gone too far?

363
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,850
Do you still consider him your father?

364
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,450
I'm saying this because I'm frustrated!

365
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,280
Did you forget why you
did that to me back then?

366
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,480
Wake up already!

367
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,100
Forget it, do what you want.

368
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,860
Hold on a second!

369
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,670
I forgot to buy coffee.

370
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,050
You go on ahead, sir.

371
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,850
-Eat up, Song-ah.
-Okay.

372
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,230
Stop singing in the office.

373
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,780
What do you mean?

374
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,020
-Song-ah's okay with it.
-You did that yesterday too.

375
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,500
Stop him!

376
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,300
Don't you like my singing?

377
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,100
You almost cried while singing.

378
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,500
Cry? I have no tears.

379
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,980
It's okay to cry, but...

380
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,700
Aren't you curious?

381
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,390
About what, sir?

382
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,820
The director's office.

383
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,310
I knew it. It was you.

384
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,080
I'm sorry. It just happened.

385
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,590
-I won't tell others...
-It doesn't matter.

386
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,840
Rumors or not, it doesn't change the fact

387
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,300
that I'm Lee Jae-woon's dog.

388
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,830
So, you don't have to feel sorry.

389
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,230
You can spread the word

390
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,300
or mock me if you want.

391
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,620
Is that all you took me for?

392
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,960
The reason I avoided you was

393
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,850
because I was sorry for listening in,

394
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,230
regardless of my intention.

395
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,430
I wasn't even thinking
about spreading a rumor.

396
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,130
Also, I don't really care

397
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,310
about your relationship with Director Lee.

398
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,380
The reason I respect you as a senior

399
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,240
is not because of your background.

400
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,150
I'll get going now.

401
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,790
So,

402
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,990
what about now?

403
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,000
It's still the same now.

404
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,100
I don't know what I'll feel later though.

405
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,980
May I go now?

406
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,890
Are you hungry?

407
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,080
I am.

408
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,550
If it's okay for you,

409
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,820
do you want to go for dinner with me?

410
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,070
Why can't you let him go?

411
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,840
Are you even thinking about breaking up?

412
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,480
Or

413
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,550
do you still have anticipation?

414
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,270
Hoping that he doesn't break up

415
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,630
because he can't let you go?

416
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,130
Do you think he'll come back to you

417
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,630
if you hold onto him?

418
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,000
Is that what you're thinking?

419
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,580
Is life that easy for you?

420
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,970
That's why you can say it so easily.

421
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,250
You don't care if I'm struggling in a pit,

422
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,870
if I'm ripped to pieces
or covered in blood!

423
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,640
You're right.
Like an idiot, I can't let go

424
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,820
even though I know
he was never sincere to me.

425
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,590
I know he deceived and belittled me,

426
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,530
but I'm still hoping that he'll pick me.

427
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,270
I hope he'll pick me instead of the girl.

428
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,980
So? So what?

429
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,870
Even if I make a fool of myself,
why do you care?

430
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,150
I'm going crazy as it is.

431
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,450
You don't know anything.

432
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,200
Who do you think you are
to talk wild and all?

433
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,620
This is my last warning.

434
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,630
You've no right
to interfere in my business.

435
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,960
I won't tolerate it anymore.

436
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,630
If you ignore my warning one more time,

437
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,970
I won't forgive you.

438
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,040
I don't do this.

439
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,280
I don't do this to anyone but you.

440
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,340
Did you forget?

441
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,070
I turned you down...

442
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,340
I've been through it.

443
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,700
The same thing as you.

444
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,530
Are they already asleep?

445
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,550
I pretended I didn't know.

446
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,620
I held out, pleading and begging.

447
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,130
That's what I did.

448
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,430
But do you know how it ended?

449
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,760
She dumped me in the end.

450
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,860
You're right.
It might be different for you.

451
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,710
But even if that jerk chooses you,

452
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,540
will you be happy?

453
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,050
Is that how you regard yourself?

454
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,290
Alright,

455
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,560
I'll pretend not knowing anything
as you wish.

456
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,850
But listen,

457
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,820
life isn't easy for me either.

458
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,400
Hurt?

459
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,670
I get hurt too.

460
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,430
I know what that feels like.

461
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,440
(Nice tie.)

462
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,150
(I wonder who picked it out for you?)

463
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,160
(I'm going home first.)

464
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,660
(Hang in there!)

465
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,060
(You skipped lunch
because of the meeting, right?)

466
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,290
(Eat this.)

467
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,400
(How are you feeling?)

468
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,230
(I feel bad for you. Get well soon!)

469
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,940
(Choose our secret rendezvous spot.)

470
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,280
Sir, please take a look
at my approval request.

471
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,420
(Q. Choose our secret rendezvous spot)

472
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,730
(Emergency staircase)

473
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,920
(I'm sorry, I have a stomachache.)

474
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,160
It's okay, I happen to be free.

475
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,630
It's not bad, is it?

476
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,100
Did you tell your husband?

477
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,300
(Of course.)

478
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,570
(He gave me acupuncture
and some medicine.)

479
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,530
(Don't worry.)

480
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,740
Okay, get well soon.

481
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,910
I'll drive Ha-eun home later,

482
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,540
so don't worry.

483
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,780
Okay, I'll call you later.

484
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,110
Is Mom still very sick?

485
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,370
She's getting better.

486
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,250
Have fun with me today.

487
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,530
(It's her! My destiny!)

488
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,110
Daughter?

489
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,739
-Instructor!
-Hello.

490
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,280
-Hi, Ha-eun.
-Hello.

491
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,840
Is Ha-eun doing well these days?

492
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,230
She's very athletic,

493
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,730
she follows my instructions very well.

494
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,480
Please teach her well.

495
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,280
Okay.

496
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,880
Here you go, Ha-eun.

497
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,630
I need to use the bathroom.

498
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,790
Stay here, okay?

499
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,100
Okay.

500
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,910
Hello, little miss!

501
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,940
No!

502
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,540
What?

503
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,610
No!

504
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,580
No?

505
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,930
No, it's not that.

506
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,950
I'm not a bad person.

507
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,920
A bad person won't say
that he's a bad person.

508
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,390
You're smart, little miss.

509
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,890
But you should adjust your standards.

510
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,360
How can such a handsome guy
be a bad person?

511
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,500
Hey!

512
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,750
Alright, alright!

513
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,470
I want to ask you this one thing.

514
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:58,530
You know, the person you're with...

515
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,710
I mean, is she your mo...

516
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,900
Mommy!

517
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,590
Ha-eun, why did you call me mommy?

518
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,030
I think he's interested in you.

519
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,330
Who?

520
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,050
The man just now?

521
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,640
But he's not your type.

522
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,910
What's my type?

523
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,010
A tall and handsome man
like uncle Hyun-seung.

524
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,380
And he must be young.

525
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,340
Young?

526
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,980
Mom said that since you're old,

527
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,510
young men will suit you better.

528
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,480
But that man

529
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,050
looked even older than my dad.

530
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,490
Do you think I can ever get married?

531
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,590
Don't worry, every Jack has his Jill.

532
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,500
Gosh, you've grown so much!

533
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,770
Let's go.

534
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,260
In the Urban Mood line,

535
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,460
there are Serum Point Lipstick

536
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,610
and Long Lasting Moisture Lip Ink.

537
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:09,130
The Urban Mood line
focuses on a natural look

538
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,480
that isn't too artificial.

539
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,720
Let's see the selling points
of Serum Lipstick.

540
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,220
The selling point of this lipstick is...

541
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,680
Good job.

542
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,880
You worked so hard.

543
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,690
I'm so tired.

544
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,990
Thanks for driving us,

545
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,460
I'll treat you next time.

546
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,230
Thanks for all your hard work.

547
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,530
You guys live near each other, right?

548
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,180
You should ride with him.

549
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,940
I'll report to BM Lee,
so don't worry about that.

550
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,740
Okay.

551
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,640
Get home safely. See you tomorrow.

552
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,710
Goodbye.

553
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,200
Goodbye, ma'am.

554
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,020
I'll be off now...

555
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,820
Get in, I'll pass by your place anyway.

556
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,410
Hey,

557
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,550
about yesterday...

558
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,980
(Assistant Manager Ahn)

559
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,220
Yes, ma'am?

560
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,720
It's me, can you talk now?

561
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Yes.

562
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,790
The freebie remover
for this month's event.

563
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,160
Do you have extra?

564
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,230
We have around three
or four thousand of them.

565
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,330
Can I take 500 then?

566
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,430
500?

567
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,430
Hold on, please.

568
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,210
(Aunt sent a message.)

569
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
Song-ah?

570
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,210
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

571
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,780
You said 500, is it?

572
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,020
Can you spare me or not?

573
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,250
If you can pay for it, then it's okay.

574
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,750
Send it to Busan Logistics tomorrow.

575
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,970
The event starts on Friday,

576
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,420
so they have to ship it tomorrow.

577
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,890
General Manager Im has a foul temper,
so don't forget.

578
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,460
No, I won't.

579
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,620
(Aunt)

580
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,030
(Are you free tomorrow evening?)

581
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,380
I'll just get off here...

582
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,220
It's rush hour.
You'd better use the subway.

583
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,240
Yes.

584
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,060
No way! It can't be true!

585
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,990
She's married?

586
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,530
Her beauty says otherwise though.

587
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,470
It took me so long to find her.

588
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,670
Why do you hate me, God?

589
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,400
(Manager Yoon, Support Team)

590
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,760
Who is that prick?

591
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,320
Who could've snatched up that beauty?

592
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,390
He's probably uglier
and has less money than me.

593
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,160
A good guy like me is hard to come by.

594
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,500
Why didn't she wait for me?

595
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,150
Why did she have to rush?

596
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,070
Should I just become the bad guy?

597
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,770
I'm sure I'll succeed.

598
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,710
I'm just saying.

599
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,880
I'm going upstairs for a meeting.

600
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
Yes, sir.

601
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
Song-ah.

602
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,190
Yes, ma'am.

603
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,420
The freebie remover I mentioned yesterday.

604
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,160
Oh, right!

605
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,520
I'm so sorry!

606
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,830
What? Why sorry?

607
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,490
Those removers...

608
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,530
Right, can I use some more?

609
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,600
They expect a good reaction,
so they want more.

610
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,560
They should've asked for it earlier.

611
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,800
500 more. Is it possible?

612
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,240
No?

613
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,230
It is. It's possible.

614
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,910
I'll put a request to the SCM team.

615
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,150
Okay, thanks.

616
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,350
Sure.

617
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,450
Yes, sir. She said it's possible.

618
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,490
ABM Chae Hyun-seung requested it.

619
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,960
ABM Chae?

620
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Yes.

621
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,250
Excuse me, sir.

622
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,890
Did ABM Yoon request a freebie shipment?

623
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,370
No, she didn't.

624
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,190
Could you do this today, please?

625
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,270
(31001078 KLAR)
(Gentle Lip & Eye Makeup Remover Freebie)
Could you do this today, please?

626
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,000
(Quantity: 500)
Could you do this today, please?

627
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,720
(Request shipment
from Central to Busan Logistics)

628
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,510
We're almost wrapping it up.

629
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,910
I'm sorry. It's important.

630
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,550
Here, have this.

631
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,450
I'll do it because
you're always good to me.

632
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,550
Next time, you should
make requests early on.

633
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,120
Okay, I will.

634
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,190
Thank you!

635
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,000
(He requested it
right before closing time.)

636
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,730
Why? Is there a problem?

637
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:38,030
No, there isn't.
There has been a request for more.

638
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,370
Send it via email then.

639
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,370
Okay.

640
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,860
You wanted to see me?

641
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,330
Yes.

642
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,200
I heard you did it.

643
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,440
You requested for the product movement.

644
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,710
Oh, yes.

645
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,180
Seemed like you forgot.

646
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,980
I'm sorry for interfering in your work.

647
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,420
No, that's not why...

648
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,250
I want to say thank you.

649
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,120
Thanks to you, things went smoothly.

650
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,460
I just did what you taught me.

651
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,880
At first, when I made mistakes,

652
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,360
that's what you did.

653
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,870
You did things for me
so I wouldn't get into trouble.

654
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,700
I was your trainer...

655
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,380
I've grown that much now.

656
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,090
I can protect my trainer.

657
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,220
But if you don't like it,

658
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,220
I won't interfere anymore.

659
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,470
Isn't that what you want?

660
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:24,110
I don't do this to anyone but you.

661
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,440
(I'll put up with it for now)

662
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,310
(since you don't want to be discovered.)

663
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,440
(But if I think it's gone too far,)

664
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,080
(I won't just stand by.)

665
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,500
Because I'm protective.

666
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,190
(I've grown that much now.)

667
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,660
I can protect my trainer.

668
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,140
(Aunt)

669
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,480
(You're free this evening, right?)
(Aunt)

670
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,280
(You're free this evening, right?)

671
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,250
Do you have plans tonight?

672
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:42,080
No.

673
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,890
Do you want to have dinner together?

674
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,760
We can go for a drink.

675
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,790
You'd rather not?

676
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,150
As long as you're paying.

677
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,720
Of course, I'm paying.

678
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,210
I'm going to eat
something really expensive.

679
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,290
I'm off now.

680
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,940
Yes.

681
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,460
No.

682
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,230
Just check if it's 82%.

683
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,630
(Manager Yoon, Support Team)

684
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,570
I have an appointment.

685
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,210
BM Lee!

686
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:44,980
Hurry!

687
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,350
You call this expensive?

688
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,790
You were glaring at me so hard.

689
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,630
I thought you'd kill me with it.

690
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,670
I'm sorry about what I said in Samcheok.

691
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:10,770
I was too harsh.

692
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:12,880
I was even harsher.

693
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,400
I talked out of line like you said.

694
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,480
I'm sorry, too.

695
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,830
Let's order something!

696
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,700
You're scary when you're hungry.

697
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,360
We just made up, so let's stay that way.

698
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:43,060
Ma'am! Three servings of pork belly

699
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,270
and one bottle of soju, please.

700
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,830
-Okay.
-Alright.

701
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,590
A scary person will be eating it,

702
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,750
so give us good meat!

703
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,770
-Okay.
-Alright.

704
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,380
Seeing that my grandfather called us here,

705
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,620
the Europe Project
must've really appealed to his taste.

706
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,820
Don't be nervous.

707
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:37,790
Let's go in.

708
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,830
Only you, Director Lee.

709
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,780
Wait here for a minute.

710
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,810
Is it that hard to let him go?

711
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,980
He's a piece of trash.

712
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,360
I will.

713
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,590
What else can I do?

714
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,130
Honestly, I don't know.

715
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,300
I don't know what I'm hoping for.

716
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:00,310
I don't know what I want.

717
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,820
My head is about to explode.

718
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,880
From morning till night.

719
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,980
But I can't seem to come to a conclusion.

720
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,760
It's not my first break up.

721
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,260
There's no reason I can't do it.

722
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,560
It won't kill me.

723
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,380
I'm so pathetic, right?

724
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,110
Ridiculous.

725
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,380
No.

726
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,660
Not at all.

727
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,530
By the way,

728
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,020
why did she do that to you?

729
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,000
You're such a nice guy.

730
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,740
So you do know that I'm a nice guy.

731
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,640
She said the same thing as you,

732
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,070
that life was so easy for me.

733
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,610
She said I couldn't understand her

734
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,620
because she got it hard.

735
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,110
That's why she left me.

736
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,950
I told her everything
was going to be alright,

737
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,600
but she picked the man
who shared her pain.

738
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,980
That's why he likes her better.

739
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,370
I live in the same reality as him

740
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,540
but she can make him forget that reality.

741
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,270
But I like him for being real.

742
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,700
(It wasn't real.)

743
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,150
What you knew about him.

744
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,780
Right.

745
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,310
I thought I was really in love.

746
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,700
I guess I got conned.

747
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,570
It's empty.

748
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,750
How about a second round?

749
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,620
Are you up for it?

750
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,710
Your father...

751
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,370
Did he still find you?

752
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,030
I'll make sure he doesn't cause trouble.

753
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:20,880
Blood ties and attachment
make you incompetent.

754
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,850
Your position is out of your league.

755
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,710
Get your act straight.

756
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,580
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

757
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,620
Go then.

758
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,260
I'll make sure to get
good results, Grandfather!

759
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,520
(Manager Yoon, Support Team)

760
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,660
Is this the second round?

761
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,370
I can't take care of you
if you get drunk.

762
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:54,900
I'm the only one here.
Are you okay with that?

763
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,320
Should I sue him?

764
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,650
I know a good lawyer.
Do you want his number?

765
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,690
It'll cost a lot, right?

766
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,030
I can lend you the money.

767
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:25,000
You're lucky to have a lot of money.

768
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,980
You really don't like what I suggested?

769
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:37,940
There's a saying.

770
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,840
While trying to avoid a fox,
you meet a tiger.

771
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,690
I can see through your rotten core.

772
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,070
If I take your hand,

773
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,560
I won't be able to manage the aftermath.

774
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,520
What are you going to do then?

775
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,630
Tell him that he's a jackass,

776
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,800
that he's on his own from now on,

777
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,770
and let him go?

778
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,380
Acting all cool and refined?

779
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,020
Why would I do that?

780
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,900
I will get back at him.
Whatever it takes.

781
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:04,010
How?

782
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,610
I'm sober now because of you. Let's go.

783
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,720
I promise I won't.

784
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,300
You're right.

785
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,110
If I take your hand,

786
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:26,100
I'd never want to let it go.

787
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,130
But I promise I won't.

788
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:32,670
Because you're really important to me.

789
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,630
All the more reason not to do it.

790
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,210
I can't give you anything.

791
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:44,790
You can't either.

792
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,590
Please.

793
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,660
Thanks for walking me home.

794
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,240
I'll do it.

795
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,470
I'll do as you say.

796
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,950
If that's what you really want.
I'll do that.

797
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,850
Thank you.

798
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:24,020
But I'll still protect you.

799
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,590
You just taught me how.

800
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,320
Bye.

801
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,000
(Aunt)

802
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,060
(Yes?)

803
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,930
I have something to say.

804
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,890
(Okay, go on.)

805
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,530
Let's stop.

806
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,270
(Stop what?)

807
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,710
I want to stop seeing you.

808
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,950
You disgust me.

809
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,790
(What?)

810
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,390
You heard me. I'm hanging up now.

811
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:02,040
Say that again. What did you say?

812
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,390
Why are you here?

813
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,060
Do you really mean it?

814
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,390
Why?

815
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,770
Isn't that obvious?

816
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,600
I don't like you anymore.

817
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,930
What have you been doing all this time?

818
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,270
Is it Chae Hyun-seung?

819
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,200
If not, then why?

820
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:28,790
I have nothing more to say.

821
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:32,250
Please let me go quietly.

822
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,980
You can't just dump me.

823
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,020
Get in my car. Let's talk there.

824
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:40,920
Don't touch me.

825
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,150
Is it really Chae Hyun-seung?

826
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,260
Why do you keep dragging him into this?

827
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,390
I said I don't like you anymore.

828
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:49,930
Does he know we are seeing each other?

829
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,870
When did you two start dating?

830
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,510
I asked when it started!

831
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,810
Why did you say you wanted
to date openly with me?

832
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,210
Why did you say that?

833
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:02,040
Let go!

834
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,170
Speak already!

835
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,140
Let go!

836
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:05,250
Tell me!

837
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,610
Let go!

838
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,170
She told you to let go.

839
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,120
Move.

840
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,270
This is no place for you.

841
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,160
You want me to move?

842
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,700
I'm ordering you as your boss.

843
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,940
Move, Chae Hyun-seung.

844
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:31,440
Senior Yoon.

845
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,810
I think you should be the one leaving.

846
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,340
Get out of my girl's face, you rascal.
