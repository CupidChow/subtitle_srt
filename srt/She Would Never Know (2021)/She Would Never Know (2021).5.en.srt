1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,750
(All places, characters, firms and events
depicted in this show are fictitious.)

2
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,530
Senior Yoon!

3
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,850
Are you alright?

4
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,720
What's wrong?

5
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,220
It's too cramped.

6
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,790
What about you?
Are you here with your friends?

7
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,090
No, I followed you here.

8
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,560
How did you know I'm here?

9
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,690
I saw you while I was passing by.
You stood out.

10
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,329
Great eyesight.

11
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,570
You can go now. I'm here with my friend.

12
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,410
Why? Since we've met, let's hang out.

13
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,110
Hey.

14
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,610
Do you need to leave now?

15
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,640
No.

16
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,450
Let's hang out then!

17
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,550
Great!

18
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,050
Let's go!

19
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,820
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

20
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,450
Come on.

21
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,650
So you two have been friends
since middle school?

22
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,300
(Episode 5)
So you two have been friends
since middle school?

23
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,050
So you two have been friends
since middle school?

24
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,829
Yes. And we live together too.

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,570
It'll bring us trouble
if people find out that

26
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,600
the HQ employee and
store employee are friends,

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,730
so I told her not to tell anyone.

28
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,340
I swear upon my life I won't tell anyone.

29
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,110
You're overreacting.

30
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,480
Then upon all my assets?

31
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
By the way, why are you here?

32
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,450
If you have any plans, you can go now.
It's okay.

33
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,579
Plans? Oh, my friends?

34
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,390
They are already gone.

35
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,990
I was on my way home
before I followed you inside.

36
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,130
Why?

37
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,040
I know, right?

38
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,960
I would like to know why.

39
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,300
Were you worried if she might meet a guy?

40
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Hey, Kim Ga-young!

41
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,750
Yes.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,700
You!

43
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,540
No, I mean, she
causes trouble quite often.

44
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,340
When I'm not around, she wreaks havoc.

45
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,579
I followed her inside
because I was worried.

46
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,980
I was worried that she
might cause trouble again.

47
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm your senior.

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,700
I know.

49
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,960
If you were my junior,
I'd knuckle you on the head.

50
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,730
She gives me so much headache.

51
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,660
So this is who you are.

52
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,100
You're better than I thought.

53
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,910
If you get to know me more,

54
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,530
you'll find me even better.

55
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,110
Should we get to know
each other more tonight then?

56
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,260
Sounds good.

57
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,870
Cheers.

58
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:17,940
Cheers?

59
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,910
Unbelievable.

60
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,740
We need to get to know each other more.

61
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,520
What a party pooper.

62
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,260
Why don't you two go drink some more?

63
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,390
Shall we?

64
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,130
I'll have to take a rain check.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,600
I can't fall out of favor
with Senior Yoon.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
Seriously.

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's meet up early next time.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,670
We should start drinking
in the morning. Up for it?

69
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,470
Sure!

70
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,159
Awesome!

71
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,770
Stop talking and get in.

72
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,640
Alright. Call us!

73
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Okay, bye.

74
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,680
Get home safely.

75
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:55,450
Okay.

76
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,250
Senior Yoon.

77
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,350
Have a great weekend.

78
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,190
You, too.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,360
Get home safely.

80
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,030
Bye.

81
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,800
Alright!

82
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,430
Fight on!

83
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,230
Ji-Seung, you're watching this, right?

84
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,230
Go easy.

85
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,040
Alright!

86
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,440
Wait!

87
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,090
Seriously.

88
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,130
Is it good?

89
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,230
The shrimp is good.

90
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,260
Try the sweet and sour pork.

91
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,500
Thank you.

92
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,230
Hey.

93
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,070
You're seeing someone, right?

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,630
You're being too giddy.

95
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,570
You're seeing someone, right?

96
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,280
Of course, I am.

97
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,980
It'd be weird if I'm not.

98
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,350
Who is she? What's she like?

99
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,380
Why do you think it's a woman?

100
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,190
It's a man?

101
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,790
Seriously!

102
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,590
What about you?

103
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,150
What about me?

104
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,100
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

105
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,070
Of course, you aren't.

106
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,570
You never know.

107
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,010
Remember the chef
of the restaurant we went to?

108
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,930
My hubby's friend?

109
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,210
Yes, what about him?

110
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,750
Do you want to set her up with him?

111
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,310
Huh?

112
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,320
Just one date. He seems perfect for you.

113
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,580
I'm not interested!

114
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,790
That's why you need to see him.

115
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,490
If I wait for you to get interested,

116
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,220
I'll never see you get married.

117
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,660
You need to make an effort.

118
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,330
That's the only way
to improve this situation.

119
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,360
Why do you keep running away?

120
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,710
I'm not running away...

121
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,500
Then what? Huh?

122
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,370
Why do you keep your distance
from everyone?

123
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,680
Since we're on the subject,
I'll ask you upfront.

124
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,050
Is the canceled engagement
still troubling you?

125
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,780
Yeon-seung.

126
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,710
It was your choice.

127
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,650
You weren't dumped, you quit.

128
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,190
So why are you afraid?

129
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,850
Do you regret it after all these years?

130
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,150
I don't regret it.

131
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,260
I'd do the same if I went back in time.

132
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,550
Then what's the reason?

133
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,890
You're breaking my heart.

134
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,310
You should love, and be loved by someone.

135
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,360
That's the way to live.

136
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,710
Yeon-seung, stop it.

137
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,540
The noodles are getting cold.

138
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,010
So this time, do as I say.

139
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,710
If you don't like him,
I won't bring it up again.

140
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
Okay.

141
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,350
People might think
you're the older sister.

142
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,560
Show me some respect then.

143
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,660
Alright, Big Sister.

144
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,070
Here's your receipt.

145
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,470
Do you, by any chance, have a dog in here?

146
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,140
Sorry?

147
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,980
I keep hearing the sound
of a dog whimpering.

148
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,210
Is she sick?

149
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,950
She's not well for sure.

150
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,800
Stop that and call her.

151
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,920
This has gone too long.

152
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,520
Do you think I don't want to call?

153
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,230
I'm scared.

154
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,650
What if she says she'll
never see me again?

155
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,740
She's so heartless.

156
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,590
She hung up the phone.

157
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,440
It'd be nice for her to call me first.

158
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,750
I told her to go to the college here,

159
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,640
but she abandoned me and went to Seoul.

160
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,720
Can I ask you something?

161
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,920
Sure.

162
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,730
Are you really her biological mother?

163
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,190
Huh?

164
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,750
You're breaking my prejudice

165
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,590
that all the mothers would sacrifice
themselves for the children.

166
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,400
In your case,
your daughter sacrificed herself.

167
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,160
How can a real mother

168
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,500
not let the child date or go to college?

169
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,840
I feel so sorry for her.

170
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,100
You...

171
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,780
Customers are waiting. Go make beverages.

172
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Go work!

173
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,340
Okay, I will.

174
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,050
So stop pouting and tend the counter.

175
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,090
If you keep loafing around,
I'm going to quit.

176
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,930
Sheesh.

177
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,590
Boo!

178
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,680
Yikes!

179
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,090
Seriously!

180
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,140
Good morning.

181
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,600
Good morning.

182
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,270
Did you rest well yesterday?

183
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,640
Yes, and you?

184
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,940
Me too.

185
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,110
By the way, do you go to clubs often?

186
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,440
You danced really well.

187
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,620
What were your moves?

188
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,080
When did I dance like that?

189
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,120
Or is it like this?

190
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,190
I danced way better than that.

191
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,760
Way better than this?

192
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,680
Show me then.

193
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,960
How dare you!

194
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,520
You must be crazy.

195
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,310
BM Lee, you must be slacking off.

196
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,780
How can you come in
later than the director?

197
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,820
Are you wearing makeup?

198
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,420
Oh, uh...

199
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,560
We're launching a new product.

200
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,920
You're so thorough, as always.

201
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,300
How was the wedding shoot? Exhausting?

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,770
I guess.

203
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,440
It's not far off now.

204
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,240
Let's talk about your promotion soon.

205
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,610
Become a director before the wedding

206
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,410
and go to Europe after that.

207
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,750
It's perfect, right?

208
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,020
Stop what? Me?

209
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,460
Stop goofing around.

210
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,020
I didn't.

211
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,700
Get in, Senior Yoon.

212
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,080
Right,

213
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,220
the lipstick is coming out
next week, is it?

214
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,720
ABM Yoon.

215
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,700
Yes, the shipment will be on Thursday.

216
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,830
I'll keep checking.

217
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,550
So you're in charge of it.

218
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,820
You'll send LMS, right?

219
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:57,890
(LMS (Long Message Service):
Group messaging service for long texts)
You'll send LMS, right?

220
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,100
(LMS (Long Message Service):
Group messaging service for long texts)

221
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,560
To the customers who already bought it.
(LMS (Long Message Service):
Group messaging service for long texts)

222
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Please pay extra attention.

223
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,960
It's very important to me.

224
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:02,970
Of course, sir.

225
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,860
Wait, I should give more than
lip service to you.

226
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,000
What do you think about lunch?

227
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,540
You are free, right?

228
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,700
Yes.

229
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,860
Will you be okay?

230
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,590
There's no reason not to be. I'll be fine.

231
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,850
If that customer comes,
please let me know.

232
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,050
Please call me. This is really good.

233
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,790
Japanese food is okay, right?

234
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,010
Perhaps I should've asked.

235
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,810
Yes, it's alright.

236
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,800
How long have you been working here?

237
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,640
Is it your third year?

238
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,350
Yes.

239
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,650
How's the marketing business? Is it fun?

240
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,450
I'm enjoying it.

241
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,920
I've been looking forward
to dining with you.

242
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,430
BM Lee complimented you once in a while.

243
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,920
He doesn't usually do that.

244
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,400
That's why I've been
keeping an eye on you.

245
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,080
I think you're great.

246
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,210
You're diligent and tactful.

247
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,010
Thank you.

248
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,850
Are there any difficulties at work?

249
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,620
For example, something like
wanting another BM?

250
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,080
What? Are you saying yes to that?

251
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,910
You should step up your game.

252
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,450
Your competent team member might run away.

253
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,600
Yes, sir.

254
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,810
Come in.

255
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,770
Your meal is ready.

256
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,950
Chef Oh is here, right?

257
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm here with important guests,

258
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,500
so pay extra attention.

259
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,840
I wonder what Song-ah's eating.

260
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,080
It'll be really expensive and good, right?

261
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,580
Of course.

262
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,380
I hope I can sit with the director too.

263
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,650
-Manager Ahn.
-Yes?

264
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,590
Should I give you some money?

265
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,360
Really?

266
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,110
Of course. You think I'm lying?

267
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,510
I'm opening my wallet.

268
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,350
Am I being too generous?

269
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,640
Here, buy and eat anything you want.

270
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,160
You want a designer bag, right?

271
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,310
Buy that too.

272
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,360
And bring me back the change.

273
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,470
Why do you still have so much left?

274
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,660
No appetite?

275
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,420
Oh, right. I guess I don't.

276
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,150
Why? At your age,
even a stone tastes good.

277
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,260
Is it because of your crush?

278
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,890
Oh, no. Not at all.

279
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,150
Who is your crush anyway?

280
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,110
Just tell me. I won't tell anyone.

281
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,170
I was so curious that I couldn't sleep.

282
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,900
Look. Can you see the bags under my eyes?

283
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,640
Manger Ahn, you've always
had bags under your eyes.

284
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,210
At first, I thought you were a panda.

285
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,810
Hyun-seung.

286
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,970
Yes?

287
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,220
If you tell Ahn,
the whole company will know.

288
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,390
Just tell me.

289
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,920
You know I'm good with secrets, right?

290
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,109
I rarely speak.

291
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,180
I told you. It's Manager Yoo.

292
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,030
Seriously!

293
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:28,270
Don't say that.
She might really think you like her.

294
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,230
He learned bad stuff at the office.

295
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,400
Song-ah should have taught him better.

296
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,170
Hyun-seung!

297
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,210
Hello.

298
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,250
Huh?

299
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,180
Are you having lunch?

300
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,980
Yes.

301
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,920
-You too?
-Yes.

302
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,050
Have you had lunch?

303
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,740
-Yes.
-I see.

304
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,320
You're with them?

305
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,120
Yes.

306
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,690
I see.

307
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,170
You know about the Europe Project, right?

308
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,200
The Europe Project?

309
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,070
Huh?

310
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,590
You haven't told her yet?

311
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,010
I think it's too soon to make it public.

312
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,110
Geez, you're too cautious.

313
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,510
I can tell her now, right?

314
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,850
She'll be going with you anyway.

315
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,420
Are you interested in working overseas?

316
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,250
Yes, I guess...

317
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,450
We'll begin a major push
into the European market.

318
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,030
We'll open independent stores
starting with Paris.

319
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,260
So we need to set up a TF team.

320
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,800
I hope you'll join the team.

321
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,370
Me?

322
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,400
We need competent people more than ever.

323
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,640
-If you agree, then...
-Director.

324
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,410
I'll discuss it with ABM Yoon later.

325
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,560
It hasn't been made public yet.

326
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,780
I don't think it's fair to others.

327
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,960
I guess you're more cautious

328
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,920
because she's your team member.

329
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,630
People might think you're favoring her.

330
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,990
BM Lee is in charge of the project.

331
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,370
You can learn the details
from BM Lee later.

332
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,630
That'll do, right, BM Lee?

333
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,800
Yes, sir.

334
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Excuse me.

335
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,640
(Kim Ga-young: Knock knock)

336
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,290
(Sir, she's here!)
(Kim Ga-young: Knock knock)

337
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,010
(Sir, she's here!)

338
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,880
(Wink)
(Sir, she's here!)

339
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,510
Now?
(Wink)

340
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,280
I'm sorry, but I need to go now.
It's urgent.

341
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,320
You two finish up.

342
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,520
Think about it, ABM Yoon.

343
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,720
Sorry.

344
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,370
You were planning to take me to Europe?

345
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,940
It's a good opportunity.

346
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,510
It'll be a great asset to you.

347
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,150
So you really were going to take me.

348
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,180
You never planned to tell me about
your marriage, is it?

349
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,690
If I never found out,

350
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,990
you would've taken me to Europe.

351
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,930
How could you?

352
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,390
Are you really the same person I know?

353
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,540
How much worse are you going to get?

354
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,910
How much lower can you go?

355
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,790
I'm not that stupid
to fall for the garbage

356
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,690
that is disguised as a good opportunity.

357
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,890
Tell the director that I'm not going.

358
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,130
What happened to you last weekend?

359
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,430
You just left.

360
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,760
Was it because of the call
you were waiting for?

361
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,530
Something important came up.

362
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,370
Is that so? Still, you should've told us.

363
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,240
You didn't even pick up your phone.

364
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,410
Actually, I have something to tell you.

365
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,620
What is it?

366
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,440
Not long ago,

367
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,620
I saw Seo-yeon on my way home from work.

368
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,220
It seems like she works
somewhere around here.

369
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,910
She must've found a job too.

370
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,760
Are you okay?

371
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,960
About Seo-yeon?

372
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,560
Of course, I am.

373
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,930
I don't even remember her number.

374
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,180
Really?

375
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,060
Since you turned every girl down,

376
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,170
I thought you were still into her.

377
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,380
Then, by any chance, this weekend...

378
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,880
Sorry,

379
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,910
something important came up.

380
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,620
Thanks.

381
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,440
Senior Yoon!

382
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,390
Did you enjoy your lunch?

383
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,070
I guess.

384
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,960
Are you back from lunch?

385
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,860
Yes, I am.

386
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,430
Go ahead to the office.
I'm going to take a walk.

387
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,470
Can I walk with you?

388
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,970
I ate too fast. I feel bloated.

389
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,740
Okay then.

390
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,120
Do you have something important
to do in the afternoon?

391
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,890
No, not really.

392
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Good.

393
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,250
Huh?

394
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,800
(Right.)

395
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,700
Hara is already well known,

396
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,960
but if you open a pop-up store

397
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,400
in our department store,

398
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,400
it will help to further promote your shop.

399
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,350
And thanks to Hara, it'll improve
the image of our store too.

400
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,290
Okay, I'll think about it
in a positive light.

401
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,160
We're planning to make some changes too.

402
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,020
I look forward to your response.

403
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,790
See you again.

404
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,840
Goodbye.

405
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,460
Bye.

406
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,630
We meet again.

407
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,870
You must be wondering why I'm here.

408
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,480
Who are you?

409
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,050
No way.

410
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,510
You don't remember me?

411
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,080
I'm not that easily forgettable.

412
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,960
Lipstick.

413
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,900
I'll get it for you.

414
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,260
Even if I have to make it myself.

415
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,560
You remember me, right?

416
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,130
What brings you here?

417
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,360
Oh, that.

418
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,340
There's something I want to ask you.

419
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,090
Which is...

420
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,470
Do you need to go through a lawsuit?

421
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,220
For me to meet you?

422
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,720
For example,

423
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,960
a divorce suit

424
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,280
or something like that?

425
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,370
(Is she saying no?)

426
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,460
(She's saying no, right?)

427
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,500
Do you need it or not?

428
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,730
No.

429
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,200
There's no need for a divorce suit.

430
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,770
Yes!

431
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,010
Okay!

432
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,530
That's great.

433
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,580
As I promised, I'll let you go now.

434
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,680
We'll meet again, so don't be sad.

435
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,850
I'll rack my brains
to find ways to see you.

436
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,360
Bye.

437
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,400
I broke off my engagement.

438
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,900
If that's an issue...

439
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,510
Should I break off an engagement too?

440
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,490
Tell me your answer next time.

441
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,750
And also your name.

442
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,240
You said you want to bunk off.

443
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,030
That's why we're here.

444
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,150
There's nothing else to do,

445
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,220
so why don't we look at the products?

446
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,380
What are you talking about?

447
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,610
We can eat something nice, watch a movie

448
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,920
or just take a walk.

449
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,720
It's not a date.

450
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,320
I asked you to bunk off.

451
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,890
But still...

452
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,560
We need to develop a new product.

453
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,360
We have to do this soon anyway,

454
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,860
so let's do it now.

455
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
It's a lip tint, right?

456
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,940
Do you like your work that much?

457
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,470
When people don't want to work,

458
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,740
they don't even go near it.

459
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,100
Yes,

460
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,550
I like my work that much.

461
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,480
I'm going to do it for a very long time.

462
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,630
So I just need to work hard

463
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,860
to win your favor, right?

464
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,830
Teach me quickly,

465
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,360
so that I can develop a good product
and win your favor.

466
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,430
Please explain to me.

467
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,030
Hurry up.

468
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,470
The shape of an applicator
is important in lip products.

469
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,380
We make the shape based on the texture.

470
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,510
It's a bit bent. Like this.

471
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,380
It goes on well.

472
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:10,940
Right?

473
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,150
The color is really deep.

474
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,080
What's the color?

475
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,920
You know the colors by number, right?

476
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,290
No. 1 is pink, no. 2 is

477
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,030
orange, no. 3 is beige, no. 4 is red

478
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,150
and no. 5 is purple.

479
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,200
You can name them whatever you like.

480
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,060
But just to be sure,

481
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,870
you need to check
with the legal team first.

482
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,470
Another company might have patented it.

483
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,160
When I come up with a new name,

484
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,340
I should patent it too.

485
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,670
That's right.

486
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,180
What could they be?

487
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,410
For example, avoid names like these.

488
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,450
Oh, because they are already taken.

489
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,120
Come in!

490
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Take a seat.

491
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,660
Sorry about earlier.
It was really important.

492
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,700
Was the lunch good?

493
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,030
Yes.

494
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,940
About the TF team...

495
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,260
You should've told me
before you spoke about it.

496
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,070
I thought you already told her.

497
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,210
We decided to take
ABM Yoon a long time ago.

498
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,510
I don't think I said anything
I shouldn't have.

499
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,380
I think I should sleep on it.

500
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,150
Why all of a sudden?

501
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,520
Is there a problem with her?

502
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,230
It's hard to find someone like her.

503
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,350
Does she have a problem with you?

504
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,470
No,

505
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,000
I just want to be careful.

506
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,870
You should be,

507
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,610
but this is unexpected.

508
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,810
Okay, I know you'll do the right thing.

509
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,740
Let me know when you make a decision.

510
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm changing the job assignments.

511
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,660
Manager Kang.

512
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,830
Yes, sir.

513
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,770
You'll be the new trainer for ABM Chae.

514
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,720
He'll be working closely with you

515
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,140
for products and channels.

516
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,370
Why so suddenly?

517
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,380
I've been watching him closely

518
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,230
and I think he's having
a hard time with his task.

519
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,010
Color cosmetics development
is harder than skincare.

520
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,690
I think it was too much
for a first-year newbie.

521
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,580
Teach him well, Manager Kang.

522
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:30,680
Yes, sir.

523
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,660
Who will come to color cosmetics then?

524
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,560
And who will handle his channels?

525
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,900
I'll let you know after I think about it.

526
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,870
Manager Yoo and ABM Yoon
will have to work on it for now.

527
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,440
Yes, sir.

528
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,380
Just transfer ABM Chae
when you have the decision then.

529
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,040
We can't afford to spare anyone
in our section right now.

530
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,450
We don't know how long it'll take
for you to make the decision.

531
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,340
We can just swap the members when there's

532
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,390
someone available for our section,
so that there's no gap.

533
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,360
Was ABM Chae doing that much work for you

534
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,830
to worry about a gap in the workload?

535
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,660
As I see it, he's more like an assistant.

536
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,600
He does quite a lot for a newbie.

537
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,000
He's doing great.

538
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,670
ABM Yoon,

539
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,470
I understand what you're saying.

540
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,310
But this is my decision as a BM
to operate the team better.

541
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,720
I think it'll be better for his career

542
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,120
to learn the basic knowledge.

543
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,050
I'll decide quickly
so that there won't be a gap.

544
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,830
Start the takeover immediately.

545
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,540
ABM Chae, learn from
Manager Kang after this.

546
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,240
Yes, sir.

547
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,220
Senior Yoon...

548
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,820
Song-ah!

549
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,490
Is there a lot to hand over?

550
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,860
No, not much. Why?

551
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,560
Can it be done
before we get off work?

552
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,540
You can just give me the material.

553
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,460
I'll have to check first.

554
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,560
Okay.

555
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,040
Why?

556
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,240
What were you going to say?

557
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,440
We'll talk later.
Do what you have to do first.

558
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,290
Okay.

559
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,360
(Canceled?)

560
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,350
I didn't cancel it.

561
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,130
Why did you cancel my dress?

562
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,570
It was because of internal affairs.

563
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,440
I'm getting married in a month.

564
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,760
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,540
What is the internal affair?

566
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,770
Are you closing the shop?

567
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,110
We will compensate...

568
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,210
What else do I need other than a dress?

569
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,820
Are you really telling me I'm on my own?

570
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,280
Is this how you handle things?

571
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,890
I don't believe it!

572
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,370
Find a new dress shop for me.

573
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,630
Where they can meet the deadline.

574
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,140
I'm going home.

575
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,370
Okay, bye.

576
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:38,910
Bye.

577
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,000
Senior Yoon!

578
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,440
Are you done?

579
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,210
Yes.

580
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,900
After the meeting, it was so hectic.

581
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,110
We didn't have a chance to talk.

582
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,550
I'm sorry.

583
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,580
You're suffering because of me.

584
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,610
I knew you would say that.

585
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,120
I was going to say I'm alright.

586
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,460
I'm really okay.

587
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,030
Since he thinks we're dating,

588
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,220
he'll surely split us up.

589
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,530
You're better than me.

590
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,350
You'll learn a lot of new things

591
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,670
at skincare and door-to-door.

592
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,870
Do your best.

593
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,270
Okay.

594
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,100
I'll work twice as hard,
so don't worry.

595
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,340
By the way,

596
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
the weather is so nice.

597
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,040
Are you not going to
throw me a farewell party?

598
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,880
I will,

599
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,390
but I'm a bit tired today.

600
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,660
Let's set a date soon.

601
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,460
Okay.

602
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,090
Get home safely.

603
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,060
You too, bye.

604
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,930
Bye.

605
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,370
You're home.

606
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,200
Thank you.

607
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,370
You should've let yourself in.

608
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,730
I have manners.

609
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,770
I don't barge into other people's houses,

610
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,030
even if you're my boyfriend.

611
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,200
Can you take a day off this week?

612
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,070
Why?

613
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,010
There's a problem with my wedding dress.

614
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,910
I'm going to change the shop.

615
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,510
I'll check my schedule.

616
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,210
Are you not going to ask

617
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,890
what problem it is?

618
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,960
You must have a good reason for it.

619
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,470
I guess I'm getting married alone.

620
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,240
It's my wedding dress anyway.

621
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,200
It's not someone else's problem.

622
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,070
I'll be careful from now on.

623
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,180
I'll get the earliest possible day off.

624
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,010
A lot happened today. I'm tired.

625
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,460
I'll get going now.

626
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,490
Hyo-joo.

627
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,530
You know, Jae-shin.

628
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,460
You can't walk all over me.

629
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
I do love you more,

630
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,770
but it's not my weakness.

631
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,290
This is really good for the complexion...

632
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,660
It goes like this, right?

633
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,820
Huh? What?

634
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,570
Song-ah.

635
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,010
Changes are hard, right?

636
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,370
Yes, a little.

637
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,340
It's been only two days,
so it must be awkward.

638
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,880
Still, how can you know just by his voice?

639
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,570
Lucky you, Hyun-seung.

640
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,280
Your trainer is so affectionate.

641
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,490
Oh, she's your ex-trainer now.

642
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,150
Get ready to go, Hyun-seung.

643
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,920
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,690
I'll introduce Hyun-seung
to the sales team.

645
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,040
To celebrate his transfer,

646
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,550
talk to Chief Kim

647
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,500
and ask for an increase in sales.

648
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,470
Hyun-seung.

649
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,600
Yes, sir.

650
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,540
Hang in there.

651
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,140
I will.

652
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,540
We'll be back.

653
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,910
Yes, this is Yoon Song-ah from KLAR.

654
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,650
Yes, Director Lee.

655
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,420
Director Lee asked to see me.

656
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,020
Tell him it's ABM Yoon Song-ah.

657
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,620
Please wait for a moment.

658
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,220
Sure.

659
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,260
Sir, ABM Yoon Song-ah is here.

660
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,100
Yes, sir.

661
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,110
You're here.

662
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,210
Hello, sir.

663
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,840
I've brought the product you asked for.

664
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,850
Good.

665
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,720
Okay, thanks.

666
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,250
Have you thought about it?

667
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,850
What I said at lunch the other time?

668
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,760
Well...

669
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,860
You're still thinking about it.

670
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,630
While you're at it, give it some thought.

671
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,120
It's the chance of a lifetime.

672
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,440
If you say you want to go,

673
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,740
I'll send you there for sure, okay?

674
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,640
You may go now.

675
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,330
What? I'm busy.

676
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,750
Jae-shin is at work, right?

677
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,430
Why would you ask me about him?

678
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,680
Of course, he's at work.

679
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,390
Two of these, please.

680
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,980
All right.

681
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,990
Lastly, two of these.

682
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,480
Pack them with the drinks
I ordered earlier.

683
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,330
Okay.

684
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,900
He decorated this place so well.

685
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,140
Did he pick these out himself?

686
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,880
Is omija tea okay?

687
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,800
Try it, I made the ingredients myself.

688
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,420
What a lovely color.

689
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:31,880
Thank you.

690
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,420
Am I bothering you at break time

691
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,690
when you should get some rest?

692
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,360
I'm okay if it's you, Yeon-seung.

693
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,170
What brings you here anyway?

694
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,700
Since you're always nice to us,

695
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,040
I want to thank you.

696
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,520
This is men's skincare.

697
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,210
My brother's company makes it.

698
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,510
My husband said it's good.

699
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,880
I'm using this too.

700
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,650
Oh, really?

701
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,320
That's great!

702
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,300
Everyone has a different taste
for their skincare,

703
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,960
so I was a bit worried.

704
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,080
Thank you.

705
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,600
Did you choose the decorations yourself?

706
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,840
Or a girlfriend choose them for you?

707
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,340
They are so pretty.

708
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,420
I chose them myself.

709
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,340
I don't have a girlfriend.

710
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,410
Oh, why though?

711
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,820
You seem like a great guy.

712
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,950
Are you not interested in dating?

713
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,610
I am, but...

714
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,620
The reality is harder than you think.

715
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,630
Why?

716
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,690
Where there's a will, there's a way.

717
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,070
Perhaps you haven't met
the right person yet.

718
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,340
If you don't mind my asking,
what's your type?

719
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,930
There might be someone
I know who fits your type.

720
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,640
I don't know what type I like.

721
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,220
But there's a type I'm curious about.

722
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,120
Which type is that?

723
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,600
Ow, hot.

724
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,660
It's hot.

725
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,200
Yes, it's hot.

726
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,950
(But there's a type I'm curious about.)

727
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,820
He's talking about me, right?

728
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,130
He has an eye for beauty.

729
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,260
Who?

730
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,360
Oh, just someone I know.

731
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,070
Did someone say you're pretty?

732
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,410
Why do you ask?

733
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,280
That person might be conning you.

734
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,710
What?

735
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,580
You're not pretty, Mom.

736
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,380
What about Aunt Ji-seung?

737
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,280
She's pretty.

738
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,780
And Uncle Hyun-seung?

739
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,420
He's pretty.

740
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,220
And you?

741
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,020
I'm pretty.

742
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,350
Why aren't I pretty then?

743
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,960
Ask Grandma, not me.

744
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,360
A daughter is supposed
to support her mother.

745
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,040
But I can't lie.

746
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,660
Green light.

747
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,590
Go, Mom.

748
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,060
Hello.

749
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,690
Long time no see.

750
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,460
He's a newcomer.

751
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,950
Hello, I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

752
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,530
Let's talk later when we have time.

753
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,530
Okay.

754
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,930
Goodbye.

755
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,140
Hello.

756
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,670
Go introduce yourself.

757
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,510
Yes.

758
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,610
Hello, I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

759
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:17,410
Oh, hello.

760
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,520
Hello.

761
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,250
Hello.

762
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,280
He's the new ABM.

763
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,940
Oh.

764
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,620
Hello.

765
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,350
Nice to meet you.

766
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Hello.

767
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,220
Hello.

768
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,530
Hello, I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

769
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,060
Hi.

770
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,030
I look forward to working with you.

771
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,190
I'll get going now.

772
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,450
(Gangnam)

773
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,200
Chief Kim,

774
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,270
I want to introduce the new ABM.

775
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,990
Oh! He's new?

776
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,140
No, but he was assigned
to door-to-door this week.

777
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,340
Hyun-seung.

778
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,270
Right, I'm Chae Hyun-seung.

779
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,180
Nice to meet you.

780
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,550
Nice to meet you, I'm Kim Do-gyun.

781
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,110
Hello.

782
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,550
How long have you worked here?

783
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,920
I've never seen you before.

784
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,070
It's my first year.

785
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,850
So you have zero background
about door-to-door.

786
00:43:58,450 --> 00:43:59,960
Have you been to the branch office?

787
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,160
I went once when I was an intern.

788
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,720
Then you haven't.

789
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,600
Are you free today?

790
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,490
Today?

791
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,430
It's up to you. Check your schedule.

792
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,700
I don't have anything important today.

793
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,530
It's settled then.

794
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,960
Hey, Manager Jin!

795
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,320
You're going to the branch office, right?

796
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,380
Yes.

797
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,080
Take the new ABM with you.

798
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,450
Teach him well.

799
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,690
Put the samples in the trunk.

800
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:33,250
Yes, sir.

801
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:47,660
Marketers should know
the situation on the field.

802
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,240
You all just sit at your desks.

803
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,540
That's not how you develop
a proper sales policy.

804
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,330
Fasten your seatbelt.

805
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,310
Yes, sir.

806
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,430
Three boxes.

807
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,250
Okay.

808
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,320
Here's your receipt.

809
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,590
Here.

810
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,560
Okay, thank you.

811
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,490
Goodbye.

812
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,100
Bye.

813
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,860
It looks heavy. I'll do it.

814
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,310
No, it's okay.

815
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,910
Do you really want to end it like this?

816
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,420
Is it that easy for you to move on?

817
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,950
Even if we break up, this isn't the way.

818
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,620
Just tell the director that
I won't join the TF team.

819
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,260
That's all I want to hear from you.

820
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,060
Is it because of Chae Hyun-seung?

821
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,430
Did he tell you not to go?

822
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,560
Let's go.

823
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,700
I'm here!

824
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,400
Come on in.

825
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,360
Hello.

826
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,400
Nice to meet you.

827
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,230
Put the box here.

828
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:56,770
Yes, sir.

829
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,940
Coffee?

830
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,140
Perfect.

831
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,410
Hello.

832
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,040
Who is he? A newbie?

833
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,450
An ABM from KLAR.

834
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,150
He's doing door-to-door now, but
he's only done department stores before.

835
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:15,820
Coffee?

836
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,250
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

837
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,320
If an elder gives you
something, you take it.

838
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,530
You're such a geezer.

839
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,030
I'm glad that I don't have to make more.

840
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,500
I have something
to say to KLAR's marketing.

841
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,000
Good, pour it all out

842
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,370
so that they'll work properly.

843
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,310
Sit down.

844
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,410
Yes, sir.

845
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:42,580
Please tell me everything.

846
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,680
About the policy...

847
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:52,320
It's always a sample or 5:1 or 4:1.

848
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,290
What are you doing? Take notes.

849
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,930
Oh, right...

850
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,030
Can I use that pen and paper?

851
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,870
The policy is always 5:1 or 4:1...

852
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,110
Yes, but the policies should be...

853
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,610
We're back!

854
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,080
Did you sell a lot?

855
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,620
Oh! Manager Jin is here.

856
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,240
Did you bring something good?

857
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,250
I'm the good thing,
what more can you want?

858
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:24,720
Who is this?

859
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,460
An ABM from KLAR.

860
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,960
Oh! ABM!

861
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,490
So handsome! How old are you?

862
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,830
I sold a lot of KLAR products today.

863
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,360
Why didn't you give him a cup of coffee?

864
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,170
Do you want some coffee?

865
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,270
No, thanks. I don't like caffeine.

866
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,170
How about iced tea?

867
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,000
No, it's alright.

868
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,660
Over here! He's an ABM from KLAR!

869
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,400
Oh, hello.

870
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:48,940
Nice to meet you.

871
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,780
Hello.

872
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,280
We have a gathering later.

873
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:52,920
A gathering?

874
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,650
You should come!

875
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,670
It'll be fun.

876
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,760
(Yes, ma'am, I just got in.)

877
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,810
(Yes.)

878
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,030
I'll get my stuff and go home.

879
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,100
Yes.

880
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,900
Okay, see you tomorrow.

881
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,700
Goodbye.

882
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:12,900
Okay.

883
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,870
Chae Hyun-seung.

884
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:57,010
Okay. Rock, paper, scissors!

885
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,150
I'm going first.

886
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,880
I did it!

887
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,730
Did you really have dinner?

888
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,390
Your cheeks have sunken in.

889
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,310
It's because I worked outside today.

890
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,920
You should go home then. Why come here?

891
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,330
I said I'd be at Ha-eun's recital
but I couldn't make it.

892
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,430
So I'm keeping my promise today.

893
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:18,400
Because my pretty little niece
wants to see me!

894
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,100
Right, Ha-eun?

895
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,600
If you're tired, it's okay
to break one promise.

896
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,540
You can just tell me next time.

897
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,340
You're exhausting yourself
trying to make a living.

898
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,810
You understand it?

899
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,380
Is she really seven years old?

900
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,850
The kids these days don't act their age.

901
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,620
She's more like a 17-year-old girl.

902
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,500
Are you sure you're alright?

903
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,720
You don't look too good.

904
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,730
Honey, feel Hyun-seung's pulse!

905
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,100
No, it's okay.
I'm healthy. I'm really fine.

906
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,600
Still, I'll check your pulse later.

907
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,730
See me before you go.

908
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,440
You should.

909
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,270
Okay, thank you.

910
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,800
He's busy.

911
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,430
Checking your pulse won't help though.

912
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:03,410
What?

913
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,880
You got dumped, right?

914
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:08,380
I can tell.

915
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,690
Don't cry even though it hurts.

916
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,920
Love is supposed to hurt.

917
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,510
Who is she going to be when she grows up?

918
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,500
Is it really about a girl?

919
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,170
No, not at all.

920
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,030
How could you listen to a kid?

921
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:26,870
I want some cold water.

922
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,550
Sit. I'll get it for you.

923
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,410
Is it my turn?

924
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:47,890
Thank you.

925
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:02,740
Senior Yoon!

926
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,230
What are you doing here?

927
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,580
The Gangnam sales team wants to see me.

928
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,640
I see.

929
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,150
Are you alone?

930
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,750
Manager Kang said she's busy.

931
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,320
Is that so?

932
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,220
You're doing well, right?

933
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:20,690
Aren't you getting on?

934
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,060
Yes, just a moment!

935
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,260
Go on then.

936
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:24,930
Okay.

937
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:25,560
Keep it up.

938
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,560
You too.

939
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,700
(Chae Hyun-seung)
(Don't worry, Senior Yoon!)

940
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,620
(Whoosh whoosh)

941
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,650
(Boom boom)

942
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:12,780
(Don't forget about my farewell party!)

943
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,330
Don't even think of
going home before midnight.

944
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:32,830
Okay, sir.

945
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:33,630
What song did you prepare?

946
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:34,590
I prepared "Ground Bee".

947
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,600
Good choice.

948
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,160
What about you?

949
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:36,930
I prepared "Unconditionally".

950
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,430
Oh! "Unconditionally"?

951
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,340
Write down your home address
and emergency contact number.

952
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,710
Why do you need this though?

953
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,120
Okay, let's go!

954
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,420
Yes, sir!

955
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,130
Oh, okay!

956
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,910
I'm going to head home.

957
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,540
Manager Kang,

958
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,180
how come Hyun-seung is not back yet?

959
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,320
He's probably at the gathering.

960
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:28,840
Why?

961
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,590
It's obvious.
They're trying to break him in.

962
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,340
You should've stopped them.

963
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,110
How could you let him go?

964
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,200
He should take care of himself.

965
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:39,230
Bye, guys.

966
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,430
Okay, bye.

967
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,270
Wow, she's so cold.

968
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,670
I'm so glad that she's not my trainer.

969
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,070
Let's go, Manager Ahn.

970
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,570
Take it easy, Song-ah.

971
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,670
Take care.

972
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,270
Bye.

973
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,260
Awesome!

974
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,100
Attention, please!

975
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,240
Let's propose a toast to all the ladies!

976
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,710
Chant, ready!

977
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,470
Chant, begin!

978
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,340
Flip the board!

979
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,480
Increase sales!

980
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,480
Meet the goal!

981
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,940
We are the kings of sales!

982
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,130
Bottoms up!

983
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,840
Have one more glass.

984
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,300
Yes, of course.

985
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,370
-Whoa.
-Oh, dear.

986
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,210
One more shot!

987
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,050
Bottoms up!

988
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,300
(Are you still at the gathering?)

989
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:40,350
(Chae Hyun-seung)

990
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,370
(Senior Yoon Song-ah:
Hyun-seung, where are you?)

991
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,320
Manager Jin!

992
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,070
I love you all!

993
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:42,010
We love you!

994
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,410
It's a beautiful night.

995
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,850
Be happy.

996
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,760
(We'll form a TF team.)

997
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,570
The team will stay in Europe
for about three years.

998
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,210
Song-ah is one of the candidates.

999
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,450
I guess she hasn't told you yet.

1000
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,520
So what?

1001
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,280
Do whatever you can to make her go.

1002
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,830
She thought I recommended her
and so she refused to go.

1003
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,490
But she's competent enough for the job.

1004
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,860
She can decide on her own.

1005
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:39,370
That's why you don't know her.

1006
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,560
If she's stuck on something,

1007
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,740
she can't see anything else.

1008
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,500
So if you really care for her,

1009
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,610
make a sensible choice.

1010
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:55,420
I assume you know that much.

1011
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:23,380
There's nothing much to life.
Just enjoy it!

1012
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,450
Why isn't he picking up?

1013
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,160
Where did he go?

1014
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:36,220
Okay, who is no. 1 next year?

1015
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:38,090
KLAR!

1016
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:43,770
KLAR!

1017
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,770
Good!

1018
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,360
Let's go for round three!

1019
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,210
Are you serious, sir?

1020
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,510
I'll go if our ABM goes.

1021
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:59,080
That's enough. Stop.

1022
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,750
Hey, Marketing!

1023
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,440
At your service!

1024
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,790
How about round three?

1025
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,020
Yes, sir!

1026
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,640
He's going?

1027
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,130
Round three! Let's go!

1028
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,630
Huh?

1029
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,200
Huh?

1030
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,300
Go away.

1031
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,010
Manager Jin!

1032
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,040
Manager Jin.

1033
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,010
What is he doing?

1034
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,270
Why did you come so late?

1035
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:27,240
What?

1036
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,070
Seriously.

1037
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,400
Hey.

1038
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,130
I missed you.
