(All places, characters, firms and events

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,460
Let go!

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,730
Speak already!

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,330
Let go!

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,530
Tell me!

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,930
She said let go.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,600
Move.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,280
This is no place for you.

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,510
You want me to move?

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm ordering you as your boss.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,720
Move, Chae Hyun-seung.

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,110
Senior Yoon.

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,250
I think you should be the one leaving.

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,289
Get out of my girl's face, you rascal.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,910
What did you just say?

16
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,440
Did you forget who I am?

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,510
You're BM Lee, Song-ah's ex-boyfriend.

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,009
You know, and yet you
talk to me like this?

19
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,009
Yes.

20
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,750
Did you make the first move?

21
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,430
I shook her up.

22
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,250
No matter who she was with,
I couldn't give her up.

23
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,320
Not to someone like...

24
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,250
Get over here, Yoon Song-ah.

25
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,960
Tell me yourself.

26
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,200
Yoon Song-ah!

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,960
If you don't want to move, we'll leave.

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,270
Let's go.

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,400
Wait.

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,730
He's right.
My feelings for you have changed.

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,680
I like him so much
that I don't even feel sorry.

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,120
You don't even feel sorry?

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,100
No.

34
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,970
Not at all.

35
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,290
No matter what you do, it won't work.

36
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,310
So stop it.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,930
Tell him to go away so that we can talk.

38
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,410
I'm done talking to you.

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,640
You should leave.

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,720
He's gone.

41
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,490
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,160
Don't say that.

43
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,780
I know this is tiring,

44
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,960
but don't think about it first.
Go get some sleep.

45
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,760
Okay?

46
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,450
(Senior Yoon Song-ah)

47

across the street.)

49
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,330
(Episode 4)

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,260
Americano with two shots of espresso

51
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,480
and two pumps of vanilla syrup, right?

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,180
Thanks.

53
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,370
You don't listen to others, do you?

54
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,140
Did you get some sleep?

55
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,740
Do you want to take a day off?
I'll do all the work.

56
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,610
It's okay.

57
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,890
I guess I still have a long way to go.

58
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,650
I'll do better.

59
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,420
I rejected you,

61
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,700
and yet I ended up taking your hand.

62
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,530
But I'm glad.

63
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,190
For not leaving you all alone
at that moment.

64
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,360
Anyway, I owe you a favor.

65
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,340
Though I don't know what to do next.

66
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,020
Just trust me and follow my lead.

67
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,260
Trust your boyfriend.

68
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,020
Not for real.

69
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,920
Yes, fake boyfriend.

70
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,410
Don't worry.

71
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,550
If something were to happen,
I'll take care of you.

72
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,290
Nothing will happen at work.

73
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,220
He's not that kind of person.

74
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,290
You never know.

75
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,130
We should be careful.
Don't make it too obvious.

76
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,260
We'll only fake it in front of BM Lee.

77
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,950
What will happen if it's obvious?

78
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,310
Oh.

79
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,670
Okay. I'll be careful, Senior Yoon.

80
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,010
Promise?

81
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,850
Yes, I promise.

82
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,540
Aren't you getting off?

83
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,910
Senior Yoon.

84
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Yes.

85
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,660
As written in the report,
the sales stop at 103% this month.

86
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,830
I talked to the Sales Department
to increase the number,

87
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,160
but the situation is not good.

88
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,570
How's the progress for the new product
launching next month?

89
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,740
We'll launch it
at the beginning of next month.

90
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,970
What's the sales percentage?

91
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,440
The sales goal for
next month is 33 billion won...

92
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,040
ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

93
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,240
Yes, sir?

94
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,180
Why don't you answer this?

95
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,960
It's 8.2 billion won.

96
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,120
The sales percentage is about 25%.

97
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,150
Can you classify it?

98
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,490
The department store is 2.8 billion won,

99
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,960
and for other distributors...

100
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,600
Is the department store
the only distributor to you?

101
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,140
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,800
I'll check the others next time.

103
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,840
Next time?

104
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,730
Don't you think it'll be too late?

105
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,180
Your mind is a million miles
away from work.

106
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,720
ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

107
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,190
Yes, sir?

108
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,790
Have you tried the new product
launching next month?

109
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:24,890
Yes.

110
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,960
Where? On the back of your hand?

111
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,500
Do consumers only
apply products on their hands?

112
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,500
Assistant Manager Kang.

113
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,390
Did you test the product
only on the back of your hand?

115
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,970
I tested it on my face too.

116
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,010
Assistant Manager Ahn?

117
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,380
Me too.

118
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,170
Why did you only try it on your hand then?

119
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,750
Is it because you're a man?

120
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,760
If that's the case,
you're not suited for our brand.

121
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,330
Or do you despise KLAR and the BM so much

122
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,620
that you just can't be bothered?

123
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,080
I'm sorry,

124
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,900
I'll test the products properly next time.

125
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,190
Do you have something to say, ABM Yoon?

126
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,020
I'm sorry, sir.

127
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,820
I thought I taught him well,

128
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,110
but I wasn't good enough.

129
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,060
From now on,

130
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,970
I'll keep him closer
to my side and teach him.

131
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,620
It hasn't worked until now.

132
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,430
Do you think he will improve
if you keep him closer?

133
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,540
I'll keep doing it until he does.

134
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,150
As his trainer, I'll take
the responsibility till the end.

135
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,790
Is he going through something?

136
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,140
It's going to be okay.

137
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,180
Don't mix business with pleasure, sir.

138
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,720
I think you need the advice more than me.

139
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,860
Everyone will face criticism at work.

140
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,470
But if it was someone else,

141
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,920
you wouldn't have done it
in front of everyone.

142
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,990
What's the reason?

143
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,740
No matter how hard I think,
I can't understand why.

144
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,310
There was no problem between us.

145
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,200
That's why I'm breaking up with you.

146
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,040
You should know what the problem is,

147
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,880
but you don't.

148
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,410
This isn't the way to do this.

149
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,380
You should have talked to me

150
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,440
instead of dragging
a third party into this.

151
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,890
Do you really want to end it this way?

152
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,490
We're done talking.

153
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,960
In your plan for the next 10

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,560
or 20 years in your life,

155
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,230
I'd always been
a part of your future, right?

156
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,100
So reconsider it.

157
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,700
How about you?

158
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,290
Will I be a part of your future
for the next 10

159
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,940
or 20 years in your life?

160
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,930
Is that the reason?

161
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,880
You want me to assure you?

162
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,020
No.

163
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,060
What I want is to end
our relationship here and now.

164
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,990
What is it about him
that you like so much?

165
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,580
Let's talk after work.

166
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,840
That'll be better.

167
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
No,

168
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,030
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

169
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,780
Do you like the food here?

170
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,750
It's so delicious.

171
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,180
I was really curious about this place.

172
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,010
I'm finally here thanks to you.

173
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,050
I heard this place is really popular.

174
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,990
It'll take months to get a reservation.

175
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,260
Really?

176
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,160
Your husband must be
really close with the owner-chef.

177
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,970
He probably is.

178
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,140
He's always at home or at the clinic,

179
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,000
but sometimes he'll come home late

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
when he hangs out with the chef.

181
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,340
Lucky you.

182
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,160
You married a hotshot doctor

183
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,110
who has an oriental medical clinic.

184
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,680
And he's also a family man.

185
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,720
I heard that you're close
with your mother-in-law too.

186
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,520
Of course, she treats me
like her own daughter.

187
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,160
Sometimes, I think
I might really be her daughter.

188
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,130
I don't think so.

189
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,230
You always wish that Grandma
would move to the South Pole.

190
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,370
How could a real daughter...

191
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Be quiet!

192
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,470
She had a fever this morning.
Why is she talking gibberish?

193
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,670
You should eat well to get well soon.

194
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,270
Eat up.

195
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,210
Open your mouth.

196
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,260
Good girl. How precious!

197
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,510
Oh, right.

198
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,690
I heard that the chef is still single.

199
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,960
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?

200
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,530
If he doesn't, I want to
introduce him to my sister.

201
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,900
Children, here's your dessert.

202
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,510
We'll get going now.

203
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,520
Good work today.

204
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,840
Goodbye.

205
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,480
He's well suited for my sister.

206
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,180
Why hadn't I thought of that before?

207
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,690
It's hard to see
what's right under your nose.

208
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,590
He's young, good-looking

209
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,350
and excellent at what he does.

210
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,030
Chef Ryu isn't seeing anyone, right?

211
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,670
I couldn't ask him directly,

212
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,500
so I asked his staff.
They said he's not seeing anyone.

213
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,300
Is it true?

214
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,290
Probably.

215
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,370
I knew it!

216
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,640
Every Jack has his Jill.

217
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,740
My sister is his Jill.

218
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,890
It's too early to do it this year.

219
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,380
They should get married next year.

220
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,350
Mom should make her wedding dress.

221
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,120
Should I call her?

222
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
But

223
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,720
I don't think he'll
be interested in marriage.

224
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,100
Of course, he isn't.

225
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,980
That's why he's still single.

226
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,580
But it doesn't matter.

227
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,720
We can make him interested.

228
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,920
I'm more worried about my sister.

229
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,120
I'll talk her into it.

230
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,910
You don't want to do this?

231
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,330
Do you think it'll be weird?

232
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,310
It doesn't matter.

233
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,980
He's your best friend anyway.

234
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,380
He's much better

235
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,400
than a complete stranger.

236
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,410
Honey,

237
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,990
let's set up a date.

238
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,930
You talk to the chef

239
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,490
and I'll talk to my sister, okay?

240
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,090
This week. What do you think?

241
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,550
Ha-eun said she wants cake.

242
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,030
Let's go get it.

243
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,240
What in the world am I doing?

244
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,670
I thought we'd go on a date,

245
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,610
but you only think about Ha-eun.

246
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,420
Let's go home.

247
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,920
Good work today, bye.

248
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,980
Goodbye.

249
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,150
Goodbye.

250
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,510
See you tomorrow.

251
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,700
(Aunt)

252
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,100
I'll wait for you at Anemona.
(Aunt)

253
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,630
I'll wait for you at Anemona.

254
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,570
Hyun-seung.

255
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Yes?

256
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,270
Do you have dinner plans tonight?

257
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,680
No.

258
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,550
Let's go check the products after work.

259
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,620
It might take a while.
We should go eat dinner first.

260
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,390
Okay, I'll set up the products
in the meeting room.

261
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,390
Alright.

262
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,640
Goodbye.

263
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,619
You did that on purpose, right?

264
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,410
What?

265
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,530
Just before we left.

266
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,490
Should I meet him alone?

267
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,890
What do you think?

268
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,859
Should I smash him
so that he won't come near you?

269
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,070
Are you a thug? Why would you do that?

270
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,610
Stop talking nonsense and eat your food.

271
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,870
We don't have much time
to study the products.

272
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,900
Today isn't the only day.

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,920
We have tomorrow and the day after that.

274
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,330
And an excuse to be together.

275
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,020
I should thank him.

276
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,640
He gave me a reason to be with you.

277
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,430
You promised.

278
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,560
You're only helping me and that's it.

279
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,610
Why?

280
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,160
Are you worried if
I would break my promise?

281
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,500
Yes, I'm worried sick.

282
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,160
Don't worry,

283
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,610
I won't haunt you for this.

284
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,380
But there's a risk though.

285
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,290
You might just fall for me.

286
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,790
What?

287
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,940
Eat your kimchi.

288
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,940
First, the base.

289
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,980
It's totally different when you apply it

290
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,680
on your hand and your face.

291
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,250
Let's prep your skin.

292
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,410
Wait a second.

293
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,950
I'm ready now.

294
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,690
Here.

295
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,560
I need to wipe my face, right?

296
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,800
Wipe your cheeks, T-zone and U-zone.

297
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,680
Let's go straight to the base.

298
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,900
You know the effects, right?

299
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,970
Geez,

300
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,410
I did make a mistake for
applying it only on my hands,

301
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,080
but I know the theory inside out.

302
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,600
This is the Actress Cream.

303
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,610
Hand.

304
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,510
You should...

305
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,190
Trust me, I know the theory really well.

306
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,590
Dab, dab, dab like this.

307
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,060
Roll it out with your index
and middle finger.

308
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,920
Wow, the shine!

309
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,110
Don't I look glowy?

310
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,950
Our KLAR team is the best.

311
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,460
Don't roll it too wide.

312
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,010
Do lightly around the eyes
with middle fingers.

313
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,190
Be careful not to get it in your eyes.

314
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,980
Ow!

315
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,490
What's wrong?

316
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,520
I got it in my eyes.

317
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
It's in your eyes?

318
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,320
Yes.

319
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,090
I told you to be careful.

320
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,500
Here, wipe it.

321
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,230
I can't right now.

322
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,600
Why can't you? Here.

323
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,000
I can't touch my eyes.

324
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,870
Come here then.

325
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,940
Why?

326
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,620
Come here, I'll do it for you.

327
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,550
Senior Yoon?

328
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,350
Oh.

329
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,410
Done. Open your eyes.

330
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,510
Now I can see again.

331
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,210
Are you alright now?

332
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,910
Yes, I think so.

333
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,620
Let's do it again then.

334
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,730
My eyes are red.

335
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,360
How are you?

336
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,600
You've gotten so pretty.

337
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,960
Have a drink. So pretty.

338
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,810
Hey, Steve!

339
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,610
How have you been?

340
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,580
I've been well.

341
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,640
How's your English?

342
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,700
I've improved.

343
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,610
Let's drink it up.

344
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,580
Cheers!

345
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,920
Bottoms up!

346
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,800
(What I want is to end
our relationship here and now.)

347
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,360
How dare you drink alone!

348
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,090
You said you weren't coming.

349
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,600
Why are you here by yourself?

350
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,910
What's the matter?

351
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,880
Nothing.

352
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,120
I just felt like drinking.

353
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,130
I understand.

354
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,690
I've been stressing you out lately

355
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,890
with sales and E-Project, right?

356
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,470
There's no one I can trust but you.

357
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,400
This is the hotshot, Lee Jae-shin, right?

358
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,170
Jae-woon's right-hand man.

359
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,090
Of course, he's a hotshot.

360
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,610
Our company is doing so well
all thanks to him.

361
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,430
Really?

362
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,250
We're thinking of
jumping into cosmetics too.

363
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,850
Lend Lee Jae-shin to me for a while.

364
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,860
I'll return him after I use him well.

365
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,520
Hey, how much is he paying you?

366
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,880
Doesn't matter, I can give you
that much too.

367
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,830
Is your annual salary 100 or 150 million?

368
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,220
Hey, are you drunk?

369
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,870
If you are, go play somewhere else.

370
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm not drunk.

371
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,280
So how much?

372
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,740
Never mind, I'll just
give you 300 million.

373
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,180
Only if you do as much work
as you did for him.

374
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,880
That's it?

375
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,680
That's puny.

376
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,290
He's got some nerve!

377
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,650
But

378
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,720
I won't go no matter how much you pay me.

379
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,660
I'm picky with people.

380
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,680
I'm calling it a night.

381
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,540
You little numbskull.

382
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,810
Do you think nobody knows

383
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,140
how you're leeching off of Jae-woon?

384
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,850
You'd never mix in here without him.

385
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,680
Know your place.

386
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,310
Why? Am I wrong?

387
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,330
Correct me if I am.

388
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,230
Are you deaf? Speak up!

389
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,200
It's you who should know your place.

390
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,980
What if your family finds out that

391
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,360
their heir gambled off a secret fund?

392
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,710
What will happen?

393
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,080
I think your brother
would love to hear that.

394
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,350
Should I go meet him?

395
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,100
Why flinch?

396
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,930
Pathetic.

397
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,210
Lee Jae-shin!

398
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,350
Good job.

399
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,420
That was awesome.

400
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,040
Why did you come out?

401
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,380
I was getting bored anyway.

402
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,990
It was like seeing the old Jae-shin.
I loved it.

403
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,590
That was so you.

404
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,130
Do you want to go
somewhere else for drinks?

405
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,500
There's a cool bar over there...

406
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,380
No thanks.

407
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,770
I want to take a breather tonight.

408
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,180
Is that so? Okay then.

409
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,530
But you can't say no next time.

410
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,220
The girls there are hot.

411
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,290
Thanks for driving me home, drive safely.

412
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,860
Wait.

413
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,300
What is it?

414
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,700
I guess Lee Jae-shin isn't here.

415
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,470
Are you not going to call him BM Lee?

416
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,890
No, I'm not.

417
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,880
Age alone can't earn respect.

418
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,280
That jerk has failed to meet my standards.

419
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,250
If you find fault with me later,

420
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,510
would you talk down to me too?

421
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,450
Not necessarily.

422
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,770
Fine, do whatever you want.

423
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,520
But if you speak down
to my face, I'll kill you.

424
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Okay.

425
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,230
Song-ah.

426
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,140
Why you little...

427
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,540
Your heart fluttered, right?

428
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,980
You're right, my heart fluttered.

429
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,910
I found an opportunity
to hit you on the head,

430
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,870
so my heart's fluttering like crazy.

431
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,680
I've been waiting for this day.

432
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,750
Seriously!

433
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,570
You're not even dodging it?

434
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,990
You can hit me. It's you.

435
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,100
Here, hit me.

436
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,060
Hit me.

437
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,340
You thought I wouldn't do it, right?

438
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,040
If you go over there,
you'll find a big hospital.

439
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Give me the receipt.

440
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,940
-Concussion...
-Bye.

441
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,620
No, my head...

442
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,250
Let's just play soccer.

443
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,110
A man's sport is basketball.

444
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,850
Zero, zero...

445
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,090
Stay still.

446
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,320
Where is Lee Jae-shin?

447
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,290
Where is Lee Sae-dong's son?

448
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,160
Oh, there he is!

449
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Hey!

450
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,940
You know where your father is, right?

451
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,940
Where is that swindling crook?

452
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,760
I don't know.

453
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,440
How can you not know?

454
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,040
He said he needed to support you.

455
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,050
He begged us and took off
with our hard-earned money!

456
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,250
Do you know how hard
we worked to save up the money?

457
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,420
So why did you get conned?

458
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,320
What, you scumbag?

459
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,630
You look down on us

460
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,910
because you're a top student, is it?

461
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,200
It's messed up.

462
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
What?

463
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
Did I ask you for a scholarship?

464
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,070
Am I the one who deceived you?

465
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,710
You were the ones
who fell for his sloppy schemes.

466
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,430
Why are you taking it out on me?

467
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,340
I didn't get a penny of your money.

468
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,780
I don't have to pay you back.

469
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,000
So, don't ever touch me.

470
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,860
What is he saying?

471
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,000
What are we going to do?

472
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,050
Why did you want to see me?

473
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,240
I want you to buy me.

474
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,760
Pay off my father's debt
and send me abroad to study.

475
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,500
I don't want to be transferred.

476
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,220
Why should I?

477
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,870
You have a lot of money.

478
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,970
If I leave now,

479
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,410
I'll live in the ditches forever.

480
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,410
What's the condition?

481
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,540
I'll be your dog forever.

482
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,910
But I don't need a dog.

483
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,450
Let's be friends, it'll be fun.

484
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,140
Just follow the plan.

485
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,830
When you receive the materials,

486
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,150
send it to us immediately.

487
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,490
Thank you for the meal, Director Lee.

488
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,620
I look forward to your support.

489
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,460
Of course, so do we.

490
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,020
That way.

491
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,030
Yes.

492
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,060
Sir, should I proceed with your schedule?

493
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,930
Yes, just follow the schedule.

494
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,650
Sir?

495
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,480
Yes?

496
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,220
Sir?

497
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
What?

498
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,590
What the...

499
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,770
I'm seeing things now?

500
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,670
I'm going to get sick at this rate.

501
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,510
Should I just commit a crime?

502
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,670
What?

503
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,320
Two, then swing. Good, just like that.

504
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,080
Two, then swing!

505
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,040
She's married.

506
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,230
I should think about
my status and dignity.

507
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,730
No matter what happens,

508
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,900
I should maintain the common courtesy.

509
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,670
Wait a second,

510
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,790
she might be a divorcee

511
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,450
or a single mom.

512
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,260
Did you receive any call
from Ms. Lee Hyo-joo?

513
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,790
No, I didn't.

514
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,950
I see.

515
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,090
I'm so exhausted these days.

516
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,770
I need extra attention today.

517
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,980
Yes, ma'am.

518
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,960
(The phone has been turned off.)

519
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,670
(Please leave a voicemail.)

520
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,630
(Hello, this is Hara.)

521
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,870
(I need to talk to you
about your wedding dress)

522
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,790
(but I can't seem to reach you.)

523
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,190
(It's very important,)

524
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,540
(please call me as soon as you can.)

525
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,910
So the mascara dries out quicker?

526
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,200
Yes, it wasn't like that before.

527
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,080
Whenever we open a new tester,
it won't last long.

528
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,220
The number of customers
are still the same though.

529
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,050
I'll take it back and check on it.

530
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,690
Okay.

531
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,760
Are the other mascaras okay?

532
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,990
I think it's the same for all of them.

533
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,290
Manager.

534
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,860
Just a second.

535
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,690
You must be busy, go on ahead.

536
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,120
I'll call you as soon as possible.

537
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,130
Okay.

538
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,310
Are you looking for
something in particular?

539
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,910
I wonder which one is better?

540
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,350
They're both pinky shades,

541
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,780
but the upper one has more beige

542
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,390
while the bottom one has coral in it.

543
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,010
I work for this brand.

544
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,760
Is that so?

545
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,930
I'll take the upper one then.

546
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay.

547
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,730
Did I make you uncomfortable?

548
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
No.

549
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,719
It's not over yet.

550
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,699
Our relationship won't end that easily.

551
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:49,050
She turned her head for a second

552
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,540
because I upset her.

553
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,960
You're being used, Hyun-seung.

554
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,520
I heard that you two dated for two years,

555
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,890
and yet you know her less than I do.

556
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,420
When she says no, she really means it.

557
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,890
You lost your chance to get her back.

558
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,840
We will reconcile.

559
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,240
As you said, we dated for two years.

560
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,840
If you have an ounce of sincerity,

561
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,030
you should stop now

562
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,970
before it gets too ugly.

563
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,730
What gives you the audacity to be so rude?

564
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,070
I want to protect her.

565
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,420
No one has my back.

566
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,470
I just want to protect her,

567
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,230
and I will.

568
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,420
You're back.

569
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,870
What happened?

570
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,230
Nothing.

571
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,810
Really?

572
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,070
Nothing happened?

573
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,760
You went to the store, right?

574
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,680
Yes.

575
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,800
Why?

576
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,090
What happened?

577
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,180
I met the woman.

578
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,480
Did you,

579
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,480
by any chance, hit her?

580
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,730
She wished.

581
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,480
I pulled her hair out.

582
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,530
All of it?

583
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,300
Are you actually believing this?

584
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,510
Of course, since you said it.

585
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,520
She's quite pretty,

586
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,080
but not as pretty as me though.

587
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,280
She managed to be less pretty?

588
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,370
You little...

589
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,980
Why? What's wrong?

590
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,470
Actually, Lee Jae-shin...

591
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,030
He knocked me into a wall

592
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,670
and threw coffee at me.

593
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,670
Liar.

594
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,020
It's true.

595
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,440
Really? He really did that?

596
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,240
Do you need to go to the hospital?

597
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,940
No, not the hospital.

598
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,300
What then?

599
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,900
I need you to keep me close to your side.

600
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,820
Anywhere, everywhere.

601
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,390
Seriously!

602
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,420
Hey!

603
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,670
My throat...

604
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,340
Seriously.

605
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,420
This is so good.
The meat melts away like honey.

606
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,160
Manager Ahn,

607
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,590
why are you so excited?

608
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,660
Are you that happy as BM Lee isn't here?

609
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,620
A little, I'm a little happy.

610
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,690
Even though he's great,
he's still our boss.

611
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,800
Why isn't BM Lee coming?

612
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,620
He just told me to go without him.

613
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,660
He didn't say why.

614
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,930
He doesn't look so well these days.

615
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,530
I guess he didn't want to dampen the mood.

616
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,140
Right, Hyun-seung!

617
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,040
Yes?

618
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,170
You're not seeing anyone, right?

619
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,070
Why are you asking me that?

620
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,480
I want to introduce you to someone.

621
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,680
She's an elementary school teacher.

622
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,870
You guys will go so well together.

623
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,790
What do you think?

624
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,890
Oh, I don't really want to.

625
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,610
Why? You two will be a perfect match.

626
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,150
She's really great.

627
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,600
It's okay, I'm good.

628
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,360
Go out for dinner with her then.

629
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,870
How about tomorrow?

630
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,480
I'll tell her to come to our office.

631
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,740
I'll text her now.

632
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,330
No! Don't!

633
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,810
What? Why are you stopping me?

634
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,910
Stop it, don't do this again.

635
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,680
This is another type
of workplace harassment.

636
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,650
Harassment?

637
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,250
Alright, just forget it!

638
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,690
Hyun-seung, we'll talk later.

639
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,960
She will change your mind...

640
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,440
I said don't! He has one!

641
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,430
What? What does he have?

642
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,230
What do you think?

643
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,800
He has one, so don't...

644
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,770
What on earth does he have?

645
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,820
A girlfriend?

646
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,810
Girlfriend?

647
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,810
Context-wise, that's the answer.

648
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,650
Do you really have a girlfriend?

649
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,290
What?

650
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,490
Since when?

651
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,040
No...

652
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,720
Tell us quickly. Do you have one or not?

653
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,260
You do, don't you?

654
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,290
-You do, right?
-Have another drink.

655
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,230
-Tell us quickly.
-He has one for sure.

656
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,530
-Do you really have a girlfriend?
-Tell us quickly. You do, right?

657
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,210
One-sided love!

658
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,740
Yes, it's just one-sided love.

659
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,740
One-sided love?

660
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
Out of the blue?

661
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,850
Who is it then? Is it someone we know?

662
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,520
She must be from the office
because Manager Yoo knows too.

663
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,120
Someone from the office?

664
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,330
Who is it?

665
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,740
Who is it, Manager Yoo?

666
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,640
I don't know!

667
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,830
Who is it?

668
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,830
Huh?

669
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,630
Who is it?

670
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,330
Hyun-seung, who is it?

671
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,370
Who is it? Huh? Who?

672
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Who is it?

673
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,580
You like someone?

674
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,400
Hyun-seung, you can't go home
until you tell us!

675
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,080
-You can't leave.
-No way.

676
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,700
Ma'am, can I get a crate of beer?

677
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,820
One crate of soju, please.

678
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,960
Don't touch it.

679
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,490
I'll mix it up for you.

680
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,380
No, it's too much.

681
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,000
Never mind!

682
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,500
Okay, I'll tell you.

683
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,270
Tell us.

684
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,040
Tell us.

685
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,590
Tell us.

686
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,550
It's Manager Yoo!

687
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,380
I knew it!

688
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,290
I'm going home.

689
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,210
She's belching.

690
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,260
I guess he likes belching women.

691
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,440
Use this.

692
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,270
I can't believe it.

693
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,320
Some more tissue, please!

694
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,200
Where's the bathroom?

695
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,410
The meat's getting burnt. Eat more.

696
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,470
There's more.

697
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,460
They're so persistent.
We almost got caught.

698
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,550
It was really tough.

699
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,360
Right, what if they really find out?

700
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,830
Still, how could you turn against me?

701
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,300
You'd only save yourself, huh?

702
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,400
Of course, we can't die together.

703
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,940
That's despicable.

704
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,270
If you and I ever fall into the water...

705
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,590
Then what?

706
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,850
I'll save you, no matter what happens.

707
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,770
I should protect my senior.

708
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,670
Anyway, what should we tell Manager Yoo?

709
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,890
I think she suspects us.

710
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,350
Tell her what? Just leave it.

711
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,350
What do you mean?

712
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,060
Even though it's fake,

713
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,820
office romance must be done in secret.

714
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,690
It's not good to go official.

715
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,010
Play innocent, okay?

716
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,600
Okay.

717
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,990
You are taking a cab, right?

718
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,990
(BM Lee Jae-shin)

719
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,840
(Director Lee wants warehouse inventory.)

720
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,870
(Tell Chae Hyun-seung
to do it, thank you.)

721
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,110
It's a bit different, so compare them...

722
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,580
Hyun-seung.

723
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,470
Yes, sir.

724
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,200
Do you have an urgent business?

725
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,420
I'm going to an event hall
with Senior Yoon later.

726
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,960
Oh, the event hall.

727
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,090
Why? Is there something you want us to do?

728
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,040
Director Lee asked for something urgent.

729
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,550
Can you go to
the event hall alone, Song-ah?

730
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,940
It's okay, I can go alone.

731
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,040
Hyun-seung, go to the warehouse
and take inventory.

732
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,780
Yes, sir.

733
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,660
All the samples too.

734
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,190
Including the samples? Okay.

735
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:27,970
Thanks.

736
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,810
Sure.

737
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,380
This is Petit La Bene,
the main hall on the second floor.

738
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:58,100
Various company banquets were held here.

739
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,250
It's smaller than the one on first floor,
but the view is better.

740
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,910
We adopted European style
for the decoration.

741
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,250
We hung a chandelier
to give it a luxurious vibe.

742
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,660
Can we call for another catering company?

743
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,540
Our banquet hall
is connected to the square,

744
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,370
and so the lighting is very good.

745
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,000
That's why customers prefer this place.

746
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,060
People usually favor warm light.

747
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,740
If it's necessary, we can
hang curtains to cover it up.

748
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,670
The size is perfect here.

749
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,970
Can I look around on my own?

750
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,380
Yes, of course.

751
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,410
Thank you.

752
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,320
I'm back.

753
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,030
You're done?

754
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,660
Yes, I'll send you the file.

755
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:12,420
Good job.

756
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,530
Thank you.

757
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,100
Sit on a chair, you'll bend the table.

758
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,170
Where is BM Lee?

759
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,330
He said he went to check on a store.

760
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,420
Okay.

761
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,790
Oh, sir!

762
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,330
What should I do
with the warehouse inventory?

763
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,090
What inventory?

764
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,630
BM Lee said you wanted it
reported by today.

765
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,250
Me?

766
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:36,810
Yes.

767
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,340
It wasn't me.

768
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,340
Just send it to BM Lee.

769
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,240
Okay, goodbye.

770
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,080
Did I make a mistake?

771
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,950
No, I was right!

772
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,960
He told me to take inventory.

773
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,810
Are you done here?

774
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:23,750
Yes.

775
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,510
Let's go, I'll drive you.

776
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,740
What is this about?

777
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,400
You're mixing in personal life
with work again.

778
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,490
I have nothing to say.

779
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,770
You should at least explain to me

780
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,310
so that I can understand.

781
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,950
Do I not even deserve that?

782
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,470
I've already chosen someone else.

783
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,830
The reason doesn't matter anymore.

784
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,290
What if I say I don't care?

785
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,290
As long as you come back to me,

786
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,950
I won't care about that.

787
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,890
I'll pretend you didn't say that.

788
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,760
Let's get married.

789
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,170
Let's get married.

790
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,220
(Senior Yoon Song-ah)

791
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,630
Get married?

792
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,760
When you said you wanted to go public,

793
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,150
didn't you think about marriage too?

794
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,160
Let's do it.

795
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,040
I'll do everything you want

796
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,880
as long as you come back to me.

797
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,980
So I'd be the one walking down the aisle

798
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,370
at the wedding ceremony one month later?

799
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,940
What do you mean?

800
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,190
You know it better than anyone.

801
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,510
Tell me.

802
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,910
Will I be the bride at that wedding?

803
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,450
So that's the reason.

804
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,000
When did you know about that?

805
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,620
Scratch that.

806
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,550
You should've asked me first.

807
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,440
You should've checked with me

808
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,650
instead of doing this.

809
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,390
What would you have said?

810
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,760
What lies would you tell me again?

811
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,880
I've been sincere to you
in every single moment.

812
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,680
If not, I would've told you easily.

813
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,440
Why can't you think that way?

814
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,230
Stop making ridiculous excuses.

815
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,940
You got the reason,
so don't ever show up like this.

816
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,220
Song-ah.

817
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,560
What are you going to do?

818
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,520
Are you going to call off the wedding?

819
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,440
You should've called it off.

820
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,530
If you really have an ounce of sincerity,

821
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,760
you should've called it off

822
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,000
while I was still smiling in front of you

823
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,230
out of ignorance.

824
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,570
You have no regard for me.

825
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,370
How ridiculous was I?

826
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,420
Is this your sincerity? Really?

827
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,720
You piece of trash.

828
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,170
Still, we shouldn't end it this way.

829
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,800
You haven't heard me out yet!

830
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,370
Let go!

831
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,330
Song-ah, please!

832
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,950
-Please listen to what I have to say.
-Let go!

833
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,150
-Song-ah, please.
-Stop it!

834
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,120
Song-ah.

835
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,490
Senior Yoon!

836
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:11,040
Song-ah, listen to me. Let's talk.

837
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,850
-Stop.
-Listen to what I have to say.

838
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:13,990
That's enough.

839
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,770
Song-ah, listen to me...

840
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:31,510
Stop it!

841
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,640
Stop.

842
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,830
I said stop!

843
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,170
Stop it now.

844
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,230
Let's go.

845
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:07,100
Drink this, you'll feel better.

846
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,430
What about you?

847
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,640
Are you okay?

848
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,340
Go to the hospital.

849
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,750
Don't worry about me.

850
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,460
If it wasn't for you,

851
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,220
I wonder what would've happened?

852
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,710
If you didn't tell me about it,

853
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,520
perhaps

854
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,510
I wouldn't have been able to break it off

855
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,000
even if he tells me the truth.

856
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,220
If he were to say that
he was forced to do it,

857
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,840
I would've accepted it.

858
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,400
If he tells me to stay by his side,

859
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,790
I would've stayed

860
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,480
even though I know it's wrong.

861
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,630
Thank you.

862
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,120
Thanks for everything.

863
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,440
I'm not even embarrassed
in front of you anymore.

864
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,300
I'll forget it.

865
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,300
So you should forget it too.

866
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,940
Okay, good.

867
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,920
Beautiful.

868
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,210
Can you move closer to the bride, sir?

869
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,130
Good.

870
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,760
Wider smile, please.

871
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,340
Yes, very good.

872
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,460
Look at each other.

873
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,200
Smile.

874
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,410
Yes, give us a wider smile.

875
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:14,090
Yes.

876
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:16,570
Okay.

877
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,030
Okay, good.

878
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,190
Okay, great.

879
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,250
Can you move closer to the bride, sir?

880
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,460
Okay. Sir, can you look at the bride?

881
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,580
Look at each other with love.

882
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,760
Good, okay.

883
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,840
Put your hand on the bride's shoulder.

884
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,680
The groom is stiffening up again.

885
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,190
Look at each other one more time.

886
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,130
Okay, good.

887
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,030
It looks new.

888
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,530
Why did she throw it away?

889
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,710
That sucker.

890
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,190
Hey! Yoon Song-ah!

891
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,910
What are you doing?

892
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,090
I'm tired, I don't want to go out.

893
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,890
I think I'm going to go overboard.

894
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:13,790
The customer yesterday
was unbelievably rude.

895
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,440
I'm going to die from stress.

896
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,030
So, don't say anything
and do as I tell you.

897
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,530
What are you going to do?

898
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,290
Just wear this!

899
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:25,830
Why?

900
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,190
Cheers!

901
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,690
Cheers!

902
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:45,160
Why? Are you waiting to hear from someone?

903
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,780
No, it's nothing.

904
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,620
It doesn't seem like nothing.

905
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,220
Who is it? Is it someone special?

906
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,900
Mind your own business.

907
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,220
Fair enough,

908
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,020
I'm the one in trouble.

909
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:01,850
Give me some ideas
for the new launch promotion.

910
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:03,270
Manager Jung said he'll kill me

911
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,820
if I don't bring anything.

912
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,800
By the way,

913
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,220
you two were in
the same marketing club in college.

914
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,820
You must have a lot of ideas.

915
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,890
Company is different from college.

916
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,080
There's nothing you can use.

917
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,450
Still, there could be something.

918
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,190
Just throw it, I'll filter the ideas.

919
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,180
My suggestion is to think practical.

920
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,510
You can consult other industries too.

921
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,780
Industries?

922
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:29,960
That's easy to say...

923
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,090
This won't do.

924
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,610
It won't do, right?

925
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,920
I'll go outside for a while.

926
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,920
Huh?

927
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,860
You're not abandoning me, are you?

928
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:39,670
You can't leave me!

929
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,960
I'll be really upset!

930
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,660
Hello?

931
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:55,470
Senior Yoon.

932
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,220
Hi. What's up?

933
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,490
I'm just wondering
how your weekend's going?

934
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,260
It's going well.

935
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,650
That's good.

936
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,710
What did you do today?

937
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,270
Did you stay at home all day?

938
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,160
Don't you need to cheer up?

939
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,350
I'm outside right now.

940
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,850
Don't worry. Have a good weekend.

941
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,060
Bye.

942
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,800
Who was it?

943
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,440
No one.

944
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,450
Let's go inside.

945
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,070
Hey,

946
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,550
do we really have to go in there?

947
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,090
Let's just go to a bar and drink.

948
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,730
Hey! If we're only going to drink,

949
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,150
we'd be at home now.

950
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,470
Everything is on me tonight.

951
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,560
Don't say anything and do as I tell you.

952
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,110
You should relieve some stress too.

953
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,500
Does it have to be this place?

954
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,930
Let's go!

955
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:47,890
Huh?

956
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,440
Senior Yoon?

957
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,080
Hey, Ga-young.

958
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,490
Hey!

959
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,440
Yes, good. Okay.

960
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,170
Last three shots!

961
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,360
Okay, last one. Smile!

962
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:17,870
Thank you, good work.

963
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:21,550
Well done!

964
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,270
Well done!

965
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,760
See you after we get changed.

966
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,520
Okay.

967
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,760
I'll remove the makeup for you.

968
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,960
It's okay, I'll do it myself.

969
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,240
Alright then.

970
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,280
(I want to be confident about it.)

971
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:58,300
I don't want to be hidden all the time.

972
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,750
(For the next 10
or 20 years in your life,)

973
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,810
did you ever consider me as a part of it?

974
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:35,760
(If you have an ounce of sincerity,)

975
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,320
you should've called it off

976
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,520
while I was still smiling to you

977
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,030
out of ignorance.
