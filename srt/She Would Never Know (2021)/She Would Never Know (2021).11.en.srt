00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,280
(Episode 11)

3
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,889
Go in and get some sleep, Senior Yoon.

4
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,940
What about you?

5
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,050
I'm going to sleep in the car.

6
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,940
In the car?

7
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,750
Yes.

8
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,320
It's a bit small and uncomfortable,

9
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,950
but it's better for you
to get a good night's sleep.

10
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,750
But you know,

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,380
it's very cold today.

12
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,360
The weather app said it's -20°C,

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,320
but I feel like it's -40°C.

14
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,550
This is how you
freeze to death in your sleep.

15
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,450
It starts with the mouth.

16
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,670
Then...

17
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,630
Why don't you sleep in the tent?

18
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,150
Really?

19
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll sleep in the car.

20
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,450
Oh, that's not...

21
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,690
Then...

22
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,960
How about we sleep in here together?

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,840
Sure.

24
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,180
Are you cold?

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,230
Yes.

26
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,300
You don't have to
address me professionally.

27
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,790
You can just call me by my name.

28
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,840
How should I call you then?

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,450
Song-ah. Like that?

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,850
Then address me comfortably too.

31
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,680
Hyun-seung.

32
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,079
How about I just call you Mr. Hyun-seung?

33
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,590
And I call you Ms. Song-ah?

34
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,350
That would be awkward.

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,110
Let's just do whatever feels natural.

36
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,030
This is how I sleep.

37
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,540
This is how I sleep.

38
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,840
I feel like I'm dreaming every day.

39
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,520
(Senior Yoon Song-ah)
(Good morning.)

40
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,310
(Senior Yoon Song-ah)

41
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,380
(I get to start my day with you.)

42
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,990
(I get to express my feelings for you.)

43
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,490
(I'm getting sleepy.)

44
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,930
Good night.

45
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,750
(Okay.)

46
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,250
(See you tomorrow.)

47
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,350
Okay.

48
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,510
(I can look forward to starting
a new day with you.)

49
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,170
(I feel like I'm dreaming.)

50
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you know what I've been thinking?

51
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,130
That I'm lucky.

52
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,920
You're the one who knows
what I've been through.

53
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,110
When I finally realized how I felt,

54
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,560
you were still there waiting for me.

55
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,780
And the one who likes me this much

56
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,670
isn't just anyone.

57
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,060
He's the man looking at me right now.

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,160
So I feel lucky and thankful
for each moment.

59
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm happy that I'm with you.

60
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,430
Can I use your arm as my pillow?

61
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Good night.

62
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Good night.

63
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,380
(Wait. I'll change into
mourning clothes too.)

64
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,770
He's not worth your trouble.

65
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,560
You've taken a look at him, go home.

66
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,700
Go home. I'm going to get some rest.

67
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,400
That jerk.

68
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,760
Are you not going to dance, Hyo-joo?

69
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,360
Why are you drinking so much?

70
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,050
Is she upset about
her wedding getting postponed?

71
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,400
Are you leaving?

72
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,550
(Identification Card)

73
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,050
(Lee Se-dong)

74
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,179
(Hyo-joo)

75
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,720
(The receiver is unable to take the call.)

76
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,740
(Please leave a message…)

77
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,110
(Chanmi's Diner)

78
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm sorry I can't stay till the evening.

79
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,350
Go eat something good.

80
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,980
You want me to pick you up
tomorrow morning?

81
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,420
How about a short early morning date?

82
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,110
I'll come to you.

83
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,050
I want to see you earlier too.

84
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,980
Get going now.

85
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,910
I don't want to go now.

86
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,840
I don't want to go.

87
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,070
I can't go now.

88
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,730
Stop it and go.

89
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,380
Design.

90
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,610
This one.

91
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,430
Start with the thumb.

92
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,580
Ooh, that's pretty.

93
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
You're home.

94
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,080
Yes.

95
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,400
You didn't go to work?

96
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,420
I will go soon.

97
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,350
What about you?

98
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,180
-Did you enjoy it?
-Huh?

99
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,260
I mean, did you enjoy the scenery?

100
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,270
Oh.

101
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Why?

102
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,390
You didn't get the chance to look around?

103
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,690
You know what?

104
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,680
The scenery was the last thing on my mind.

105
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,570
Hey, girl!

106
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,310
And you almost didn't give him a chance.

107
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,890
Well, I'm thankful I did.

108
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,480
Oh, by the way,

109
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,670
I'll be at the main shop
starting next week.

110
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,280
So suddenly? Why?

111
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,020
Because I'm the manager of that shop now.

112
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,390
I got promoted.

113
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,390
Really?

114
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,750
That's great! Congratulations!

115
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,750
Oh, my. I have to get to work.

116
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,870
I'm late.

117
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,190
Let's talk after I get back.

118
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,180
Yes, I just got here.

119
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,640
I'll go up and grab a table.

120
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,330
Long time no see.

121
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,630
How have you been?

122
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,750
You're back in Korea?

123
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,430
I have something to take care of.

124
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,720
What brings you here?

125
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm meeting my siblings for lunch.

126
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,080
Ji-seung!

127
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,350
I should get going.

128
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,820
Enjoy your lunch.

129
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,960
(You ran into I-joon?)

130
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,420
Are you okay?

131
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,240
What's not to be okay about?

132
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,010
Years since he became her ex-fiance.

133
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,220
I was just a bit taken aback.

134
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,100
I hadn't seen him since then.

135
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,130
He looked the same
as he did a few years ago.

136
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,510
The life as a professor in the States
must be smooth.

137
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,950
Well, she's become more beautiful too.

138
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,480
Man.

139
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,540
What about me?

140
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,950
You're beautiful too.

141
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,810
Is he married?

142
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,530
I didn't ask.

143
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,910
I'm sure he is.

144
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,670
He's capable and nice.

145
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,540
It'd be weird if he isn't.

146
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,580
It'd be nice to have a husband
or boyfriend to show off.

147
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,570
You should've said
you were seeing your husband.

148
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,420
Nay.

149
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,530
-Hey.
-Why?

150
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,560
-Hey.
-Why?

151
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,270
Why would you make her lie like that?

152
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,090
It's better than being mortified.

153
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,550
I'm dating someone.

154
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,910
Yes, that's what you should've told him.

155
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,670
What was that?

156
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,690
What?

157
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,560
What?

158
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,560
Are you really seeing someone?

159
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,520
Really?

160
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,770
You're dating someone?

161
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
-Yes.
-Gosh!

162
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,820
-Who is it?
-Since when?

163
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,360
-How old is he?
-What does he do?

164
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,240
I'll tell you all about it later, okay?

165
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,390
-When?
-Hmm?

166
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,630
-Come on.
-Stop it.

167
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,030
-Come on.
-Attagirl.

168
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,120
You go, girl.

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,010
Senior Yoon.

172
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,330
Here.

173
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,900
Good morning.

174
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,660
Thank you.

175
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,490
Let's go.

176
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,550
It's the weather.
The weather is just great.

177
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,490
Are you going to be like this at work?

178
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,300
If you keep looking at me and smile,

179
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,850
everyone's going to find out about us.

180
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm not that great at
hiding my feelings, to be honest.

181
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,590
No can do.

182
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,850
I'll have to try harder
so we don't get caught.

183
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,650
Leave it to me.

184
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,560
Senior Yoon, this is yours.

185
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,920
-Thanks.
-You...

186
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,550
It's yours.

187
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,859
Coffee?

188
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,740
Hey, Hyun-seung.

189
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,220
Are you guys here for some coffee?

190
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,980
Yes.

191
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,720
I don't think I want any.

192
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,960
Okay then. Please excuse me.

193
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,250
Enjoy your coffee.

194
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,720
Are they pretending
not to be in a relationship?

195
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,680
Seems like it.

196
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,630
They're trying too hard.

197
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,880
Let's pretend like we don't know anything.

198
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,140
You want some coffee?

199
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,550
I don't want any.

200
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,100
Have some coffee.

201
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,590
I have a favor to ask you.

202
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,370
Can you spare me a few minutes?

203
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,160
It's about the Renew Stick.

204
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,260
I was wondering which
foundation we can put in it.

205
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,720
What? Were you expecting something else?

206
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,130
What do you mean?

207
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,920
What are you talking about?

208
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,350
What would I expect?

209
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,940
Right, what would you expect though?

210
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,120
Hold on.

211
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,120
Were you expecting
a secret date or something?

212
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,150
Seriously.

213
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,440
So what?

214
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
You don't know which foundation to choose?

215
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,180
Did you talk with the lab?

216
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,610
They said any foundation will do.

217
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,850
But since it has to be applied
with a cotton swab,

218
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,080
I think a matte one
would be too irritating.

219
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,190
We should go with moist or semi-matte.

220
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,400
Let's test it first.
There's nothing better than that.

221
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,930
This is yours.

222
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,070
What do you think? Does it go on smoothly?

223
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,690
Yes. But...

224
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,090
Did I dab too much?

225
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,750
It feels a bit thick.

226
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,400
Here.

227
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,460
This is really convenient.

228
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,670
It removes makeup so easily.

229
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,050
I wish I could create
a successful product like this.

230
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,960
Your Renew Stick will do great.

231
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,150
You can do it.

232
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,480
Okay.

233
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,140
Can the lab take care
of the sealing issue?

234
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,810
This is different from oil products.

235
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,880
Product Planning will take care of that,

236
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,280
but I think it's doable.

237
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, Senior Yoon.

238
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,930
Let's go on a date after I wrap this up.

239
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,990
Hyun-seung.

240
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,840
Yes, sir.

241
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,320
I just heard it from Product Planning.

242
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,170
Seolyoon's preparing the Renew Stick too.

243
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,530
Why is Seolyoon doing it?

244
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,290
You didn't know, right? Just as I thought.

245
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,480
I can't believe those people.

246
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,640
Sir.

247
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,720
What is it?

248
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,320
Well...

249
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,310
Daejeon isn't meeting its quota again.

250
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,560
What's their sales department doing?

251
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,780
Are you releasing the Renew Stick?

252
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,110
Why do you ask?

253
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,980
Our team is planning on a solo release,

254
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,760
but I heard Seolyoon
is preparing that too.

255
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,610
We're different brands anyway.

256
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,570
What's the problem?

257
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,660
This is a multi-brand company.

258
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,200
When the lab develops something,

259
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,970
all the brands release their own version.

260
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,350
But this product is my idea,
not the lab's idea.

261
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,190
You're scheduled to release
next month as we are.

262
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,380
If you could, please postpone the release.

263
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,250
We're going to follow
our brand's timetable.

264
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,730
Chae Hyun-seung,

265
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,760
you're just an ABM.

266
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,750
You think you can order us around?

267
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,670
I know you're impudent,
but this is going too far.

268
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,100
Do I need to teach you a thing or two?

269
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,920
-What's going on?
-Sir.

270
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,630
It's about the Renew Stick.

271
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,840
He told me not to release it.

272
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,720
I was only asking
if you could adjust your timeline.

273
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,650
Look here, Chae Hyun-seung.

274
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,630
Don't tell me you're this naive.

275
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,450
You can't tell us what to do.

276
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,420
Is this a college group assignment?

277
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,150
You said you know when to butt in and out.

278
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,840
But you don't know when to shut up.

279
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,840
Stop wasting time,
and go get the shipment records.

280
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Yes, sir.

281
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll print that thing.

282
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,960
So we're asking you to meditate.

283
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,760
We can't come to a resolution on our own.

284
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,750
Hmm.

285
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,460
Does Seolyoon have to release it?

286
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,850
We haven't made a final decision.

287
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,670
We were just looking into some options

288
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,720
to meet our sales goal.

289
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,730
We did consider that it might affect KLAR,

290
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,720
but we are different brands anyway.

291
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,480
So I think it will be okay.

292
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,330
But it's not like
it won't negatively affect us.

293
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,620
This idea is a contest winner.

294
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,290
You could've discussed it
with the developer.

295
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,190
I would've done that
if we decided to release it.

296
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,650
But we're still reviewing that option.

297
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,790
Why are you making me the villain?

298
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,560
You're breaking my heart, Manager Kwon.

299
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,480
When's the release date again?

300
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,580
We're thinking of mid-December.

301
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,190
If we have a new release in December,

302
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,850
we can avoid negative growth this year.

303
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,820
ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

304
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,510
Yes, sir.

305
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,810
Is there no way
to release it with Seolyoon?

306
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,960
I know you want it to be
KLAR release only.

307
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,030
But BM Seo is right.

308
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,620
You're two different brands.

309
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,950
It's not like the Renew Stick
has a solid brand identity.

310
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,990
It can be released by more than one brand.

311
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,880
We'll release it together.

312
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:09,190
Keep me posted on the development process.

313
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,680
Later.

314
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,810
I want to give him some punches.

315
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,610
Sir.

316
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,640
BM Seo is unbelievable.

317
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,910
He really is deplorable.

318
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,560
Do you have to be like that to be a BM?

319
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,260
He only thinks about sales.

320
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,570
He lacks integrity
and business principles.

321
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,890
Someone like me can never be a BM.

322
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,770
Yoo-sun, don't worry.

323
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,070
With your temper,
you'll be the perfect BM.

324
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,420
You should go get a temper.

325
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,320
You could've protested
in front of the director,

326
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,080
or grab BM Seo by the collar.

327
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,010
I might get fired for that.

328
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,890
Will you keep food
on the table for my family?

329
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,580
If you say yes,
I'll go to BM Seo right now,

330
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,530
grab him by the collar
and punch him in the face.

331
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,360
Manager Kwon did more than enough for me.

332
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,130
I'm really okay.

333
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,160
Don't worry about me.

334
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,720
No way.

335
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,470
It's your first product.

336
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,510
You must feel as if your baby got stolen.

337
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,220
You won't be able to do it,

338
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,180
so we'll curse for you.

339
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,600
That fricking jerk!

340
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,460
She's right.
Get upset as much as you want.

341
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,850
And then put it all behind tomorrow.

342
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,630
You'll experience all sorts of
injustice at work.

343
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,280
He'll surely get his karma back.

344
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,900
Just shake it off.

345
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,990
What? I say nice words occasionally.

346
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,260
Do you want a drink?

347
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Oh, yes.

348
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,230
Awesome.

349
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,010
Why are you so warm-hearted suddenly?

350
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,690
I'm getting burned here.

351
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,690
Thank you.

352
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,710
If only we had our BM with us.

353
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,730
I mean the director. I wish he were here.

354
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,660
BM Seo wouldn't have
dreamed of pulling this.

355
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,350
There's no way he'd be able to.

356
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,020
The director is taking a very long break.

357
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,970
He's probably not returning anytime soon.

358
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,450
He barely used his leave days
because of work.

359
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,400
Anyway! Let's drink, Hyun-seung.

360
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,430
Cheers.

361
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,070
Thank you.

362
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,450
Excuse me. Passing through.

363
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,590
Thank you.

364
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,670
Excuse me. Passing through.

365
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,930
Excuse me. Passing through.

366
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,040
Hey, it's you.

367
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,040
Get up. I'll take you home.

368
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,840
This is the only way
to make you look at me.

369
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,430
Let's go.

370
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,280
Where to, sir?

371
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,580
To Director Lee Jae-woon's place, please.

372
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,990
Go to your place.

373
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,040
That's where I live now.

374
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,650
Right here.

375
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,880
Here.

376
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,530
Hyo-joo. Hey.

377
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,450
Darn it.

378
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,390
Why did she drink so much?

379
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,960
Was she with you?

380
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,450
I think she was with her friends.

381
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,090
Good lord.

382
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,760
Come on.

383
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,450
I'll go now.

384
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,670
Okay.

385
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,610
Why do you look so scrawny? Are you okay?

386
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,590
What's not to be okay about?

387
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,680
Knock it off.

388
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
Let me know if you need anything.

389
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,040
And also,

390
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
I know things are hard.

391
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,650
But don't leave Hyo-joo alone too much.

392
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:24,960
Goodbye.

393
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,270
Do you want me to scratch BM Seo's car?

394
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,420
Really?

395
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,460
Shall I?

396
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,710
Yes.

397
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,860
Really?

398
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,230
Give me a hug, please.

399
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Right now?

400
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,360
Okay. Come here.

401
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,520
I know you're very upset.

402
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,880
But don't be too broken up about it.

403
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,920
It means you thought of
a fantastic product.

404
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,510
Shake it all off,

405
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,100
and just have fun making it.

406
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,400
It gets really hectic,

407
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,800
but you'll have so much fun
once the product is out.

408
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,570
Let's just focus on the fun part.

409
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,920
Okay?

410
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,050
It's frustrating though.

411
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,730
I wish I could get back at him for this.

412
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,090
Don't go scratching his car.

413
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,060
Maybe I should puncture his tires too.

414
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,810
It's nothing.

415
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,930
What is it?

416
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,160
Well,

417
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,370
a thought crosses my mind.

418
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,520
What if the Renew Stick is a promotion,

419
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,770
and not a new release?

420
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,030
But it might be a waste of a good product.

421
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,560
I like it.

422
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,240
Really? You'd be okay with that?

423
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,880
Yes. I think it's a great idea.

424
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,420
Why didn't I ever think of that?

425
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,980
Impressive, Senior Yoon. You're the best!

426
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,910
I'm not your senior for nothing.

427
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,220
Hey now.

428
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,180
You're not my senior right now.

429
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,720
-You're my girlfriend.
-Hey!

430
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,500
Be careful.

431
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,770
-Are you scared?
-Yes, put me down!

432
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,290
Okay. I'll put you down but I need a kiss.

433
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,460
One more.

434
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,430
-Come on.
-Two kisses.

435
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,160
-Okay, then. Careful.
-Put me down now.

436
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,260
Stop.

437
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,220
Stop it.

438
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,960
You want me to stop?

439
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,060
Renew Stick as a promotional gift?

440
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,880
Yes, this is a niche product.

441
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,820
So instead of selling it right away,

442
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,850
it'll be good to test it
by giving it away as a freebie.

443
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,040
There are many parties
and events in December,

444
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,989
so it'll catch
the customers' attention too.

445
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,540
That makes sense.

446
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,159
Color makeup customers will love it.

447
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,860
Basic skincare, too.

448
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,469
Since the skin gets dry during winter,

449
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:26,270
they can carry it everywhere to apply.

450
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,310
It's a good idea,
but are you sure about that?

451
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,679
It's your first product.

452
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,020
Are you okay with it being a freebie?

453
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,639
If the customers like it,

454
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,239
we can release it later.

455
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,850
It's better than making
premature release and getting low sales.

456
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,090
I think it's better this way.

457
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,670
Okay then.

458
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,070
I'll talk to Director Lee Jae-shin.

459
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,739
Oh, right.

460
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:48,380
Go prepare all the new material codes.

461
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,199
Yes, sir.

462
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,840
That's a smart move.

463
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,730
How did you think of this?

464
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,199
BM Seo will completely lose it.

465
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,170
This is so satisfying.

466
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,670
I told you. He'll get his karma.

467
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,680
He's getting what he deserves.

468
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,140
I'm scared of you the most, Manager Kang.

469
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,970
Shall we wrap up?

470
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,130
Then proceed like that.

471
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,610
We'll talk about it more once I'm back.

472
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,650
Yes, sir. I'll let you know
if there are any changes.

473
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,530
Okay.

474
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,600
Come on in.

475
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,260
Will you be dining alone?

476
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,810
Yes.

477
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,460
Sit anywhere you like.

478
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,170
Min-sook, can you get his order?

479
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:13,750
Okay.

480
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,940
I'll take that.

481
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,680
What would you like to order?

482
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,350
One rice soup, please.

483
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,310
One rice soup.

484
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,910
That's all you're going to eat?

485
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,120
Eat some more.

486
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,320
I just need to wipe these dry.

487
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,770
Are you about 35 years old now?

488
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,330
Yes.

489
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,950
It's been, what, 22 years?

490
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,990
I thought it might
have been you last time.

491
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,060
So I called Yoo-mi's mom.

492
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,130
She told me you contacted her.

493
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,930
It was unexpected.

494
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,670
I didn't think you'd look for me.

495
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,740
Father passed away recently.

496
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,100
It was a car accident.

497
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,220
That's a relief.

498
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,930
That man is a waste of space.

499
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,950
He should've died a long time ago.

500
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,880
Did you come here to tell me that?

501
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
I just...

502
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,930
I wondered how you're doing.

503
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,230
Not much to it.

504
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,530
I was unlucky to begin with,

505
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,280
so nothing much changed.

506
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,120
This is as good as it gets.

507
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,940
I need to know.

508
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,970
Do you have any regrets?

509
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,600
This is much better.

510
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,030
Better than when I was
living with your father.

511
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,520
You look like you're doing okay.

512
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,760
You're always smart.

513
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,840
I guess you used it to your advantage.

514
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,270
Well done.

515
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,480
Come on in.

516
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,320
What would you like to order?

517
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,560
Two rice soups, please.

518
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,550
Okay.

519
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,740
Why did you come here?

520
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,980
Do you feel better
seeing me living like this?

521
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,260
You asked if I have any regrets?

522
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,410
I don't even regret abandoning you.

523
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,790
Don't come back here.

524
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,090
Consider me dead.

525
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,390
I've never needed you anyway.

526
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,480
A promotional gift?

527
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,030
That's a low move, Chae Hyun-seung.

528
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,180
You're making our products as freebies?

529
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,380
It's a new release.

530
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,010
Of course, when I reviewed this option,

531
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,600
I thought hard about
how this might affect Seolyoon.

532
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,760
Of course it'll affect us.

533
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,220
Just release it as a new product.

534
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,030
But then I got to thinking,
and you were right.

535
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,860
We are two different brands anyway.

536
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,500
You said that it would be okay.

537
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,730
So I think it will be alright.

538
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,350
But this is a different case.

539
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,430
If you give it out as a freebie,

540
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,620
how would that make us look?

541
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,530
We're not going to just give it out.

542
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,060
It'll only be given upon purchase.

543
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,940
Ahh, wait. Hyun-seung.

544
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,410
Is there something in my eye? It stings.

545
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,960
So then...

546
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,160
How will KLAR make up for sales
with no new release?

547
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,600
Oh, we're thinking of
an additional promotion.

548
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,250
I'll get that reported to you soon.

549
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,240
Director, this isn't right.

550
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,450
We need to boost sales.

551
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,190
We need to avoid negative growth.

552
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,250
Right. We don't want that.

553
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,010
-So then...
-So then,

554
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,040
you should get to thinking very hard.

555
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,500
If you want to keep your position,

556
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,120
what does Seolyoon need to do
to avoid negative growth?

557
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,800
I'm quite a reasonable person.

558
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,440
ABM Chae is just using
the same logic as you.

559
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,720
Isn't it?

560
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,990
Yes, sir.

561
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,150
ABM Chae Hyun-seung,

562
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,690
you're tenacious.

563
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,460
I mean it in a good way.

564
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,780
Thank you, sir.

565
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,090
A marketer must make
hard decisions about his product.

566
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,390
Your idea was great,
and you showed determination.

567
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,170
I received a lot of help with my idea.

568
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,800
From ABM Yoon Song-ah.

569
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,760
She was my trainer.

570
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,620
So you learned from the best.
It definitely shows.

571
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,780
It's such a shame.

572
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,920
Keep up the good work.

573
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,480
I'll be watching you.

574
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,500
Yes, sir.

575
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,800
I'm off.

576
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,450
See you tomorrow.

577
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,500
Bye.

578
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,590
You're making training samples again?

579
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,240
Yes, I want to get it out of the way.

580
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,160
There are so many
chores with color makeup.

581
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,720
New product every month,

582
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,220
new sample every month.

583
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,540
And it's not quick work either.

584
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,710
Can you help her, Hyun-seung?

585
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,170
Oh, I have a prior engagement.

586
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,570
It's easier if I do it alone.

587
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,160
I'll be heading out now.

588
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:31,890
I'm sorry I can't help.

589
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:32,760
It's fine.

590
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,450
Alright, Song-ah. See you tomorrow.

591
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,650
See you tomorrow.

592
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,450
You didn't leave?

593
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,390
So how many do you have to make?

594
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,030
I need 500 of them.

595
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,530
I'll put them in the container.

596
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,020
You close the lid.

597
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,780
Okay, I got this.

598
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,500
Let's wear an apron first.

599
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,190
Such a baby.

600
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,630
Here.

601
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,440
Done.

602
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,130
You need to wear one too.

603
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,410
I don't think I need one.

604
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,400
Nay.

605
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,170
If it gets on your clothes,

606
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,070
you won't be able to wash it off.

607
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:53,830
Come here.

608
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,570
Ahh, I don't need it.

609
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,370
Okay. How do you want it?

610
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,630
Pretty.

611
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,490
Pretty? A butterfly then.

612
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,120
Don't I look good in an apron?

613
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,310
-It's not a bad look.
-I'm a very good cook.

614
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,710
Oh, really?

615
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,700
Do you want me to show you?

616
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,740
Is this your way of trying
to get me to come over?

617
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,480
Yes.

618
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,160
Come on.

619
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,580
Focus on work for today, former trainee.

620
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,890
Right, we're at work.

621
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:29,640
Okay. Understood.

622
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,020
But when are you going to come over?

623
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,320
Come on, tell me.

624
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,270
Korean, Chinese or Western cuisine.

625
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,920
My Japanese cuisine isn't good enough.

626
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,550
Pick from Korean, Chinese or Western.

627
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,770
What the heck!

628
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,580
Gosh!

629
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,660
You're still here.

630
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:03,350
That's hilarious!

631
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,170
Totally unexpected, Manager Kwon.

632
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,240
You've turned KLAR upside down.

633
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,010
I told you it was 500.

634
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,060
I told you 500.

635
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,730
Hurry up if you want to get home tonight.

636
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,610
How is the food, Yeon-seung?

637
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,740
It's delicious.

638
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,120
You really know a lot about food.

639
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,980
I'm glad that you like it.

640
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,870
You're not eating much.

641
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,580
Isn't this the kind of food you like?

642
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,530
I'm eating.

643
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,660
Should I order something else for you?

644
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,660
No.

645
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,480
I know this is your favorite. Eat up.

646
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,480
Okay.

647
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,180
The empty seat next to you looks huge.

648
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,900
It'd be nice if someone
were sitting there.

649
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,050
What if I set you up with someone else?

650
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,970
You know anyone around you?

651
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,850
Of course not.

652
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:04,090
If you did, that would've
happened ages ago.

653
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,390
Oh, how about Nurse Kim?
Is she dating anyone?

654
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,760
He's fine on his own.

655
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,580
This is how he is.

656
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,520
He acts all unimpressed,

657
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,940
but he actually cares about you.

658
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,780
You know that, right?

659
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,830
Of course.

660
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,480
I'm used to it.

661
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,510
Right, you've been friends since college.

662
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:26,290
I'm glad my husband has a friend like you.

663
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,300
What were you two like in college?

664
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,420
I liked him.

665
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,720
I wanted to get close to him.

666
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,380
You know.

667
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,900
Some people just draw others in.

668
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,530
Oh? That's how he was?

669
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,000
Still, it wouldn't have been easy
to befriend him.

670
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,790
How did you get close?

671
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,770
Should I ask for dessert
if you're done with it?

672
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,310
-Already?
-We don't want to keep Ha-eun waiting.

673
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,710
We need to go home soon.

674
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,930
I'll ask for dessert.

675
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,490
Did something happen between you two?

676
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,860
You've never been talkative,
so that's fine.

677
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,250
But you abruptly ended dinner.

678
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,520
You barely ate too.

679
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,280
I'm just not feeling that well.

680
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:43,550
Why didn't you tell me?
We would've cancelled it.

681
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,360
Is it bad?

682
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,730
I'm feeling better.

683
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,460
Can I turn on some music?

684
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,840
Go ahead.

685
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,680
Do you like it?

686
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:13,390
Isn't it great?

687
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,380
Everything's all set up.

688
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,180
We just need to bring in our stuff.

689
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,950
Let's move at the end of this week.

690
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:21,690
Why so sudden?

691
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,230
Aren't you going to stay
with me until I leave?

692
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,430
Because of you.

693
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,080
You're taking your father's passing
harder than I thought.

694
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,890
I figured a change of
environment might be good.

695
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,240
I also want to live
a newlywed life somewhere new.

696
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,990
You could've discussed it with me first.

697
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,530
How? You didn't even pick up the phone.

698
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,930
That won't happen anymore.

699
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,610
It's all over now.

700
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,610
You're doing this again.

701
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,510
You're always doing this.

702
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,390
You don't tell me about the problem.

703
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,910
You just say it's over.

704
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,740
I feel like I'm staring at a brick wall.

705
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,960
Do you know how frustrating it is?

706
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,470
Is it so hard for you to open up to me?

707
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,980
I'm the only one you've got now.

708
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,380
Let's not do this right now.

709
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,140
You're pushing me away again.

710
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:23,880
Then why did you tell me
you'll be better to begin with?

711
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,950
Why did you get my hopes up
and leave me in misery again?

712
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,820
How much more do I have to tolerate?

713
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,070
I didn't ask you to tolerate anything.

714
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,700
You know what we have isn't normal.

715
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,370
You know how we began.

716
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,890
You forced this on me
by attempting suicide.

717
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,340
What else could I have done?

718
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,520
If I hadn't done that,
you'd never look my way.

719
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,560
Since you agreed to this,

720
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,800
shouldn't you at least make an effort?

721
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,670
This is me making an effort!

722
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,840
But it's not enough for you,

723
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,700
so you keep driving me crazy.

724
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,340
When will you be satisfied?

725
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,980
What more do you want from me?

726
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,800
So I'm the only problem?

727
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,830
You're not at fault at all?

728
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,390
Then what do you want from me?

729
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,840
I forced this on you,

730
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,640
so I should shut up about it?

731
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,350
Should I just accept whatever you do?

732
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,220
That's not what I said!

733
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,040
That's exactly what you meant!

734
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,890
If this is your best effort,
then I don't need it.

735
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,930
I'm not a charity case.

736
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,920
If this is the best you can do,

737
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,670
let's just end it all then!

738
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,250
Shall we end it, then?

739
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:45,850
What?

740
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,630
Are you serious?

741
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,780
Is that really what you want?

742
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,020
Yes.

743
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,000
I can't do this anymore.

744
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,190
(My sister...)

745
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,350
(Can you please accept her?)

746
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,520
(She says she can't live without you.)

747
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:02,550
How are you feeling?

748
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,460
Jae-shin.

749
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,470
It's much better.

750
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,720
Thanks.

751
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,280
Did you get home okay yesterday?

752
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,100
I was worried I might have
made you uncomfortable.

753
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,440
I didn't want to ignore your wife,

754
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,860
and ended up saying that.

755
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,960
I didn't mean anything by it.

756
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,810
I see you because you're my friend.

757
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:21,430
Oh.

758
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,500
I want to make sure you feel the same way.

759
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,490
Sure, friend.

760
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,680
Take care of your wrist.

761
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,770
Guard it before it's damaged for good.

762
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,940
Yes.

763
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,720
Oh, I see.

764
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,530
Okay.

765
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,010
I'll check and get back to you right away.

766
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,990
Manager Kang?

767
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:13,990
I'm sorry.

768
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,690
It's about an event in Daejeon.

769
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,550
They're asking for
1,000 Aqua promotional gifts.

770
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,630
Can we do that?

771
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,440
Don't we have to check our inventory?

772
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,510
What do you think?

773
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,750
Umm...

774
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,730
We'll still have some stock left

775
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,860
even after we meet 120% of our target.

776
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,520
I think we can give them 1,000.

777
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:33,950
Do it then.

778
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,150
Okay.

779
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,640
You can decide that by yourself now.

780
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,500
Recent events tell me
you're more than capable.

781
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,210
Just keep me updated.

782
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,930
Okay. Thank you.

783
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,720
Our newbie is now all grown up.

784
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:53,380
You happy, Hyun-seung?

785
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,360
Bam!

786
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,480
Anyone want coffee? My treat.

787
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,310
Fantastic.

788
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,940
-Hot americano.
-Okay.

789
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,900
-Can I get something fancy?
-Sure you can.

790
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,130
Can I get two?

791
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,330
Two? Of course!

792
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,340
It seemed like
you were taking credit earlier.

793
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,570
(Letter of Resignation)

794
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,240
(Letter of Resignation)

795
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,730
(Lee Jae-shin)

796
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,320
(The caller's phone is turned off.)

797
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:10,070
(Please leave a message after the tone.)

798
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,270
Fresh coffee has arrived.

799
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,470
Coffee is here!

800
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,450
-Hot americano for me.
-Latte for me.

801
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,430
My latte.

802
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,160
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

803
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:23,710
This is yours.

804
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,920
Thank you.

805
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,400
Thanks for the coffee, Hyun-seung.

806
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,390
Enjoy.

807
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,440
It's so delicious.

808
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,910
I can drink their coffee every day
and not get sick of it.

809
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,260
This smells so good.

810
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,310
Doesn't it?

811
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,430
When did Director Lee Jae-shin stop by?

812
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,290
Today?

813
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,950
We didn't see him today.

814
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,150
I thought he's coming back tomorrow.

815
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,220
Is something wrong?

816
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,890
Nothing.

817
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,180
It seems urgent.

818
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,580
Did something happen?

819
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,950
(Jae-woon)

820
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:25,600
What?

821
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,870
(Did something happen
between you and Jae-shin?)

822
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,740
Why?

823
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,420
Bye.

824
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,760
(The caller's phone is turned off.)

825
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,950
(Please leave a message after the tone.)

826
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,210
(After the tone...)

827
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,370
(If this is the best you can do,)

828
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,320
(let's just end it all then!)

829
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,280
Yes. Let’s put an end to this

830
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,160
(Jae-shin)

831
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:57,170
(The caller's phone is turned off.)

832
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,720
(Please leave a message after the tone.)

833
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:10,530
It's not every day we get off work
at the same time.

834
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:13,230
Right. This is very uncommon.

835
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,200
Shouldn't we grab a drink to celebrate?

836
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,710
You and your celebrations.

837
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,030
Go home and play with
your children for once.

838
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,650
It's not my problem.

839
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:26,110
They are too busy to play with me.

840
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:30,550
Nobody's down for dinner? I'm buying.

841
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,740
Enjoy it by yourself.

842
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,840
Manager Kang, how about some beef?

843
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,370
I have a date.

844
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,780
A date?

845
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,920
I don't understand
why you guys are rejecting me.

846
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,390
You'll buy us beef BBQ?

847
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:46,620
How about beef rice soup?

848
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,600
BBQ.

849
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,110
No BBQ.

850
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,640
I don't have the money.

851
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,660
Where is he?

852
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,520
Where is he?

853
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,220
Where is Lee Jae-shin?
