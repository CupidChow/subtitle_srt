(All places, characters, firms and events
depicted in this show are fictitious.)

2
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,330
Sorry. I dozed off.

3
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,330
Get some sleep.

4
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,400
We did a lot already.

5
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,170
But there's still a lot left.

6
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,810
I'm awake now.

7
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,220
No, stop.

8
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,039
Just get some sleep.

9
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,479
You can barely keep your eyes open.

10
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,420
I usually go to bed early.

11
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,880
Lie down for half an hour.

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,950
Don't worry, I'll wake you up.

13
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,270
Should I?

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,020
I'll switch with you when I wake up.

15
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Okay.

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Oh, wait.

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,600
Wait for a second.

18
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,800
Take this.

19
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,940
Are you okay? You're all wet.

20
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,970
I'm okay.

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,100
Quick.

22
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,230
Lie down here. Use that as a blanket.

23
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,760
Come quickly before you're fully awake.

24
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,780
Dry yourself. You'll catch a cold.

25
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,280
I can brush it off. It's okay.

26
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,420
Sit down.

27
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,790
Now.

28
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,450
Can I ask you something?

29
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
Why do you like me?

30
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,330
I'm just curious.

31
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,880
It wasn't love at first sight.

32
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,450
Excuse me!

33
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,020
Are you here for career counseling?

34
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,230
(At first...)

35
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,860
Then I'll see you at work next time.

36
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,530
(I wanted to see you once again.)

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,360
(I hoped to see you again.)

38
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,870
(That's how I felt.)

39
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,310
When I saw you again,

40
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,170
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

41
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,280
(You're kind and passionate,
just as I thought.)

42
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,490
I learned about your thoughts,
actions and expressions.

43
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,920
Learning more about you was great.

44
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,530
I don't know exactly when
I started to like you.

45
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,270
Nor do I know why.

46
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,730
It's just...

47
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,900
It's just because it's you.

48
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,510
I like you because you're you.

49
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,110
I think when you like someone,

50
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,530
that's what happens.

51
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,000
You see only what you want to see.

52
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,630
You think you've known enough
about that person.

53
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,100
But

54
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,970
you are mistaken.

55
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,110
I'm not that great of a person.

56
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
I'm more foolish than you think.

57
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,180
And I'm pathetic.

58
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,900
Also,

59
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,270
I'm a bad person.

60
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,470
So...

61
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,150
So your heart is too big for me.

62
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,170
For a person like me to accept.

63
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,090
This is the only answer I can give you.

64
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,430
Warm yourself up.

65
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,310
I'll wait.

66
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,490
I can wait.
I won't make you uncomfortable.

67
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,190
I'll wait.

68
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,150
(Episode 7)

70
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,690
What are you doing?

71
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,710
Hey, baby.

72
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,680
You're late.

73
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,050
Some of them aren't right for you.

74
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,690
I thought I bought all your clothes,

75
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,410
but there are some tacky ones
mixed in here.

76
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,260
Did you buy them yourself?

77
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,150
Your taste isn't that good.

78
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,470
Leave them. I'll organize it.

79
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,130
You're busy. I'll do it.

80
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,669
We'll move into our new place soon.

81
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,840
I have to clean it out anyway.

82
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,850
I said I'll do it.

83
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,690
Okay then, you do it.

84
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,550
You look awfully drunk.

85
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,690
Is something wrong?

86
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,800
No.

87
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,250
You'd better go now.

88
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Jae-shin.

89
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,680
Your current place suits you the best.

90
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,880
As my brother's friend
and right next to me.

91
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,120
Just in case you forget.

92
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,190
Sometimes you get confused about
where you fit the best.

93
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,030
You look tired. Wash up and get some rest.

94
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,160
I'll get going now.

95
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,300
You must've worked awfully hard.
You did it all.

96
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,430
Looks like you did stay up all night.

97
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,040
Are you going back to the office?

98
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,700
No, they told us to take the day off.

99
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,080
Okay, drive safely back to Seoul.

100
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,590
-We'll leave the rest up to you.
-Sure, don't worry.

101
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,780
-Thank you.
-Sure.

102
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Let's go.

103
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,790
Okay.

104
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,800
Let me know if you're sleepy. I can drive.

105
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,800
Okay.

106
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,150
Shall we listen to the radio?

107
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,580
(Morning Discovery.
This is your host, Lee Ji-hye.)

108
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,920
(We have a letter from
Mapo-gu Lovesick Guy.)

109
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,420
(There's something about his nickname.)

110
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,360
(Hello.)

111
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,850
(I'm a 27-year-old guy
who recently confessed my love)

112
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,370
(to a senior at work and got rejected.)

113
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,530
(My condolences to you, sir.)

114
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,060
(It rained yesterday.)

115
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,750
(You know that vibe.)

116
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,110
(So I confessed my love for her,
like a man.)

117
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,150
(But she said younger men
aren't her type.)

118
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,750
(A guy's heart isn't a joke.)

119
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,450
(Just because I'm younger,
my feelings don't matter, is it?)

120
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,060
(I was so hurt that...)

121
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,890
Let's just drive quietly.

122
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,440
We'll soon hit the rest stop.

123
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Let's get something to eat.

124
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,180
Okay.

125
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,910
Hello, this is Chae Hyun-seung.

126
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,180
Oh, hello.

127
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,510
The Beauty Class banner company?

128
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,250
I'm not sure.

129
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,920
I think...

130
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,390
I'll ask Manager Kang and get back to you.

131
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,690
Okay, I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

132
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,730
I'll go on ahead.

133
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,330
Okay.

134
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,510
Happy birthday to you!

135
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,450
Happy birthday to you!

136
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,930
Happy birthday, dear Ha-eun!

137
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,360
Happy birthday to you!

138
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,640
You must have worked hard
to prepare everything.

139
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,150
I have to do this to
stop her from nagging me.

140
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,770
Where did you order the lunchboxes?

141
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,910
They were so pretty.

142
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,240
Could you pass me the info?

143
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,340
I want to order it for Ye-na's birthday.

144
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,350
I asked my husband's friend to do it.
He's a chef.

145
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,950
-From that restaurant?
-Yes.

146
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,550
Ha-eun asked, so I called him
and he said yes.

147
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,560
His recipes are really special indeed.

148
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,860
I tried to copy him at home,
but it didn't taste the same.

149
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,900
I guess that's why he's a famous chef.

150
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,930
I couldn't even think of copying him.

151
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,370
Could you ask him
if he can teach us his recipe?

152
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,210
His recipe?

153
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,540
I know it's not easy.

154
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,250
But I won't tell others.

155
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,210
I'll pay him handsomely.

156
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,950
I don't know if I can ask him that.

157
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,740
Come on, please.

158
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,550
Ask him if he's up for teaching a class.

159
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,120
Small restaurants these days
do that a lot.

160
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,460
Is that so?

161
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,560
Sounds great!

162
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,060
Alright, I'm in!

163
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,960
Me too.

164
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,830
Me too.

165
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,130
Okay, I'll ask him.

166
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,270
But don't get your hopes up.

167
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,210
I'm sorry to call you here.

168
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,440
I was suddenly short on ingredients.

169
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,000
It's okay.
I'm glad you could make time to see me.

170
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,020
And I can do my grocery shopping too.

171
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,820
I should get some of these.

172
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,350
What did you want to ask me?

173
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,830
Oh, about that...

174
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,700
Are you interested
in teaching a cooking class?

175
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,130
A cooking class?

176
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,500
Your recipe is special.

177
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,570
So people around me
are hyped to learn from you.

178
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,640
Just four people including me.

179
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,680
You too?

180
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,580
Yes. I love your cooking.

181
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,210
But I don't know if I can.

182
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,520
You're too busy, is it?

183
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,720
Even once a month would be great.

184
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,910
No, that's not what I mean.
It's just that I haven't done it before.

185
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,060
I'm not confident enough to do it.

186
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,200
I have an idea.

187
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,800
How about going to
another chef's cooking class?

188
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,530
If you see how it's done, it'll help.

189
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,840
Well, I think that'll be good.

190
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,740
Right?

191
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,340
But I haven't been to one before.

192
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,930
Could you go with me?

193
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,810
Me?

194
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,180
I'd be shy going alone.

195
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,180
And I don't have anyone else to ask.

196
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,220
Sure. Why not?

197
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,840
(Plum Beige Lip Color Relaunch)

198
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,240
(Relaunch)

199
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,640
We are holding an event
for the re-produced lipstick

200
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,600
this weekend.

201
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,120
After this event,

202
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,180
we'll decide whether
we should keep producing it.

203
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,680
Good job. It must've been hard.

204
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,490
Not at all.

205
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,190
Good job, Hyun-seung.

206
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,030
You did great stepping in eagerly
for the team.

207
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
Thank you.

208
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,750
Hyun-seung and Song-ah did great.

209
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,490
A round of applause for them.

210
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,510
Did anything happen to the two of you?

211
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,540
What do you mean?

212
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,180
When? What?

213
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,480
You two pulled an all-nighter together.

214
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,460
Did you not see a ghost?

215
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,060
I saw one before.

216
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,790
It was a woman in white.

217
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,560
And she had long hair like this.

218
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,730
It was me.

219
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,100
I grew my hair long
and wore a white T-shirt.

220
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,700
My ghost's hair was silky smooth.

221
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,600
So is mine.

222
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,700
You just gave me the creeps.

223
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,770
I'm getting goosebumps.

224
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,440
We were busy attaching stickers.

225
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,100
It was the director's order.

226
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,480
If we didn't do it on time...

227
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,380
That would've been scarier than a ghost.

228
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,980
You're right. That's scarier.

229
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,220
Let's go back to the meeting.

230
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,120
Oh, yes.

231
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,490
We're holding a new product
suggestion contest this year.

232
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,360
It'll be exactly the same as last year.

233
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,960
One mandatory participant
per team, as usual?

234
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,370
Yes. Any volunteers?

235
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,680
Then this time, it's Hyun-seung's turn.

236
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,980
The youngest one should do it
since he's quick-witted.

237
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,470
It's the same for other teams.

238
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,320
Song-ah did it every year.
You're finally free.

239
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,850
You'll be informed of the details,
so check the bulletin, Hyun-seung.

240
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,560
Team members, help him as much as you can.

241
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Yes, sir.

(KLAR New Product Suggestion Contest)

243
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,340
(We support your idea)

244
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,770
It seems like a big deal, but it's not.

245
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,470
Don't feel too pressured.

246
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,770
I guess you're right.

247
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,560
But

248
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,840
Song-ah won first place every year.

249
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,910
I'm just saying. Good luck.

250
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,310
Song-ah is incredible.

251
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,380
Why make me do this?

252
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,050
What's wrong with being the youngest?

253
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,290
I've been pressured to win first place.

254
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,250
They told me the same thing too.

255

My manager wants the prize money
for the team dinner.

256
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,890
How much was it?

257
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,850
Three million won.

258
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,130
I heard it'll be taken into account
in our personnel evaluation.

259
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,800
Let's do it this way.

260
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,740
Give me all your ideas.

261
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,370
We'll do it by age this year.

262
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,810
I'll win first place, Hyun-seung's second

263
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,580
and Se-rim's third.

264
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,880
He has more ambition than he lets on.

265
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,110
-I'll get the coffee.
-No.

266
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,450
-I'll get it.
-Thanks.

267
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,920
What good idea is there?

268
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,890
-What good idea is there?
-Seriously.

269
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:37,690
Huh?

270
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,060
What is it?

271
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,670
Why? What?

272
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,970
Hyun-seung.

273
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,670
Isn't he the BM from your team?

275
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,250
Wait.
(Granddaughter of KLAR Cosmetic
plans wedding with employee)

276
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,450
The BM Lee mentioned here.

277
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,120
-That's our BM Lee, right?
-I think so.

278
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,790
-He's the only BM who's still unmarried.
-Right.

279
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,920
Isn't he Director Lee's cousin?

280
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,390
But the woman in this article
is the director's sister.

281
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,120
How can the two get married?

282
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,200
They're not cousins then.

283
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,730
That's only a rumor, isn't it?

284
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,030
Yes, that's right.

285
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,900
BM Lee never said they were cousins.

286
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,710
Anyway, this is huge.

287
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,270
He'll become the chairman's
grandson-in-law.

288
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,520
Yes, you're right.

289
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,440
(Page not found)
Yes, you're right.

290
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,380
Huh? The article has been deleted.
(Page not found)

291
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,700
Huh?

292
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,980
What's the matter? It's deleted.

293
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,620
Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

294
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,000
I asked them to delete the article.

295
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,530
We won't announce our stance or anything.

296
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,470
They're so bothersome.

297
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,310
How about announcing it now?

298
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,440
Now?

299
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,910
Most of the employees
must've seen the article.

300
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,110
It won't be good to confuse the employees.

301
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,550
I don't mind it being announced now.

302
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,820
Are you really okay with it?

303
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,390
You'll have to carefully watch
your actions after this.

304
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,020
We're going to get married anyway.

305
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,220
It's better if they talk to my face
than behind my back.

306
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,160
His promotion...

307
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,800
It's for sure.

308
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,300
Seriously.

309
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,830
Hello, sir.

310
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,940
You all must've seen the article.

311
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,510
It was deleted.

312
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,190
What's going on, sir?

313
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,740
The news about my marriage

314
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,350
is real.

315
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,380
I kept it a secret
because it's still early.

316
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,850
But now you know.

317
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,640
If you're free that day,
please come to the wedding.

318
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,950
-We'll make time to go.
-Of course.

319
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,660
Congratulations. A round of applause.

320
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,960
-Yes.
-Great.

321
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,860
Congratulations!

322
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,940
Let me treat you to a meal soon.

323
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,230
-Sounds great.
-Okay.

324
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,110
-Once again, congratulations.
-Congratulations.

325
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,530
(You must've been surprised today.)

326
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,570
Sorry for all the fuss, Grandpa.

327
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,840
I thought she was taking a picture
to see if the dress fits.

328
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,540
I didn't know she'd upload it
on her social media.

329
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,040
You really didn't know?

330
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,190
No. It never crossed my mind.

331
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,920
Are you still that insecure?

332
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,790
What did he do to make you cling to him?

333
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,190
There are a lot of better men out there.

334
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,390
I know.

335
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,730
I know Jae-shin isn't a great man.

336
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,170
But among all those people,

337
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,740
he was the only one who took care of me

338
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,400
when I was desperately in need.

339
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,910
So I can never let him go, Grandpa.

340
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,840
Even if you can't let go,

341
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,910
you can't keep hold of someone's heart.

342
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,570
Even if you break their legs

343
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,950
and make them sit next to you,

344
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,250
you can't win their heart.

345
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm good if I can just
keep him next to me.

346
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,460
I remember what you taught us.

347
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,600
We must only desire what we can have.

348
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,900
We must only challenge what we can handle.

349
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,410
I won't struggle to hold on to his heart.

350
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,280
You don't have to worry.

351
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,050
It seems like Jae-shin knows for sure now.

352
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,520
That I have to be next to him.

353
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,360
I'm going home now.

354
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,190
Are you working late, Song-ah?

355
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,820
Yes.

356
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,450
Someone has to go
to the color makeup section soon.

357
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,060
Not me, you know that, right?

358
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,830
I know.
I can't send you because I'm scared.

359
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,320
Color makeup has enough problems already.

360
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,840
You'll make it explode.

361
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,940
I'll make it boom!

362
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,880
I know.

363
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,710
Don't worry.

364
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,480
Are you leaving, Hyun-seung?

365
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,380
Want to go for a drink?

366
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,820
I'm going to do a brainstorming session

367
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,220
with my recruit buddies.

368
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,720
You're starting on that already?

369
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,460
Yes, I'm starting early.

370
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,770
Wow, he never half-asses it.

371
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,920
-He's like me.
-As if.

372
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,070
Hyun-seung, do you know MLB?

373
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,580
The LA Dodgers?

374
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,930
Yes, I do.

375
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,900
They won Rookie of the Year
for five years in a row.

376
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,010
In 1992, Eric Karros.

377
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,240
-In 1993, Mike Piazza.
-Piazza.

378
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,310
In 1994...

379
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,350
Raul Mondesi.

380
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,010
That's right.

381
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,720
-In 1995...
-Nomo Hideo.

382
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,020
-How did you know?
-Get to the point.

383
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,750
Well, I mean...

384
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,650
We can win first place 3 years in a row.

385
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,560
Hyun-seung, fight on!

386
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,690
-Thanks.
-You can do it!

387
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,330
If you don't know something, ask Song-ah.

388
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,530
Of course, she'll teach you well anyway.

389
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,230
She won first place no matter what.

390
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,030
Good luck.

391
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,550
Thanks.

392
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,330
-Goodbye.
-See you tomorrow.

393
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,400
Manager Ahn, do you want to grab dinner?

394
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Hey...

395
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,500
Let's go eat.

396
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Hey, guys.

397
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,740
Hello.

398
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,370
Are you working late too?

399
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,970
Yes.

400
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
Do you want to get dinner with us?

401
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,170
It's okay, it won't take long.

402
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,110
Go eat.

403
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,380
Then treat us to dinner next time, please.

404
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,680
Hyun-seung has been
complimenting you non-stop.

405
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,350
I'm sick and tired of it.

406
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,650
There's no time. Let's go.

407
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,350
No time?

408
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,780
We have a tight schedule.

409
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,260
-Really?
-Let's go eat quickly.

410
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,790
-Do we have to go now?
-Come on.

411
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,060
-I'll look forward to that dinner!
-Forget it. Come on.

412
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,160
Bye.

413
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,130
Let's go! We don't have much time.

414
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,300
I'll get going too.

415
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,270
Enjoy your dinner.

416
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,010
Thanks. Goodbye.

417
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,340
Hurry up!

418
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,940
I'm coming!

419
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,320
Absorbs into my skin.

420
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,160
Ah, it's so refreshing.

421
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,190
Goodness. What are you doing, Director?

422
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,930
Director Lee is becoming beautiful!

423
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,560
Hey! I just put it on!

424
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,400
You won't get prettier with this.

425
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,000
How displeasing to my eyes.

426
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,490
If you act this way after you get married,

427
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,670
you'd be in trouble.

428
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,810
Mind your own business.

429
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,210
Right.

430
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,710
Why did you change the dress shop?

431
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,280
Why?

432
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,050
You even changed the date
to match their schedule.

433
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,020
Why'd you change shops?

434
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,350
I heard the news today.

435
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,020
It didn't satisfy my expectation.

436
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,320
Empty vessels make the most sound.

437
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,420
Maybe it's because you were fussy?

438
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,380
You should've gone to a better place then.

439
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,960
They leaked your photo.

440
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,770
We'll make an official statement soon.

441
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,340
Jae-shin agreed to it.

442
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
He did?

443
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,670
Yes. He didn't want you to be criticized.

444
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,880
Thanks anyway.

445
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,680
Lunch tomorrow? It's on me.

446
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
No. I'm busy all weekend.

447
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,150
Doing what? You have nothing to do.

448
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,860
This time, I do.

449
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,490
And it's very important to me.

450
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,130
How about a melting mask
that you can sleep with it?

451
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,530
I think that already exists.

452
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,270
Really?

453
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,940
Everything I say already exists.

454
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,620
Then what isn't there?

455
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,540
How about this?

456
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,950
Highly concentrated ampoule
on top and essence below it.

457
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,740
When you turn the container
for the first time,

458
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,140
the ampoule drops
and mixes with the essence.

459
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,660
Ampoule essence.

460
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,420
You're a genius.

461
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,790
Can you give that idea to me?

462
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,430
It exists.

463
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,460
Seriously, I quit! I quit!

464
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,000
Do we have to consider the prime cost?

465
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,170
I think so, feasibility is
one of the evaluation criteria.

466
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,210
I'm thinking about adopting
a disposable ampoule

467
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,240
to the container Hyun-seung suggested.

468
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,280
Sounds good.

469
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,610
I don't know if we can make
that kind of container.

470
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,080
It's disposable
so it has to be super small,

471
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,790
but it'll be more expensive.

472
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,650
Right.

473
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,890
How much will a container cost?

474
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,730
What?

475
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,090
She's still here.

476
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,890
Who?

477
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,900
Your senior.

478
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,810
Senior Yoon.

479
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,480
Yes?

480
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,130
We were talking and we wanted
to ask you something.

481
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,720
What is it?

482
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,290
We want to make
a disposable container that mixes

483
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,620
the top layer and bottom layer
when twisted.

484
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,630
Will it be possible to make one
in such a small size?

485
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,130
It's possible.

486
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,030
It doesn't have to be turned.

487
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,070
You can find another way too.

488
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,340
Then what about the prime price?

489
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,790
It's fine as long as
it's not ridiculously high.

490
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,240
Don't worry about it.

491
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,480
It's hard enough to think of a new idea.

492
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,580
It'll be harder if you
need to consider that.

493
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,280
Okay. Thank you.

494
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,520
Are you heading home now?

495
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,560
Yes.

496
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,890
Are you okay?

497
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,890
About what?

498
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,800
Today's article.

499
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,980
I shouldn't ask these things anymore.

500
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,770
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,310
No, it's okay.

502
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,840
It's not like I didn't know.

503
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,150
That's a relief.

504
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,680
Also...

505
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,450
If you, by any chance,
have any other questions, you can ask.

506
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,220
Okay.

507
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,230
Get home safely.

508
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,490
Okay.

509
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,180
Did something happen between you and her?

510
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,580
What?

511
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,390
You two seemed awkward.

512
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,550
Different from usual.

513
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,870
No, nothing happened.

514
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,590
Why would we seem awkward?

515
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,270
Do you want to do
market research with me tomorrow?

516
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,330
Let's do it separately.

517
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,400
The clerks will notice
if we show up together.

518
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,400
Okay, then.

519
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,950
Welcome! We're KLAR!

520
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,800
Welcome.

521
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,540
I'll contact you
when the design is completed.

522
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,080
Okay. I look forward to it.

523
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,780
Leave it to us.

524
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,750
-Okay.
-Thanks.

525
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:08,980
Take care.

526
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,950
Bye.

527
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,280
You're exhausted, right?

528
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,920
You've got no time to rest this weekend.

529
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
I am.

530
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,090
You'll soon be able to buy the lipstick
you were looking for.

531
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,830
When you get the word,
come anytime you want.

532
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,470
I'll doll up and wait for you.

533
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,270
-Manager.
-Yes, ma'am.

534
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,370
Department stores close at 8:30 p.m.
on the weekends, right?

535
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,810
Yes.

536
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,440
Why?

537
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,310
Nothing.

538
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,220
I'll be in my office.

539
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,510
Let me know when the next client comes.

540
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,810
Sure.

541
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,580
I shouldn't ask these things anymore.

542
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,430
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,640
Why make that face?

544
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,410
Huh? What?

545
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,210
Huh?

546
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,890
Did something happen?

547
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,350
No.

548
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,760
You have plans today?

549
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,360
Not really.

550
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,660
Let's go out.

551
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Where to?

552
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm at Garosu-gil right now.

553
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,170
(Do you want to meet up
at our usual place later?)

554
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,560
Again?

555
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,340
Please don't interfere with my weekend.

556
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,630
(You jerk.)

557
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,980
(Never mind. Bye.)

558
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,180
What the...

559
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,950
What do you think?

560
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,280
It's pretty.

561
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,560
Good. I'm going with this.

562
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,690
Aren't you getting anything?

563
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,730
I don't need anything.

564
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,590
You don't buy clothes
because you need them.

565
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,330
You look around and buy some pretty stuff.

566
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,469
It's on me. Choose something.

567
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,739
You don't have money to buy me clothes.

568
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,300
Come here.

569
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,780
Wow, there are lots of
pretty clothes here.

570
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,810
This is pretty.

571
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,219
How about this?
Just buy this. It's pretty.

572
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,280
I can't wear this to work.

573
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,550
Wear it well.

574
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,760
Okay.

575
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,909
Tell me when you need something.

576
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,920
I'll buy it for you.

577
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,630
You never owe someone, do you?

578
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,050
Anyway, I'm so hungry.

579
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,400
-Want to eat something?
-Yes.

580
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,570
What should we have?

581
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,929
Huh?

582
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,540
What?

583
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,840
ABM Chae Hyun-seung!

584
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,590
Hey, Ga-young!

585
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,550
Hello!

586
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,350
Oh, hi.

587
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,480
What brings you here?

588
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,920
We were shopping.

589
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,650
I came to do market research.

590
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,920
But it's the weekend.

591
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Song-ah trained you to be a workaholic.

592
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,830
You two are the same.

593
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,730
Hi.

594
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,020
You must be busy.

595
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,100
You can go if you want.

596
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,240
Okay.

597
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,580
Have you had lunch?

598
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,640
Hey!

599
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,310
We're on our way to lunch.

600
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,950
If you haven't had it yet, join us.

601
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,880
You have to eat alone if you go home.

602
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,350
Let's go, come on!

603
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,870
Let's go!

604
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,290
Hey, Ga-young.

605
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,350
Cheers!

606
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,900
It's so good.

607
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,700
Eat up, ABM Chae. I'm buying.

608
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,460
No, it's on me.

609
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,440
No, I dragged you here, so I'm buying.

610
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,070
Okay.

611
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,240
What a coincidence

612
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,910
to run into each other here!

613
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,680
Right?

614
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,580
I was wondering how you were doing.

615
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,120
Why didn't you come by the store nowadays?

616
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,820
Actually, my work assignment has changed.

617
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,820
Why so?

618
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,530
I work on skincare and
door-to-door channel now.

619
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,520
Then what about Song-ah?

620
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,300
You don't work with her anymore?

621
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,870
No.

622
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,010
So that's why you were down and low.

623
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,810
What are you talking about?

624
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,280
Why have you become so thin?

625
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,910
Eat up, okay? Here.

626
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,010
Well, I...

627
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,650
She doesn't like skinny guys.

628
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,760
Eat up.

629
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,650
Hey!

630
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,290
Alright. I'll give you some, too. Wait.

631
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,090
Here comes the meat. Open your mouth.

632
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,130
Ow, it's hot.

633
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,210
I'll cool it down for you.

634
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,430
Here.

635
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,300
It's okay, right?

636
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,470
Eat.

637
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,160
What's taking her so long in the bathroom?

638
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,770
Does the market research help?

639
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,470
Yes, more or less.

640
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,000
This won't do.

641
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,850
I'll go check on her.

642
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,930
(Kim Ga-young)

643
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,910
(I suddenly got a severe stomachache.)

644
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,650
(So I'm going home.)

645
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,870
(Don't desert the ABM. Walk him home.)

646
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,970
(Come home as late as you want.)

647
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,470
Kim Ga-young!

648
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,240
Why? What did she say?

649
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,510
Oh...

650
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,080
She went home because of a stomachache.

651
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,540
Is it bad?

652
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,920
It's nothing to worry about.

653
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,730
Should we say goodbye here?

654
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,440
Sure.

655
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,540
Tell Ga-young it was good seeing her.

656
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,750
Manager Kang?

657
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,980
It's really Manager Kang.

658
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,420
You're right.

659
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,640
Run!

660
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,740
What?

661
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,240
Run! Now!

662
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,090
Your shoe.

663
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Are you okay?

664
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,670
Let's go.

665
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
It'll be okay now, right?

666
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,500
Yes.

667
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,950
I'm so exhausted.

668
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,050
-Senior Yoon.
-Yes?

669
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,660
Why were we running?

670
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,530
I don't know.

671
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,060
Why did we run?

672
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,440
Did I tell you to run?

673
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,410
You told me to run just now.

674
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,930
How could you forget?

675
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,280
Hey, you ran with me.

676
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,480
I'm so exhausted.

677
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,570
Ow, it hurts.

678
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,560
Hello!

679
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,900
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

680
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,830
You're here.

681
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,690
Get me a glass of water.

682
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,160
Is something wrong?

683
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,530
You said you had an errand.

684
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,770
It's nothing.

685
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,460
Weren't you busy today?

686
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,770
No, we didn't have that many customers.

687
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,220
I'll go inside and rest for a while.

688
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,460
What's up with her?

689
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,300
How's your foot?

690
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,730
It's okay.

691
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,940
You really don't exercise, do you?

692
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,510
You seemed out of breath.

693
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,510
I know. I need to exercise, right?

694
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,180
If I assess my metabolic age,

695
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,350
it'd say I'm in my 50s.

696
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,680
You went too far.

697
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,380
Okay, then maybe in my 40s?

698
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,390
70s.

699
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,150
In your 70s.

700
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,060
What?

701
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,690
What did you buy?

702
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,700
Oh, this?

703
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,450
It's not my taste,

704
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,700
but Ga-young bought it for me.

705
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,170
It must be a dress or a skirt.

706
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,540
How do you know so well?

707
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,760
What I said that time...

708
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,800
I hope you're not too hurt by it.

709
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,270
I know I've been pushing you away.

710
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,010
And it's ridiculous to say this now.

711
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,790
But I've been wanting to say this.

712
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,750
I hope you don't make that face.

713
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,390
You're not the problem.

714
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,100
For now,

715
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,830
I don't think I can handle anyone.

716
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,470
I don't want to be scared or swayed

717
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,010
by the wounds that jerk gave me.

718
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,110
But I can't help it right now.

719
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,820
Anyway, thanks.

720
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,990
I feel less pathetic.

721
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,560
Thanks to you.

722
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,660
I won't forget that.

723
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,890
Are you

724
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,750
never going to see me again?

725
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,240
You talk as if you'll never see me again.

726
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,040
Why would I not see you?

727
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,710
That's enough for me.

728
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,850
Actually, I knew it from the start.

729
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,010
I wanted you to be mine

730
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,620
when I interfered in your relationship.

731
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,720
I knew I was being selfish.

732
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,500
So I didn't expect a lot from the start.

733
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,030
But I'm a greedy guy.

734
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,310
Seeing you smiling at me made me think.

735
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,880
I thought things might really
go well with you.

736
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,150
I thought I might really
become your boyfriend.

737
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,320
So it was my fault.

738
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,040
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,160
I made you say difficult words.

740
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,210
Anyway...

741
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,860
If I can keep seeing you like this,

742
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,910
I'd be content.

743
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,310
I'll maintain the distance
if that's what you wish.

744
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,610
Like now. Like this.

745
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,080
Is that okay?

746
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,850
Why aren't you stretching?

747
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,510
I said I don't want to.

748
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:41,150
Why do you want to jog?
You've never done it before.

749
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,090
That's why I need to start jogging now.

750
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,590
If my metabolic age is 70, so is yours.

751
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,620
We won't be able to run in a war.

752
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,730
We'll just die.

753
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,820
What era are you living in?

754
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,170
If there is a war,

755
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,600
bombs will come flying and boom!

756
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,870
We all just die.

757
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,600
I'm leaving.

758
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:05,410
-Where are you going?
-Hey!

759
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,240
Run! Go!

760
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,420
This is nice.

761
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:19,780
Indeed.

762
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,620
Shall we hang it in our new home?

763
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,850
If you like it.

764
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,800
What?

765
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
I'm happy.

766
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,530
It's been so long since we went on a date.

767
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,070
I'll take more care of you from now on.

768
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,960
I won't make you upset like last time.

769
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,470
You'll be even busier
once you go to Europe,

770
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,110
so let's go on lots of dates.

771
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,480
Okay.

772
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,180
-Just a second.
-Okay.

773
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,480
Who is it?

774
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,760
I don't know this number.

775
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,490
You ignore it?

776
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:56,560
What if it's work?

777
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,030
They'll call back.

778
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,230
Don't worry about it.

779
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,010
Why isn't he picking up?

780
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,740
I sent him the account number long ago.

781
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,200
-Hey, Lee!
-Yes, sir!

782
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:18,880
Over here.

783
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,720
Yes, sir. I'm coming.

784
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,210
Thank you.

785
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,130
Throw it in.

786
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:31,660
Let's do this.

787
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,800
Go around.

788
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,300
Throw it in.

789
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,400
I'll keep going then.

790
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,670
No one is throwing it in.

791
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,040
Today's the last day of the promotion.

792
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,040
Why isn't she coming?

793
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,100
Director Lee Jae-woon.

794
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,950
Executive Director!

795
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,520
What brings you here on a weekend?

796
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,880
I just came to see
if everything is going well.

797
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,230
Let's have a cup of tea.
It's been so long.

798
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,230
Right now?

799
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,530
Are you busy?

800
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,990
No. Let's go then.

801
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,740
Okay. This way.

802
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,840
(Relaunch)

803
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,490
Welcome! We're KLAR!

804
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,050
Are you looking for something?

805
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,510
Sorry.

806
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,870
Do you have the relaunched lipstick?

807
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,030
That one?

808
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,040
We sold the last one just a moment ago.

809
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,180
I guess I'm too late.

810
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,550
I'm sorry.

811
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,520
No, it's okay. Have a nice day.

812
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:19,930
Take a look.

813
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,440
Open it.

814
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,560
I reproduced it for someone.

815
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,900
That someone must have it.

816
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,830
Thank you for this.

817
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,570
I didn't say it's free.

818
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,340
My name is Lee Jae-woon.

819
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,810
What's your name?

820
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,080
It's Chae Ji-seung.

821
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,360
Chae Ji-seung.

822
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,880
Am I done with the payment?

823
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,950
One more thing.

824
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:11,950
Am I one of the reasons you came today?

825
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,530
If I don't answer that,

826
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,260
do I need to return the lipstick?

827
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,260
No.

828
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:22,600
You already paid for that
when you showed up today.

829
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,720
I wanted to get more,
but I guess it won't work.

830
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:34,980
I don't want my interest
to be a burden to you.

831
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,280
Do you have a business card?

832
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:42,350
Let's set up a date formally next time.

833
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,850
Lee Jae-woon.

834
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,070
Yikes!

835
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,210
What is it, ma'am?

836
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,540
What kind of eyeshadow are you wearing?

837
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,380
What?

838
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,290
Eyeshadow?

839
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,190
I'm testing a new one.

840
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,830
Is that so? Looks good on you.

841
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,830
Thank you.

842
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,800
What's up with you?

843
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,370
You never give compliments.

844
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,130
I'm just stating a fact.

845
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,700
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

846
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,290
Stop laughing.

847
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,830
Wait.

848
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:47,860
What is it?

849
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:50,090
Tell me if you need anything.

850
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,190
Today's snack?

851
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,120
Instant noodles.

852
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,900
I'm going insane.

853
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,170
Stop laughing! Seriously!

854
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,610
Why can't I laugh?

855
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,540
You want noodles too?

856
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,610
Go help yourself.

857
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,560
Noodles, my butt.

858
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,600
(Does your father still visit?)

859
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:39,270
Blood ties and attachment
make you incompetent.

860
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,540
(Your position is out of your league.)

861
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,960
(So get your act straight.)

862
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:54,020
(Myungjin Inn)

863
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,720
That darn jerk.

864
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,750
Why'd he say he'd give me money?

865
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,020
Darn it.

866
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,520
I should've gotten a better settlement.

867
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,720
Sheesh.

868
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,680
Come in.

869
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,320
You should've told me you're coming.

870
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,100
What are you doing? Sit down.

871
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,070
What did you do with the money
you took from me?

872
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:53,540
Like you gave me a lot.

873
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,110
Some might think you gave me millions.

874
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,170
Never mind that.

875
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,390
Why didn't you answer my calls?

876
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,750
Why haven't you sent the money?

877
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,150
What do you do for a living?

878
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,520
You never care about me.

879
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,030
Why did you ask?

880
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,750
Are you playing a good son now?

881
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,800
How much do you want?

882
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,980
Let's disown each other.

883
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:26,270
How much will it take to do that?

884
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,440
What?

885
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,420
So you want to sever blood ties
by paying me?

886
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,520
Make a choice.

887
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,390
Take the money and cut ties with me.

888
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,620
Or get no money and watch you die.

889
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,300
How dare you threaten me!

890
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,010
How much can you give me?

891
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,350
Name a price.

892
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,830
300 million won.

893
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,980
Give me 300 million won then.

894
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,070
(300 million won has been
deposited to your bank account.)

895
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:35,040
From this moment onward,
I have no father.

896
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:41,550
Remember, you gave this to me!

897
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,490
I'll never give it back to you!

898
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,990
Good work today.

899
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,690
Thank you, Senior Yoon.

900
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,160
Your advice helped us a lot
with the contest.

901
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:55,970
You flatter me.

902
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,430
You all are so good, I did nothing.

903
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:02,170
How can you say that?
You gave us lots of tips.

904
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,640
If one of us wins the prize,
we'll treat you big time.

905
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,880
We should treat her even if we don't win.

906
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,250
Then we'll treat you
even if we don't win.

907
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,340
You don't have to.

908
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,720
Just make it to the PT round.

909
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,250
Okay.

910
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,840
You're heading home, right?

911
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,980
How will you go?

912
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,050
I'll take the bus over there.

913
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,150
I brought my car.

914
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,590
Do you want me to drive you home?

915
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,290
It's okay. I'll take the bus.

916
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,330
I'll be going now. Get home safely.

917
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:27,990
Okay.

918
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,900
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodbye.

919
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,470
Get home safely, Senior Yoon!

920
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,970
Let's go. Drop us off on your way home.

921
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:36,810
Okay.

922
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,010
Let's go.

923
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,100
(Chae Hyun-seung)

924
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,780
(Did you get home safely?)
(Chae Hyun-seung)

925
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,790
(This is an innocent question
from a junior to a senior.)

926
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,850
(I just arrived.)

927
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,060
(See you tomorrow, Junior Chae.)

928
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,510
(Okay, Senior Yoon.)

929
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,030
Let's go.

930
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,760
Yes, sir.

931
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,470
Here.

932
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,310
Give it to the models
or celebrity friends of yours.

933
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,550
It's a new essence.

934
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,830
If it's good enough,

935
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,610
ask them to upload it
on their social media.

936
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,150
Can they say it's not good
if they don't like it?

937
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,080
Geez.

938
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,780
Whatever.

939
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,880
Where are you going?

940
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,450
To the studio.

941
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,150
I have to wrap up yesterday's shoot.

942
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,560
Are you still busy nowadays?

943
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,520
Not really.

944
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,830
I'm turning down new projects.

945
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,220
I'm going to focus on
my married life after the wedding.

946
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,060
I won't be able to do that if not now.

947
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,330
Are you that happy
to get married to Jae-shin?

948
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,060
Yes.

949
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,700
What a quick and assured answer.

950
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,380
I'll leave now. I've stayed for too long.

951
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,180
Are you not going to see Jae-shin?

952
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,240
No. I don't want to bother him.

953
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,850
I'll see myself out.

954
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,290
Which floor?

955
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,820
-Tenth floor.
-Tenth floor.

956
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,670
Hold the elevator!

957
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,570
Thank you.

958
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,750
Oh, right.

959
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,720
You know, your senior...

960
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,820
-My senior?
-Yes.

961
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,760
She's a really nice person,
just like you said.

962
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,530
She doesn't have a boyfriend, right?

963
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,130
Why do you ask?

964
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,460
Is she interested in a blind date?

965
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,360
I have a friend who'd be perfect for her.

966
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:52,600
Is Senior Yoon Song-ah 28 years old?

967
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:57,200
Forget it. She's not interested.

968
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,270
Why?

969
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,970
You said she doesn't have a boyfriend.

970
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,310
My friend is really great.

971
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,210
He has looks, personality,
qualifications and everything.

972
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:06,210
This is your floor.

973
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,410
I should go.

974
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,220
Tell her about it, okay?

975
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,090
I'll send a photo later. Bye.

976
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,980
Why are you two together?

977
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,540
Let's go, Senior Yoon.
