1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,530
(This is a work of fiction.)

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,830
(Names, businesses, products,
events and places are used fictitiously.)

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,160
Over here.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,100
What's up?

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,230
I'm sorry, but about tonight...

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,790
Director Lee said we have to go somewhere,

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,070
but I forgot.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,960
Is it something important?

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,010
Yes, it's work. I can't get out of it.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,570
I'm really sorry.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Since it's work, there's nothing
you can do.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,930
Didn't you mention that
you have something to tell me?

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,940
It's almost our second anniversary.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,250
Do you want to go on a trip?

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,570
Yes.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,040
Think about where to go.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,340
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,790
Okay.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,210
You'll be late for your meeting. Go on.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,710
Senior Yoon!

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,910
I heard everything.

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,110
You were turned down
by the guy who seems like your boyfriend.

23
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,300
I wasn't turned down. He's not my...

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,740
You were turned down for sure.

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,370
Compared to what you'll face
in the near future,

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,789
this is nothing.

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,800
Anyway, you're free, right?

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
No, I don't have time for you.

29
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,530
Even if you're busy,

30
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,890
make some time for me.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,390
That doesn't suit you at all.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
Senior Yoon,

33
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,820
don't put on that lipstick.

34
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,800
We'll meet at the crosswalk after work.

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,380
Let me make this clear,

36
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,240
you have to be there.

37
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,370
Prestige's marketing department

38
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,380
(Episode 2)
Prestige's marketing department

39
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,620
is planning to enter the European market.
(Episode 2)

40
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,760
is planning to enter the European market.

41
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,370
It's called E-Project.

42
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,390
Do you know about this?

43
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,190
We'll go beyond the existing way
of global marketing

44
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,190
and open a specific distribution channel

45
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,880
to target the local customers.

46
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,550
Specific distribution channel?

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,610
It had failed before.

48
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,880
Are you doing it again?

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,630
We failed 20 years ago.

50
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,290
I know you went through a lot
when you pulled out from the market.

51
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,500
So, you should understand very well.

52
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,210
Entering the market is not the problem.

53
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,640
The problem is that it'll cost even more
when we pull out.

54
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,339
I know you're ambitious,

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,550
but don't use the company money
to fulfill your ambition.

56
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,800
That's why we must succeed this time.

57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,250
20 years ago, no one knew about
Korean cosmetics.

58
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,830
(Distribution of Korean Cosmetics Imports
to European Countries)
20 years ago, no one knew about
Korean cosmetics.

59
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,080
(Distribution of Korean Cosmetics Imports
to European Countries)

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,670
But now, it's different.
(Distribution of Korean Cosmetics Imports
to European Countries)

61
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,130
Korean makeup style has become
one of the beauty trends.
(Distribution of Korean Cosmetics Imports
to European Countries)

62
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,100
Korean makeup style has become
one of the beauty trends.

63
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,080
As long as we lay down a proper strategy,

64
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,510
there's no need to worry.

65
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,350
Do you think we failed because
we didn't have a strategy?

66
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,200
How can a business
rely solely upon strategies?

67
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,360
Isn't it better to just focus on Asia?

68
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,470
It's easier to increase
the sales in Southeast Asia.

69
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,659
Let Masstige join you in the plan.

70
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,920
We're a family.
We should do this together.

71
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,080
Don't you think so, BM Seo?

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,230
Oh, yes. That sounds good, Director Park.

73
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,150
Of course, we'll formulate the strategies
to conquer the Asian market.

74
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,010
But if the brand is not recognized
in Europe and America,

75
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,330
it won't go very far in Asia as well...

76
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,890
Stop.

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,200
No matter what he says,

78
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,640
it seems like you're sure it won't work.

79
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,640
But to me, there's no reason
for it to fail.

80
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,740
Young people always
fantasize a rosy future.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,640
You're too greedy.

82
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,370
Since when did the company
regard challenges as greed?

83
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,430
Our chairman has already
approved this project.

84
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,740
Please continue, BM Lee.

85
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,810
Those stiff-necked old farts.

86
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,970
No one asked for their opinion.

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,530
You're sure about this, right?

88
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,260
I wouldn't have started if I wasn't sure.

89
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,420
Okay!

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,800
Anyway,

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,420
gather a TF team with the finest staff.

92
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,350
I'll support you with everything I have.

93
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,280
Let's kick up a storm.

94
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,550
Then, I'll become the president

95
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,660
and you'll continue to be
my right-hand man.

96
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,750
See you tomorrow.

97
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,740
-See you.
-Goodbye.

98
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,820
I'm leaving too.

99
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,970
Aren't you leaving?

100
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,900
The more I think of it, the angrier I get.

101
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,590
How dare he touch my lips!

102
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,960
(Chae Hyun-seung)

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,070
(Chae Hyun-seung: You'll regret it.)

104
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,430
(You'll regret it.)
(Chae Hyun-seung: You'll regret it.)

105
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,610
(Chae Hyun-seung: You'll regret it.)

106
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,510
Darn this cheeky scoundrel!

107
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,830
Fasten the seat belt.

108
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm busy. Let's get it over with.

109
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,640
You're not surprised?

110
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,150
Are you kidding me?

111
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,809
I have to step it up then.

112
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,620
It's Friday night, so it'll take a while.

113
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,690
If it turns out to be nothing,

114
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,310
you're dead.

115
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,740
How long have you been dating?

116
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,410
I mean Lee Jae-shin.

117
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,670
Don't speak of him so lightly.

118
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,920
And we're not like that.

119
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,570
I hope it's not like that between you two.

120
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,360
Are you quitting your job?

121
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,330
Is this the real you?

122
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,370
If you're leaving, go quietly.

123
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,070
Don't you know that it's a small world?

124
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,200
More than six months,

125
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,320
I guess.

126
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,070
Forget it, stop the car.

127
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,850
What the hell are you doing?

128
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,830
I can't stand by and
watch you being mistreated.

129
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,310
Who mistreated me?

130
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,520
Alright, let's say I'm being mistreated.

131
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,740
So what? Who are you?

132
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,110
Who do you think you are to butt in?

133
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,530
I'm nothing.

134
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,720
That's right. You're nothing...

135
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,750
I like you.

136
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,850
What?

137
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,940
I said I like you.

138
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,050
Do you want me to repeat?

139
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,390
Is this a confession?

140
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,020
You're foolish
if you still don't get it by now.

141
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,950
By the way, you are a fool.

142
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,910
-Chae Hyun-seung.
-Have you two talked about marriage?

143
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,410
Why?

144
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,650
Do you want to break us up?

145
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,590
You think I'll run to you then?

146
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,220
If you know what a scum he is...

147
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,460
Have you ever considered me romantically?

148
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,490
Ever?

149
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,870
Why would I?

150
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,490
And why are you being so incoherent?

151
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,740
I like you.

152
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,770
That's rude, right?

153
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,140
Where are we going?

154
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,640
We're almost there.

155
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,490
Good,

156
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,180
we'll arrive before them.

157
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,420
Get out of the car.

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,180
Why are we here?

159
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,710
-What do you want...
-This is mine.

160
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,740
I'm trying to impress you.

161
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,300
I guess you're not interested in wealth.

162
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,980
Excuse me for a second.

163
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,370
We're not late, are we?

164
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,640
No, you aren't.

165
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,110
I'll knock on the door when they come.

166
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm sorry

167
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,860
for doing it in such a way.

168
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,030
So?

169
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,830
What do I have to see here?

170
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,790
You need a chance.

171
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,520
A chance to stand up for yourself.

172
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,120
(You were turned down for sure.)

173
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,400
Compared to what you'll face
in the near future,

174
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,070
this is nothing.

175
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,660
What do you think you're doing?

176
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,330
I can't stand by and
watch you being mistreated.

177
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,960
Who mistreated me?

178
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,920
I know it's cruel.

179
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,430
You'd rather want me
to look the other way.

180
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,560
But

181
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,270
I can't bear it.

182
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,570
Please have a seat.

183
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,470
Just a moment.

184
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,430
Don't avoid it.

185
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,270
Senior Yoon.

186
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,050
Lee Hyo-joo,

187
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,300
she's the chairman's granddaughter

188
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,550
and Director Lee's sister.

189
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,090
Who did you say she is?

190
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,730
I thought they were cousins,

191
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,560
but apparently, they aren't.

192
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,830
No, that's not true.

193
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,330
No way.

194
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,820
Senior Yoon,

195
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,030
what are you saying?

196
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,140
You still refuse to believe it now?

197
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,340
You still think they are cousins?

198
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,930
Don't talk nonsense
if you don't know anything.

199
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,960
I don't know anything? What should I know?

200
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,340
That he is stabbing you in the back?

201
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,770
Or the fact that he's getting married
in two months,

202
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,660
and yet he's still
fooling around with you?

203
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,910
Are you this stupid?

204
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,420
Watch your mouth
if you don't know anything!

205
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,330
Ma'am, would you like to try the dress on?

206
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,060
Yes, I'd like to.

207
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,960
Come with us, sir.

208
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,330
Okay.

209
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,060
This way.

210
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,530
What do you think? Pretty?

211
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,670
Yes, it's pretty.

212
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,280
Do you like it, ma'am?

213
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,110
Yes, I love it.

214
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,680
Their first reservation
was made six months ago.

215
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,550
Clearly, they've been dating
longer than that.

216
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,430
Stop denying it like a fool.

217
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,290
Look after yourself first.

218
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,810
That's your job from now on.

219
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,570
What are you going to do?

220
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,840
Are you going to turn the place
upside down?

221
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,890
You told me to face the facts.

222
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,520
Move, this is how I do things.

223
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Think it through before you do anything.

224
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,850
Then what?

225
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,220
What should I do?

226
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,360
Should I write up a script
and rehearse before I go?

227
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,770
If I do that,

228
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,770
will that make me feel less of a fool?

229
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,100
I helped you, but it doesn't mean
it's right to do so.

230
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,070
She's going to hate me so much.

231
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,660
Aren't you prepared for that already?

232
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,230
I am,

233
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,400
but I'm still afraid.

234
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,710
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

235
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,890
I'd like to get to know you more,

236
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,200
but perhaps some other time.

237
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,090
Take care.

238
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,070
I'll take you home.

239
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,570
You might not notice,

240
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,290
but I'm really scared right now.

241
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,900
Senior Yoon.

242
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,550
You said you like me, right?

243
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,510
I'll give you my answer now.

244
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,900
Don't.

245
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,730
Who do you think you are?

246
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,550
Why would you do such a thing?

247
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,670
You should've let me be.

248
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,890
Whether I look like
a complete fool or not,

249
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,810
you should've at least
let me keep my dignity.

250
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,330
Listen carefully,

251
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,990
don't ever interfere

252
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,290
in my business or his business.

253
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,530
Get lost.

254
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,600
Go inside.

255
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,480
You must be tired. Get some rest.

256
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,020
-What?
-It suddenly seems real

257
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,250
that we're really getting married.

258
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,790
Jae-shin,

259
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,610
can I ask you something?

260
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,690
Who was your first love?

261
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,000
First love?

262
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,130
I know everything about you
except for that.

263
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,200
You must've had a first love.

264
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,250
Although I've never seen you date anyone,

265
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,670
you had one, right?

266
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,330
Wait, you really did?

267
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,820
Who was it?

268
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,330
Was she prettier than me? When was it?

269
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,150
Go inside.

270
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,980
Jae-woon must be waiting.

271
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,530
Never mind.

272
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,050
What's important is that
you're marrying me.

273
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,310
I will never let you go.

274
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,060
(I'm sorry, but about tonight...)

275
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,690
Director Lee said we have to go somewhere,

276
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,410
but I forgot.

277
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,790
(Is it something important?)

278
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,700
(Yes, it's work. I can't get out of it.)

279
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,380
(I'm really sorry.)

280
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,190
Alright, he got it.

281
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,630
How did the dress shopping go?

282
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,210
That'll make them share the lead.

283
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,120
Be cautious. Yes, that's it.

284
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,060
Don't you have any dinner plans?

285
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,460
-Huh?
-I'm warning you.

286
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,660
If you ask Jae-shin to hang out with you
after we get married,

287
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,260
I'm going to kill you.

288
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,120
Man, that's harsh.

289
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,230
Who am I supposed to hang out with?

290
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,680
Figure that out on your own.

291
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,570
Make friends or start dating.

292
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,700
Making friends will be a lot faster.

293
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,490
What? Hey,

294
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,270
I think you've misunderstood me.

295
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,260
It's not that I can't date,
it's just that I don't want to.

296
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,320
Yeah, whatever.

297
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,820
What do you mean? You know I...

298
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,600
Forget it.

299
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,370
You only have eyes for Jae-shin anyway.

300
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,920
Jae-shin is the only man
in the world, isn't it?

301
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,620
It's been so ever since we were kids.

302
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,170
What are you trying to say?

303
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,270
Don't just think about yourself.

304
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,240
Think about Jae-shin too.

305
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,190
Love and marriage involve two people.

306
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,700
Did Jae-shin say I'm wearing him out?

307
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,640
No, he didn't, but...

308
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,330
That's enough then.

309
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,190
Even though you're my brother,
you've gone too far.

310
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,500
You're home.

311
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,550
Yikes.

312
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,630
I'm not coming back tonight.

313
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,640
Hey! What's wrong? Hey!

314
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,090
You can't enter without permission.

315
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,010
Just a moment.

316
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,510
-No, you can't.
-I'm sorry.

317
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,620
-Let him in.
-Yes, sir.

318
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,690
You're here.

319
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,210
How is she?

320
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,850
She was found just in time.

321
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,590
She's relentless. She took some pills.

322
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,870
Jae-shin, there's no other way.

323
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,560
My sister...

324
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,640
Could you please accept her?

325
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,330
She said she can't live without you.

326
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,630
Please, I'm begging you.

327
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,830
(Calling...)
(Leader Yoon from Support Team)

328
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,380
(Aunt)

329
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,600
What's going on?

330
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,540
What happened? Why are you here?

331
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,050
Is it because of your mom?

332
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,260
Did she call and nag you?

333
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,450
Or is it about work?

334
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,090
Did a subcontractor mess up again?

335
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,010
Hey!

336
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,150
Right, you should've held back.

337
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,890
I should've held back from the start.

338
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,650
I should've pretended not to know.

339
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,180
I feel like I hurt her even more.

340
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,960
Either way, she would've gotten hurt.

341
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,850
As you said,

342
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,670
it's not bad that she has a choice now.

343
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,960
That's why I didn't stop you.

344
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,500
I hope she's not in too much pain.

345
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,340
She won't

346
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,170
and so you should wait for her.

347
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,940
Wait until she makes her choice.

348
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,470
(1 kill)

349
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,400
(1 kill)

350
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,530
How about this?

351
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,510
-No.
-No?

352
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,320
Wow, Ha-eun. This is so pretty.

353
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,840
Oh? No again?

354
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,000
Then...

355
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,160
So princessy!

356
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,140
You like it?

357
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,600
We'll take this.

358
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,400
Come this way.

359
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,270
That girl.

360
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,530
She insisted that you pick out her outfit,

361
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,280
not knowing that I'm more fashionable.

362
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,530
Why is she making such a fuss?

363
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,530
Why else would she do it? It's for a boy.

364
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,190
A boy?

365
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,430
Her crush is throwing a birthday party.

366
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,640
The funny thing is,
she plays hard to get with him.

367
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,470
That squirt already knows how to flirt.

368
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,570
Get your act together.

369
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,480
-Huh?
-Even that little kid knows what to do.

370
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,560
-What are you doing?
-Why is she taking so long?

371
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,800
Ha-eun! It's your aunt.

372
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,160
Gosh.

373
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,170
Let's call Hyun-seung
and have a meal together.

374
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,710
He's probably cooped up at home.

375
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,240
Next time.

376
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,660
Let's eat next time

377
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,520
Why? Didn't you say you are free today?

378
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,610
An important client is
coming in without notice.

379
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,830
Is it? I'll eat with Hyun-seung then.

380
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,030
He seemed tired.

381
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,870
Did you two talk without me again?

382
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,770
He popped into my head
while I was coming here.

383
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,240
He drank until late last night.

384
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,700
Why? A company get-together?

385
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,210
Yes, that's why.

386
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,820
You know I hate it
when you two leave me out

387
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,810
and share secrets, right?

388
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,010
Of course.

389
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,560
So, if you don't want me to be mad,

390
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,670
don't go behind my back.

391
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,340
Alright.

392
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,220
Anyway, let's have a meal
together next time.

393
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,640
-What about a cup of coffee?
-Sure, I can do that.

394
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,340
Go ahead.
I have to buy something real quick.

395
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,020
Which do you prefer among the two colors?

396
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,490
I think crystal gold is a lot better.

397
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,390
-Do you want a color test?
-Yes.

398
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,140
-I'll do it lightly.
-Okay.

399
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,780
-It's so pretty.
-It looks really good on you.

400
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,120
-What's the color of the pink one?
-I'll show you.

401
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,280
-Really?
-You have bright complexion.

402
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,830
You need a lighter color.

403
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,110
Manager.

404
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,300
Yes, sir.

405
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,510
Good work so far.

406
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,140
Thank you.

407
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,640
Here, take the staff to dinner.

408
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,630
Director Lee!

409
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,510
I put in a lot, so go to
a place with beef BBQ.

410
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,440
Thank you.

411
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,200
Everything's fine at the shop, right?

412
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,110
Okay, I'll get there sooner
than I planned.

413
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,969
Hello, it's been so long.

414
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,969
How may I help you?

415
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,360
Do you, by any chance, have this?

416
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,940
Oh, it's a limited edition.
It's all sold out now, ma'am.

417
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,100
I see, so you can't get it?

418
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,969
No, I can't.

419
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,940
It sold so well that
it was sold out in a week.

420
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:58,400
You can't find it anywhere
in the country now.

421
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,550
It's okay then.

422
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,890
Would you like me to
recommend a similar color?

423
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,380
The new one is really pretty.

424
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,710
Maybe later, I still have some left.

425
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,120
-Thank you.
-No problem.

426
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,020
I'll get it for you

427
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,430
even if I have to make it myself.

428
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,150
Here's my number.

429
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,470
(Director Lee Jae-woon)

430
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,670
No, it's okay.

431
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,030
What?

432
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,630
You don't think much of me, is it?

433
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,630
It's a first for me, right?

434
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,160
See you next time.

435
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,310
Yes, ma'am. Goodbye.

436
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,380
A regular customer?

437
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,090
Yes, she's a regular customer.

438
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,940
Her phone number

439
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,680
is personal info, so I guess no.

440
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,600
She's my type.

441
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,810
(You should've let me be.)

442
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,360
Even if I look like a complete fool,

443
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,660
you should've at least
let me keep my dignity.

444
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,320
(Listen carefully.)

445
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,430
(Don't ever interfere.)

446
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,270
(Aunt)

447
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,970
Can you engrave this?

448
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
It's our second anniversary.

449
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,790
Of course.

450
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,770
Write it down here.

451
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:21,140
(Always with you)

452
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,520
(What's wrong?)
(Call me when you see the text.)

453
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:38,610
(You have one missed call from Aunt.)

454
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,030
(Did something happen?)
(You have one missed call from Aunt.)

455
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,320
(Call me when you see my text.)

456
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,560
(I hope she's not in too much pain.)

457
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,300
(She won't)

458
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,090
(and so you should wait for her.)

459
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,210
(Wait until she makes her choice.)

460
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,140
-Good morning, sir.
-Hello.

461
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,420
There's no signature here...

462
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,490
Alright.

463
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,570
-Good morning.
-Hello.

464
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,960
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

465
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,900
Hello.

466
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,380
-Hello.
-Good morning.

467
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,220
Miss, aren't you going to kindergarten?

468
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,860
You'll be late.

469
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,600
Mom, I want to go there.

470
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,590
Where?

471
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,880
Dad's friend's restaurant,
where we went last time.

472
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,050
Chef Ryu's place?

473
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,760
Okay.

474
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,050
With Jae-young's family.

475
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,500
What?

476
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,140
Is this a meeting with the in-laws?

477
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,630
Call Jae-young's mom and arrange it, okay?

478
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,020
Ha-eun!

479
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,670
Bye.

480
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,560
I'm coming!

481
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,650
And the other foot.

482
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,700
All done, okay.

483
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,740
See you later.

484
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,790
-Have a great day.
-Okay.

485
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,250
Bye!

486
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,190
Like mother, like daughter.

487
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,700
Hello, the team code is B21530.

488
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,430
It's going to Yeoksam-dong.

489
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,100
I'll do that...

490
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,190
That's heavy, let me...

491
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,630
Next.

492
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,150
Next.

493
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,870
Next.

494
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,990
Okay, send these three as the final ones.

495
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,220
The last ones are definitely better.

496
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,120
These three were taken last, right?

497
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,990
It's because he fell for me.

498
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,920
You know what people say.

499
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,460
The best photos are taken

500
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,150
when the photographer fell in love
with the subject.

501
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,620
But I think in a different way.

502
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,650
The subject must love the photographer

503
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,580
in order to get a good picture.

504
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,140
So you did that to the model on purpose?

505
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,300
Get it now? It's my secret.

506
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,480
Man.

507
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,240
Does that always work?

508
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,490
I haven't failed once.

509
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,060
If you want something,

510
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,420
it doesn't matter how you get it

511
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,670
as long as you get it.

512
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,080
BM Lee, let's go for lunch.

513
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,620
Come on.

514
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,810
Let's go for lunch too.

515
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,400
I'm so hungry. Let's go.

516
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,870
How are you getting taller? Incredible.

517
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,220
Sir,

518
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,910
I have a lunch appointment.

519
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,740
Okay, have a good one.

520
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,590
Enjoy your lunch!

521
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,500
Sir, did something good happen?

522
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:36,690
Is it obvious?

523
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,380
What happened?

524
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,730
How about we all go to lunch together?

525
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,920
It's my treat.

526
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,990
Sounds great, sir!

527
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,980
-What do you want?
-Beef BBQ.

528
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,230
She's a beef maniac.

529
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,160
Okay then. Beef. Where should we go?

530
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,320
Let's go.

531
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,210
Ma'am, I have an appointment.

532
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,820
Okay, enjoy your lunch.

533
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,150
You too.

534
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,720
(Mom)

535
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,340
I left my wallet.

536
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,660
(Your call cannot be connected...)

537
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,100
She never picks up right away, that girl.

538
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,230
Stop calling and just text her then.

539
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,250
She must be busy at work.

540
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,030
It's lunchtime.

541
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,460
Since she said she's busy all the time,

542
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,420
I only call her outside office hours,

543
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,230
but she never picks up.

544
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,990
She's bad, right?

545
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,310
What's the matter this time?

546
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,850
The thing is,

547
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,810
I put the blouse I bought in the closet.

548
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,640
But it has vanished into thin air.

549
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,100
Where could it have gone?

550
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,940
Why would Song-ah know about that?

551
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,130
She doesn't live here.

552
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,330
She might know.

553
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,260
She might have taken it.

554
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,240
That girl.

555
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,970
She abandons her mother to live her dream.

556
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:10,350
She's not dating, is she?

557
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,770
She can't.

558
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,310
Why? Dating is good.

559
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,190
Good, my butt.

560
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:20,250
It's not good at all.

561
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,850
Fighting wears you out,
and breakups are hard.

562
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,330
Why would she do that?

563
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,070
It's an absolute no-no.

564
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,920
Should she live alone forever?

565
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,200
She won't be alone. She has me.

566
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,790
We'll live happily together.

567
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,540
Living happily is already
out of the equation.

568
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:42,580
Anyway, she'd better not be dating.

569
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,810
What do you think? Is it good?

570
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,400
It's supposed to be a nice place.

571
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,750
It's really good, sir!

572
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,140
The meat just melts in my mouth.

573
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,810
You know I'm always
grateful to KLAR, right?

574
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,990
I'm proud of BM Lee and the KLAR Team.

575
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,740
Thank you.

576
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:12,520
By the way, is it difficult to reproduce
a discontinued product?

577
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,250
What's the item?

578
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,090
It's lipstick.

579
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,130
It's a limited edition,
but it's still in demand.

580
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,480
What do you think, General Manager Yoo?

581
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,910
It's different with every item.

582
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,730
If it's a limited edition,
it might not be easy.

583
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,240
All you have to do is
to produce the color.

584
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,780
Is that hard?

585
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,950
The whole line
might have been discontinued.

586
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:37,160
The container of lipstick
changes depending on the texture.

587
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,580
We have to check the product first.

588
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,570
Has it been discontinued for a long time?

589
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,290
I don't think so.

590
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,220
Don't worry too much then.

591
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,470
General Manager Yoo can

592
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,060
do anything, but this time...

593
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,730
I'll talk with the team and report to you.

594
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Okay.

595
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,030
Let me know if you need anything.

596
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,110
Let's do a big event when we re-launch it,

597
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,790
so people can't help but buy it.

598
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,390
Make it happen
as soon as possible, BM Lee.

599
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,190
Yes, sir.

600
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,740
Do you want anything more to eat?

601
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,480
Can I order one more piece of steak?

602
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,170
How was lunch?

603
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,540
It was so good.

604
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,910
Thank you, sir.

605
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,620
-I trust you'll work hard now.
-Yes, sir.

606
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,560
BM Lee, a word.

607
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,660
Did you have a good lunch, Song-ah?

608
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,370
Yes. How about you?

609
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,260
It would've been good if you were there.

610
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,670
Director Lee bought us steaks.

611
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,660
You had to tell her that?

612
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,500
ABM Yoon Song-ah,

613
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,150
see me in the meeting room.

614
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,840
You don't look so good.

615
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,790
Is there something wrong?

616
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,180
I just don't feel well.

617
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,560
Did you catch a cold?

618
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,180
You have a fever?

619
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,040
We're at work.

620
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,140
It's the first time you're so sick
that you couldn't even pick up the phone.

621
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,800
Right.

622
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:39,740
Director Lee wants to reproduce
a limited edition lipstick.

623
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,320
It's possible, right?

624
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,460
I'll look into it.

625
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,550
Do it when you have time.

626
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,150
Don't overwork yourself.

627
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,080
I'll set a separate budget,

628
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,770
so think about how to promote it.

629
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,400
I'll report to you when I'm ready.

630
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,100
Did I...

631
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,520
Did I do something wrong?

632
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,900
(Large meeting room)

633
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,910
Are you free after work today?
(Large meeting room)

634
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:15,380
Are you free after work today?

635
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,250
You play tennis, right?

636
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,200
I'd like to play with you sometime.

637
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,620
Show me what you've got.

638
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,340
Are you really up for a match?

639
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,900
Sure, let's set a date.

640
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,040
Weekend is better, right?

641
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:27,270
It's better for me,
but I don't know about you.

642
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,170
You seem extremely busy on the weekends.

643
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,950
I don't have a lot of free time,

644
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,030
but I have time for tennis.

645
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,920
Let's go for a game then.

646
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,520
I won't go easy on you.

647
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,490
I look forward to that.

648
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,750
How do you feel?

649
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,870
You're upset because of me, right?

650
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,550
Did you do something to upset me?

651
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,360
Men are usually like that.

652
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,930
We do something wrong
without realizing it.

653
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,280
I'm no different. I'm an ordinary guy.

654
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,320
Should we tell people
that we're dating now?

655
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,390
You mean at work?

656
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,140
At work or to your friends.

657
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,640
Director Lee still doesn't know
we're dating, right?

658
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,900
You know he's not my real friend.

659
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,630
Besides, we're dating at work.

660
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,270
People will frown upon it.

661
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,470
It'll make you uncomfortable too.

662
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,400
What if I say I'm okay with it?

663
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,660
Why?

664
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,430
Why the sudden change of heart?

665
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,610
I want to be confident about it.

666
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,180
I don't want to be hidden all the time.

667
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,540
It's been two years.

668
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,180
We're not dating casually, are we?

669
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,140
No, it's not a casual relationship.

670
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,140
But do you have to do this right now?

671
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,440
It's kind of sudden for me.

672
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,110
There's no reason for us
to rush into this.

673
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,770
How long are you going
to keep this a secret?

674
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,420
Song-ah,

675
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,280
I'll think about it.

676
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,620
Give me some time.

677
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:22,980
Okay.

678
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:39,120
(You selfish little douchebag,)

679
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:39,620
(did you completely lose your mind?)

680
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,670
(Otaku Girl's Intervention)
(did you completely lose your mind?)

681
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:40,680
(did you completely lose your mind?)

682
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,350
(Speechless. Did you completely
lose your mind?)
(did you completely lose your mind?)

683
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:43,790
(You're getting married in two months!)

684
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:44,930
(You're getting married in two months!)
(You're getting married in two months!)

685
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,040
(You're getting married in two months!)

686
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,180
When is he going to fess up?

687
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,740
(If the relationship is serious enough,
just tell her then!)

688
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,500
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
If the relationship is serious enough,)
(If the relationship is serious enough,
just tell her then!)

689
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:53,510
(If the relationship is serious enough,
just tell her then!)

690
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,390
(you have to tell her!)
(If the relationship is serious enough,
just tell her then!)

691
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,110
(If the relationship is serious enough,
just tell her then!)

692
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,900
(Wrap things up as soon as possible
and confess.)

693
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,200
(You should know that
this is the best for her.)

694
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,160
-(Why?)
-Geez.

695
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,410
(Douchebags like you don't have it.)

696
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,720
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
Douchebags like you are inconsiderate.)
(Douchebags like you don't have it.)

697
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,160
(No considerate DNA in the bone.)
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
Douchebags like you are inconsiderate.)

698
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:11,700
(No common courtesy.)

699
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,220
(No common courtesy.)
(No common courtesy.)

700
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:13,690
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
You worthless piece of trash!)

701
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,230
You worthless piece of trash!
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
You worthless piece of trash!)

702
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:16,460
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
You worthless piece of trash!)

703
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,910
(Gosh! (Shooting anger for 3 seconds))

704
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,560
That scumbag.

705
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,250
(Anyway, come to your senses.)

706
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,810
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
Get your act together, okay?)
(Anyway, come to your senses.)

707
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:24,280
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
Get your act together, okay?)

708
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:24,980
(Okay?)
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
Get your act together, okay?)

709
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:25,480
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
Don't dig your own grave.)

710
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,980
(Don't dig your own grave.)
(Otaku Girl's Intervention:
Don't dig your own grave.)

711
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:28,730
(Thank the angels and break it off.)

712
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:33,740
(Thank the angels and break it off.)
(Thank the angels and break it off.)

713
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:34,830
(Break it off)

714
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:34,890
(It's so frustrating....)

715
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,130
(This is so frustrating.)
(It's so frustrating....)

716
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:36,990
(It's so frustrating....)

717
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:37,030
(Next story!)
(It's so frustrating....)

718
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,950
(I'm so angry. Next story!)
(Next story!)

719
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,360
(Should we tell people
that we're dating now?)

720
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,980
(But do you have to do this right now?)

721
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,700
It's kind of sudden for me.

722
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,650
There's no reason for us
to rush into this.

723
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,030
(How long are you going
to keep this a secret?)

724
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,060
I'll think about it.

725
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,390
Give me some time.

726
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,140
(Mom)

727
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,100
I want to go on vacation.

728
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,470
You say that all the time.

729
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:50,450
I haven't gone once.

730
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,970
Yes, you have.

731
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,120
Why are you getting mad?

732
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,160
Can't I go on a vacation?

733
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,320
It's just that...

734
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,810
Assistant Manager Jung
always bosses me around.

735
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:03,840
Thank you!

736
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,000
Hey, what's up with Hyun-seung?

737
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,920
Why is he acting all moody?

738
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,510
He got dumped.

739
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,210
Who? You?

740
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,320
Come on.

741
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,200
Do I look like one who gets dumped?

742
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,000
No, sir. Not me.

743
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,670
Yes, sir. Especially you.

744
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,180
Whoa, wait.

745
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,990
No one's said that to me before.

746
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,310
I'm so hurt right now.

747
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,600
Ouch.

748
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,390
Let me ask you a real question.

749
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,290
Why do you guys hang out with him?

750
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,840
We're not hanging out.

751
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,840
He's hanging out by himself.

752
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,720
Why don't we play a game then?

753
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,840
One hangs out. Two hang out.

754
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,620
Three hang out. Four hang out.

755
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,070
-Hey.
-Three hang out. Two hang out.

756
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,810
Fine, I'll stop.

757
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,190
I'm sorry, I'll take my leave now.

758
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,030
How can you make him leave?

759
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,980
Next time, just stay at home.

760
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,970
Hey, was that my fault?

761
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:09,840
Was it my fault?

762
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,660
No.

763
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,900
(Mom)

764
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,530
What?

765
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:50,020
Why did you call?

766
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,590
(Why don't you ever pick up?)

767
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:54,790
Where are you?

768
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,310
Are you home?

769
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,780
Have you eaten?

770
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,130
I asked if you've eaten.

771
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,220
Hello?

772
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,400
Song-ah, are you there?

773
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,380
(Sweetie, are you still there?)

774
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,310
What's up with her?

775
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,830
Are you with a guy?

776
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,740
Are you really with a guy?

777
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,240
Why are you doing this to me?

778
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,700
Huh? What?

779
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,390
(Why are you doing this to me?)

780
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,390
(What is she talking about?)

781
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,510
(What did I do to you?)

782
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,550
How could you do this to me?

783
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,560
(What?)

784
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,460
Do I mean nothing to you? Huh?

785
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,860
(Is she drunk?)

786
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,200
What am I to you?

787
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,000
What did I do?

788
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,290
What did I do wrong
to make you treat me like this?

789
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,650
Huh?

790
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:12,010
Why in the world are you doing this to me?

791
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,880
Song-ah, sweetie.

792
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:20,820
Are you crying?

793
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:43,180
(Dalmaji Park)

794
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:16,090
(You need a chance.)

795
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,350
A chance to stand up for yourself.

796
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,800
Look after yourself first.

797
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,180
That's your job from now on.

798
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,460
Think it through before you do anything.

799
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,790
Then what?

800
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,320
What should I do?

801
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,920
Should I write up a script,
and rehearse before I go?

802
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,690
(If I do that,)

803
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,300
(will it make me feel less of a fool?)

804
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:03,900
Chae Hyun-seung,

805
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,620
tell me.

806
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,520
What should I do?

807
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,240
If I don't do it my way,

808
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:38,080
what should I do to get back at him?

809
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,340
To that jerk who made me an idiot.

810
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,740
If I tell you the way,

811
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,730
are you going to do it?

812
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,880
Just tell me.

813
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,790
Do it with me.

814
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,270
Date me,

815
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,260
Senior Yoon.

816
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,170
