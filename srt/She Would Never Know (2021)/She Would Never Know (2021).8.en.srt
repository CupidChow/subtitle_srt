1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,890
(All places, characters, firms and events
depicted in this show are fictitious.)

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,410
Sir,

3
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,880
I need to go to the basement.

4
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,270
Okay.

5
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,640
An announcement about the Europe Project
will be released soon.

6
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,680
Don't worry, your name isn't on the list.

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,050
I'm running KLAR as well as
the Europe Project,

8
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,310
so we'll still run into each other.

9
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,319
But don't mind me.

10
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,150
Be patient for a couple of months.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,289
You don't have to mind me either.

12
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,789
I'm okay.

13
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,930
This will be the last time
we talk privately.

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,070
Don't mention the past again.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Let bygones be bygones.

16
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,710
Don't worry.

17
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,030
That's what I want too.

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,720
Okay.

19
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,820
Why are you two together?

20
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,140
Let's go, Senior Yoon.

21
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,290
You can go now.

22
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,690
You're busy. Get back to work.

23
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,430
Okay.

24
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,810
By the way,

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,730
what you said earlier...

26
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,660
Oh, that?

27
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,270
Actually, I saw her at the store before.

28
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,170
At the store?

29
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,030
Yes.

30
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,010
I thought she was a store employee.

31
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,110
When I saw you together,
I was surprised, so...

32
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,620
Is she an HQ employee?

33
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,110
Is she your subordinate?

34
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,480
Yes, she's on my team.

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,500
Then who's the man?

36
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,890
Are they dating?

37
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,790
Yes.

38
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,400
I see.

39
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,470
They look good together.

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,970
I'll get going now.

41
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,410
Drive safely.

42
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,210
Okay.

43
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,070
(Episode 8)

44
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,070
I'm so tired.

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
You must be tired, Manager Ahn.

46
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,210
I've prepared a piping hot cup of coffee.

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Thank you.

48
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,350
-It's sweet and delicious.
-Right?

49
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,150
Call me whenever you're tired.

50
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,270
-Okay.
-Good.

51
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,360
This is so good.

52
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,970
So good.

53
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,400
Oh, my gosh. How can I carry this?

54
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,570
It looks so heavy.

55
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,520
I'll carry it!

56
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,540
I'll carry it, Manager Ahn.

57
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,870
-Oh.
-It's heavy.

58
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,010
You don't have to do it.
It goes in the mailroom.

59
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,680
Oh, the mailroom.

60
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,550
Hurry!

61
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,750
Okay.

62
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,250
Song-ah?

63
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,230
You're leaving?

64
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes.

65
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,270
Take care.

66
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,240
Hyun-seung!

67
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,740
Did something happen
between you and Manager Ahn?

68
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,040
Manager Ahn?

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,410
Did you make a mistake?

70
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,850
Why are you walking on eggshells
around her?

71
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,720
Nothing happened.

72
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,650
Really?

73
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,090
How far are you going to go?

74
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,200
Sorry. What I did back there...

75
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,510
It's okay.

76
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,840
You don't have to make excuses.

77
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
You did it to help me.

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Senior Yoon...

79
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,220
You should go inside.

80
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,290
What about you?

81
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,290
I have an urgent business.

82
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,600
You go up first.

83
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay then.

84
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,170
-See you later.
-Okay.

85
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,590
I owe her something.

86
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,160
-You owe her?
-Yes, but...

87
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,790
The elevator door is closing.

88
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,330
Okay then.

89
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,050
-Don't work too late.
-I won't.

90
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,060
See you tomorrow.

91
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,850
Yikes!

92
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,620
Manager Ahn!

93
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,980
How could I not know about that?

94
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,190
It's right before my eyes
and yet I couldn't tell.

95
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,909
My goodness! Your crush is Song...

96
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,990
No!

97
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,880
Manager Ahn!

98
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,000
Anyway, you're lucky I caught you.

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,260
If it was someone else,

100
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,270
the entire company
would've been in an uproar.

101
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,270
If you need anything,
please tell me at any time.

102
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,540
You like her so much.

103
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,570
I feel sorry for you.

104
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,410
I'm always rooting for you, Hyun-seung.

105
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,950
First floor!

106
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,250
Oh!

107
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,250
First floor!

108
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,750
First floor.

109
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,090
Go for it!

110
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,590
Goodbye.

111
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,550
(Lee Jae-woon)

112
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,480
(So when are we going to meet?)
(Lee Jae-woon)

113
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,820
I didn't know I'd see you this soon.

114
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,710
I was just asking,

115
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,530
and you said you haven't had dinner.

116
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,300
But

117
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,770
you've hardly eaten anything.

118
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,440
Oh, right, I...

119
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,810
You don't have to force yourself.

120
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,310
You'll upset your stomach.

121
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,080
Are you upset?

122
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,380
Because I lied about not having dinner?

123
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,250
I prefer a man who doesn't lie.

124
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,420
Okay, I'll never lie to you again.

125
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,060
Even if it's trivial.

126
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,730
Do you always try to
please other people like this?

127
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,230
No, I'm only doing it for you.

128
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,470
By the way,

129
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,340
what do you do?

130
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,740
I make clothes.

131
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,710
What kind of clothes?
There are so many kinds of them.

132
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,990
Wedding dresses.

133
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,880
I took over my mother's shop.

134
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,040
I see.

135
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,350
Too bad. If I had known earlier,

136
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,720
I'd ask you to make
my sister's wedding dress.

137
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,620
No, I'd better not.

138
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,730
Her temper is so...

139
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,460
I think I made a mistake.

140
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,000
What?

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,390
A bad-tempered sister-in-law

142
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,160
is a turn-off, right?

143
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,740
This is only the first time
we're eating together.

144
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,950
You're right.

145
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,830
Go on and eat.

146
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,580
I'll drink cold water and get a grip.

147
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,420
Excuse me! Can I get some cold water?

148
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,690
Right.

149
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,030
We don't know about each other's age yet.

150
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,560
I'm 37 years old.

151
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
Two years apart then.

152
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,040
You're 39 years old?

153
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,170
Who?

154
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,380
Then...

155
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,950
35 years old?

156
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,650
Yes.

157
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,520
Huh?

158
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,620
Why are you flustered?

159
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,380
There's no reason for it.

160
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,120
Oh, I like this place.

161
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,400
But you don't like me?

162
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,880
Go away.

163
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,480
Hello? Where's the owner?

164
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,790
Get behind me.

165
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,390
Hi, sweetie. Why are you here alone?

166
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,460
Seung-ah!

167
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,930
I'm sorry, I lost my grip.

168
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,670
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,570
It's okay.

170
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,070
Goodbye!

171
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,290
Are you alright?

172
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,120
Oh, I...

173
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,020
I'm still scared.

174
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,660
There are so many dogs here.

175
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,020
Let's go.

176
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,340
This dish looks good.

177
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,610
So you can do it this way.

178
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,490
Are you watching something fun?

179
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,550
Huh?

180
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,690
Is it more fun than what I'm watching?

181
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,560
I want to watch too.

182
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,800
Are you really watching this?

183
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,940
Yes, I'm watching this.

184
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,410
It can't be.

185
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,040
It looked like it was so much fun.

186
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,440
Time for bed, Ha-eun!

187
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,980
Dad!

188
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,350
What are you working on so hard?

189
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,480
I told you.

190
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,740
Chef Ryu and I are
working on a cooking class.

191
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,590
I'm looking for references.

192
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,510
Take it easy. You must be tired.

193
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,020
Don't worry, I'll take care of myself.

194
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,920
Tuck Ha-eun in for me.

195
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,500
Right, Ha-eun.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,070
Good night, Mom!

197
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,100
Good night, sweetie!

198
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,170
Let's go.

199
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,950
Your uterine myoma has grown.

200
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,020
It's grown?

201
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,560
It used to be the same.

202
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,110
You said you've been
feeling pain recently?

203
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,120
And there's some bleeding?

204
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,190
I came because my lower belly hurt more.

205
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,390
It looks like

206
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,310
it's suddenly grown bigger recently.

207
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,230
It's a low chance,

208
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,810
but we should perform surgery
and take a biopsy of it.

209
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,250
Then is it...

210
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,280
Is it cancer?

211
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,040
(I can't say for sure.)

212
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
(Let's perform surgery first.)

213
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
(Daughter)

214
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,290
Wait!

215
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,480
No...

216
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,570
(Recruiting New Marketers
for KLAR Cosmetics)

217
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,780
Senior Yoon! I'll do it.

218
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,250
Will you?

219
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,080
Yes.

220
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,810
Thanks.

221
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,230
We're set to go, right?

222
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,100
Yes, I think so.

223
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,400
Wow, this place brings back memories.

224
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,270
It seems like only yesterday
I saw you here.

225
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,360
Indeed.

226
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,710
It feels strange seeing you here.

227
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,410
I didn't know I'd see you again.

228
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,080
Thanks for what you did back then.

229
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,680
You brought me something to eat.

230
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,720
I was so hungry at that time,
I was about to go crazy.

231
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,990
I would've snapped off a desk leg
and gnawed it down.

232
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,460
A desk leg?

233
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,900
Oh, a desk leg.

234
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,600
I missed out on a good show.

235
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,470
Gnawing on a desk leg
sounds like a circus act.

236
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,740
You'll make this noise when you eat it.

237
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,460
A circus act?

238
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,980
Yes.

239
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,540
It's not too late.

240
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,210
Want me to snap off a desk leg
and beat you with it?

241
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,220
Come in, please.

242
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,790
Stop joking...

243
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,940
Hello.

244
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,560
You should've believed me.

245
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,390
Shut up.

246
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,020
-Sit here.
-Hi, please come in.

247
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,300
Come over here, please.

248
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,340
Oh, you brought your papers?

249
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,700
Read this carefully,

250
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,940
and ask me what you'd like to know.

251
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,109
This is my business card.

252
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,780
Thank you.

253
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,599
Read this carefully,

254
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,380
and take your time to ask me questions.

255
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,950
Okay.

256
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,980
Something good is going on?

257
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,829
Huh? Nothing.

258
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,329
Right!

259
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,870
You know about it, right?

260
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,640
About what?

261
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,540
Song-ah and Hyun-seung!

262
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,440
They are busted?

263
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,510
So busted.

264
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,080
If you know it, you should've told me.

265
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
I almost set Hyun-seung
up on a blind date.

266
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,580
How could I? They are dating secretly.

267
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,490
Dating? What do you mean?

268
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,790
You said you know.

269
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,690
I do.

270
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,390
About Hyun-seung's crush.

271
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,000
What?

272
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,590
It's a crush?

273
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,870
They're dating?

274
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,900
Aren't they flirting?

275
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,310
Crush.

276
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,640
Aren't they dating?

277
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,810
Flirting?

278
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,120
I can't believe the first day
is so hectic this year.

279
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,850
It's not usually like this, right?

280
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,110
Usually, the last day is the busiest day.

281
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,390
What about lunch? Where should we go?

282
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,430
Have you been to the cafeteria?

283
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,400
No. Is it good?

284
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,700
Not bad. Let's go there.

285
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,430
Okay.

286
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,240
This way.

287
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,950
Chae Hyun-seung!

288
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,550
It's really you.

289
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,790
Long time no see.

290
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,890
Yes, it's been a while.

291
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,730
What are you doing here?

292
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,770
Are you here for the campus recruiting?

293
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,600
Yes.

294
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,570
Me too.

295
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,160
I'll go on ahead.

296
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,410
No, Senior Yoon.

297
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,780
Let's go together.

298
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,580
We're going somewhere.

299
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,220
Sorry. See you when the day's over.

300
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
You're at KLAR, right? I'll go find you.

301
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,620
I have other plans.

302
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,230
I'll get going now.

303
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,960
Let's go, Senior Yoon.

304
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,670
Why are we here?

305
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,320
I told you.

306
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,450
You'll have to carefully
watch your actions.

307
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,790
And that includes what you wear.

308
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,560
I picked out the clothes
that will suit you well.

309
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,200
And they will become
your taste after this.

310
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,000
Let's begin.

311
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,790
This one.

312
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,500
Yes, sir.

313
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,400
You look better than I expected.

314
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,350
Thanks for today.

315
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,930
Don't be.

316
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,400
To some extent, I'm putting
shackles on you.

317
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,200
You'll be criticized non-stop
about your conduct.

318
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,610
About what you must do
and must not do in our family.

319
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,420
By the way, how's your dad?

320
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,080
He hasn't called you yet?

321
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,840
If he sees your marriage announcement,

322
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,590
he'll come to you soon.

323
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,990
Don't worry. That won't happen.

324
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,120
You met him already?

325
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,550
As a courtesy to join your family,

326
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,190
I've taken care of him.

327
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,070
Good job.

328
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,310
We're here.

329
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,680
Can I really go?

330
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,780
They're your friends from college.

331
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,550
The junior we met earlier
told you to come.

332
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,920
Don't be so nervous.

333
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,290
The owner here is our senior.

334
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,360
Everyone is friendly and fun.

335
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,130
It'll be fine.

336
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,350
Since I'm already here,

337
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,630
should I join for a while?

338
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,330
Sure.

339
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,840
Okay.

340
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,450
Strawberries, go!

341
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,640
I like strawberries!

342
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,310
Strawberries!

343
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,410
Strawberries!

344
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,540
I'm here!

345
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,650
-Hey!
-Hyun-seung!

346
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,620
Why has it been so long?

347
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,190
-Hey!
-Long time no see!

348
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,360
-Sorry. It's been a while.
-Remember me?

349
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,620
Of course, I remember you.

350
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,330
Where should we sit?

351
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,160
-Over here.
-Okay.

352
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,580
Move over. Here.

353
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,130
Thanks.

354
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,430
Sit here.

355
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,950
-Okay.
-Thank you.

356
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,580
You got lucky with food.
You're here just in time.

357
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,550
Is this the senior
you've been talking about?

358
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,050
Yes.

359
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,520
Say hi.

360
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,620
This is the owner I told you about.

361
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,720
Oh, hello...

362
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,320
Sit down.

363
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,390
Oh, okay.

364
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,190
Hello, I'm Yoon Song-ah.
I work with Hyun-seung.

365
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,930
Nice to meet you.

366
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,330
I'm this fool's senior, Kim Jong-hyuk.

367
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,770
You must've gone through a lot
training this fool.

368
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,840
Hyun-seung is really good at his job,

369
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,560
so I receive a lot of help.

370
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,530
You're so kind.

371
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,010
How did you end up with this idiot?

372
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,980
Oh, come on.

373
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,280
What did you say? You need more soju?

374
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,020
Yes!

375
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,770
More soju?

376
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,520
Yes!

377
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,390
Soju!

378
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,390
Hey, guys!

379
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,590
Eat whatever you like today.

380
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,030
Hyun-seung is buying everything!

381
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,700
Ready, go!

382
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,470
Chae Hyun-seung!

383
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,170
Seriously, guys...

384
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,870
Hye-jung's voice wasn't loud enough.

385
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,380
Chae Hyun-seung!

386
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,420
Unemployed, alright.

387
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,050
Here come the drinks!

388
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,990
One here.

389
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,860
I'll pour you one.

390
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,680
-Hyun-seung.
-Yes?

391
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,700
How's work? Is it fun?

392
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,760
Work?

393
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,830
It's fun. The office vibe is good.

394
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,440
And there are a lot of
good seniors like her.

395
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,210
Wow, you know how to
lead a good social life!

396
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,510
What about making products?

397
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,340
Can you really make whatever you want?

398
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,440
Not really.

399
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,080
But things do go as marketers plan them.

400
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,250
From product planning
to the container and design,

401
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,820
we control everything.

402
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,620
Hyun-seung, what's the
best cushion foundation?

403
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,390
Of course it's KLAR.

404
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,560
-Oh, my bad.
-Come on.

405
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,860
By the way, are you wearing makeup?

406
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,830
Yes.

407
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,330
He's unbelievable, Hyun-seung.

408
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,390
He always wears makeup, even during tests.

409
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,470
Great self-discipline.

410
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,570
Hey! It's about my pride.

411
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,560
Of course it is.

412
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,910
You really...

413
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,180
Senior Yoon,

414
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,350
can I have your business card?

415
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,650
My business card?

416
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,280
I want to go to KLAR too.

417
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,290
I want to ask you a bunch of questions.

418
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,460
Hey, shouldn't the order go like this?

419
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,860
Come on, you're still a newbie.

420
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,960
If I have questions,
she'd answer me better.

421
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,930
So move over, please.

422
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,230
Can I have your business card?

423
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,900
Sure, I'll give it to you.

424
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,100
He seized his chance.

425
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,210
I'm so embarrassed.

426
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,070
Thank you.

427
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,480
Can I have one too?

428
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,140
Of course.

429
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,710
If you have any questions,
contact me anytime.

430
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,420
Really? Thank you.

431
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,280
Me too...

432
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:11,890
No, I'm not drunk!

433
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,260
One, two, three, four!

434
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,830
Orange, orange, oh!

435
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,600
Orange, orange, oh!

436
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,230
-Who?
-Why didn't you catch it?

437
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Me?

438
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,740
Drink! Here goes the shot!

439
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,310
Isn't this too much?

440
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,410
Gulp it down!

441
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,240
Don't sneak away, drink it already!

442
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,450
Rice cake, four.

443
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,880
Rice cake.

444
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,720
Fish cake, eight.

445
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,390
Fish cake!

446
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,120
Okay!

447
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,560
Tuna, tuna...

448
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,580
-No.
-You have to drink.

449
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,150
Come on. Seriously.

450
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,460
Get used to this.

451
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,130
They'll give you a lot of help
from now onward.

452
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,980
Sorry for being late.

453
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,220
This is Jae-shin,
the one I told you about.

454
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,690
Come in.

455
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,830
The sky is spinning in circles.

456
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,700
I think I'm going to die.

457
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,440
Don't worry. People won't die that easily.

458
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,940
No, I mean it.

459
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,100
It's your fault you suck at games.

460
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,110
You slipped and lost every time.

461
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,680
You're too good at it.

462
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,910
You said it was your first time playing,

463
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,090
and yet you never lost.

464
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,390
You didn't even offer to drink for me.

465
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,990
Don't you know my motto?

466
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
When training juniors...

467
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,770
You raise them to be strong.

468
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,140
But this is too much, isn't it?

469
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,470
Are you feeling that bad?

470
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,740
I think I'll be okay in a little while.

471
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,380
You should go home.

472
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,350
And hear later that you die on the street?

473
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,720
I knew it.

474
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,920
You're the best.

475
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,280
Get some rest.

476
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,090
Okay.

477
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,730
You must've had a really fun college life.

478
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,670
I guess.

479
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,070
What about you?

480
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,010
It was hard enough just to attend classes.

481
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,780
I tutored kids, worked part-time jobs...

482
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,640
I had no time to make friends,

483
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,620
let alone join club activities.

484
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,430
I wanted to be independent,
so don't feel bad.

485
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,570
Anyway, seeing you today made me jealous.

486
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,710
A college life like that
would've been fun.

487
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,880
And it was different seeing you
as someone else's senior.

488
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,050
I was cool, right?

489
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,810
Yes.

490
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,560
I'll invite you again some time.

491
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,220
I'll invite you anytime, so please come.

492
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,510
The door is wide open.

493
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,050
I think you've sobered up now. Let's go.

494
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,910
Okay.

495
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,890
What's wrong?

496
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
You okay?

497
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,980
No.

498
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,310
Five minutes.

499
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,980
Just stay like this for five minutes.

500
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,980
Who are you?

501
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,200
(Family Relation Certificate)

502
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,860
So you're Jae-shin's father?

503
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,810
Oh, yes.

504
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,780
As it says there, I'm Jae-shin's father.

505
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,920
He's a spitting image of me.

506
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,840
So,

507
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,320
have you heard about me from him?

508
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,260
I only know you exist.

509
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,330
He doesn't like me that much.

510
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,820
I guess that's how it is
between every father and son.

511
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,030
By the way, you're very lovely.

512
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,470
My son has great taste in women,
just like his old man.

513
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,680
How did you find me here?

514
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,850
Well...

515
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,580
The wedding announcement
was huge in the news.

516
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
I did a little digging.
It was easy to find.

517
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,860
I don't have an ulterior motive.

518
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,220
You'll be joining our family now.

519
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,560
I should see you at least once.

520
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,760
It'll be weird to see you
for the first time at the wedding.

521
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,600
You're coming to our wedding?

522
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,670
Of course, I am.

523
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,640
It's my one and only son's wedding.

524
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,370
But don't worry.

525
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,810
I look shabby today
because I was in a rush.

526
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:19,010
But if I clean myself up,
I'd look like a movie star.

527
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,380
In order to do that,

528
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,560
I need some money.

529
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,460
Oh, where are you going to live?

530
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,700
How much do you want?

531
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,300
How much?

532
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,370
Tell me.

533
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,900
Come on.

534
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,870
That's not why I came.

535
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,820
I guess I should consider your position.

536
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,620
And I am sort of badly-off these days.

537
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,940
One big one...

538
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,010
No,

539
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,930
two big ones will do.

540
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,730
Why should I?

541
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,440
Huh?

542
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,100
Do I seem

543
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,010
like a pushover to you?

544
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:21,949
No...

545
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,540
Since my daughter-in-law
dutifully offered first...

546
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,840
I told you I didn't come to get anything!

547
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,719
So you don't need the money?

548
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,310
Oh, thank you!

549
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,620
It was inconvenient for me all day
because I lost this.

550
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,450
You're an office worker.

551
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,920
How could you lose your employee card?

552
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,480
You're a newbie and yet
you're already laid-back.

553
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,090
I've been working long enough
to be laid-back.

554
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,770
How confident.

555
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,360
-The food's here.
-Here's your food.

556
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,190
Thank you.

557
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,670
Looks good.

558
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,460
Thank you.

559
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,270
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

560
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,910
My stomach is burning.

561
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,980
You're still very young.

562
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,710
When I was your age,
I drank a crate of soju...

563
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,900
Yes, I know.

564
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,450
You drank a crate of soju
and a crate of beer

565
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,720
but you felt nothing.

566
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,920
I know it all.

567
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,760
Slick as a whistle.

568
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,590
You pretended to be cool
in front of that senior of yours.

569
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,390
Did I?

570
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,130
You like her, don't you?

571
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,870
What are you talking about?

572
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,900
I knew it! I'm right!

573
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,100
It's so obvious. How can she not know?

574
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,040
Is it that obvious?

575
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,080
Geez.

576
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,610
Just tell her.

577
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,370
I should be more careful.

578
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,390
So that I can be around her.

579
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,760
Hey.

580
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,560
Why the sudden sad vibe?

581
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,870
We'll first knead the dough
for buckwheat noodles.

582
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,400
First, put in buckwheat flour.

583
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,040
We also use hard wheat flour.

584
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,410
Kneading with hot water
is called scalding.

585
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,710
You use this method to make thin noodles.

586
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,920
Scrub the buckwheat noodles
as hard as you can.

587
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,660
Remove the starch to get a chewy texture.

588
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,360
Oh, this is sesame oil.

589
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,110
They are edible flowers.

590
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,090
Would you like to try it?

591
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,050
Is it good?

592
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,090
It's really good.

593
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,190
Is it?

594
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,270
You're right.

595
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,040
Your cooking is better though.

596
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
I agree.

597
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,110
You two must be together.

598
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,880
What?

599
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
You're not?

600
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,850
You seem close.

601
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,310
Oh, no. We're...

602
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,320
Friends.

603
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,190
Just close friends.

604
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,660
Oh, I see. Good for you guys.

605
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,530
You can come to places like this.
I envy you.

606
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,830
It's good to have a friend.

607
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,540
Thank you for today.

608
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,510
I learned a lot.

609
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,610
That's good.

610
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,480
You'll do it then?

611
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,150
Yes. I'll check my schedule
and let you know.

612
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,050
Oh, and...

613
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,780
Sorry about earlier.

614
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,220
I went ahead and said we were friends.

615
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,150
If I said I was your husband's friend,

616
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,390
she'd look at us in a funny way.

617
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,290
Come to think of it, that's possible.

618
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,350
You have a lot of friends, don't you?

619
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,060
I do.

620
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,400
But what's the use?

621
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,270
They're all married
and busy raising their kids.

622
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,340
I got married early.

623
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,730
I was busy raising Ha-eun,

624
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,840
so I couldn't see them.

625
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,180
Now, it's the opposite.

626
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,170
I know all the moms of Ha-eun's friends.

627
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,780
But they are different from my friends.

628
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,950
I guess you're right.

629
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,850
What about you? Do you have many friends?

630
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,690
Not really, I only have Woo-hyun.

631
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,290
It's sad, right?

632
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,350
What's wrong with that?

633
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,960
My husband is the same too.

634
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,030
You're peas in a pod.

635
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,630
By the way, how did you two
become friends?

636
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,070
Oh, about that...

637
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,810
What is it?

638
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,120
(Pick up Ha-eun for
nature experience class)

639
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,490
Sorry, I have to go to my next schedule.

640
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,550
Sure.

641
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,760
-I'll see you next time.
-Bye.

642
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,840
Doctor, that was the last patient.

643
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,100
Okay, well done today.

644
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,960
(Han-seo)

645
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,530
Over here!

646
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,470
That was quick.

647
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,940
We were wrapping up.

648
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,640
Your restaurant?

649
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,870
It's my day off.

650
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,820
You're hosting a cooking class
with my wife?

651
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,060
Yes, I'm going to give it a go.

652
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,130
It's boring managing the restaurant.

653
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,530
It's good that your place
is doing well so quickly.

654
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,400
Has it been six months now?

655
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,900
Yes.

656
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,240
Around that.

657
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,520
Should I prepare what Manager Kwon
asked by tomorrow?

658
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,390
Yes.

659
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,980
You're leaving now?

660
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,990
Yes.

661
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,230
You're getting off work late.

662
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,640
Why are you here?

663
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,010
You didn't answer my texts.

664
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,800
There was no reason to answer.

665
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,490
You're still very angry.

666
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,780
Let's go, Senior Yoon.

667
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,690
I'll keep coming.

668
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,400
Until you agree to meet me.

669
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,580
So?

670
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,950
What do you want to say?

671
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,980
Who was that woman?

672
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,950
Your girlfriend?

673
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,730
It's so strange.

674
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,560
That you're looking at me like this.

675
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,220
If you don't have anything
to say in particular,

676
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,630
I'll leave now.

677
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,160
I miss you so much.

678
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,810
Did you ever think about me?

679
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,720
I know I'm being shameless.

680
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,860
Acting like this after what I did to you.

681
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,920
I thought I made myself clear.

682
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,590
When I say it's the last time,
it's really the last time.

683
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,530
But you still chose him.

684
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,900
I was young.

685
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,800
That's why I preferred someone
who shared the pain.

686
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,370
But in reality, it wore me down.

687
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,740
You always said it'd be fine.

688
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,980
That everything would be alright.
And I missed that.

689
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,980
You're the one

690
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,290
that I really need.

691
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,250
Seo-yeon,

692
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,770
you can't do this.

693
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,790
You can't win or discard people
based on your needs.

694
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,590
Also, there's someone I like.

695
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,130
I like her a lot.

696
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,970
Who?

697
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,370
That woman?

698
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,310
Yes.

699
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,600
What about her?

700
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,050
Does she feel the same way?

701
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,250
The important thing is
I'm not going back to you.

702
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,020
Just accept my feelings then.

703
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,860
I can't give up on my feelings
just because you like her.

704
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,790
When you grow weary of your crush,

705
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,600
you'll look at me one day, right?

706
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,300
I won't become weary.

707
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,530
Even if we get further apart,

708
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,630
I still won't become weary.

709
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,370
Then I'll keep my eyes fixed on you too.

710
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,310
I don't think I'll become weary either.

711
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,210
Don't you think that's an obsession?

712
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,840
It seems to me that we're the same.

713
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
You and I.

714
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,080
Unrequited love is nothing more
than a selfish thought.

715
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,680
(She's got a lot of nerve! How shameless!)

716
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,260
What a jerk.

717
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,870
(She's talking a load of trash!
Ignore her!)

718
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,120
But it's not that easy.

719
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,270
(Of course, it'll trouble your mind.)

720
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,070
You said you won't be greedy,

721
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,710
but you can't control your feelings.

722
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,940
But still, there's a way.

723
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,210
(Keep your feelings
to yourself till the end.)

724
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,250
(Because you want to stay by her side.)

725
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,960
It'll be hard to keep hiding it.

726
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,840
(Geez.)

727
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,450
(I'm tearing up.)

728
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,460
(Anyway, Little Brother.)

729
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,420
(I'll call you Little Brother, okay?)

730
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,430
(From now on, just focus on
your feelings.)

731
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,400
(Don't look at anything around you.)

732
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,670
(Just look at your heart.)

733
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,600
Okay?

734
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,170
Keep that in mind!

735
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,010
(I've been through it.)

736
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,990
(The same thing as you.)

737
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,940
I pretended I didn't know.

738
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,090
I held out, pleading and begging.

739
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,330
That's what I did.

740
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,000
(But do you know how it ended?)

741
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,000
(She dumped me in the end.)

742
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:15,520
(Unrequited love is nothing more
than a selfish thought.)

743
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,530
(Senior Yoon Song-ah)

744
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,560
(Are you alright?)

745
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,770
Have you been talking all night

746
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,420
without having dinner?

747
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,840
We didn't talk that long.

748
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:52,730
That woman

749
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,800
is the girl you mentioned before, right?

750
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,300
Is she asking you to get back together?

751
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,780
You read my mind.

752
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,750
It's obvious.

753
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,710
She came to the office
because you ignored her texts.

754
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,090
These people always do that.

755
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,350
They tear you into pieces

756
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,140
and leave you for someone else.

757
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,990
Then, they come back
as though nothing's happened.

758
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,730
It's more appalling that they think
they can undo what's happened.

759
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,300
You must be upset.

760
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,040
Not that much.

761
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,240
Don't lie.

762
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,410
Your face says otherwise.

763
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,280
It's okay.

764
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,120
I used to be such a mess in front of you.

765
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,190
Did something else happen?

766
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:58,930
Are you worried?

767
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,000
Of course.

768
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,200
Why?

769
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,880
What do you mean why?

770
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,750
Because you're a junior that I value.

771
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,920
Senior Yoon.

772
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,860
Yes? Talk to me.

773
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:32,830
The more I think about it,

774
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,200
the more I realize I'm being too greedy.

775
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,620
I still like you a lot.

776
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:51,280
I don't want to
keep the distance I promised.

777
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,650
I was lying.

778
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,890
I want to stay by your side
even if it's like this.

779
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,930
I was going to hide my feelings,

780
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,160
but it'll come out eventually.

781
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,160
Then you'll be shocked again

782
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,450
and feel sorry for me.

783
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,540
I'll become a burden to you.

784
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,050
I don't want to see you like that again.

785
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,520
So I'm going to give you up.

786
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,190
I'll try to become distant from you.

787
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,600
When you say no, it means no.

788
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:51,440
So don't be surprised if I seem different.

789
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,710
And don't be hurt.

790
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,850
I can't be the same as before.

791
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,290
All my friends say you're awesome.

792
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,220
They're asking if you can set them up
with your friends.

793
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,230
There's only Jae-woon.

794
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,530
There's no one then.

795
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,100
I need to keep my conscience clear.

796
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:51,570
Thanks.

797
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,700
For meeting up with my friends.

798
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,540
By the way, I met your father
earlier today.

799
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,070
My father?

800
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,450
Yes. He came to my studio.

801
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,920
He saw our wedding article.

802
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,340
I think he came to me
because he was afraid to go to you.

803
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,450
What did he say?

804
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,720
Seemed like he can barely make ends meet.

805
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,090
Why didn't you call me?

806
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,540
I thought about it,

807
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,450
but I didn't want to stress you out.

808
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,830
I took care of him.

809
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,830
He's no longer my father.

810
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,170
So don't give him money ever again.

811
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,110
Don't even talk to him.

812
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,010
Did I make a mistake?

813
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,870
(So I'm going to give you up.)

814
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,980
I'll try to become distant from you.

815
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,810
Iced Americano with two shots of espresso

816
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,550
and two pumps of vanilla syrup.

817
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,950
Okay.

818
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,720
Oh! Song-ah!

819
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,990
Oh, hello.

820
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,200
You're here alone?

821
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,130
Yes.

822
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,370
When will they send
the new eyeshadow sample?

823
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:42,270
They said within this week,
but I'll check again.

824
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,500
Okay.

825
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,910
By the way,

826
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,440
Hyun-seung's new product idea is great.

827
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,410
The team leader pulled out a list.

828
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,180
Hyun-seung is on the presentation list.

829
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,180
Really?

830
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,650
The official email will be sent tomorrow,

831
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,120
but you can tell him in advance.

832
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,090
Okay.

833
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,860
How do you feel?

834
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:18,040
I knew you'd make the PowerPoint list.

835
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,780
All that's left is the first place.

836
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,110
I'll do my best.

837
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,680
What do you mean?

838
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,300
You'll win first place
even without doing your best.

839
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,720
What are you doing there, Song-ah?

840
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:35,420
Song-ah,

841
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,180
Hyun-seung made the presentation list.

842
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,060
Congratulations. You worked hard.

843
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,530
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

844
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,970
Come on.

845
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,570
Let's go out for drinks.

846
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,500
To wish for first place.
What do you think?

847
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,240
I'm in.

848
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,740
Of course, you are.

849
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,410
How about you?

850
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,180
Sure.

851
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,440
Of course, you're the hero.

852
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:56,980
What do you want to eat?

853
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,850
Anything's fine.

854
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,680
We should go where you want to go.

855
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,020
Cheers!

856
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,300
Wow! This is so good!

857
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:22,070
You must order makgeolli
and pajeon on rainy days.

858
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:24,910
You used Hyun-seung
as an excuse to drink, right?

859
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,440
Kind of.

860
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,770
It's a good day to drink together.

861
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,380
I'll order fried pepper.

862
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,750
Ma'am, fried pepper
and assorted jeon, please!

863
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,620
Okay.

864
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,390
Do you want anything?

865
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,920
No, you ordered everything.

866
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,760
I'll just eat that.

867
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,130
I wanted beef jeon though.

868
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,400
Why are you feeling down?

869
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,460
Just drink.

870
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,900
Yes, let's drink.

871
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,970
-You're very tactful.
-Of course.

872
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:53,940
Okay.

873
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,960
No one is going home early, okay?

874
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,140
No one will go.

875
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,140
Hyun-seung!

876
00:55:59,140 --> 00:55:59,740
First place!

877
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,610
Go for it!

878
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,130
Go for it!

879
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,580
Listen to the sound of rain.

880
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,620
I hope the food comes soon.

881
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,960
Cheers!

882
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,830
I knew it.

883
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,100
He can't hold his liquor.

884
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,000
Where is Song-ah anyway?

885
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:33,270
Why don't you go look for her, Hyun-seung?

886
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,940
Yes, you should go.

887
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,750
The youngest one should step up.

888
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,650
Okay, I'll go look for her then.

889
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,920
I told you it's a crush.

890
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,490
They're flirting.

891
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,060
I said they're dating.

892
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,630
I heard it with my own ears.

893
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:53,830
I saw it with my own eyes.

894
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,330
They held hands and ran.

895
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,400
They held hands again?

896
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Again? When?

897
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,130
Geez! What is this?

898
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,430
I got it.

899
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,340
Today,

900
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,870
no one is leaving early.

901
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,210
We'll go to work in the morning.

902
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,180
Go back to sleep.

903
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,510
Sleep well, Manager Kwon.

904
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,180
It started in Samcheok.

905
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,820
It doesn't make sense
if they're still not dating.

906
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,950
Maybe the crush became a relationship,

907
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,190
then they broke up

908
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,460
and now they're flirting.

909
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,690
Geez! What is it?

910
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,320
Seriously.

911
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:26,660
Relationships are so complicated.

912
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,000
I give up.

913
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,560
-They're flirting.
-Go back to sleep.

914
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,960
Are you okay?

915
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:56,990
Yes.

916
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,060
What about you?

917
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,430
Me too.

918
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,850
I'll go back inside.

919
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,680
Okay.

920
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,170
Oh...

921
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:45,910
I'm sorry.

922
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,880
It's okay.

923
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,250
I'm going in now.

924
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,250
Okay.

925
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,550
First, the selling points of Aqua Cushion.

926
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,190
There are two things you need to remember.

927
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:37,260
Triple functional cosmetics.

928
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,130
Dermatologically tested
for sensitive skin.

929
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,360
Remember these two aspects.

930
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,390
Specifically, it brightens the skin,
treats wrinkles

931
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:48,040
and blocks UV rays.
It has three functions.

932
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,400
Take note of that.

933
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,470
It's best for those who want to moisturize

934
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,510
and those who want
a skin-lightening effect...

935
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:55,240
Hi.

936
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:55,780
Hello.

937
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,680
Where is Manager Ahn?

938
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,850
She'll be here later.

939
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,950
The previous training session
hasn't ended yet.

940
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,780
Wait in the next lecture room,
I'll call for you.

941
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,640
Okay.

942
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,860
Inflacin X that helps soothe the skin...

943
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,340
You're here.

944
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,450
Where's Manager Ahn?

945
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,590
She went to solve issues
with the new product.

946
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:37,750
Oh.

947
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,650
Is it serious?

948
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,720
One of the materials for the container
is running late.

949
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:05,410
How is it going with your presentation?

950
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:07,980
Good.

951
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:22,930
(Training Team Manager Kim So-min)

952
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:26,030
(You can come in five minutes later.)
(Training Team Manager Kim So-min)

953
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,630
If I don't like this,

954
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,490
I become the bad person, is it?

955
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,320
If I don't like the fact that I can't ask you if you need any help,

956
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,230
If I don't like that we can't laugh together anymore,

957
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,500
If I don't like that I can't even look at you in the eyes,

958
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,340
If I don't like it,

959
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:38,770
I'm the bad person, right?

960
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,300
Even so,

961
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:47,120
I'll just be the bad person.

962
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,250
So don't give up.

963
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,590
Don't become distant

964
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,150
from me.
