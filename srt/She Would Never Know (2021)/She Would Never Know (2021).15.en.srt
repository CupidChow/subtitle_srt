1

(All places, characters, firms and events

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,260
(Return Application)

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,970
Everything seems to be in order.

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,310
I'll process this.

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,180
-Thank you.
-By the way,

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,080
why did you choose to return?

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,820
The branch manager was sad to see you go.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,950
Things are going smoothly now,

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,310
but you're leaving after
laying the groundwork.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,420
I think I've gained enough experience.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,290
Actually,

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,830
I miss home.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,730
I'll leave you to it. Thank you.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,200
Okay.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,310
Alright, I'll be there soon.

16
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,400
I think it's completely useless.

17
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,230
You're back?

18
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,510
(Episode 15)
You're back?

19
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:10,980
Yes.
(Episode 15)

20
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,510
Yes.

21
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,250
Reading your inbox?

22
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,880
Yes.

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,780
So many people have relationship issues.

24
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,050
It takes a long time
to read these through.

25
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,150
It's because you're a hot commodity.

26
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,690
That I am.

27
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,320
If you were there
two more years as planned,

28
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,660
I would've gotten my Gold Button.

29
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,060
You came back too early.

30
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,660
Fine, it's my fault.

31
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,700
At least you're quick to acknowledge it.

32
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,440
Did you have dinner? I haven't.

33
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Let's eat together. Let me get changed.

34
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,170
Okay.

35
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,330
(Winter, two years ago)

36
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,230
Asst. Manager Yoon Song-ah.

37
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Yes!

38
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,940
Yes, ma'am?

39
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,450
We'll be meeting with that OEM company.

40
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,220
Get two tickets to London
for tomorrow morning.

41
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,690
One is yours.

42
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,090
My leave starts tomorrow.

43
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,390
Oh, right.

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,560
What to do...

45
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,400
I really need you there.

46
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry,

47
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,400
but can you cancel your leave?

48
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,710
You know this is important.

49
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,350
A business trip?

50
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,350
(Yes.)

51
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,420
(A meeting suddenly came up.)

52
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,120
This company is playing hard-to-get.

53
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,620
It'll be difficult to reschedule.

54
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
It's okay. It's work anyway.

55
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry to make you wait.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,360
(It's okay.)

57
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,370
I know things are hard over there.

58
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,200
Don't worry. Do what you need to do.

59
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,470
Thank you.

60
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,750
What?

61
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,020
(Summer, one and a half years ago)

62
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,860
Why can't it come through?
(Summer, one and a half years ago)

63
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,430
You said there'd be no problem this time.

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,240
You know we need them.

65
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,180
(Senior Yoon Song-ah)
(I'm sorry.)

66
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,780
(Senior Yoon Song-ah)

67
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,290
(There's a customs issue
with a key product.)
(Senior Yoon Song-ah)

68
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:05,750
(There's a customs issue
with a key product.)

69
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,180
(I can't go to Korea.)

70
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,550
(I'm really sorry.)

71
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,670
Hey.

72
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,740
You're awake?

73
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,810
It's okay.

74
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,540
I understand. Stop feeling so bad.

75
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,210
(I'm really sorry.)

76
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,250
I really want to see you.

77
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,220
It's fine.

78
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,920
Don't cry. You'll make me sad.

79
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,820
Hmm?

80
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,010
Okay.

81
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,790
(Don't skip meals. We'll talk soon.)

82
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,130
(Winter, a year ago)

83
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:56,430
Alright, it's okay.
(Winter, a year ago)

84
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,700
Alright, it's okay.

85
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,840
Don't worry. Just get your work done.

86
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Okay.

87
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,020
Hey.

88
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,680
You're home.

89
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,900
Have you eaten?

90
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,500
You must be so exhausted.

91
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,040
Aren't you angry at all?

92
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,710
You came to see me.

93
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,710
We haven't seen each other
in one and a half years.

94
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,150
And yet I made you wait.

95
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,180
But look at you,

96
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,290
how could you worry about me?

97
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,790
Don't you resent me?

98
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,060
It was because of work. I understand.

99
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,130
And I came because I want to see you.

100
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,330
I can handle waiting.

101
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,570
What am I?

102
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,350
What am I?

103
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,450
How can you always be patient
with me like this?

104
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,120
How can you keep saying that it's okay?

105
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,160
It's not okay.

106
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,530
This is hard on you.

107
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,370
Remember what I told you before?

108
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,900
Whether I fall or crash,

109
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,840
all I want to do is to be with you.

110
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes, it's hard.

111
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,620
I'm upset at you sometimes,

112
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,560
or I go crazy missing you.

113
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,860
But we have to endure this to be together.

114
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,990
At least we still get to see each other.

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,130
We've come this far.

116
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,300
Let's bear with it just a bit more.

117
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,870
Hmm?

118
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,540
Is it right to endure?

119
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,420
Senior Yoon.

120
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,860
This is it.

121
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,020
I think we should end this.

122
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,860
Senior Yoon.

123
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
Let's end this.

124
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,600
We're interviewing the members
of the marketing team.

125
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,360
I was told to find you
for the overseas team.

126
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,270
Please wait inside the conference room.

127
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Okay.

128
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,090
I forgot you were still waiting.

129
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,520
You two were in the same team, right?

130
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,460
Yes.

131
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,890
Please stay here for a moment.

132
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,390
You're here for the interview?

133
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,090
Yes.

134
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,670
I'm returning to HQ today.

135
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,140
I think I'll be assigned to marketing.

136
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,340
But I'm not sure which team yet.

137
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
I see.

138
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,560
We can't avoid each other completely.

139
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,660
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

140
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,800
I don't feel uncomfortable.

141
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,340
Manager Chae, we'll start with you.
Let's go.

142
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
Okay.

143
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,630
It was only a season after we broke up.

144
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,100
I understood what Hyun-seung meant.

145
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,310
Whether you fall or crash,

146
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,000
whatever happens,

147
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,670
all you have to do is
to hold on your partner.

148
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,880
It was wonderful just
being able to love him.

149
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,040
I didn't know what a blessing
it was back then.

150
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,550
I was a fool.

151
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,050
You just had a different idea about love.

152
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,530
You thought letting him go
was the right thing to do.

153
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,030
That was what I thought then.

154
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,740
But now I understand.

155
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,510
I just want to see him.

156
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,370
If I could do that,

157
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,110
I'd be so happy.

158
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,240
You still have feelings for him.

159
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,640
You think you can handle seeing him?

160
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,730
I have to.

161
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,260
You're not going to tell him how you feel?

162
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,690
I was harsh when I
broke things off with him.

163
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
How can I be so shameless?

164
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm already being selfish
by coming back to stay near him.

165
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,830
How dare I ask for more?

166
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,350
Did you get over jet lag?

167
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,450
Yes, I'm doing okay.

168
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,350
Then it's time to get back to work.

169
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,490
Show us what you've learned in Europe.

170
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,020
I heard from Director Lee.

171
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,890
You're open to working on any team.

172
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,330
Any team with a vacancy.

173
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,560
Okay then.

174
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,870
Are you okay with the KLAR Team?

175
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,470
We have a vacancy right now.

176
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,110
Well...

177
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,040
For your information,

178
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,410
I already discussed this
with Manager Chae.

179
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,850
He said he's okay with it.

180
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,310
Song-ah.

181
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,120
I mean, Manager Yoon.

182
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,020
If it's too hard for you,

183
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,520
we'll get someone from another team.

184
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,150
And then you can fill in their vacancy.

185
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,920
So no pressure.

186
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,360
But I hope you'd return to our team.

187
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Wait, no.

188
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,930
Think about it.

189
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,260
Really, no pressure.

190
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,330
Okay, I'll think about it.

191
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,870
Let me see. Ah!

192
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,140
What about the master bedroom wallpaper?

193
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,680
Should we do a different color
on one wall?

194
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,540
That sounds nice.

195
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,950
Okay.

196
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,810
What color should it be?

197
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,880
White is the basic color.

198
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,280
How about gray?

199
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,490
It'll look modern.

200
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,890
No.

201
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,790
Gray's too simple.

202
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,290
How about a more vivid color?

203
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,160
That sounds nice too.

204
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,230
How about black?

205
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,730
That's fine.

206
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,100
Am I getting married by myself?

207
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,109
I wasn't going to say anything

208
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,440
because I didn't want to look petty.

209
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,250
But how can you do this to me?

210
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,150
I know you're busy,

211
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,380
but we're getting married.

212
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,710
How can you not be interested
about our future home?

213
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,490
Well...

214
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,520
You're so good at everything.

215
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,359
But this will be our home.

216
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,790
It should reflect your taste too.

217
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,000
You are my taste.

218
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,570
So what you like is what I like.

219
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,560
You're all talk.

220
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,430
Forget it. We'll live in a cave.

221
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,170
Who cares about the wallpaper?

222
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,270
Where are you going?

223
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,930
Hyo-joo will be here soon.

224
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,980
We need to discuss the wedding photoshoot.

225
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,950
I'm going to throw away the wallpaper.

226
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
Hey.

227
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,890
Jae-woon!

228
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,860
Where are you going?

229
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,300
(Your call cannot be connected.)

230
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,800
Jae-woon is not picking up.

231
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,170
You should've just gone along with him.

232
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,060
That's exactly what I did.

233
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,940
He sulks a lot.

234
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,350
I told you to reconsider this marriage.

235
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,410
You could break it off.

236
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,110
Hyo-joo!

237
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,850
I guess you don't want to.

238
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,790
What in the world do you see in him?

239
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,460
He's my type.

240
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,790
Yikes.

241
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,320
I feel bad though.

242
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,730
You came all the way here.

243
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,760
Don't worry.

244
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,720
I'll charge it as an expense.

245
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,670
Okay.

246
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,270
Overcharge your brother.

247
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,470
Right,

248
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,110
how did the blind date go?

249
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,880
Was it okay?

250
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,910
The blind date?

251
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,310
It was just...

252
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,420
You look like you've been doing well.

253
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,290
I've been doing great myself too.

254
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,560
I can tell.

255
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,400
Once a jerk, always a jerk.

256
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,000
It was that awful?

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,340
Yes, I realized he was awful.

258
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,280
Call me when you two make up.

259
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,410
I'll see myself out.

260
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,750
(CEO Lee Jae-shin)

261
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,520
Sir.

262
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,350
They said they'd call at 3 p.m., right?

263
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,040
30 minutes have passed.

264
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,100
(MD Kim Ju-young)

265
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,670
Hello?

266
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,310
Okay.

267
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,150
Thank you.

268
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,280
Are we getting a spot?

269
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,050
Yes!

270
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,260
We're finally getting an offline spot.

271
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,940
Congratulations, sir.

272
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,090
Congratulations to all of us.

273
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,600
But let's party later.

274
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,850
We have a lot to prepare.

275
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,200
How about a meeting first?

276
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,470
Welcome back, Manager Yoon.

277
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,930
You were just an employee three years ago,

278
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,270
and now you are a general manager.

279
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,210
I'm happy to join this team again.

280
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,310
I'll work extra hard.

281
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,510
Don't worry.

282
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,310
BM Kwon works us like slaves
since his promotion.

283
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,810
There's no choice but to work hard.

284
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,550
Come on, Manager Kang.

285
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,750
How come you always say the right thing?

286
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,980
She's right, Song-ah.

287
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,250
You better stay sharp.

288
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,820
Okay.

289
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,860
You already know everyone here.

290
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,330
So no need to introduce yourself.

291
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,990
Let's have a company BBQ dinner soon

292
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,550
and catch up on things.

293
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,730
Great.

294
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,960
Right.

295
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,530
About your desk, Manager Yoon.

296
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,870
You can use your old one.

297
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Okay.

298
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,410
Do what you need to do in the morning.

299
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,640
We'll have a meeting in the afternoon.

300
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,010
Give her a round of applause.

301
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,650
Welcome back!

302
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,280
Can I see the two of you
in the meeting room later?

303
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,320
Okay.

304
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Okay.

305
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,540
It's been a while, right?

306
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,440
You must be sad to see Myung-jin go.

307
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,880
You trained him and now
he's off to basic skincare.

308
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,180
It's okay.

309
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
You took over the work he was doing?

310
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,550
Yes.

311
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,390
Give some of your work to Manager Yoon.

312
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,230
You can discuss
the task distribution yourselves.

313
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,560
Okay.

314
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,700
I have another meeting to get to.

315
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,100
Let me know what you decide on,
Manager Yoon.

316
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,270
Okay.

317
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,510
-See you later.
-Alright.

318
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,650
Gosh!

319
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,160
What is it?

320
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,950
How did they look? Do they look okay?

321
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,660
Yes, they seemed okay.

322
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,480
Really?

323
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,760
I guess they handled it nicely.

324
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,990
They agreed to be on the same team.

325
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,970
I'm sure they are professional.

326
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,770
I'm so relieved.

327
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,140
I couldn't sleep last night
because I was so worried.

328
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,640
That's overreacting.

329
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,680
Anyway, I'm glad we don't have to worry.

330
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,880
This is why you dragged me here?

331
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,090
Yes.

332
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,020
What in the world?

333
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,760
At least get me a cup of coffee first.

334
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,710
How do you want to divide the tasks?

335
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,340
Is there a list?

336
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,480
Here.

337
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,180
Do you want to discuss it now?

338
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,790
I have time.

339
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,360
Just check the ones you want to take.

340
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,150
I'll give you the documents
of the related information.

341
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,760
Okay, that sounds good.

342
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,730
I'll get going first.

343
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,650
This is a shared kitchen used by
self-employed restaurateurs.

344
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,870
I see.

345
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,320
You mean delivery-only cuisine?

346
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,660
That's right.

347
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,660
You'll use this place
for the cooking class.

348
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,470
Have you come up with a curriculum?

349
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,700
Not yet.

350
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,600
I'm not sure what to do.

351
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,470
Don't worry. I can help you with that.

352
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,410
I have some samples.

353
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,540
Or I can make you a customized one too.

354
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,640
Thank you.

355
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,550
I've always wanted to do this,
but I didn't know where to start.

356
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,390
Having you here makes things easier.

357
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,260
Please spread the word about me then.

358
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
Sure.

359
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,220
Want to see more?

360
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,230
Sure.

361
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,000
Woo-hyun.

362
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,700
(I'm going to pick up Ha-eun.)

363
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,810
When do you think you'll be done?

364
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,770
I have another meeting. I'll be home late.

365
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,440
Don't worry. Do your thing.

366
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,540
I'll go get Ha-eun.

367
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
Okay.

368
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm good, aren't I?

369
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,020
Stay focused.

370
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,350
You'll cut yourself.

371
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,590
Okay.

372
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,360
Be careful.

373
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,400
I want a lot of this.

374
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,370
Why?

375
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,540
Because I need my protein.

376
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,780
Okay.

377
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,770
Happy?

378
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,680
More.

379
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,850
-More?
-Yes.

380
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,650
I think this is enough protein.

381
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,650
No, it's not.

382
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,490
-It's enough.
-More.

383
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,020
-I need more.
-I think it's enough.

384
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,420
Then buy a lot more when
it's your turn to cook again.

385
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,960
Huh? That much?

386
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,850
All done.

387
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,230
Thank you for the food, Daddy.

388
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,430
You're welcome.

389
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,100
How is it?

390
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,040
Is it good?

391
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,480
It's not that good.

392
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,940
But it's edible.

393
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,150
You're improving, Daddy.

394
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,250
I'll do better next time.

395
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,250
Okay.

396
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,290
How was school? Did you have fun?

397
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,580
What is it? Something happened?

398
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,800
You know Ye-ji in my class?

399
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Yes.

400
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,200
Her parents are getting a divorce.

401
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,570
Really?

402
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,630
Yes, that's why she cried today.

403
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,580
She must be so sad.

404
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,410
Um.

405
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,650
So what did you tell her?

406
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,920
I just gave her a hug.

407
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,520
We can't do anything
about a grown-up thing.

408
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,550
Say this to Ye-ji then.

409
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,320
Even if they get a divorce,

410
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,560
they will always love Ye-ji.

411
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,260
That will never change.

412
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,240
You still have some work left?

413
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,740
Yes.

414
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,550
I didn't get to greet you properly before.

415
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,880
I'm glad we're on the same team.

416
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,920
Let's get in.

417
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,570
Manager Yoon.

418
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,230
I don't know if I should say this.

419
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,470
But Hyun-seung took
your breakup really hard.

420
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,270
After you two ended things,

421
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,410
he was in a really bad place.

422
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,780
He was worse than you think.

423
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,920
-So...
-Se-rim.

424
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,650
I know what you're worried about.

425
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,490
But it won't happen. Don't worry.

426
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,660
I'm sorry.

427
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,400
See you tomorrow.

428
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,780
You can't change it at the last minute.

429
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,850
Alright then.

430
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,980
Let's go for the product photoshoot.

431
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,690
We can't do that today.

432
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,850
Why not?

433
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,420
I just got a call.

434
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,560
The studio is having issues
with its equipment.

435
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,330
They said they can't fix it today.

436
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,030
How long will it take then?

437
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,500
They said it's going to take a week.

438
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,930
I think we need to find another studio.

439
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,970
Can we find one on such short notice?

440
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,800
Still, let's start making some calls.

441
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,710
Okay.

442
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,300
I have a photographer friend.

443
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,640
I'll call their studio.

444
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,080
Okay.

445
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,880
-I'll make some calls too.
-Okay.

446
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,690
This is the studio?

447
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,700
Yes, my friend works at this place.

448
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,600
We got lucky. They're free today.

449
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,260
Is your friend Lee Hyo-joo?

450
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,790
Huh? Who is that?

451
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,110
You said your friend works here.

452
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,440
Oh, my friend is an assistant here.

453
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,010
She got permission from the director here.

454
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,250
Let's go inside.

455
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,300
Are you here to see me?

456
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,470
We have a photoshoot today.

457
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,840
I didn't know we scheduled it with you.

458
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,370
You're the urgent photoshoot?

459
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,340
Can we use your space?

460
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,810
Have a great one.

461
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,300
Is that the new cushion foundation?

462
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,910
It's not finished yet.
This is just a sample for customers.

463
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,710
I've put a lot of work into that.

464
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,970
I tested it many times on my face.

465
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,380
I see.

466
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,850
So that's why it came out so nice.

467
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,050
Good work.

468
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,250
Thank you.

469
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,650
You know...

470
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,120
You can address me comfortably.

471
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,660
In due time.

472
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,290
Alright.

473
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,130
Manager Yoon,

474
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,390
we need to visit some stores.

475
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Okay.

476
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,990
We're doing a survey
on our base makeup line

477
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,910
before we release new products.

Do you feel a cooling effect?

How is it?

486
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,190
It applies very well.

487
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,830
You can check it off
if it brightens your complexion.

You too.

It's late enough. Want to have dinner?

496

No, I'll be leaving now.

Okay.

00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,980
Let's drink first.

511
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,010
Alright.

512
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,740
Cheers!

513
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,070
Cheers!

514
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,880
-You are buying tonight, right?
-Of course. This is the least I can do.

515
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,950
I'm going to eat a lot then.

516
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,010
Thank you.

517
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,220
Hey.

518
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,560
Let me pour you a glass.

519
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,990
Sure.

520
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,800
I'll pour you a glass, Manager Yoon.

521
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,500
But your glass is full.

522
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,930
Right.

523
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,540
Okay, I'll drink.

524
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,210
At the same time.

525
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,130
Cheers!

526
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,640
Thank you.

527
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,080
It's great to see you.

528
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,710
Can I join you?

529
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,710
It's been a long time.

530
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,980
-I know, right?
-Here.

531
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,750
Cheers!

532
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,220
Good work today.

533
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,090
Really.

534
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,160
There's not enough alcohol.

535
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,290
Are you drunk?

536
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,600
Manager Yoon.

537
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,300
Hey.

538
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,040
It's Chae Hyun-seung.

539
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,190
I thought you went home.

540
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,290
What are you doing here?

541
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,950
What took you so long?

542
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,790
I've missed you so much.

543
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,260
Right,

544
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,160
I made you leave.

545
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,000
Like a fool.

546
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,570
Let's go.

547
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,210
I'll take you home.

548
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,780
I'm sorry.

549
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,990
I'm sorry I still like you.

550
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,630
I'm really sorry.

551
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,330
Are you alright?

552
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
No.

553
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,640
Jeez.

554
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,770
How much did you drink?

555
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,070
Make sure you take
some medicine before you go.

556
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,410
By the way,

557
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,350
how did I get home yesterday?

558
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,200
You don't remember?

559
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,020
Hyun-seung brought you home.

560
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,220
What?

561
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,190
Who?

562
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,790
Why?

563
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,330
My thoughts exactly.

564
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,600
Why did he carry you home?

565
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,430
I was so shocked.

566
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
Hey!

567
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Did you drunk dial him?

568
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,070
Check your phone.

569
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,110
Darn.

570
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,370
Huh?

571
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,890
You didn't call him.

572
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,380
Then how?

573
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,330
(Manager Yoon.)

574
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,520
It's Chae Hyun-seung.

575
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,290
What took you so long?

576
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,800
I've missed you so much.

577
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,390
(I'm sorry I still like you.)

578
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,330
I'm really sorry.

579
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,970
Gosh.

580
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,810
Oh, my gosh!

581
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,410
Omo! I must've been crazy.

582
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,410
What?

583
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,020
I must be crazy!

584
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,210
-Good morning.
-Morning.

585
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,540
-Good morning.
-Morning.

586
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,740
Good morning.

587
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,110
Good morning.

588
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,300
What do you think, sir?

589
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,140
Don't they look much better
than the other ones?

590
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,770
What happened?

591
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,370
Did you ask for a reshoot?

592
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,680
I heard the director saw
the assistant's work

593
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,110
and criticized her.

594
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,980
Then she redid the whole shoot herself.

595
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,480
She's a big-shot photographer.

596
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,320
The quality alone proves it.

597
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,420
The products came out really nice.

598
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,900
This is Lee Hyo-joo.

599
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,170
(It's me, Lee Jae-shin.)

600
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,040
What's up?

601
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,070
I saw the product photos.

602
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,380
Oh, those photos?

603
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,840
I redid them because my assistant
didn't do justice.

604
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,210
(Don't get me wrong.)

605
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,520
You know I'm a perfectionist.

606
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,620
Thank you.

607
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,850
I want to repay this debt.

608
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,790
You don't have to.

609
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,790
But if you want, you can buy me lunch.

610
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,360
When's good for you?

611
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,750
How about today?

612
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,910
You must've been really thankful.

613
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,650
I know it's uncomfortable for you.

614
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,010
I picked a nice place,

615
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,520
but it's probably not what you're used to.

616
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,410
But their food is good.

617
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,530
Isn't this a must-eat place?

618
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,580
Why? Surprised that I know about it?

619
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,800
You think I only
eat at luxury restaurants?

620
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,470
Are you serious?

621
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,740
I'm not some princess.

622
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,440
I'll eat kimbap if I get off work late.

623
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,040
I'll have fried chicken and beer
with my coworkers too.

624
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,380
I never asked you to take me
to some fancy places.

625
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,550
All I asked for was to be with you.

626
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,860
You're right.

627
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,690
Your food is here.

628
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,730
Thank you.

629
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,830
Enjoy your meal.

630
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,100
Thanks for the food.

631
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,760
About yesterday...

632
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,630
Thanks for taking care of me.

633
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,930
And I'm sorry.

634
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,430
I shouldn't have said that.

635
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,180
I'm not completely over you,

636
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,110
even though I tried to hide it.

637
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,120
But you don't have to worry.

638
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,520
I won't bother you anymore.

639
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,760
Alright.

640
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,260
You're still here?

641
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,400
Hey.

642
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,700
Who is making my brother-in-law
work overtime?

643
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,700
This is unacceptable!

644
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,400
They're all gone.

645
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,440
How is Ji-seung?

646
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,340
You got in a fight again?

647
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,740
No.

648
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,490
It's just me sulking.

649
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:25,950
You have to stay longer?

650
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,750
Want to eat with me?

651
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,850
Not dinner.

652
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,890
How about a drink?

653
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,830
You said you were fine
with working with her again.

654
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,300
So I thought you were okay.

655
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,500
I thought it'd be okay,

656
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,160
but it wasn't.

657
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,080
It was hard not seeing her,

658
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,580
and it's hard seeing her.

659
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,480
It's been a year, right?

660
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,720
A year could be long or short.

661
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,730
But it's not enough to get over someone.

662
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,750
So how do you feel?

663
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,180
Will you be okay working with her?

664
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,930
I'm not sure yet.

665
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,230
In that case,

666
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,530
give it some time.

667
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,570
What's important is how you feel.

668
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,200
Focus on that.

669
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,210
Okay.

670
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,550
-Manager Yoo.
-Yes?

671
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,490
I'm going to drop by the Sales Team.

672
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,660
We'll visit some new stores,

673
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,060
so it's going to take a while.

674
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,730
Go home right away if it's too late.

675
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,530
Okay, I'll call you.

676
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,270
Thank you!

677
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,800
-Have mine too.
-Thanks, Hyun-seung.

678
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,240
(Ladies and gentlemen,)

679
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,290
(this is an announcement
about the fire drill)

680
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:01,140
(to be conducted by the Safety Team.)

681
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,980
Wow, the announcement is loud today.

682
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,040
I know, right?

683
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,920
(Based on Article No. 25
regarding fire prevention,)

684
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,590
(fire fighting equipment
installation and maintenance,)

685
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,320
(we will conduct
a comprehensive fire drill)

686
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,110
(from 8 p.m. to midnight.)

687
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:19,260
This announcement reminds me
of someone I know.

688
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,400
Who is it?

689
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,130
He was with his girlfriend for six years.

690
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,830
They were at a concert
when the fire alarm went off.

691
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,380
But nobody moves instantly

692
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,410
because it could just be a drill.

693
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,370
Right.

694
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,730
He was wondering what it was,

695
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,180
and they were told to evacuate.

696
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,030
Then there really was a fire.

697
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,050
Yes.

698
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,750
So he turned to his side
to grab his girlfriend,

699
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,750
so that they could get out.

700
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:42,780
But she wasn't there.

701
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,520
She'd already run for her life?

702
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,620
Yes.

703
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,290
He looked for her,

704
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,960
and she was down near the entrance.

705
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,490
So? What happened between them?

706
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,960
He broke up with her that day.

707
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,060
She left him at a dire moment like that.

708
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,400
He saw her true colors.

709
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,590
He was going to marry her though.

710
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,830
Good for him.

711
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,500
This is why a couple
has to experience a crisis.

712
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,310
Words are no use.

713
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,300
Your actions show who you are.

714
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,910
How could she do that after six years?

715
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,660
Whether she loved him or not,

716
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,110
she's probably a heartless person.

717
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:14,540
Let's say it happens to you.

718
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,490
Will you grab your husband and run?

719
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,850
Of course.

720
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,250
Wait. You're not going to?

721
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,620
Of course, I will.

722
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,830
But I know my wife won't.

723
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,290
She doesn't even cook for me these days.

724
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,670
Don't be sad.

725
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,640
We'll take good care of you.

726
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,680
This is making me sadder.

727
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,640
Thanks, Hyun-seung.

728
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,110
Let's join hands.

729
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:56,860
You're leaving now?

730
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,860
Yes.

731
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,330
Why are you here at this hour?

732
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,530
I left something at the office.

733
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,430
Bye then.

734
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,430
Bye.

735
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,540
(Attention!)

736
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,360
(A fire emergency has been reported
in the building.)

737
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,290
(Proceed to the nearest emergency exit.)

738
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,850
(Do not use elevators.)

739
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,210
(Walk down the stairwells
to the ground floor.)

740
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,120
Let's go!

741
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,190
What?

742
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,180
Hurry!

743
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,300
Manager Yoon!

744
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,520
Hurry up!

745
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,470
Senior Yoon!

746
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,730
What?

747
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:40,440
It's a fire drill.

748
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,440
What?

749
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,750
They're doing a system check.
It's not a fire.

750
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,600
I'm sorry.

751
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,960
I didn't know about that.

752
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,370
I'll get going then.

753
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,110
I have to go up.

754
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,680
Sorry.

755
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,090
Is my life that important?

756
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,240
At least you're not heartless.

757
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,350
I'm other things, too.

758
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,680
Goodbye then.

759
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,800
How was today's meeting?

760
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,970
It went well.

761
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,340
The chef liked the curriculum I set up.

762
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,480
Nice.

763
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,780
Aren't you tired?

764
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,880
It's not easy dealing with people.

765
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,120
Sometimes there's a difficult client,

766
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,520
but it's mostly fun.

767
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,250
I'm getting more clients too.

768
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,390
Don't overwork yourself.

769
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:16,280
I know. I'm doing this because it's fun.

770
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,640
Yeon-seung,

771
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:29,900
do you want to go on a trip?

772
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,030
A trip?

773
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,510
Does Ha-eun want to go somewhere?

774
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,100
Not with her. Just the two of us.

775
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,510
The two of us?

776
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,420
Sure.

777
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,750
Let's go where you want then.

778
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,560
Okay.

780
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,440
(I'll be by your side.)

781
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,610
Until you can accept yourself
just as you are.

782
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,110
Just until then.

783
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:19,680
Let's go!

784
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,620
Huh?

785
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,610
Hurry!

786
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,300
(I'm not completely over you.)

787
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:41,500
Even though I tried to hide it.

788
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,220
I'm other things, too.

789
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,480
(I'm sorry I still like you.)

790
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,880
(So how do you feel?)

791
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,970
Hold it. Sorry.

792
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,000
Hello.

793
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,680
I'm sorry.

794
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,710
Excuse me.

795
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,390
Wait!

796
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,540
I'm sorry.

797
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,570
(KLAR Factory 1)

798
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,840
Please make modifications
to the renewed products

799
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,450
as we discussed earlier.

800
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,710
When can we get the fixed samples?

801
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,280
Sometime next week?

802
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,950
Wednesday, I think.

803
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,940
Okay.

804
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,260
It won't change much, will it?

805
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,270
Do we have to do another
container suitability test?

806
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:32,210
There are some changes
to the ingredients, so we should.

807
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,680
That won't affect
our production timeline, will it?

808
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,410
It won't, as long as everything's
decided this month.

809
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,180
We'll be sure to do that.

810
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,130
Okay.

811
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,520
You're leaving right away?

812
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,780
It's dinner time soon. Let's go eat.

813
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,960
That sounds good.

814
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,630
What about you?

815
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,360
We need to go back in.

816
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,900
We still have work to do.

817
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,800
I'm sorry.

818
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,270
Alright. Bye then.

819
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,800
Thank you.

820
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,700
Good work.

Good work. Safe travels.

00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,590
Okay.

824
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,020
You want me to drop you off at the office?

825
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,060
Yes.

826
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,780
Can we stop by somewhere first?

827
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,660
Here you go.

828
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,530
Thank you.

829
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,070
Have a good day.

830
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,790
Here.

831
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,360
Seems like you're having an upset stomach.

832
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:59,860
Thank you.

833
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,570
I can drive if that's okay with you.

834
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:56,820
If this is how you act,

835
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,520
can you still hide your feelings?

836
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,340
You said you won't bother me.

837
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,250
You're being selfish.

838
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,920
If you're going to act this way,

839
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,090
go ahead.

840
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,090
Try to win me over, Yoon Song-ah.
