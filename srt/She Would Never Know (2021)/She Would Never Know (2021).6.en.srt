1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,820
(All places, characters, firms and events
depicted in this show are fictitious.)

2
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,110
This is crazy

3
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,120
Hey!

4
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,390
Seriously!

5
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,230
Your head! Hey!

6
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,180
(Episode 6)

7
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,850
Drink it.

8
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,620
Don't forget this!

9
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,800
(Seven hours ago)

10
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,970
Geez, why are you so heavy?
(Seven hours ago)

11
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,970
My password is my birthday.

12
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,500
I know. You said that a hundred times.

13
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,120
Is it this one?

14
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,820
I can hear my house crumbling down.

15
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,960
No.

16
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,130
Mind the steps!

17
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,600
Slow down.

18
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,770
Good. Slow down.

19
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,670
You're as big as a bear.

20
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,040
Hyun-seung, let me take your bag off.

21
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,430
-My bag...
-Sit up.

22
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,550
-I don't have my bag.
-Sit up.

23
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,850
Head.

24
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,470
Ow, you pulled out my hair.

25
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
Why are you laughing?

26
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,600
Hyun-seung, you know
this is your house, right?

27
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,070
I'm going home now. Bye.

28
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,970
No.

29
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,570
Why can't I go?

30
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,640
Let go!

31
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,310
-Let go!
-No, never.

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,250
Stop! You're being bad!

33
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,180
You're the worst.

34
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,550
I'll leave now.

35
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,030
What do you want me to do?

36
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,030
Let's go.

37
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,670
Huh?

38
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,990
Let's go.

39
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,420
-Let's go!
-Where?

40
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,470
Sit here, please.

41
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,770
Sit down, please. Okay, thank you.

42
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,210
Okay.

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,050
Wait a second.

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,950
What are you going to do?

45
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,710
Here.

46
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,210
These are all yours.

47
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,180
-Huh?
-Eat it all.

48
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,620
Oh! Okay.

49
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,090
It's 100% juice...

50
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,710
Drink it.

51
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,610
I can leave after I finish this, is it?

52
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,280
Finish it. It's good for your health.

53
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,150
Seriously.

54
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,920
Open your mouth.

55
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,080
You better remember this tomorrow.

56
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,530
Don't forget this!

57
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,010
You eat well.

58
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,780
You're pretty.

59
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,880
Pretty.

60
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,520
What?

61
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,820
What are you going to do now?

62
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,730
I'll see you tomorrow.

63
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,700
(Starting from tomorrow,
we don't know each other.)

64
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,790
(Don't ever talk to me.)

65
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,040
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

66
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,180
Yes, bit by bit...

67
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,810
Why did you drink so much?

68
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,350
You're not even a newbie.

69
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,550
It could've been hard to decline

70
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,050
since it was your first time.

71
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,990
Did they force you to drink?

72
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,680
No, it wasn't like that.

73
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,510
Why did you get drunk then?
That's not like you.

74
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,630
Well...

75
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,800
I wanted to do well.

76
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,870
Do well?

77
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,340
I wanted to fit in and adapt well,
so that you wouldn't worry.

78
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,610
Though I made you worry in the end.

79
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,350
I taught you wrong.

80
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,850
It's good to fit in,

81
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,620
but you must know how much you can handle.

82
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,680
Also, I never worry about you.

83
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,230
You're already doing well.

84
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,620
Why would I worry about
someone who's doing well?

85
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,640
In fact, you did too well yesterday.

86
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
Anyway, don't let this happen again.

87
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,240
Alright.

88
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,400
This is for you.

89
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,780
How do you feel?

90
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,210
I'm fine.

91
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,990
Why were you there last night though?

92
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,890
I was passing by.

93
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,160
The place?

94
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,890
Yes.

95
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,490
Let's go, we have to work.

96
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,660
Passing by?

97
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,730
Yes!

98
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,230
Come quickly!

99
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,570
Okay.

100
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,370
The reason I asked for the two of you

101
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,880
is because the chairman
demanded something.

102
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,200
Do you have data comparing between
the color cosmetics

103
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,950
of global brands and that of our brand?

104
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,410
Something about managing products or SKU?

105
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,820
We do, but it still has some rough edges.

106
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,050
(SKU (Stock Keeping Unit):
Number of products being managed)
We do, but it still has some rough edges.

107
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,610
How long will it take
if you two work on it together?

108
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,460
I can't be sure.

109
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,430
It's impossible to finish it by today.

110
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,260
Send it to me as soon as possible then.

111
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,130
After we presented the Europe Project,

112
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,930
he's gotten very interested
in color cosmetics.

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,170
You may leave now.

114
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,410
Sir, there's something I need to tell you.

115
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,040
What is it?

116
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,010
In this project, I...

117
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,250
I'll tell him.

118
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,890
I'll tell him about that.

119
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,380
What is it about?

120
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,020
ABM Yoon's mother lives alone.

121
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,780
So?

122
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,190
So it's hard for her to leave for
Europe for several years.

123
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,150
She's the only child.

124
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,090
So she's decided not to go?

125
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,390
Yes.

126
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,530
That can't be helped. What else can we do?

127
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,500
Find an alternative quickly.

128
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,970
Okay.

129
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,960
To meet your deadline,

130
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,630
it'll be really hard
to start from the design.

131
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,370
However, we can modify
what you're wearing...

132
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,610
I'll just go with this one.

133
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,970
Really?

134
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,310
But you have to meet the deadline
no matter what it takes.

135
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,920
-I'll leave now.
-Good job today.

136
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,530
What time is it?

137
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,360
-Good work. Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

138
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:44,890
Goodbye.

139
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,230
I sent the report form already.
Fill in and send it back to me.

140
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,620
Yes, sir.

141
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,310
If you're feeling uncomfortable,
you don't have to do it here.

142
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,970
It's okay, sir.

143
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,980
Do as you wish.

144
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,650
I'm stepping outside for a bit.

145
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,500
Do you have a lot of work to do?

146
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,060
Do you need help?

147
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,900
No, it's okay. Go home.

148
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,240
Hey, Chae Hyun-seung!

149
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,540
Can't you show up in a normal way?

150
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,350
No. This is my charm.

151
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,250
Are you off work? Want to grab dinner?

152
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,520
Dinner?

153
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,250
Up for it?

154
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,830
Is that a yes?

155
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:57,900
What the...

156
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,550
What the...

157
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,490
I just don't feel like eating alone today.

158
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,830
This is the sandwich you like.

159
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,800
This is the strawberry milk you like.

160
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,470
This is mine.

161
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,270
What? Do you need something else?

162
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Did I not bring wet wipes?

163
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,770
I'm okay.

164
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
It's just work.

165
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,020
Man.

166
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,820
You know what I'm thinking
even before I tell you.

167
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,910
It's so rewarding, being your boyfriend.

168
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,190
Just eat already.

169
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,750
Okay.

170
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,690
Seems like you need to write
a lot of reports these days.

171
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,760
Apparently, the company
is preparing a huge project.

172
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,570
So the chairman asked for
a bunch of information.

173
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,730
Oh, even the chairman?

174
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,390
Yes.

175
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,460
Are you on the fast track to success now?

176
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,780
Become an assistant manager
at a young age, and all the way to BM?

177
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,920
Why? Do you want me to guide you?

178
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,850
I'll be so grateful if you do.

179
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,920
I'll trust you and follow you.

180
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,490
I can never beat you.

181
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:34,990
Thanks for the food.

182
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,290
Enjoy your meal.

183
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,110
How may I help you?

184
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,540
Huh? Son!

185
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,780
Lee Se-dong's son, Mr. Lee Jae-shin?

186
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,650
Yes.

187
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,690
I told you my son works in a huge company.

188
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,260
How could you not believe me?

189
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,230
My son graduated from
the best university in Korea!

190
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,630
What's going on?

191
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,540
Mr. Lee Se-dong is
the victim of an assault.

192
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,310
The assailant is the man next to him.

193
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,540
-Ouch!
-Sheesh.

194
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,610
He can agree to a settlement...

195
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,150
I'll never agree to a settlement!

196
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,180
Then what?

197
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,270
You want to put him in jail?

198
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,460
You committed attempted fraud against him,

199
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,050
don't you know that?

200
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,520
I was wronged!

201
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,390
He was looking for a way
to earn some money,

202
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,150
so I recommended him

203
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,230
an investment scheme.

204
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,000
But I didn't know it was a fraud.

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,270
I was conned too!

206
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,330
And what's with your attitude?

207
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,260
I'm the sole victim here! Huh?

208
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,680
You swindler!

209
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,640
Seriously.

210
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,910
Sit down!

211
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,450
We'll find out the truth
after investigating his case.

212
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,320
We called you because he said
you can be his guarantor.

213
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,650
Can you do it?

214
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,430
We shouldn't have settled like that.

215
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,620
Why did you agree
to take that little money?

216
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,100
Didn't you go to a top university?

217
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,270
I got hit for nothing.

218
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,410
Hey, let's go somewhere for a bite.

219
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,510
I was in there for hours. I'm so hungry.

220
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,610
Hey! Where are you going?

221
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,960
Give me some money before you go.

222
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,970
I need money.

223
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,660
If I got a better settlement,
that would've solved my problem.

224
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,270
But I didn't because of you,

225
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,330
so you have to give me money.

226
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,770
So? Can you give it to me now?

227
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,290
Or

228
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,670
should I pay you a visit to your office?

229
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,950
You still work
at that shiny building, right?

230
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,089
Text me your account number.

231
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,510
I'll treat you to
something good next time.

232
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,250
If you insist.

233
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,040
Take care.

234
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,300
You, too.

235
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,270
Bye.

236
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,870
Jae-woon's sister took some pills

237
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,170
because of me.

238
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,880
After that, Jae-woon asked me
to marry his sister.

239
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,620
It was actually an order.

240
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,820
I had no option to refuse the order.

241
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,520
I had no choice but to marry her.

242
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,590
I can't get out

243
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,160
unless they let me go.

244
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,830
I just have to live like this.

245
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,280
So don't let me ruin

246
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,510
your opportunity to go to Europe.

247
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,170
I won't either.

248
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,080
I'm just an unpleasant eyesore
to you now, right?

249
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,120
Sooner or later, you won't even
care about me anymore.

250
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,590
Don't miss this golden chance
simply because of me.

251
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,600
Just focus on what's good for you.

252
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,230
You've always wanted a chance like this.

253
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,720
So pretty!

254
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
You're so pretty, Ha-eun!

255
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,190
It's so pretty.

256
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,560
Do you like it too, Ha-eun?

257
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,450
Your dresses are the prettiest
in the world.

258
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,700
You're even prettier.

259
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,060
Happy birthday, Ha-eun.

260
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,800
Thanks.

261
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,500
Go get changed so that
you can wear it on your birthday.

262
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,300
No, I want to wear this home.

263
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,040
It'll get wrinkled.

264
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,570
You can iron it for me.

265
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,080
Geez.

266
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,620
Can't you make dresses, Mom?

267
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,520
Why? Do you want me to make one for you?

268
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,890
Aunt Ji-seung makes dresses

269
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,030
while Uncle Hyun-seung makes cosmetics.

270
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,030
But you stay at home all the time.

271
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,200
What do you mean?

272
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,300
I'm busy raising you to be a pretty girl.

273
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,380
Do you want me to work?

274
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,050
Like Aunt Ji-seung?

275
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,320
No, you should do whatever you want.

276
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,450
Your favorite thing is raising me.

277
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,450
Of course.

278
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,230
So there's nothing wrong
with the mascara container?

279
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,000
Nothing changed?

280
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,170
(The post-process and the thickness)

281
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,460
(are the same as before.)

282
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
(Shall I make the container thicker?)

283
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,610
What about the cost variance then?

284
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,980
(There's not much difference.)

285
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,050
Then ask the manufacturer to...

286
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,850
Huh?

287
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,050
(See you downstairs!)

288
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,190
Oh, yes.

289
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,630
Here.

290
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,970
Thanks.

291
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,760
I should be buying.

292
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,940
No, it's okay.

293
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,810
When did you get back to Korea?

294
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,100
It's not the time for you
to return to the office yet.

295
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,610
I still have a few months left.

296
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,410
I dropped in because
I had something to report.

297
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,650
How have you been?

298
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,420
I hear your work is excellent, as always.

299
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,050
I'm just doing my best.

300
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,490
Don't work too much though.

301
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,530
So that you can work hard when I return.

302
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,100
The BM position in your team
might become vacant.

303
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,670
I have my eye on it.

304
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,870
Oh...

305
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,140
Wait, you know about that?

306
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,180
Are you involved in the Europe Project?

307
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,010
No. They did make an offer,

308
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,950
but I'm not sure.

309
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,620
Why?

310
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,320
It's such a good opportunity.
You have to take it.

311
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,560
Something is keeping you here?

312
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,090
Family? Boyfriend?

313
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,130
No.

314
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,770
I'm just wondering
if I'm qualified enough to go.

315
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,420
Oh? It's BM Choi. When did she come back?

316
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Who is she?

317
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,540
She's at the European branch office.

318
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,460
She's a real hotshot.

319
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,800
Hello.

320
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,840
-I'm the one who contacted you.
-Nice to meet you.

321
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,090
Come this way, please.

322
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Hyun-seung.

323
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,480
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,480
Go inside and get more freebies.

325
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,350
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,400
Please open them too.

327
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,990
We should organize it

328
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,720
in order to avoid confusion later.

329
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,360
Okay.

330
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,280
Sir!

331
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,580
We couldn't reach the model.

332
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,190
So the male model couldn't come?

333
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,550
They said he left,

334
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,830
but we couldn't get a hold of him.

335
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,550
There's no substitute, is it?

336
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,450
What did the agency say?

337
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,230
All the A-list models are booked.

338
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,340
Those who are available
aren't suitable for cosmetics.

339
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,470
What should we do?

340
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,140
We can't do this without a male model.

341
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,910
It's the main part.

342
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,710
I know.

343
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,050
Should I get prepared then?

344
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,510
Don't I look dandy today?

345
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,080
Just say something if I'm not.
It's awkward if you

346
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,050
don't say anything.

347
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,210
Did you invite male beauty influencers?

348
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,920
Yes, there're a few of them.
Should I ask them?

349
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,890
Let's call them first.

350
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,190
Where's the list?

351
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,100
Hyun-seung has it.

352
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,500
Hyun-seung!

353
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,060
Yes?

354
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,170
You have the list, right?

355
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:15,950
Huh?

356
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,550
Wait!

357
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,010
Wait for a second...

358
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,140
Me?

359
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,610
Hyun-seung, turn around.

360
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,450
Look, he's perfect.

361
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,750
There's no need to find someone else.

362
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,630
He has great complexion and build.

363
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,140
He's practically a model.

364
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,060
Isn't that right, sir?

365
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,380
Is it okay?

366
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,070
We're not forcing you,
so don't feel pressured.

367
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,930
Do whatever you like.

368
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,340
He seems to feel uncomfortable.

369
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,300
Find someone from our clients.

370
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,700
I'll do it.

371
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,880
I'll do it. I'll try it out.

372
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,910
That's a great decision. We're safe now.

373
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,280
Thanks, Hyun-seung.

374
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,280
Let's get you changed.

375
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,350
Help him with it, Song-ah.

376
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,120
Okay. Let's go, Hyun-seung.

377
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,520
Okay.

378
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,500
I'll go inside and get ready.

379
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,810
We should do a final check.

380
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,960
I'll make preparations.

381
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,430
Do the clothes fit well?

382
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,730
Yes, they do.

383
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,940
Give that to me.

384
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,010
We don't have much time.
Come here quickly.

385
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,610
Okay.

386
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,580
Wow, you have a great complexion.

387
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,350
It's better than
the beauty product models.

388
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm flattered.

389
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,250
I'll style your hair first.

390
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,060
Okay.

391
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,070
All done.

392
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,400
Thank you.

393
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,440
(Hello, everyone.)

394
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,360
First of all, I'd like to thank
all the VIP clients

395
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,720
who took time out of their busy schedule

396
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,990
to come to the KLAR event.

397
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,320
This event is a beauty class
for our VIP clients.

398
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,590
It will be led by the makeup artist,
Jeon Hyun-hong.

399
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,770
Before we start, let's watch
a short video from KLAR.

400
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,980
(Welcome to KLAR's VIP Beauty Class!)

401
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,480
Get the artist and
female model ready first.

402
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,550
Already?

403
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,020
Hyun-seung has only
gotten his hair styled.

404
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,680
Song-ah, help him with the skincare then.
You can do it, right?

405
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,690
Yes, I can...

406
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,200
Okay, I'll do it.

407
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,200
Great. Please follow me.

408
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,500
Thank you for doing it.

409
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,070
Ignore my clumsiness, okay?

410
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,910
You'll do fine. Don't worry.

411
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,980
Senior Yoon.

412
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,580
Huh?

413
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,310
Can I ask you something?

414
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,410
What?

415
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,490
Are you going to Europe?

416
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,960
How did you know about that?

417
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,570
No matter what your decision is,
I'll support you.

418
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,480
I really wanted to say that.

419
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,290
They ask for the male model now.

420
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,060
Okay!

421
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,260
Okay.

422
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,620
Hurry up.

423
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,150
(KLAR's VIP Beauty Class Invitation)

424
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,850
Let's jump into the next stage
of KLAR's makeup world.
(KLAR's VIP Beauty Class Invitation)

425
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,030
Let's jump into the next stage
of KLAR's makeup world.

426
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,230
The model is very handsome, isn't he?

427
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,230
Yes!

428
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,170
Please give him a round of applause
so he'll do well today.

429
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,540
Thank you.

430
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,180
You should brighten up three spots
with the foundation.

431
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,920
First,

432
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,120
the forehead.

433
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,190
Then, the ridge of the nose.

434
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,130
Lastly, the triangle zone.

435
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,930
Keep the amount to a bare minimum.

436
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,500
The shade should be one level
brighter than the skin.

437
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,820
How many levels? Yes, one level.

438
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,810
Go along the texture of the skin.
Do it gently.

439
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,610
Will you face the audience?

440
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,300
Thank goodness, he's doing well.

441
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,790
I can do well too.

442
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
Never.

443
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,570
You can just say no. Why say never?

444
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:55,500
It often looks awkward
because of the color difference.

445
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,070
Brighten the front part of the neck
with the same shade

446
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,670
to give it a three-dimensional effect.

447
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,140
(No matter what your decision is,
I'll support you.)

448
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,170
If you apply it vertically
and horizontally,

449
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,920
it will fix better on the skin.

450
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,320
Now, I'll show you
how to apply lip products.

451
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,690
Hello.

452
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,360
You can give it to me.

453
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,910
Here.

454
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,510
Please follow me. This way.

455
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
I'm sorry.

456
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,100
Excuse me!

457
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,890
We met before, haven't we?

458
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,830
We met at the store the other time.

459
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,700
Don't you remember?

460
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,170
Hello.

461
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,840
I thought you were a store employee.

462
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,640
Turns out you're from HQ.

463
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,170
KLAR Team.

464
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,580
Yoon Song-ah.

465
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,160
I have to go now.

466
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,990
Okay, bye.

467
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,050
Are you going inside?

468
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,370
No, I'm done.

469
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,290
Wow, this is great. How much is it?

470
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,420
3,000 won?

471
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,460
It's cheap and good.

472
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,909
Hi, I'm here.

473
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,130
Welcome.

474
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,739
Bracken and bellflower roots.

475
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,780
Okay.

476
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,510
It's for my husband's memorial service,

477
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,830
so give me the best ones.

478
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,670
Okay, you're so fussy.

479
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,250
What about your daughter?

480
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,640
She's on her way.

481
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,660
By the way, shouldn't she get married now?

482
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,610
My nephew works in Seoul too.

483
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,590
Should I set them up?

484
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,000
She's only 28 years old.
She's too young to get married.

485
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,240
Stop talking nonsense
and give me my stuff.

486
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,450
Alright.

487
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,860
Why is everyone interested
in her marriage?

488
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,180
She's my daughter.

489
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,340
Wait a minute, is this girl coming or not?

490
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,500
Sheesh.

491
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,400
Yes.

492
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,610
Have you reached?

493
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,750
Yes.

494
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,360
Don't get into a fight with her.

495
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,470
I know, don't worry.

496
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,720
(We're closed for today.)

497
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,760
Spend the night there.
(We're closed for today.)

498
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,190
Okay, I'll call you.

499
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,360
Okay.

500
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,940
(My lovely dear.)

501
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,530
Hey, you're home?

502
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,930
Sweetie! Where are you?

503
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,570
Huh?

504
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,070
Sweetie!

505
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,980
When did you get here?

506
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,010
Throw these away.

507
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,250
And Dad's photos too.

508
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,090
Why sleep in the living room
when you have your own room?

509
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,050
You just came home
and you're nagging me already.

510
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,020
Also,

511
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,330
they represent your father.

512
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,090
Why would I throw them away?

513
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,300
They're precious.

514
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,520
All done.

515
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,540
Really?

516
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,290
Let's see.

517
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,820
Great, it's sturdy and good.

518
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,610
The task is done.

519
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:21,130
Why order self-assembly furniture
when you can't do it?

520
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,800
Why do you think I did?
Because it's cheap.

521
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,000
Didn't you do well
in the finance business?

522
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,970
Where did all that money go?

523
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,430
Where do you think it went?

524
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:35,150
I bought you meals and drinks
when you were in school.

525
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,690
I don't recall you buying me anything.

526
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,540
I did. Think hard.

527
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,760
Okay, I'll think about it on my way home.

528
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,690
Bye.

529
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:45,990
What?

530
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,370
What are all those?
How can I do that all by myself?

531
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,030
I called someone to help you out.

532
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,700
Who?

533
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,640
Why would you call me

534
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,310
on a weekend?

535
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,880
I hope your dad enjoys the food.

536
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,840
He loved my radish sprouts.

537
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,790
So, how are you doing?

538
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,320
If you hung up like that,
you should've called back.

539
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,020
Don't you wonder
if your mother is dead or alive?

540
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,790
Did something happen last time?

541
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,320
It sounded like you were crying.

542
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,490
Let's hold Dad's memorial
at a temple or somewhere else.

543
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,070
What are you talking about?

544
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,310
It's been 13 years since he left.

545
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,440
You're still young.

546
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,230
You should make a fresh start.

547
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:32,000
Are you telling me to
abandon your father and get married?

548
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,590
Abandon who?

549
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,130
He died a long time ago.

550
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,910
You're one heartless girl.

551
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,910
Your father means so much to me.

552
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,880
How could you tell me to abandon him

553
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,750
and go find another man?

554
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,290
What kind of daughter are you?

555
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,920
Are you, by any chance,

556
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,180
trying to get rid of me
because of your boyfriend?

557
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,600
What kind of person was he?

558
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,640
What?

559
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,680
Was Dad such a great person

560
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,230
for you to be devoted like this?

561
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,480
What are you talking about?

562
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,500
Of course, your dad was a good person.

563
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,600
He behaved socially even without laws.

564
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,320
He loved me so much.
He was good to you too.

565
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:22,190
I can't believe how ungrateful you are!

566
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,490
Huh? Where are you going?

567
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,610
You haven't finished eating.

568
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,010
I finished it.

569
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,710
Seriously, that girl.

570
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,070
Every time...she does this

571
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,910
Thanks for working so hard!

572
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,660
It was worth raising you,
my precious juniors!

573
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,620
So that's why you bought us meals
when we were in school.

574
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,400
It was all for today.

575
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,890
Right? I bought you a lot of meals, right?

576
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,930
But why don't you remember?

577
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,750
You bought meals mainly for girls.

578
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,140
I acknowledge that.

579
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,440
But among the guys,
I treated you the best.

580
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,290
By the way, about the money I spent on
buying you drinks...

581
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:57,790
You can pay me back
by hanging out with me until I die.

582
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,510
That's too harsh.

583
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,680
I didn't even drink that much.

584
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,760
I'll just pay you back in cash.

585
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,610
Keep it.

586
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,380
Anyway,

587
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,530
accidental death can't be helped.

588
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,720
I'll deal with dying of hunger.

589
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,240
You two are responsible
to prevent me from dying alone.

590
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:14,640
Including me?

591
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,480
It'll bore me if I see
the same person all the time.

592
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,190
You're being picky
under such circumstances?

593
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm good at scheming.

594
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,820
You're almost like a loan shark.

595
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:24,670
Man.

596
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,890
This won't do.

597
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,500
Huh?

598
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:32,430
I should find a woman for him.

599
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,610
There must be an angel out there

600
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,790
who will take him in.

601
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,040
You don't have any preferences, do you?

602
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,240
Nope. None.

603
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,300
Okay.

604
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,440
That's wise.

605
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,940
Got anyone?

606
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,670
I'm in the lobby.

607
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,450
Okay, I'll wait. Take your time.

608
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,910
Did you, by any chance, come to see me?

609
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,060
I guess not.

610
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,710
What brings you here?

611
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,690
If it's okay for you,
would you like to have lunch with me?

612
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,080
It's lunchtime.

613
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,440
Sir, you're on your way
to a lunch meeting.

614
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,720
I can cancel it.

615
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,240
It was planned a month ago, so you can't.

616
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,630
I can make the impossible possible.

617
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,710
Yes, I'm quite competent.

618
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,230
I made plans already.

619
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,400
Oh, I guess not today then.

620
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,490
But we'll see each other soon.

621
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,340
You'll soon be able to buy
the lipstick you were looking for.

622
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,130
When you get the word,
you can come anytime you want.

623
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,740
I'll doll up and wait for you.

624
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,080
Ji-seung!

625
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,800
Hey!

626
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,020
What brings you here?

627
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,650
The pop-up store project.

628
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,270
I've decided to do it.

629
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,160
You did?

630
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,650
You're on a roll!

631
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,790
But I don't know
if I made the right decision.

632
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,860
I don't know if I can
handle a bigger business.

633
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,300
You'll do great. I guarantee it.

634
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,400
You've gotten thin.

635
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,120
Something happened?

636
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,130
Me?

637
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,710
I'm fine.

638
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,180
For real. Nothing happened.

639
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,500
Do you want me to set you up
on blind dates?

640
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,690
It's better for you to go.

641
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,910
How's it going with the blind date
Yeon-seung mentioned before?

642
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,100
I don't know.

643
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,330
By the way...

644
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:28,890
What?

645
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,000
Is it easy to reproduce
a discontinued makeup product?

646
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,320
For example, lipstick.

647
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,380
Of course not.

648
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,000
We have to revive a dead product line.

649
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,920
The process is complicated,

650
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,790
and it doesn't always succeed.

651
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,750
It's harder than increasing
the production volume.

652
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,610
Why do you ask?

653
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:45,320
Huh?

654
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,750
No reason. Have your lunch.

655
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,410
Okay, I'll be right there.

656
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,620
Manager Yoo.

657
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,030
She went to the training team.

658
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,740
ABM Yoon, come with me to the store.

659
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,140
It's urgent, so get ready immediately.

660
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,060
Yes, sir.

661
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,510
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, sir.

662
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:28,940
Hello, sir.

663
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,950
Are you an employee?

664
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,490
Yes, I'm ABM Yoon Song-ah from KLAR.

665
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,050
I thought you'd be curious
about the products.

666
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,680
She knows everything
about color cosmetics.

667
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,990
Is that so? Nice to meet you.

668
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,320
This snack tastes better
when I eat it like this.

669
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,500
You already ate a lot at lunch.

670
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,560
The cafeteria lunch wasn't enough for me.

671
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,070
Manager Ahn? Hey!

672
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,970
What's on your mind?

673
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,050
Why is BM Lee taking Song-ah everywhere?

674
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,190
Is there something going on?

675
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,910
Senior Yoon left with BM Lee?

676
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,600
Yes.

677
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,190
They hurriedly went to the store.

678
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:22,470
It's not good to be
called to urgent matters.

679
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,510
Still,

680
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,330
there must be something going on.

681
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,060
You must be really exhausted
with all the wild thoughts.

682
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,460
You make me more exhausted.

683
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,650
Yes, hello?
This is Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

684
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,580
I'm Chief Kim.

685
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,570
Oh, yes. Hello.

686
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,980
Hi, is ABM Yoon Song-ah not in?

687
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,510
She's on outside duty right now.
You can talk to me.

688
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,590
What?

689
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,110
We took special care
in displaying the products.

690
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,040
As you can see,
the eyeliners are over here.

691
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,950
The front part here is the skincare line.

692
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,930
The lipsticks I told you about
are our main items,

693
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,390
so we placed it close to the entrance.

694
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,300
Would you like to see it?

695
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,300
Darn it!

696
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,630
I saw you take it.

697
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,360
You saw it wrong.

698
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,430
Go check on them.

699
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,700
Show me what's in your pocket.

700
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,110
Why should I?

701
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,630
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.

702
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,650
Call then!

703
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,330
What's going on?

704
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,390
This girl stole a product,
but she insists she didn't.

705
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,800
I didn't steal it!

706
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,190
Let me see what's in your pocket then.

707
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,670
Why should I show it to you?

708
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,750
You should prove me wrong.

709
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,200
Are you sure she stole it?

710
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,690
Yes, she definitely stole it.

711
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,450
There are surveillance cameras, right?

712
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,460
Yes.

713
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,160
But it's a blind spot,
so it might not be on the camera.

714
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,370
I should call the police.

715
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,120
Just send them away.

716
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,480
This isn't important right now.

717
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,130
Just send them away?

718
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,490
What's the problem?

719
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,990
What's going on?

720
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,390
This student stole a product, sir.

721
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,990
I told you I didn't!

722
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,320
You're confident
you didn't steal it, right?

723
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,940
Right! I didn't steal!

724
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:17,310
How many times do I have to say it?

725
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,530
You tell me.

726
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,160
She said she didn't steal it!

727
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,830
Not that. Tell me what you know.

728
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,570
She didn't steal.

729
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,940
Is that so?

730
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,790
You're at the age
where you want these things.

731
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,910
Fill a basket with all kinds of products.

732
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,040
Yes, sir.

733
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,910
I want to make a deal with you.

734
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,500
If you tell the truth,

735
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,960
I'll give you everything in that basket.

736
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,260
You'll really give me all of it?

737
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:15,770
Hey!

738
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:16,760
Of course.

739
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,020
Fill another basket.

740
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:19,890
Yes, sir.

741
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,900
Well...

742
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,430
Darn it! Seriously! Here!

743
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,970
I was just going to test it.

744
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,970
Let her go.

745
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,240
I can take these, right?

746
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,680
You said I can take them
if I tell the truth.

747
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,460
What have you done?

748
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,320
You got this back because of me.

749
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,680
Did you say your friend stole it?

750
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,220
You lost your chance while hesitating

751
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,640
for your shallow friendship.

752
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,210
If you ask for something
when you did nothing,

753
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,350
you become a thief too.

754
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:22,530
Don't you agree?

755
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,900
What a jerk!

756
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,110
Young ones and old ones alike...

757
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,720
They say they're friends and all,

758
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,660
but when there's profit involved,

759
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,520
they stab you in the back.

760
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,660
That's why you shouldn't
let strangers in your house.

761
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,500
Things that need to
stay outside must stay outside.

762
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,610
Let's go.

763
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:23,270
So the package was misprinted
for the re-produced lipstick?

764
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,890
Yes, the previous one
was for limited edition,

765
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,080
so Senior Yoon sent them a new one.

766
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,970
But they printed the previous one.

767
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,450
I'm sorry, I must've been out of my mind.

768
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,190
The event will take place
two days later, isn't it?

769
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,100
Director Lee is paying
extra attention to it.

770
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,650
Can we ship it tomorrow
if we print a new one now?

771
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,550
They said it's possible
tomorrow afternoon.

772
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,110
It can't be shipped tomorrow then.

773
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,580
Well,

774
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,380
let's report to BM Lee first.

775
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,130
Oh, stickers!

776
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,640
That's what Senior Yoon did
when they misprinted the leaflet.

777
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,180
Can't we do that this time?

778
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,100
I don't see why not.

779
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:01,430
We can take care of
the urgent ones that way.

780
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:02,880
You can make stickers quickly, right?

781
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,850
Yes, I'll tell them to make it quickly.

782
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,570
Attaching them is the problem.
Will the factory do it?

783
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,000
It's hard to get part-timers
on short notice,

784
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,750
and I can't go either.

785
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,880
I'll go then.
We need to send the stickers anyway.

786
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,730
Is that okay, Manager Kang?

787
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:20,120
Go if you want to suffer.

788
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,800
Why would you say that?

789
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,720
Proceed with the stickers first.

790
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,710
-Yes, ma'am.
-I'll ask the factory to get part-timers.

791
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,680
Let's see if you'll
need to go, Hyun-seung.

792
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,240
I'll report to BM Lee.

793
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,330
Okay.

794
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,150
Go on ahead.

795
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,850
Why would you put up with that?

796
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,750
You said they wouldn't let you go.

797
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,690
Then why are you being treated that way?

798
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,490
What's wrong with it?

799
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:12,830
In return, I can live like
a decent human being elsewhere.

800
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,930
I have to pay back my debt.

801
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,220
I think you've paid back plenty
for what you've been doing.

802
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:23,280
If that's not it...

803
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,410
Do you want to
keep your position that much?

804
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:28,880
Yes.

805
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,650
If I put up with being humiliated
by a few people,

806
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,710
no one will think I'm that criminal's son.

807
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,110
Is it because of your father...

808
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,820
I'm going to persevere.

809
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,150
No matter what.

810
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,700
That's why I need you.

811
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:57,520
You haven't changed a bit after two years.

812
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,430
You still live like the teenager
who had nothing.

813
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,800
I taped cushions on the stools
for your comfort.

814
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,100
Thank you.

815
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,290
I tried to get more part-timers,

816
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,080
but only the two of them are available.

817
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,840
And they only work until nine o'clock.

818
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,620
-Nine o'clock?
-Yes.

819
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,250
Thank you for doing this.

820
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:52,920
Sure.

821
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,740
The stickers?

822
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,270
Here, they are here.

823
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,710
Okay. Good luck.

824
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:59,320
Thanks.

825
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,540
Goodbye.

826
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,410
Bye.

827
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,290
Wow, when will you finish all of that?

828
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:05,260
Seems like you need to
pull an all-nighter.

829
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,530
-Goodbye!
-Bye.

830
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,810
Okay, then. Let's begin.

831
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:13,720
-Okay.
-Okay.

832
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,610
I'm already sick of this.

833
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,340
When will we finish everything?

834
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,160
You'll buy us coffee, right?

835
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,190
Coffee? Oh, okay.

836
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:33,800
Oh, I made a mistake.

837
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,480
Luckily the stools are cushy.

838
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,150
Right.

839
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:02,660
(So Hyun-seung is at the factory now?)

840
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:03,690
Yes.

841
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,560
They hired part-timers,
but there are not enough people.

842
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,530
So we sent him.

843
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:10,000
He stepped up for his ex-trainer's job.

844
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,870
You raised him well.

845
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,810
I should've raised my trainee well too.

846
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:15,700
Right, Manager Ahn?

847
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:18,910
Major fail.

848
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,320
Oh, no. I don't know what to say.

849
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,550
We have to go now.

850
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:34,060
Oh, I'm sorry. Feel free to leave.

851
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,760
But will you be able to do this all alone?

852
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,660
Even if you're up all night,
I don't think you'll finish.

853
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,600
I can do it. I'll have to try.

854
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,140
He's so optimistic.

855
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,440
Take it easy.

856
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,740
-Okay.
-Let's go.

857
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:53,190
Get home safely.

858
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:56,330
You're so handsome.

859
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,210
I feel bad.

860
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:07,880
I can do this!

861
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:14,730
Senior Yoon.

862
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,200
Are you still attaching stickers?

863
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,500
Yes.

864
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,110
How many do you have left?

865
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,880
Well...

866
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,850
I'm almost done.
I'll finish in an hour or two.

867
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:33,650
That's good.

868
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,240
I heard the stickers were your idea.

869
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,020
Good work.

870
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,630
It's all thanks to you.

871
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,560
Since I have to do well
without you after this.

872
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:50,630
Huh?

873
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:53,170
Without me?

874
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,370
Yes. Without you.

875
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:03,080
But I'm staying though.

876
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:06,380
What?

877
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,920
I'm not going.

878
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,790
I'm not going to Europe.

879
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,030
Oh, I'm sorry.

880
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,070
Really?

881
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,310
You can do that?

882
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,180
Why can't I do that?

883
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,820
Hello?

884
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,450
Oh, uh...

885
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,190
I'm sorry. Please wait.

886
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,200
I'll call you back in a second.

887
01:01:58,970 --> 01:01:59,530
What?

888
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:04,870
Yes!

889
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,230
Calm down.

890
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,170
Calm down, Chae Hyun-seung.

891
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,500
I said calm down.

892
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,410
Thank you!

893
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:42,540
Yes, the water in Europe tastes bad.

894
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,520
She's not going!

895
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,300
Black hair.

896
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:09,960
Her height is...

897
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:10,910
European song.

898
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:50,650
What the...

899
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:53,720
What in the world!

900
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:00,960
Senior Yoon?

901
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,230
You dance really well.

902
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:14,200
What is this?

903
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,840
You said you'll finish in an hour or two.

904
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,280
Where should I start?

905
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:30,590
One glass, please.

906
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:31,920
Okay.

907
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,760
(You haven't changed a bit
after two years.)

908
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,020
(You still live like the teenager...)

909
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,030
You scumbag!

910
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,960
(Who had nothing.)

911
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,000
Son!

912
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,220
What do I have then?

913
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,400
Senior Yoon.

914
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:20,500
Huh?

915
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:23,410
Can I ask why you decided
not to go to Europe?

916
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,710
Because it's not what I want to do.

917
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,010
I like what I'm doing now.

918
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:39,820
Also,

919
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,230
Korean food suits my taste better.
