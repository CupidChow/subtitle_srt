1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,760
(All places, characters, firms and events
depicted in this show are fictitious.)

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,740
If this is how you act,

3
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,470
can you still hide your feelings?

4
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,320
You said you won't bother me.

5
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,300
You're being selfish.

6
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,270
If you're going to act this way,

7
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:29,880
go ahead.

8
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,650
Try to win me over, Yoon Song-ah.

9
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,050
What should I do?

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,320
There are many nice women out there.

11
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,780
So listen to my advice, gentlemen.

12
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,310
Learn how to see beneath the surface.

13
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,890
Stop acting foolishly.

14
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,579
That's all for today!

15
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,590
Bye.

16
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,329
So stupid.

17
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,710
Oh, my gosh!

18
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,710
You done?

19
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,610
You scared the heck out of me!

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,210
What?

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,850
What?

22
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,020
You want tips on how to seduce a man?

23
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,579
Yes.

24
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,570
What for?

25
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,120
Is this about Hyun-seung?

26
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,720
Yes.

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,960
Oh, my gosh!

28
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,890
So what do I have to do?

29
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,890
Come on now.

30
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,500
There are many ways to do it.

31
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,170
Is that so?

32
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,620
But those tricks aren't really important.

33
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,740
What moves a person is your sincerity.

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
When you like someone,
you want to take care of them.

35
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,580
Don't you think it's best
to be genuine like that?

36
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,850
(Final Episode)

37
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,430
Hi.

38
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Hello.

39
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,350
Let's get on.

40
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,470
Are you feeling better?

41
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,440
Yes. Thank you.

42
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,210
I'm glad to hear that.

43
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,320
I like you.

44
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,190
I like you, Hyun-seung.

45
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,430
This is so random.

46
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,570
Have a great day.

47
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,020
That's a lot.

48
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,550
It's for our office, right?

49
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,740
This is for you only.

50
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,870
It's not that sweet.

51
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,540
Okay. Please call me back.

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,810
Okay.

53
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,210
Hello.

54
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,410
-Coffee?
-Yes.

55
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,410
Later.

56
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,480
Can I get a cup of coffee?

57
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,190
What's that?

58
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,010
What?

59
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,020
What is it?

60
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,390
Mine.

61
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,660
But what is it?

62
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,760
It's mine!

63
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,600
This is yours.

64
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,130
The weather is good today.

65
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,730
Is it?

66
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,800
Hot!

67
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,580
You're not going home?

68
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,440
I have a bit more work left.

69
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,310
You want me to bring you something to eat?

70
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,970
No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

71
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,950
Okay then.

72
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,020
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

73
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,150
Let's go home. Good work today.

74
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,520
Good work.

75
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,159
-Down for a BBQ?
-Sounds great.

76
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,090
Goodbye.

77
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,920
Don’t stay too long.

78
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,530
Okay. Goodbye.

79
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,560
He's working hard.

80
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,890
-Let's go for BBQ.
-BBQ is delicious.

81
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,070
He says it's his treat.

82
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,430
Over here!

83
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
Hello.

84
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,330
You like fried chicken, right?

85
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,990
(Hot pepper and mayo chicken)

86
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,880
It's really delicious.

87
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,300
Maybe it's because I'm eating with you.

88
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,810
Am I doing a good job now?

89
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,580
Trying to win you over.

90
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,840
Why?

91
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,450
Just...

92
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,520
I wonder if I'm doing it right.

93
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,960
I've never done this before.

94
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,429
I guess guys always asked you out.

95
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,400
Mostly, yes.

96
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,200
Why?

97
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,169
Are you jealous?

98
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,740
Of course not. Why would I be jealous?

99
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,440
Anyway, I'm on cloud nine.

100
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,450
You're giving me another chance,

101
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,280
and I can look at you like this again.

102
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,120
I can tell you I like you.

103
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,760
And I can sit with you like this.

104
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,500
Thank you.

105
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,230
You gave me an excuse for this.

106
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,740
I didn't do it for you.

107
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,440
I'm going to try really hard.

108
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,710
I won't give up.

109
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,310
Here.

110
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,250
My sincerity.

111
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,130
You know drumsticks are the best, right?

112
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,650
You look handsome, as expected!

113
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,020
I wonder who your bride will be.

114
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,060
Are we done now?

115
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,300
Are you going to keep sulking?

116
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm not sulking.

117
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,100
Now that I think about it,

118
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,070
there was no proposal.

119
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,510
Man.

120
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,610
I'm going to do it!

121
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,090
I was really going to do it.

122
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,370
You should've already done it.

123
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,780
The wedding is right around the corner.

124
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,250
It's...

125
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,550
You know I was really busy
planning the wedding.

126
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,220
I wasn't going to skip the proposal.

127
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,280
Feeling bad, right?

128
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,730
Please forgive me.

129
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,790
I felt bad too.

130
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,920
Jae-woon.

131
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Huh?

132
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,130
I'm not as intuitive as you are,

133
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,510
so I may end up upsetting you again.

134
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,680
But I can promise you.

135
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,110
I'll never make light of your feelings.

136
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,480
So...

137
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,050
If you're upset with me,

138
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,660
you must always tell me.

139
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,460
I'll do my best to make it up to you.

140
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,800
Come on.

141
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,630
You can't just spring this on me.

142
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,620
Huh?

143
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,340
Are you crying?

144
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,240
I'm not crying.

145
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,470
I don't get emotional easily.

146
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,240
I think you totally do.

147
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,940
I don't.

148
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,810
-It looks like you're crying.
-I'm not.

149
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,210
I see tears.

150
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,220
Ji-seung.

151
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,850
I promise.

152
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,410
I'll make you the happiest woman on earth.

153
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,260
I love you, Chae Ji-seung!

154
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,750
Stop it.

155
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,530
Don't cry.

156
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,670
You surprised me.

157
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,770
Stop crying.

158
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,180
Next year's F/W collection theme
is "Celebrate for Me".

159
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,640
It's about celebrating yourself.

160
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,980
We will do a limited-edition
eye shadow collection,

161
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,850
highlighter and two lipstick colors.

162
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,950
What about the package design?

163
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,830
Who are you collaborating with?

164
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,440
(Check Mom's OB/GYN checkup date)
Who are you collaborating with?

165
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,970
(Check Mom's OB/GYN checkup date)

166
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,530
I was thinking HARA.
(Check Mom's OB/GYN checkup date)

167
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,290
I was thinking HARA.

168
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,020
The designer is very hot.

169
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,160
Her schedule is packed a year ahead.

170
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,300
I think she'd be
a great fit for our theme.

171
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,500
Not that she has agreed
to collaborate yet.

172
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,440
HARA is hotta.

173
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Sorry.

174
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,480
Let's contact her and make a pitch.

175
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,340
Okay.

176
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,310
Manager Chae, can you do that?

177
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,580
Okay.

178
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,620
It's weird.

179
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,520
I know.

180
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,250
We always have room for dessert.

181
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,260
That's right.

182
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,760
I could eat another meal
if it were delicious.

183
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,130
Me too.

184
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,930
That place is good.

185
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,160
The new marinated crab restaurant.

186
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,170
I love marinated crabs!

187
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,400
Their food isn't too salty.

188
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I really like that dish.

189
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,740
Let's go there next time.

190
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,600
Sure.

191
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,940
Let's go tomorrow.

192
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,140
I'm down!

193
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,370
-Excuse me.
-You free tomorrow?

194
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,740
Of course, I am.

195
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
What is it?

196
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,340
What are you doing?

197
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,220
I'm with my friends at my cafe.
What is it?

198
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,550
Didn't you just see them yesterday?

199
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,120
That was singing class.
Today I had aerobic class.

200
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,960
What's the matter?
I have to get back to them.

201
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,060
I think your OB/GYN checkup is coming up.

202
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,700
(When did you schedule it for?)

203
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,370
When was it?

204
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,700
They will text me when the date is closer.

205
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,940
I'll let you know once I get a text.

206
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,710
Let's talk later.

207
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,750
That was a long phone call.

208
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,380
It was my daughter.

209
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,480
She works at KLAR.

210
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,680
That's why you have nice skin.

211
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,550
Right.

212
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,450
She is one busy lady.

213
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,630
So what about the collaboration?

214
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,460
Do what you want to do.

215
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,500
I didn't tell them you are my sister.

216
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,400
You can do a meeting if you're interested,

217
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,530
or you can just turn it down.

218
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,570
It sounds fun.

219
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,100
But let me think about it first.

220
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,110
Okay.

221
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,110
How is work these days?

222
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,450
Nothing much is going on.

223
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,320
Jae-woon told me.

224
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,890
Song-ah is back.

225
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,660
Ah, he told you?

226
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,060
Are you okay?

227
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,830
You know what?

228
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,790
I've become a coward.

229
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,510
She wants to get back together.

230
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,380
I want that too.

231
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,020
But now I know I can't always win in love

232
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,820
even when I've given it my all.

233
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,310
So I'm scared.

234
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,830
If she leaves me again...

235
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,170
I wasn't going to say anything.

236
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,110
This is all Jae-woon's fault.

237
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,910
My adorable Jae-woon?

238
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,680
Ew! Adorable?

239
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,710
Love is terrifying.

240
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,030
Eat.

241
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,120
I didn't bring an umbrella.

242
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,320
You didn't drive here?

243
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,460
I took a taxi.

244
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,090
Take this.

245
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,630
What about you?

246
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm not far from here.

247
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,080
You can keep it.

248
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,530
Here.

249
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
Bye.

250
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,410
Why are you so nervous?

251
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,050
She's your sister.

252
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
She'll probably hate me.

253
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,050
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

254
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,740
Consult took forever.

255
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,030
Hello.

256
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,590
Long time no see.

257
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,620
(KLAR Introduction)

258
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,470
The collaboration design
will go on the containers,

259
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,140
packages and any PR items.

260
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,240
We haven't decided on
what those items will be.

261
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,210
I've only designed dresses,

262
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,080
so I have no idea where to start.

263
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,910
Our design team will be there as support.

264
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,850
They'll offer guidance if you need any.

265
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,690
Sorry, I have to take this.

266
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
Yes?

267
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,670
Can I talk about something personal?

268
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,610
Sure.

269
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,050
There are people who face things head-on.

270
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,400
But when they experience true fear,

271
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,620
they tend to step back.

272
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,790
They could give everything

273
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,830
because they used to be fearless.

274
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,330
But that crumbled. So they're scared now.

275
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,200
If the same situation
were to happen again,

276
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,500
they know there's nothing they can do now.

277
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,610
Some people are less stubborn
than they look.

278
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,910
They get hurt more than you think.

279
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,760
(Don't go, Song-ah.)

280
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,060
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,130
I want to go, Hyun-seung.

282
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,970
Is it right to endure?

283
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,410
Song-ah.

284
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,780
This is it.

285
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
I think we should end this.

286
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,150
(Hyun-seung took your
breakup really hard.)

287
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,950
(After you two ended things,)

288
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,890
(he was in a really bad place.)

289
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,490
(He was worse than you think.)

290
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,530
(There are people
who face things head-on.)

291
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,290
(When they experience true fear,)

292
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,640
(they tend to step back.)

293
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,340
(If the same situation
were to happen again,)

294
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,940
(they know there's nothing they can do.)

295
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,240
Do you have to go back to the office?

296
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,820
If not, I'll go straight
to the office dinner.

297
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,350
Okay, that's fine.

298
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,830
Cheers.

299
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,130
Good job, everyone.

300
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,940
Especially the color makeup team.

301
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,310
Thanks for your work
with the base makeup renewal.

302
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,270
All the items are getting good reviews.

303
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,340
We won't have to worry
about the sales this month.

304
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,210
Can I order more beef then?

305
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,450
You're working basic skincare.

306
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,970
I tested a lot of samples.

307
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,850
Me too.

308
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,280
I'm ordering more.

309
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,120
Two more servings
of chuck flap tail, please.

310
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,890
Okay.

311
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,590
Haven't you already eaten a whole cow?

312
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,660
Can I ask you something?

313
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,660
How is it working in Europe?

314
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,290
Why? Are you interested?

315
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,100
I want to be sent overseas to work too.

316
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,330
That's why you're sitting next to her,

317
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,750
and not Hyun-seung.

318
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,240
I think it's a good experience.

319
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,180
Right, the place where I used to
work is recruiting soon.

320
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
Really?

321
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,550
But now isn't a good time.

322
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,210
You need to go when there's an open spot.

323
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,720
They don't come around often.

324
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,580
I want to go, but it's my girlfriend.

325
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,890
She said she'd never do long-distance.

326
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,460
She'd rather break up.

327
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,790
So I want to go after I get married.

328
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,220
Europe is just too far away.

329
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,560
Long-distance won't last long.

330
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,640
Myung-jin, stop talking.

331
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,770
Try this pepper. It's sweet.

332
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,980
-Good?
-Sir!

333
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,620
It's too hot for me.

334
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,620
Wow, this is really hot.

335
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,220
I told you, don't just eat anything!

336
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,120
Here, drink this.

337
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,450
Hot!

338
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,200
Are you okay?

339
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,070
No.

340
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,970
Is your stomach better?

341
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,040
No.

342
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,720
I think it's paralyzed.

343
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,410
Let's go home now.

344
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,680
Have a good weekend. See you Monday.

345
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,440
-Okay.
-Bye.

346
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,580
Have a good weekend.

347
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,150
-Let's go.
-Okay.

348
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,720
Are you taking a taxi?

349
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
Get home safely.

350
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,950
-Have a great weekend.
-Bye.

351
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,630
I didn't drink. I'll drive you home.

352
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,190
Before you do that...

353
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,420
Can we talk a bit?

354
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,200
Don't worry about what Myung-jin said.

355
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,040
It's fine.

356
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,810
I'm making you say it again.

357
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,780
That everything is fine.

358
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,790
And I'm apologizing yet again.

359
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,730
I'm sorry I hurt you.

361
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,600
I knew it would be hard,

362
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,100
but I didn't fully realize

363
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,500
how much you were hurting.

364
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,810
I'm really sorry.

365
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,750
So?

366
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,150
Are you going to give up now?

367
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,090
No.

368
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,420
I'm saying...

369
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,830
I hope I can make you feel better.

370
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,900
I came back because I missed you so much.

371
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,140
I didn't want to be there anymore.

372
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,940
I missed your face
and I missed your voice.

373
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,680
I don't care how long it takes

374
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,350
if I can make it up to you.

375
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,450
If you give me another chance,

376
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,520
I'll never ever do anything stupid.

377
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,630
Like hurting you again.

378
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,010
Senior Yoon,

379
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,250
can I kiss you?

380
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,030
Let's go back to my place.

381
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,270
What?

382
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,410
I love you.

383
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,380
So much.

384
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,010
Not as much as I do.

385
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,080
I love you.

386
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,380
Still handsome, aren't I?

387
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,580
You're awake?

388
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,000
I've wanted to tell you this before.

389
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,090
You're beautiful.

390
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,810
I'm happy.

391
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,910
Me too.

392
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,730
I'm hungry.

393
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,400
You really know how to cook?

394
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
This is too easy.

395
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,910
You're like a chef.

396
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,910
Right?

397
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,180
Salt to taste.

398
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,780
Looks good.

399
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,850
The toast is done.

400
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,650
Where are you going?

401
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,720
Stick next to me.

402
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,220
I'm right here.

403
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,560
You have to stick next to me.

404
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,490
Come on.

405
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,490
We said we'd stick to each other.

406
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,470
Hey!

407
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,870
We said...

408
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,000
Come here!

409
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,310
Stop messing around.

410
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,910
Let's eat.

411
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,470
Can you drop me off over there?

412
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,140
Over there?

413
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,800
Yes, ma'am.

414
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,380
See you later.

415
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,040
See you later.

416
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,050
Good morning.

417
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,420
Good morning.

418
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,140
Morning.

419
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,860
Here, Manager Yoon.

420
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,720
Thank you, Manager Chae.

421
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,750
Yeon-seung.

422
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,120
Yes?

423
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,430
You told me that whoever I am,

424
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,460
I will just be myself to you.

425
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,860
Nobody's said that to me before.

426
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,970
It has stayed with me
for the past three years.

427
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,410
Whatever or whoever I am,

428
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,780
there's someone who
accepts me just as I am.

429
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,850
I had always felt suffocated,

430
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,950
but you kind of freed me by saying that.

431
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,010
Thank you.

432
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,100
For being my safe place.

433
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,040
I haven't fully accepted myself yet,

434
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,710
but I think I have the courage to try now.

435
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,250
I'm ready to try facing it alone.

436
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,150
Alright.

437
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,000
If that's what you want.

438
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,960
And Ha-eun...

439
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,730
Ha-eun is going to take it hard.

440
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,900
I don't know how to tell her either.

441
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:45,540
No matter what we say, it'll hurt her.

442
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,710
I only want the best for her.

443
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,720
It might take long,
but we have to give her enough time.

444
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,720
So that she can accept it.

445
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,460
It might not hurt as much.

446
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,310
Ha-eun.

447
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,550
Ha-eun?

448
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,010
I brought your favorite mango cake.

449
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,489
Can I come in?

450
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,330
(Checkup notice for guardian Chae -
First Heart OB/GYN)

451
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,610
He can't do anything right.
(Checkup notice for guardian Chae -
First Heart OB/GYN)

452
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,270
He can't do anything right.

453
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,180
He's already been here for a year.

454
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,450
I don't understand how he can be so dumb.

455
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,640
My day goes by cleaning up his messes.

456
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:09,580
That never happened when I was a trainee.

457
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,260
Hyun-seung,

458
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,500
he forgot his clumsy newbie days.

459
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,370
You don't know the real reason
why your trainer quit.

460
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,470
It was because of his trainee,
which was you.

461
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,210
Who is spreading such a rumor?

462
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,060
Who said that?

463
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,300
Who said that?

464
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,850
I have to go.

465
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,090
You always leave when I'm talking.

466
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,660
Manager Yoon!

467
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,600
I don't get it.

468
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,870
They used to be trainer and trainee.
How can they be cordial to each other?

469
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,670
Isn't that impressive?

470
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,640
You're more impressive.

471
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,170
Why?

472
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,570
With such a bad observational skill,

473
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,050
how does he call himself a marketer?

474
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,350
Hey, I heard that.

475
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,080
What about my observational skill?

476
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,350
Where are you going? Hang out with me!

477
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,150
Wait up!

478
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,160
Right, I'm meeting someone on Saturday.

479
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,890
Me too. My mom is visiting.

480
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,360
Who are you meeting?

481
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,400
I don't know.

482
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,870
Who is it?

483
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,840
I'm not curious anyway.

484
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Really?

485
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,200
Who is it?

486
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,310
Hold on.

487
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,610
Ha-eun.

488
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,680
Yes, Ha-eun.

489
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,110
(Uncle.)

490
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,280
Are you crying?

491
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,150
Uncle.

492
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,120
Mommy and Daddy are getting a divorce.

493
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,560
Why?

494
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,220
Hey, little princess.

495
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,240
Ha-eun.

496
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,040
Go have a good time with your uncle.

497
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,240
Okay?

498
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,520
Don't worry too much.

499
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,640
I'll talk to her.

500
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,820
Thank you so much for this.

501
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,190
Are you okay?

502
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,130
Yes, I am.

503
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,260
I'm proud of you.

504
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,800
You brat.

505
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,200
I'll call later.

506
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,920
Don't look at me like that.

507
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,260
It's not like this is complete news.

508
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,760
I'd be lying if I said I'm 100% fine,

509
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,630
but I'm handling it as well as I can.

510
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,440
I'm just worried about Ha-eun.

511
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,910
We'll all do our best.

512
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,240
So that Ha-eun won't get hurt so much.

513
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,950
Hyun-seung and I are here for you.

514
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,280
Thank you.

515
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,990
And you.

516
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,630
Nobody said you have to be okay.

517
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,380
So if you need a shoulder to lean on,

518
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,800
don't hesitate.

519
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,870
Come to me or Hyun-seung.

520
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,610
We'll always be right by your side.

521
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
Okay.

522
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,260
Ah.

523
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,520
It's your favorite mango cake.

524
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,900
You're not eating it?

525
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,440
Don't you want to talk to me?

526
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,050
Uncle.

527
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,110
Yes, Ha-eun.

528
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,420
It's just like Ye-ji's parents.

529
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,050
I know I can't do anything
about the divorce.

530
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,490
But I just hate it.

531
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,360
Your parents made you
really upset, didn't they?

532
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:46,070
You don't have to understand
why they chose that.

533
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,340
But I hope you remember one thing.

534
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,240
That your parents love you.

535
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,250
And that will never change.

536
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,610
I know that.

537
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,320
Do you know I love you?

538
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,760
I know that, too.

539
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,130
Can you give me a hug?

540
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,630
Please.

541
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,950
Mommy and Daddy are very sorry.

542
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,590
We are sorry for hurting you.

543
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,230
Can I see Daddy every Friday?

544
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,040
You can see him anytime you want.

545
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,840
I love you so much, Sweetie.

546
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,850
Me too.

547
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,850
I love you, Mommy.

548
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,460
Good night, Ha-eun.

549
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,300
Good night, Mommy.

550
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,780
How was Ha-eun?

551
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,920
We'll just have to
pay more attention to her.

552
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,820
It's amazing.

553
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,930
People hurt you the most,

554
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,670
but they also help you heal.

555
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,990
I'm glad.

556
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,270
I'm glad Ha-eun has a good uncle like you.

557
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,450
And...

558
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:17,150
I'm very thankful that
you are right here with me.

559
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,830
I hope I can become
someone like that to you.

560
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,740
Someone on whom you can lean on.

561
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
You're doing well enough already.

562
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,460
Right,

563
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,210
are you not going to tell me
who you're meeting?

564
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,030
You don't trust me?

565
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,080
I trust you.

566
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,650
But I don't trust the world.

567
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,780
Others can see how handsome you are.

568
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,520
How handsome?

569
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,690
Who are you meeting?

570
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,810
How handsome?

571
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,890
You're being weird.

572
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,320
How handsome?

573
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,730
I'm not moving an inch

574
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,560
until you tell me how handsome I am.

575
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,430
Don't move an inch then.

576
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,300
Here.

577
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,980
I told you to keep it.

578
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,480
It was an excuse.

579
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,250
An excuse to see you again.

580
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,280
That's the look.

581
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,820
You always looked at me that way.

582
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,620
Now I know that it was
because you were nervous.

583
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,160
You were always nervous around me.

584
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,900
Have you ever regretted ending it with me?

585
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,210
Not once.

586
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,280
I was curious.

587
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,920
Did I really get over you?

588
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,220
Could I get over you?

589
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,960
But I realized it when I met you again.

590
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,130
I'm okay.

591
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,660
When I first ran into you,

592
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,030
I felt a little unsettled.

593
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,440
But that was it.

594
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,510
Thank you.

595
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,740
For calling it off.

596
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,450
If you hadn't, I wouldn't be
living my own life.

597
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:32,090
If you still feel bad about the past,
you don't have to.

598
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,920
Be free.

599
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,490
Okay.

600
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,230
Jae-woon is getting married.

601
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,620
If you need an excuse to contact him,

602
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,270
that's your hint.

603
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,510
Thank you.

604
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,210
Shall we shake hands?

605
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,350
Take care of yourself.

606
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,790
You take care of yourself.

607
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,530
I'm the last person
you need to worry about.

608
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:10,870
You're right.

609
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,820
Bye.

610
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,820
You look younger.

611
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,490
I should call you my sister.

612
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,290
What?

613
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,030
You haven't been skipping meals, right?

614
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:48,430
No, I haven't. Don't worry.

615
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm sure glad to see you.

616
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,020
But I feel like such a nuisance.

617
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:59,380
I should've removed you
as my checkup guardian.

618
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,640
Also, you didn't have to pick me up.

619
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:05,180
It was the perfect excuse to see you.

620
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,520
I'm really happy to see you.

621
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,390
Me too.

622
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:13,620
I've wondered how you were doing,
but I couldn't call.

623
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,230
How stupid of her to let him go like that.

624
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,200
Are you dating anyone?

625
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Yes.

626
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,430
Who? Is she a good person?

627
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,590
Yes, she's a very good person.

628
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,940
I see.

629
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,820
I'm happy for you.

630
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,370
Why did you come together?

631
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,430
Well...

632
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,670
Both of you.

633
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,810
Come and sit here.

634
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:05,870
Why?

635
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,600
You two are dating again?

636
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:40,580
Yes, we are.

637
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,580
You can't.

638
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,110
I am against it.

639
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:48,340
Why? You like Hyun-seung.

640
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,920
Mom.

641
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:00,630
There's a sea of good women out there!

642
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,160
Hyun-seung is too good for you! No!

643
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,000
Just no!

644
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,200
What?

645
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,440
But ma'am.

646
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,910
I won't date someone
without your blessing.

647
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,580
What are you doing?

648
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,180
Beg her and say that you need me.

649
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,050
Hurry.

650
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,830
Whatever. I can't live without him.

651
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,030
I just can't.

652
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,030
I can't live without Song-ah, either.

653
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,900
I just can't.

654
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,340
I can't.

655
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,870
I really can't live without her.

656
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,070
We'll just have to sit here in protest.

657
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,430
Are you cold?

658
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,720
-I can't live without her.
-Those two...

659
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,000
Jae-woon is getting married.

660
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,680
If you need an excuse to contact him,

661
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,270
that's your hint.

662
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,310
Really?

663
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,420
You never thought of me as a friend?

664
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,320
Not even once.

665
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,300
From the very beginning.

666
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,580
It's been a while.

667
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:09,970
Thank you for coming.

668
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,260
Are you?

669
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,470
I don't know why I came.

670
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,040
Why did you call me?

671
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,470
Well...

672
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,540
I wanted to have a drink with you.

673
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,540
Here.

674
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,950
I heard you're getting married.

675
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,950
Congratulations.

676
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,750
Thank you.

677
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,900
I can't go to the wedding,

678
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,400
but I'll be sure
to give you a big present.

679
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,630
You better.

680
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,340
It looks like you've been doing well.

681
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,440
You have always been exceptional.

682
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,780
I've done my best to interfere,

683
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,910
yet you've succeeded anyway.

684
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,850
That's why I called myself your friend.

685
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,290
Jae-woon,

686
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,930
thank you.

687
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,370
You reached out to me

688
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,770
and treated me like a real friend.

689
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,130
You are not dying tomorrow.

690
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,020
From now on,

691
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,760
don't call me out at night.

692
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,890
I can do afternoons.

693
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,960
My nights are solely
dedicated to Ji-seung.

694
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,660
Alright?

695
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,560
Okay.

696
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,000
You've changed.

697
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,670
Don't smile, or you'll grow on me.

698
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,700
(Party A: KLAR Lee Myung-suk)
(Party B: HARA Chae Ji-seung)

699
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,440
Thank you for accepting this project.

700
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,040
I look forward to working with you.

701
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,340
I look forward to working with you, too.

702
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,810
I think it'll be fun.

703
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,810
Yes.

704
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,680
Also,

705
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,520
I want to thank you.

706
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,960
What you said that day

707
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,090
helped me see things better.

708
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,360
Thank you so much.

709
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,770
I only said a few things.

710
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,340
Your sincerity was what did the job.

711
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:13,110
It was all thanks to Hyun-seung.

712
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:19,050
Sometimes it was awkward,

713
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,490
and sometimes it was
a bit much to take in,

714
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:29,120
but he was genuine and open
every single moment.

715
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,530
I'm really glad.

716
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,970
Glad that I didn't
turn a blind eye to his heart.

717
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,700
Right,

718
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,740
my name is Chae Hyun-seung.

719
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,480
Chae Hyun-seung.

720
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,180
Senior Yoon.

721
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,050
Don't put on that lipstick.

722
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,020
Who are you to butt in like this?

723
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,780
I'm nothing.

724
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,880
That's right. You're nothing...

725
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,190
I like you.

726
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,420
I said I like you.

727
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,990
All the more reason not to.

728
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,930
Because I can't give you anything.

729
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,590
But I'll still protect you.

730
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:09,130
I think you should move.

731
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,670
Get out of my girl's face, you rascal.

732
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,370
Let's go.

733
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,380
Here.

734
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,710
Why do you like me?

735
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,950
It's just...

736
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:25,440
It's just because it's you.

737
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,250
I like you because you're you.

738
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:31,650
From this moment, I can't hear anything.

739
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,890
(I feel lucky and thankful
for each moment.)

740
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,000
(I'm happy that I'm with you.)

741
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,890
There's a typo here.

742
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,620
I'll fix that.

743
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,690
Have you checked who should approve this?

744
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,090
I'll check one more time.

745
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,060
Okay. Good job.

746
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,630
Thank you.

747
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:14,620
Sure.

748
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:20,340
(Senior Song-ah)

749
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,390
(I'm almost there.)
(Senior Song-ah)

750
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:21,410
(Senior Song-ah)

751
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,480
(See you at the crosswalk.)
(Senior Song-ah)

752
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:24,890
(Okay.)

753
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,260
I'm heading out. Where are you?

754
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,720
(I'm almost there.)

755
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,740
Okay. I'll see you there.

756
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,840
Where are you going, Manager Chae?

757
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,140
I'm heading home, Manager Yoon.

758
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,920
Hyun-seung.

759
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,690
Should we go see
cherry blossoms in the spring?

760
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,030
Sure. Where should we go?

761
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,360
Let's see the ocean in summer.

762
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,330
The fall leaves in autumn.

763
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,870
And the snow in winter.

764
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,380
Every year.

765
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,100
Okay, next year then.

766
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:49,630
No.

767
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,590
Not next year. Every year.

768
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,360
I know. Next year.

769
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,800
Let's go.

770
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,170
Not next year. Huh?

771
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:06,440
Yes, next year.

772
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,340
Not next. Every...

773
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:50,580
Okay.

774
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,470
Every year.

775
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,350
Every year.

776
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:58,930
Together.

777
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,650
The bride-to-be is ready.
