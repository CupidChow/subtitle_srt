1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,830
(All places, characters, firms and events
depicted in this show are fictitious.)

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,840
Where is he?

3
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,510
Where is he?

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,020
Where is Lee Jae-shin?

5
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,310
I think you've got the wrong person.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,290
What?

7
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,890
You know where he is.

8
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,580
Where is he? Tell me quickly.

9
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,070
I don't know.

10
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,800
Where is your phone?

11
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,740
Call him.

12
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,300
Call Lee Jae-shin right now.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,520
We're done here.

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,550
I said call him!

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,480
Move.

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,590
Move!

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,800
Lee Hyo-joo!

18
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,970
Are you okay?

19
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,530
Why were you talking to Yoon Song-ah?

20
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,620
Why would you ask her about Jae-shin?

21
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,550
What happened between you and him?

22
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,530
What's going on?

23
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,270
There's nothing going on.

24
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,890
Not with me.

25
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,780
I can only help if you're honest with me!

26
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,400
Does it have something to do
with Yoon Song-ah?

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,760
I said nothing's going on!

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,650
Just find Jae-shin.

29
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,980
He's your friend.
Why don't you know where he is?

30
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,020
What exactly do you know?

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,950
What kind of friend are you?

32
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,820
I kept going back and forth
about calling you,

33
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,880
(Episode 12)
I kept going back and forth
about calling you,

34
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,240
and I thought it'd be better
to ask you directly.

35
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,890
I don't understand why Hyo-joo

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,630
said that to you yesterday.

37
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,760
Can you tell me why?

38
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,829
I think there was a misunderstanding.

39
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,490
What could there be to misunderstand?

40
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,990
Director Lee Jae-shin and I...

41
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,870
We were in a relationship.

42
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,970
Of course, that's over now.

43
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,380
So you two dated.

44
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,960
May I know when the relationship ended?

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,570
It was

46
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,010
quite recent.

47
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,960
Then, when my sister was dating him...

48
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,250
That was why we broke up.

49
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,440
Anyway, he and I are done.

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,610
I don't know why she came to me yesterday.

51
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,170
I see. You can leave now.

52
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,560
(Yoon Song-ah,)

53
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,170
by any chance, do you know
where Jae-shin might be?

54
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,040
He's turned in a letter of resignation

55
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,790
and I can't get in touch with him.

56
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,860
Two hot americanos with
two shots of espresso

57
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,300
and two pumps of vanilla syrup, please.

58
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,850
Here you go.

59
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,080
We'll call your name when they're ready.

60
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,320
Thank you.

61
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Two hot americanos, please.

62
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,790
I'm jealous.

63
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,740
He's got a fiancée and a mistress.

64
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,980
This is why you need to be a big shot.

65
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,970
Who? Oh, Director Lee Jae-shin?

66
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,110
He's probably going to get fired though.

67
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,490
The chairman won't take this lightly.

68
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,910
That female employee's career is over too.

69
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,140
She'd be too ashamed to show her face.

70
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,280
Did you look her up?

71
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,510
She's pretty.

72
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,200
That's probably why he was seeing her.

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,120
Right.

74
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,480
Should we go take a look?

75
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,480
Excuse me.

76
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:48,390
You should be more careful
about what you say.

77
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,659
Who are you?

78
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,659
I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

79
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,770
If you want to see what she looks like,

80
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,650
do that when you're sued for slander.

81
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,600
-That's okay.
-No, it's okay.

82
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,990
Thank you.

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,560
What's Yoon Song-ah's relationship
with Director Lee?

84
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know.

85
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,840
I heard Chairman's
granddaughter went berserk.

86
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,330
She was shouting and acting crazy.

87
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,020
-Maybe they're having an affair.
-An affair?

88
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,700
She's got some nerve.

89
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,300
He's engaged to Chairman's granddaughter.

90
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,710
She's shameless.

91
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,020
That's why she's messing around like that.

92
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,940
-No self-respect at all.
-Song-ah.

93
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,360
Do you want something to drink?

94
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,909
Yes, I want to get some coffee.

95
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,800
Excuse me.

96
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,190
I'm not as brazen as you think I am.

97
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,360
Nothing's going on
between Director Lee and me.

98
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,530
You seem curious.

99
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,180
No, we aren't.

100
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,690
Come on.

101
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,140
Let's go.

102
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,280
Watch your mouth!

103
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,480
You did great.

104
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,220
This kind of chatter dies down soon.

105
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,660
I know it's hard now but just ignore it.

106
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,060
Okay.

107
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,080
You don't have to stay in the office.

108
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,130
Do you want to go out?

109
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,760
Why avoid them? She's done nothing wrong.

110
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,020
That's not what I meant.

111
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,220
The weather is nice today.
She could let off some steam.

112
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,909
It's fine.

113
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,480
I have a meeting later.

114
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,990
I'll just stay in the office.

115
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,030
If that doesn't bother you.

116
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,790
What are you talking about?

117
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,159
Stop that nonsense.

118
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,190
Let's have something nice for lunch.

119
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,870
I'm sure Manager Kwon will gladly pay.

120
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
Okay.

121
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,780
(Chae Hyun-seung)

122
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,880
(Pay for the coffee
by thinking of nothing)
(Chae Hyun-seung)

123
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,160
(Chae Hyun-seung)

124
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,720
(but me today.)
(Chae Hyun-seung)

125
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,130
(Chae Hyun-seung)

126
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,260
Jae-shin?

127
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,230
-Come out.
-No.

128
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,610
I'm going to wait for him here.

129
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,500
You knew Jae-shin was seeing someone.

130
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,600
How long have you known?

131
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,480
That's not a problem.

132
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
I won't allow this.

133
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's go.

134
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,530
You don't get any say in this.

135
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,120
That's my business.

136
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,150
How could this be your own business?

137
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,080
Do you have no self-respect?

138
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,260
Why are you giving yourself up for him?

139
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,670
You deserve more than this!

140
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,460
Because I love him.

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,130
I can't live without Jae-shin.

142
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,430
I can't.

143
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,240
Walk straight. You might trip.

144
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,820
I'll just trip then.

145
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,780
I don't care about falling.

146
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,500
I don't care about crashing
or getting lost.

147
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,150
I'd welcome it all if I can be with you.

148
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,270
What I'm saying is,

149
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,670
you can tell people about us.

150
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,540
It's okay to tell people we're dating.

151
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,920
It'd make things easier for you at work.

152
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,860
But it'd complicate things for you.

153
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,090
Thank you.

154
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,490
I prefer a hug over a thank you.

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,540
I'll always be by your side
anytime, anywhere.

156
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,160
You can lean on me at any time.

157
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,670
I'm here for you.

158
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay.

159
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,180
I took notes of today's recipe.

160
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,360
You can go over them at home.

161
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,560
-Okay.
-Good job, everyone.

162
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,700
Thank you.

163
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,040
We had a great time today, Chef.

164
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,990
So did I.

165
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,260
I have something to tell you.

166
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,540
Today's the last day of cooking class.

167
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,420
Oh.

168
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,460
Why so sudden?

169
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,870
Is everything okay?

170
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,830
It's just taking more
out of me than I thought.

171
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,990
I want to focus on the restaurant.

172
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,550
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,290
I guess this is it then.

174
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,570
It sure is a bummer.

175
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,250
-It really is.
-That's too bad.

176
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,670
-We do thank you though.
-Thank you.

177
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,340
You can go. I'll do the cleanup.

178
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,870
Let me help. It's a lot to do by yourself.

179
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,270
No. It's more convenient for me
to do it by myself.

180
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,470
Is everything okay with you?

181
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,420
Yes, everything's fine.

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,690
That's good.

183
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,920
You know we are friends, right?

184
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,980
I'm here if something's troubling you.

185
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,170
Okay.

186
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,630
Did I call you out at a bad time?

187
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,870
No, I have some downtime.

188
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,290
What brings you here by the way?

189
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,020
I was having lunch
with a former team member

190
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,560
and I thought of you.

191
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,600
I'll just cut to the chase.

192
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,200
Have you thought about
working somewhere else?

193
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,480
Working somewhere else?

194
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,520
You know I'm working at a foreign company.

195
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,590
Yes.

196
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,480
My team needs
an assistant-manager-level ABM.

197
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,610
I think you'd be perfect for it.

198
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,190
We haven't found the right person yet.

199
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,420
I'd like to work with you.

200
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,390
Your salary would be
much higher there too.

201
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,760
Thank you for thinking of me,

202
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,270
but I haven't considered
changing jobs yet.

203
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,030
Not even once?

204
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,270
It's about time to consider.

205
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,840
Why don't you chew it over?

206
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,110
It won't hurt you.

207
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,950
I'll email you the details.

208
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,840
Okay.

209
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,430
One more thing.

210
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,150
I heard you're in trouble at work.

211
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,090
I know it's just a rumor, so don't worry.

212
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,930
I just want to tell you that
this could be an option for you.

213
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,230
I know.

214
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,900
I'll contact you.

215
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,930
Oh, this?

216
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,380
Senior Yoon asked me to buy it.

217
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,940
You don't have to lie.

218
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,600
We all know.

219
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,670
Of course, we know.

220
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,400
How could we not?

221
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,160
Finally. It was hard
pretending not to know.

222
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,630
What? What's with the look?

223
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,770
Why do you all look so surprised?

224
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,910
I've been working here for so long.

225
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,310
Anyway, take good care of her.

226
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,730
You're the only one she can rely on now.

227
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,310
I will.

228
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,560
Thank you.

229
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,350
They said that?

230
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,730
I guess we really are terrible actors.

231
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,730
No wonder they were acting weird.

232
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,570
Even though we're in the same team,

233
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,720
I didn't expect their trust when
there's a rumor going around about me.

234
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,150
I'm so grateful to them.

235
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,300
Come on.

236
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
It's because you get along with them well.

237
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,120
Even if they didn't know about us,

238
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,740
they'd definitely believe you too.

239
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,960
Whose girlfriend is this great person?

240
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,760
Whose girlfriend is this great person?

242
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,170
Whose girlfriend am I? Of course
I'm Chae Hyun-seung's girlfriend.

243
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,520
I have something to tell.

244
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,590
I met a former colleague earlier.

245
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,290
When you went out for a while just now?

246
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,420
She asked if I would like to work with her.

247
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,780
I see. And then?

248
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,210
I told her I'll think about it.

249
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,950
What's your thought, Hyun-seung?

250
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,870
I get a say in this?

251
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,300
Of course.

252
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,570
This affects us too.

253
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,730
Us.

254
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,740
If I were being selfish,

255
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,300
I'd say I want you in the same office.

256
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,900
But this is about your career.

257
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,540
If this job offer is better for you,

258
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,330
you should take it.

259
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,160
What I want is for you to do
what you want to do.

260
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,580
(How many days has it been?)

261
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,310
He quit this company.

262
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,820
Why aren't you accepting his resignation?

263
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,980
You're too soft.

264
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,640
That's how you get stabbed in the back!

265
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,210
-I'm sorry.
-Stop saying it and show me some action!

266
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,740
With the Europe project and everything,

267
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,000
we have too many things to care about.

268
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,890
There is no time to waste on that goon.

269
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,550
Are you that incompetent?

270
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,640
You can't work without him by your side?

271
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
About that...

272
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,150
I'll make sure the project goes smoothly.

273
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,650
That worthless hoodlum.

274
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,290
How dare he embarrass me like this?

275
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,550
You better make it clear with Hyo-joo too.

276
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,349
If she makes another scene because of him,

277
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,540
I'll disown her just like
what I did to your parents.

278
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,630
If you don't cut ties with him,

279
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,490
I'll take away your position too!

280
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,670
Manager Kwon!

281
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,300
(Urgent Notice: Personnel Appointments)

282
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,340
(KLAR Senior Manager Kwon -
KLAR Acting BM)

283
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,010
(Date of appointment:
Effective as of today)

284
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,200
What in the world?

285
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,830
Manager Kwon Sung-yeon.

286
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,470
Did you see the notice?

287
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,370
I just saw it.

288
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,390
You'll be the acting BM
before we find a new BM.

289
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,790
What about Director Lee Jae-shin?

290
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,250
You won't be seeing him here anymore.

291
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,540
Report to me about
the projected sales for this month.

292
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,560
What in the world is happening?

293
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,390
Is BM Lee really not coming back?

294
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,030
Let's just...

295
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,120
I'll find out more about it later.

296
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,550
Let's see.

297
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,530
Let's get the projected sales
for this month.

298
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,380
Let me ask around a bit.

299
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,850
Thank you. Please come again.

300
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,940
Thank you.

301
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,110
Hello.

302
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,210
I want a refund.

303
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,850
Sure. Just one second.

304
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,880
Do you have the receipt?

305
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,850
I'll get a refund for you right away.

306
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,920
May I know why you want to return it?

307
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,850
I watched a scrub review video

308
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,340
and it said the product is bad.

309
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,190
It doesn't exfoliate
and it'll damage your skin.

310
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,630
Our products?

311
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,270
That's not possible.

312
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,630
Can you show me that video?

313
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,090
(Beauty Fun Fun)
(What's worse than KLAR's mascara?)

314
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,320
(It's their cream shadow.)

315
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,540
(The creasing effect is just too much.)

316
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,980
(Do you see this?)

317
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,090
(It gets on the small creases,)

318
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,510
(making them stand out.)

319
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,420
(And it hardens so fast.)

320
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,820
(Look at this.)

321
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,580
(It's very hard.)

322
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,600
(Who would buy this?)

323
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,050
People are returning our products
because of this video?

324
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Yes.

325
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,750
Three people came in for a refund today.

326
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,060
She might be sabotaging
our brand on purpose.

327
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,670
She's bashing our basic skincare
and color makeup.

328
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,000
It's not just a simple low-star review.

329
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,670
I agree.

330
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,520
But we don't have any concrete evidence.

331
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,770
If we provoke her without evidence,

332
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,050
it'll backfire on us.

333
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,810
In the worst-case scenario,

334
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,750
it'll damage our brand image.

335
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,990
I think she has a routine.

336
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,440
Why?

337
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,450
She targets certain brands
and leaves bad reviews.

338
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,660
This kind of content gets higher hits.

339
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,400
She got a few hundred thousand views.

340
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,040
So she gets more subscribers this way.

341
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,110
And we're her unlucky victim this time.

342
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,650
What do we do?

343
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,720
We can't just let this happen.

344
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,440
Of course, but we can't do
anything right now.

345
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,700
We need concrete evidence.

346
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,590
(Are you really going to spend
the whole night watching all her videos?)

347
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,590
Yes.

348
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,340
I'm not sure if I'll find something,

349
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,900
(but I want to do everything I can.)

350
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,450
(I can't sit by while our products
get slandered.)

351
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,960
(I'll watch the videos with you then.)

352
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,850
You will?

353
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,770
It's our job. And it's my brand too.

354
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,100
(It feels very smooth.)

355
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,710
(Let me test if it lasts long.)

356
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,520
(I'm going to apply it around my eye.)

357
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,170
(It applies very well. The more layers...)

358
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,280
(I have to tell you this.)

359
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,570
(I'm so angry at the poor quality
of this product.)

360
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,790
(I just had to post a video.)

361
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,900
(I don't want these for my subscribers.)

362
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,680
(Don't waste your money on
this garbage cosmetics.)

363
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,910
(Oh, my.)

364
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,190
(The design is cute and lovely.)

365
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,850
(The quantity is smaller
than other brands.)

366
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,390
(The texture is moist
and glossy, not matte.)

367
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,690
(You can see how clean
the shading effect is.)

368
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,410
(You get moist lips
and it doesn't come off easily.)

369
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,640
(So it looks natural.)

370
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,460
(The mirror is big,
so you can see very well.)

371
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,810
(This puff...)

372
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,980
Huh?

373
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,460
(What is it?)

374
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,690
Senior Yoon.

375
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,700
I got the purchase history
from the CRM Team.

376
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,720
Really?

377
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,810
She's been buying our products and yet
she said it was her first time using them.

378
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,880
She's been a VIP customer for years.

379
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,970
You found her reviews on our online mall?

380
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,310
Right here.

381
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,800
She said the scrub is a holy grail item.

382
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,020
And she said our cream shadow is good,
so she bought all the colors.

383
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,400
This will definitely get her to back off.

384
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,350
She'll have to.

385
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,970
If not, we'll take legal measures.

386
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,610
You're meeting her today, right?

387
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,760
I won't remove the video.

388
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,450
That's why you contacted me, right?

389
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,490
No.

390
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,470
No?

391
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,780
Everyone has their own preferences
for makeup products.

392
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,420
We understand if you are not satisfied.

393
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,590
We're here to confirm
some information with you.

394
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,760
Confirm what?

395
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,470
I watched your video.
You said you'd never used our products.

396
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,800
That's right.
I only use imported products.

397
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,150
But when we were
looking through your videos,

398
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,240
we found something familiar.

399
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,630
What's this?

400
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,920
This was our VIP gift two years ago.

401
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,260
I got this from a friend.

402
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,060
I didn't even know I had this.

403
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,990
Take a look at this then.

404
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,570
We searched the portal
and found your name.

405
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,440
We compared that with our CRM data.

406
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,690
You've been our VIP customer
for three years straight.

407
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,720
Those were all gifts for others.

408
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,190
Even if I did use them,

409
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,610
are you saying that I can't give
bad reviews if they suck?

410
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,730
Of course not.

411
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,100
But, a week ago,

412
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,320
you said the same product
was a holy grail item.

413
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,780
We can only suspect that
you exploited KLAR

414
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,590
for your personal gain.

415
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,510
For example, you wanted to cause a stir

416
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,150
and boost the number of your subscribers.

417
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,870
That's funny.
I already have so many subscribers.

418
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:50,090
I'm going to post
what you're doing right now.

419
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,450
Go ahead with it.
The law will be the judge.

420
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,290
We're going to hold you responsible

421
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,390
for the damage of our brand image
and the drop in sales.

422
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,390
That's why we asked to see you today.

423
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,170
So what now?

424
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,430
What do you want me to do?

425
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,890
The decision is yours.

426
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,780
Just as your subscribers
are important to you,

427
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,000
every one of our customers
is important to us too.

428
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,390
We do our very best
when we create a product,

429
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,280
so that we won't disappoint them.

430
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,330
We hope the same for you.

431
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,960
Don't disappoint your subscribers.

432
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,310
Oh, my!

433
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,390
I made that in the cooking class.
I want you to try them too.

434
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,420
Thank you so much.

435
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,680
How is the class? Still having fun?

436
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,150
It's over now.

437
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,640
Isn't it an on-going project?

438
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,570
The chef wanted to focus
on the restaurant

439
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,850
and so he ended it.

440
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,270
That's too bad.

441
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,580
I know you were enjoying it.

442
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,380
There's nothing I can do.
It's his class anyway.

443
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,840
By the way, I prepared two servings.

444
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,240
Hmm?

445
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,960
It's for you and
your mysterious boyfriend.

446
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,620
Okay.

447
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,480
I ended the cooking class.

448
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,050
Your wife knows it.

449
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,170
I heard.

450
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,510
She seems like a good person.

451
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,140
She seems genuine.

452
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,370
Unlike you.

453
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,180
How much longer will you deceive her?

454
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,160
What do you mean?

455
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,630
Can I tell her the truth then?

456
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,020
About how we got close and grew apart?

457
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,560
You already told her.

458
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,830
You wanted to befriend me
and so we got close,

459
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,430
then we grew apart as we didn't get along.

460
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,180
You're the one who ran away.

461
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,510
Like a coward.

462
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,840
What are you trying to say?

463
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,130
You disgust me.

464
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,480
It's the same now as it was back then.

465
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,660
You draw a line because you're scared.

466
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,990
And you leave me
to deal with the aftermath.

467
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,900
Do you really see me as a friend?

468
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,570
Have you ever thought of me as a friend?

469
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,590
If I haven't, it's your fault.

470
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,360
You project your feelings onto me
and cross the line.

471
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,420
-Don't come around anymore.
-That's right.

472
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,350
I still like you.

473
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,750
That's why I can see clearly.

474
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,260
You're afraid to accept yourself.

475
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,070
And I pity you for that.

476
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,640
I don't have to accept anything.
This is me.

477
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,950
What happened in college?

478
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,420
That was a one-time thing. A mistake.

479
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,130
I'm not the same as you.

480
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,590
I like men?

481
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,880
Are you crazy?

482
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,200
I thought we could go home together.

483
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
I didn't know you have a guest.

484
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,050
He's here because of his wrist.

485
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,300
I'm done. We can leave now.

486
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,290
No. I forgot to pick up Ha-eun.

487
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,220
She must be waiting for me.

488
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,580
I'll get going now.

489
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,190
Man.

490
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,180
This looks wonderful.

491
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,080
I didn't make this,
but I hope you enjoy it.

492
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,350
Thank you.

493
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,870
Is it good?

494
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,170
It's really delicious.

495
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,840
I love watching you eat.

496
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,580
I love shrimp.

497
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,540
There's a lot of shrimp. Eat more.

498
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,230
This is peppermint tea.
It's good for relieving tension.

499
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,500
Something's going on, right?

500
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,610
You sounded tired on the phone.

501
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,980
And you look very tired too.

502
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,270
Does it show that much?

503
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,370
Is it something you can't share?

504
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,400
If it is, you don't have to tell me.

505
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,360
I'm just worried about you.

506
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,940
It's about my best friend.

507
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,820
He's severed all contact

508
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,790
and disappeared.

509
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:38,230
Actually, he's my sister's fiancée.

510
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:47,400
I guess it was just me
who thought we were friends.

511
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,780
I knew he didn't really
consider me as one.

512
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,020
But having that thrown in my face,

513
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,740
it's...

514
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,640
It hurts a lot.

515
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,090
I feel betrayed too.

516
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,300
I'm more worried
about my sister right now.

517
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:25,360
I don't know if Hyo-joo
will let Jae-shin go.

518
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,180
Hyo-joo?

519
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,820
Are you talking about Lee Jae-shin?

520
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,490
Then Lee Hyo-joo...

521
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,450
You know my sister?

522
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,050
She was my customer.
I mean, she used to be.

523
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,790
What a small world!

524
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,440
I love that I have a shoulder to lean on.

525
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,080
It's nice.

526
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,350
Here's a cold glass of beer.

527
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,250
Thank you.

528
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,480
Cheers.

529
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,380
Great work, Senior Yoon.

530
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,139
You too.

531
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,040
Do you think she'll remove the video?

532
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,310
We'll have to wait and see.

533
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,300
We've done our part.

534
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,750
The rest is up to the legal team.

535
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:29,850
Have you decided what to do
about the job offer?

536
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:30,639
Why?

537
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,550
Looking at you today,
I don't think you'll leave.

538
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,940
Even if you do, I think you'll come back.

539
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,780
You can tell, right?

540
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:43,770
I noticed this from the beginning.

541
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,800
Do you like KLAR that much?

542
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,480
Yes.

543
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,489
Why?

544
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,290
I don't know.
I just love being a KLAR marketer.

545
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,580
I love being able to say KLAR is my brand.

546
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,270
I feel especially good

547
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,910
when I see someone using our product.

548
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,180
My first product is lipstick.

549
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,900
I was on a bus

550
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,460
and saw someone taking it out of her bag.

551
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,880
I wanted to ask her how she likes it,

552
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,550
and tell her that
I'm the one who developed it.

553
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,500
It was so hard trying to stay still.

554
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,640
Really?

555
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Yes.

556
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,000
What?

557
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,040
What?

558
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,360
What's with you?

559
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,250
Screw this wretched world.

560
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,460
Wretched?

561
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,260
The world is beautiful. Right?

562
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,860
(I'd like to apologize for
my recent post.)

563
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,590
(The KLAR product review was misinformed.)

564
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,760
(I wanted to make it more interesting,)

565
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:23,790
(and so I exaggerated
some things in my video.)

566
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:28,570
(I'd like to apologize to all my viewers.)

567
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,690
Okay.

568
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,380
With this apology, things will smooth out.

569
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,400
The return requests died down too.

570
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,900
Did you ask the PR team
to release an article?

571
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,910
Yes, they'll print that
we won't press charges.

572
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,060
I heard you two worked hard on this.

573
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,460
Well done.

574
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,310
Thank you.

575
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,320
Let's have an office dinner soon.

576
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,630
Sounds great.

577
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,850
You're dismissed.

578
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,060
Okay.

579
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,330
Thank you.

580
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,100
Give me a moment, ABM Yoon Song-ah.

581
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,420
Did you hear from Jae-shin by any chance?

582
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,380
I don't think he'll be contacting me.

583
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,150
If he does, could you let me know?

584
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,780
I won't take it the wrong way.

585
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,770
Okay, sir.

586
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,360
Now onto another topic.

587
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,650
Did you receive a job offer recently?

588
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,160
Things might be uncomfortable right now,

589
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,400
but I hope you're not going to leave us.

590
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,930
You're very much needed at our company.

591
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,720
Thank you.

592
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,430
You need to eat.

593
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,380
It's been days.

594
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,890
I don't feel like eating. Go away.

595
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,690
Your brother told me to make sure you eat.

596
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,970
Just a little bit.

597
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,220
I'll leave this here then.

598
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,340
Please eat some.

599
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,940
Did you find him?

600
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,930
(His phone has been turned off,)

601
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,560
(and he's not using his credit card.)

602
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,750
(It's not easy to track him.)

603
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,620
If it were easy,
I wouldn't have hired you.

604
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,910
I'll pay you more. Just find him!

605
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,180
That's it for the weekly meeting.

606
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
Right,

607
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,250
we're getting an intern today.

608
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,300
Already?

609
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,550
I know, right.

610
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,710
Wasn't it yesterday Hyun-seung joined us?

611
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,070
You were so fresh-faced back then.

612
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,340
It's only a year,
but I can hardly recognize you already.

613
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,590
Should I break down in tears
right about now?

614
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,740
I was joking.

615
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,730
Don't cry.

616
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,070
Right, sir.

617
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,280
I was wondering.

618
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,410
The intern's desk.

619
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,330
Where should we put it?

620
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,050
It's best if it's next to you.

621
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,160
But this is the only empty desk we have.

622
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,080
Set it up here.

623
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,190
Yes, sir.

624
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,600
You want some help?

625
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,210
It's okay. I can do it by myself.

626
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,880
Can I have a moment, everyone?

627
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,570
This is Ko Myung-jin.

628
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,080
He'll be our intern for a month.

629
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,370
Hello, I'm Ko Myung-jin.

630
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,690
It's nice to meet you.

631
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,740
You can greet him later.

632
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,560
Your desk is here.

633
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,450
You'll learn the basics
from ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

634
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,350
Yes, sir.

635
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,390
It's nice to meet you.

636
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,600
Nice to meet you too.

637
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,410
Yes.

638
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,160
Myung-jin.

639
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,770
You can sit.

640
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,800
Yes, sir.

641
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,640
Did you learn how to access the internet?

642
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,690
I can show you.

643
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,760
It's okay. I'll figure it out.

644
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,870
If you need anything, let me know.

645
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,410
I'll explain our brand
in the meeting room later.

646
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,540
Okay.

647
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,680
I think that covers the brand description.

648
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,370
Now about the job assignments
within the team.

649
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,020
There are basic skincare and call sales.

650
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,660
We have color makeup
and department store sales too.

651
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,640
At the same time, we manage PR,

652
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,670
inventory management
and visual merchandising.

653
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,950
To put it plainly,

654
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,990
our task is to manage all the processes

655
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,890
from product manufacturing to sales.

656
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,890
I see.

657
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:21,680
Is there anything else
you'd like to know more about?

658
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,450
Feel free to ask.

659
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,120
I had many questions when I was an intern.

660
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,290
I don't have any though.

661
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,120
Okay then.

662
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,440
I think we're done here.

663
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,330
Okay.

664
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,630
It's close to lunchtime now.

665
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,900
Do you want to join us for lunch?

666
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,250
How about the cafeteria?

667
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,420
I'll eat by myself.

668
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,500
I can do that, right?

669
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,600
Sure, if that's what you want.

670
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,910
Thank you.

671
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,820
Okay.

672
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,480
Oh, my god.

673
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,290
You've been turned down?

674
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,710
This is our colleague,
ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

675
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,560
Our interns.

676
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,870
Hello.

677
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,500
Hello.

678
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,180
Looking sharp, right?

679
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,570
Let's go. I'll save you from eating alone.

680
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,790
Let's go.

681
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
We're meeting the sales team today.

682
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,720
They asked for our input
about their sales promotion.

683
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,020
Marketing usually gives them policies,

684
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,750
but sometimes they do their own thing.

685
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,790
I see.

686
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,520
Sir.

687
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,470
Yes?

688
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,940
I'll be honest with you.

689
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,350
I'll soon be joining another company.

690
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,300
This is just for the experience.

691
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,580
So you don't need to train me.

692
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,890
I know.

693
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,280
(Our team's intern said)

694
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,960
your intern is going to another company.

695
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,790
Really?

696
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,200
Yes. So don't waste your time on him.

697
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:08,990
I'm still going to
do my best to train you.

698
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,630
That won't make me stay here.

699
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,210
That's not what I'm trying to achieve.

700
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,480
But I learned this from my trainer.

701
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,120
A brand marketer must think that
he is the brand.

702
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:28,330
When you hear KLAR's name in the future,

703
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,900
I'm sure I will cross your mind.

704
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,230
I don't want to be remembered

705
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,960
as an insincere and irresponsible person.

706
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:45,770
Let's get on.

707
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,430
Ahem.

708
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,960
(Chef Ryu isn't seeing anyone, right?)

709
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,910
No. But I don't think he'd be interested.

710
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,320
Marriage isn't his thing.

711
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,500
It'd be nice. But…

712
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,030
You can't always get what you want.

713
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,290
What were you two like in college?

714
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,020
I liked him.

715
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,280
Honey.

716
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:47,030
Are you happy when you are with me?

717
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,190
I'm suddenly curious.

718
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,380
I'm happy, are you?

719
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,480
I'm grateful.

720
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,500
Thank you for being my wife.

721
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,150
Do you have something
to say to Hyun-seung?

722
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,540
Gosh.

723
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,540
It's about the brand description.

724
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,690
Can I get the original file?

725
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,290
Okay. Sure.

726
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,890
Thank you.

727
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:50,920
Also,

728
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,350
can you buy me lunch tomorrow?

729
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,310
At the cafeteria.

730
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,460
Okay.

731
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,340
Sure.

732
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,410
Let's have lunch together tomorrow.

733
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,910
Thank you, Senior Chae!

734
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,440
Bye!

735
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,380
Take that home.

736
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,420
Bye!

737
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,270
Bye.

738
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,880
Mommy!

739
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,850
Ha-eun!

740
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,500
Oh? Uncle!

741
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,230
Where's Mommy?

742
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:46,520
Something came up,
so she asked me to get you.

743
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,080
Is she on a date with Daddy again?

744
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,540
Maybe. What will you do then?

745
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,010
You want to go on a date with me?

746
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,400
Let's go on a date.

747
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,610
-Let's do that.
-Sounds good.

748
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,810
Awesome.

749
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,170
How did you grow so tall?

750
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:06,810
Excuse me?

751
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,640
I'm going to grow as tall as you.

752
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,200
Ha-eun said she'll marry me
if I become as tall as you.

753
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,170
One moment, please.

754
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Marry him?

755
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,350
I was feeling generous.

756
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,430
Just like that?

757
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,930
Why are we standing here?

758
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,470
Just one moment.

759
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,320
Senior Yoon!

760
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,150
Hello, Ha-eun!

761
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,900
Meet my girlfriend.

762
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,810
You finally did it!

763
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,560
Now you know I'm good.

764
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,770
I found it!

765
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,160
You found it!

766
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,320
Should we get the bigger one?

767
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,560
Where are the potatoes? Potatoes.

768
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,690
Here they are!

769
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,100
Let's give it to him.

770
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,510
What do you think will be better?

771
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,230
-This one.
-That one?

772
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:48,120
But that one has a bug in it. A bug!

773
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:02,710
Which one looks good?

774
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,060
-It's good.
-Is it good?

775
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,380
You're giving me one?

776
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,340
It's very delicious.

777
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,000
Should we ask your uncle to get this?

778
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,920
My uncle buys me many toys.

779
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,200
Really?

780
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,100
Let's dry your hands.

781
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,070
My uncle plays tennis very well.

782
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,270
Oh, I see. That's great.

783
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,360
My uncle listens very well too.

784
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,140
So you did well, Auntie.

785
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,620
Okay.

786
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,220
How is it?

787
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,260
It's so good!

788
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,460
It's delicious. Isn't it, Ha-eun?

789
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,050
I love it.

790
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,990
Is it good?

791
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,700
Eat as much as you want, Ha-eun.

792
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,110
Do you want mussels?

793
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,260
Here.

794
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,180
My hands are tied.

795
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,980
Seriously.

796
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,320
Here.

797
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:51,930
Thank you.

798
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,930
It's so delicious.

799
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,220
I can sell this.

800
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,200
Who is prettier? Auntie Song-ah or me?

801
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,230
You're asking me?

802
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,400
Of course you're prettier, Ha-eun!

803
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,590
You should've said
your girlfriend is prettier.

804
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:23,640
I'm sorry, Auntie.

805
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,800
My uncle still has a long way to go.

806
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,270
This is my girlfriend.

807
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,880
It's very nice to meet you.

808
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,270
Now I see why Hyun-seung looked all happy.

809
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,210
Open the door for me.

810
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:51,960
Okay.

811
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,650
Be careful.

812
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:04,950
Her backpack.

813
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,130
Thank you.

814
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,940
Let's grab dinner
when both of you are free.

815
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,690
It'll be my treat.

816
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,070
That sounds great.

817
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,230
Why is Ha-eun sleeping at your place?

818
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:27,120
Yeon-seung went to
a funeral with Wu-hyun.

819
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,000
They are out of town.

820
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,230
Drive safely.

821
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,630
See you another time.

822
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,680
Sure. Drive safely.

823
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
Bye.

824
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:54,580
She said you buy her toys,
play tennis well

825
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,470
and listen to her well.

826
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,440
Then, she complimented me on my choice.

827
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,560
Ha-eun is very wise for her age.

828
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,390
I'm worried if I set
her standards too high.

829
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:11,630
But she left out the most important thing.

830
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,420
What I do best is loving Yoon Song-ah.

831
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,330
More like you say
corny things really well.

832
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,050
Action speaks louder than words.

833
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,900
Want me to show you?

834
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,170
Stop it. You're too much.

835
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,270
I'm sorry to show up like this.

836
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,840
I really need to tell you something.

837
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,300
Can we talk?

838
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,440
If you must say something,

839
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:41,560
just say it here.

840
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,280
It's not something
you have to worry about.

841
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,950
Please.

842
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,050
I'll head home.

843
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,070
Call me afterward.

844
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,050
Okay.

845
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,310
You said you wanted to talk.

846
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,290
I was thinking...

847
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,270
I never properly apologized to you.

848
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,120
This may sound like an excuse,

849
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,280
but I didn't mean to keep lying to you.

850
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,520
I wanted to tell you.

851
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,960
But when I was with you,

852
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,020
I could be myself.

853
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:30,250
I didn't have to be scared that
you'll see the real me.

854
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:37,500
I could be myself in front of you.

855
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,440
I wanted to hold on to you
just one more day.

856
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,690
I thought maybe you'll be understanding.

857
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,330
I was selfish
and let things unravel like that.

858
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,580
Because I was afraid that you'd leave me.

859
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,570
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

860
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,500
I just...

861
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,720
It was real for me.

862
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:12,050
I'm sorry that it ended the way it did.

863
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,940
I just wanted to tell you this in person.

864
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,020
I heard you resigned.

865
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:37,040
What will you do from now on?

866
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,620
I haven't thought that far ahead.

867
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,760
I'm going to start over
with what I truly have.

868
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,440
If I've fallen to the bottom,

869
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,430
then that's where I'll start.

870
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,780
By the way,

871
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,630
Jae-woon might find out about our past.

872
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,570
I'll make sure you
won't be treated unfairly.

873
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,980
He already knows.

874
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,090
I hope that didn't cause you trouble.

875
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,440
It didn't.

876
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:11,970
And also,

877
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,490
don't worry about me.

878
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,550
Not anymore.

879
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,410
Okay.

880
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,360
I understand.

881
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,710
Can I come in?

882
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:15,670
Come in.

883
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,960
Is everything okay?

884
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,530
Why are you here?

885
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,400
I wanted to see you.

886
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,920
You should've called me.

887
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,310
I didn't want to waste time.

888
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,710
Why are you still unchanged?

889
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,320
Were you staring at
your phone all this time?

890
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:06,350
I was just doing this and that.

891
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,860
He came to apologize.

892
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,260
Said he was sorry.

893
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:26,350
I thought this wouldn't bother you.

894
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,900
I never said it doesn't bother me.

895
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,770
How can it not bother me?

896
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,410
You're my girlfriend.

897
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:37,080
I think about you all the time.
It's crazy.

898
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,220
I'll leave now.

899
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,410
Get some rest.

900
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,690
Already?

901
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:48,020
I saw the face I wanted to see.
I should go.

902
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,630
Night.

903
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:59,910
That wasn't enough for me.
Stay for a while.

904
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:10,090
It's late. How long is a while?

905
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,950
I don't know.
