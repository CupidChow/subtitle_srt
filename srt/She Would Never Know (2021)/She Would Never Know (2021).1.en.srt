(Names, businesses, products,
events and places are used fictitiously.)

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,790
Moisturizing foundation?

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,220
Yes, we put in
our basic skincare ingredients.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,140
It moisturizes the skin

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,070
and gives the skin a healthy glow.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,640
I can feel the moisturizing effect.

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,000
What's the percentage?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,850
70%.

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,750
How to apply it? By using your hands?

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,290
Oh, right.

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,940
The researcher told us to use the hands,

13
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,020
but we think it'd be better to use a puff.

14
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,220
We'll develop them together.

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,400
Yes, I agree with you.

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,940
I'll focus on the basic ingredients,
and its moisturizing glow effect

17
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,240
during the training, okay?

18
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,190
Also, emphasize how it
differs from the existing ones.

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,520
We'll send you the material.

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,340
By the way, ABM Hyun-seung
can do it all by himself now.

21
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,450
The newbies to other teams
are still struggling.

22
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,370
He's quite outstanding.
I wonder who taught him.

23
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,710
She taught me.

24
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,280
He knows how to survive at work too.

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,300
Send me an adequate amount of samples.

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,820
Okay.

27
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,920
You're heading back, right?
I have another meeting.

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,350
Thank you for your hard work.

29
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,670
Thank you.

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,520
I'm glad I taught you well.

31
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,600
It's so rewarding.

32
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,670
You think I'm a kid, right?

33
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,539
Not a kid, per say.

34
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,180
Why? Did I offend you?

35
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,410
Not exactly.

36
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,890
But you're treating me more like a kid
as compared with my older sisters.

37
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,710
I'm only a year younger than you.

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,240
It's a one-year difference in age,

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,200
but two-year difference
in working experience.

40
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,870
You really are a kid.

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,910
Let's go, we'll miss the bus.

42
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,090
Okay.

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,440
Did you pack all the samples?

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,670
Yes, I did.

45
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,390
-You'd better not leave anything behind.
-Huh?

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,710
What?

47
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,730
Sir!

48
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,490
Sir, wait!

49
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,140
Sir, wait!

50
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,759
Wait.

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,140
Thank you.

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,180
We're back.

57
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,510
-We're here.
-Welcome back.

58
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,290
So-mi is getting married.

59
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,760
Really?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,430
-Yes.
-Congratulations.

61
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,640
Thank you.

62
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,880
Should we really congratulate her?

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,080
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,790
Marriage isn't easy.

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,590
Your husband's name sounds familiar.

66
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,670
Yes, he's Assistant Manager Oh

67
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,200
from the department store sales team.

68
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,490
Really?

69
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,290
I'm sorry, we've been dating secretly.

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,000
You've dated behind our backs for 3 years?

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,490
How did you manage to do that?

72
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,910
We have our tricks and methods.

73
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,180
So cheeky!

74
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,480
If anyone wants to date secretly at work,
please come to me.

75
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,490
I'll teach you everything.

76
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,130
Yes, office romance must be kept a secret.

77
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,290
It's good if it turns out well,
but if it doesn't...

78
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,140
I can't bear to think about it.

79
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,080
And it's worse for the woman.

80
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,740
It labels you for the rest of your life.

81
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,450
Right,

82
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,050
I don't understand why
women have to suffer more.

83
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,390
It's ridiculous.

84
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,140
The world is a ridiculous place.

85
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,420
Assistant Manager Ahn,
you're even more ridiculous.

86
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,070
ABM Yoon Song-ah.

87
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,280
Yes?

88
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,670
Was he watching?

89
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,260
Let's go.

90
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,710
Yes, BM Lee.

91
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,980
You're going to the headquarters, right?

92
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,230
They've set up a new display stand.

93
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,430
Yes, I'm going with Hyun-seung later.

94
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,210
Are you coming, too?

95
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,550
No, I'll go later on.

96
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,280
I'll go with the director.

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,610
Check carefully
so that he doesn't find fault.

98
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,110
Okay, I'll check carefully.

99
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,520
Get going now.

100
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,370
Hello, this is Lee Jae-shin from KLAR.

101
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,150
Once again, Seolyoon is the only product

in our department that
hasn't reached the monthly sales goal.

106
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,780
What should I do
if it's always like this?

107
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,450
I'm sorry, Director Lee.

108
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,000
-We're doing our best, but...
-Stop!

109
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,690
Other BMs are doing their best as well.

110
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,700
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Come in.

112
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,790
You called for me, sir?

113
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,950
Yes.

114
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,030
You may leave, BM Seo.

115
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,170
We'll talk about responsibility later.

116
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,560
Take a seat, BM Lee.

117
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,840
You know why I called you, right?

118
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,070
Not really, Director Lee.

119
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,830
Seolyoon doesn't have any star products.

120
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,790
We need those for sales.

121
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,070
What do you think is the problem?

122
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,980
you should figure it out .. its your job after all

123
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,920
I'm just a BM, I don't know anything.

124
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,350
But if it wasn't for you,

125
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,270
I wouldn't be able to get this title.

126
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,680
Help me out.

127
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,910
Is Seolyoon willing to make an effort?

128
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,530
They're already at their limit.

129
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,840
What about Bayer and Lassiere?

130
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,280
I'll only do as much as
Seolyoon is lacking.

131
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,520
Okay.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,270
What would I do without you?

133
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,860
Our chairman has no mercy
for the untalented

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,270
even if I'm his grandson.

135
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,820
My team members will do all the work.

136
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,400
Please reward them well.

137
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,760
It must be so easy for them

138
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,650
It's a brand that is
good enough to sell itself.

139
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,650
How in the world
would sales go up on their own?

140
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,890
It goes up because
our BM and ABMs work hard.

141
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,400
We just follow BM's instruction.

142
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,170
Are you saying that my brand
has poor sales

143
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,170
because I'm incompetent?

144
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,080
Don't take it the wrong way.

145
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,630
He knows himself well enough.

146
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,080
What did you just say,
Assistant Manager Kang?

147
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,490
Were you talking to me?

148
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,289
I didn't say anything.

149
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,030
You heard it too, right? Didn't you?

150
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,520
Me? I didn't hear anything.

151
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,270
My mist was making a noise, so...

152
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,450
Seriously.

153
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,250
Nothing scares you
because you're hotshots, is it?

154
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,290
You have no basic manners,

155
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,780
just because Director likes you...

156
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
Assistant Manager Kang.

157
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,810
Yes, sir.

158
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,030
Sort out the monthly achievement
for every team

159
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,090
and bring it to me.

160
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,100
Yes, sir.

161
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,040
I owe you again. Thanks, BM Lee.

162
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,410
It won't happen again next month.

163
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,990
Our new product will hit the jackpot.

164
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,030
Right, I really hope it will.

165
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,600
Of course it will.

166
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,490
I have manners
and so I want to repay your kindness.

167
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,620
You still play tennis
with the director, right?

168
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,590
Let's play tennis together
and head out for a meal.

169
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,640
It's on me.

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,190
Are you going to play this weekend?

171
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,620
The world is so unfair.

172
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,050
Competent employees
should have more spare time,

173
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,860
but instead they're given more work.

174
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,710
But the incompetent ones...

175
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,720
It's almost time for evaluation.

176
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,840
Be concerned about your sales, BM Seo.

177
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,780
By the way,

178
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,830
you should only play tennis
for the sake of your health.

179
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,390
Serves him right.

180
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,640
What do you think about office romance?

181
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,840
What?

182
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,730
I was listening back there

183
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,000
and wondering if
it's really that inconvenient. ok

184
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,960
You have to be careful.

185
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,210
When you're dating,
people make a huge fuss about that.

186
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,490
And you have to keep seeing
that person after breaking up.

187
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,040
There are more cons than pros.

188
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,790
So you won't date at work, right?

189
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,050
Me?

190
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,670
I'd be reluctant.

191
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,510
But still, if you like someone,

192
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,610
what can you do but date them?

193
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,030
If you see anyone dating secretly,
just ignore them.

194
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,580
Okay.

195
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,830
-Keep on looking.
-Okay.

196
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,130
How's the new product?

197
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,870
The sales aren't bad.

198
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,160
Yes, it's selling well.

199
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,760
But can you make us a mirror
for sales promotion?

200
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,000
That brand's got a pretty mirror.

201
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,010
Over there.

202
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,340
May I help you?

203
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,620
It's okay, I'm just looking around.

204
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,020
What are you doing?

205
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,180
Senior Yoon!

206
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,600
Checking out a product?

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,780
I'm doing market research.

208
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,550
You're making it obvious that
you're from a competitor.

209
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,830
Am I?

210
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,390
Do you need any help?

211
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,910
It's okay, thank you.

212
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,410
Yes, please!

213
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,700
Your lipstick seems great.

214
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,260
Can you pick one

215
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,350
for my girlfriend?

216
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,760
Pick one, honey.

217
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,430
Your girlfriend is so beautiful.

218
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,510
Right? What's the best one here?

219
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,400
In this line, this product
is the best seller.

220
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,210
Would you like to test this out?

221
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,650
Do you want to try it on?

222
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,990
You are unbelievable.

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,370
We can't do market research
out in the open.

224
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,740
I'll let it slide. Just this once.

225
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,070
Don't you remember what happened
the first time we worked together?

226
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,140
People suspected if we were dating.

227
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,280
Things have cooled down now,

228
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,490
but they still want to ship us.

229
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,510
What if someone saw what happened?

230
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,620
Well, I just...

231
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I know.

232
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,760
It's because you feel at ease with me.

233
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,930
Still, it's better to be careful

234
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,170
to avoid misunderstanding.

235
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,370
I might seem like an old fossil,

236
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,130
but that's the office life
I've experienced.

237
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,000
You understand what I'm saying, right?

238
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,620
Yes.

239
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,170
I'm sorry, I didn't think it through.

240
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,960
Forget it, it's fine.

241
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,930
Take it to the
Product Development Team tomorrow.

242
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,570
and file an expenses claim.

243
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,670
Senior, you should take it.

244
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,670
It's okay, I have a lot of lipsticks.

245
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,260
But you don't have this one.

246
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,460
Even if you have a lot,
you only apply the same one.

247
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,180
This one looks good on you.

248
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,780
Well, anyway. You should take it.

249
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,570
Take it as a thank-you gift
for teaching me well.

250
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,930
Can't you accept it?

251
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,370
Well, I did work really hard.

252
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,520
You're a troublemaker.

253
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,910
Thanks, I'll use it well.

254
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,690
Okay, but

255
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,510
you have to use it.

256
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,170
Don't give it to someone else.

257
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,240
Do you want to get something to eat?

258
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,180
I have a dinner plan.

259
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,060
Dinner with whom?

260
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,260
My boyfriend.

261
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,550
Bye.

262
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,980
You don't have one.

263
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,570
Welcome.

264

Oh! Over here!

265
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,490
You came just in time.

266
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,640
I lucked out in the food department.

267
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,070
Wow, it looks delicious. Let's eat.

268

-I'll pour for you.
-Okay.

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,110
-A lot of rice cakes?
-Yes.

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,910
Hey, about your trainee.

271
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,530
Hyun-seung? What about him?

272
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,980
Does he like you?

273
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,020
What?

274
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,270
You two seem like you're dating.

275
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,060
Did your colleagues not say anything?

276
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,550
They used to.

277
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,180
But now...

278
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,030
He doesn't like you?

279
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,790
He's just friendly.

280
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,540
Perhaps because he has two sisters.

281
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,250
Wow, he has two sisters?

282
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,040

Nothing serious, I'm sure.

I think this is how a marketer
should've acted.

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,240
I know because I wanted to
bring the two of you here.

335
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,430
You didn't even bother to contact us.

336
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,190
Stop lying.

337
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,860
He must be really busy.

338
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,560
What do you mean?
He doesn't even have a girlfriend.

339
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,240
That's why he has time for us
whenever we call him.

340
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,030
I've come to the wrong place.

341
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,860
I'll go to eat ramen.

342
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,590
-Hey! Sit!
-Come on.

343
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,260
What's wrong with you?

344
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,280
This is all your fault.

345
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,760
Why me?

346
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,860
The lower stream will be dirty
only when the upper stream is dirty.

347
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,020
But the upper stream is so clean
that it's become a natural reserve.

348
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,190
What will the lower stream learn from you?

349
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,890
You make bridal dresses
for others every day, but...

350
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,380
You are exaggerating.

351
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,420
She can take care of herself.

352
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,660
Is that why you never tell us
about your girlfriend?

353
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,570
I won't tell you because it's you.

354
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,080
What's wrong with me?

355
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,890
Am I going to eat her alive?

356
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,540
Of course.

357
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,850
Stop laughing!

358
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,090
By the way,

359
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,170
how are you going to celebrate
your birthday? Do you have any plans?

360
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,730
I've made a lot of plans.

361
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,600
So, don't worry about me,
and take care of Ha-eun.

362
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,990
You two are worse off than Ha-eun.

363
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,330
At this rate, she'll get married
before her aunt and uncle.

364
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,950
I should've taught you better,

365
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,340
but men wouldn't leave me alone.

366
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,590
That's why I had no time to teach you.

367
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,260
Slightly to the right.

368
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,320
Lift your chin.

369
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,110
Slightly to the right.

370
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,580
Lower your hand.

371
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,430
Lower.

372
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,490
Look at the camera.

373
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,260
Not like that.

374
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,060
Like this.

375
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,650
Like this.

376
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,630
This angle is the best for you.

377
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,240
Okay, last ten shots.

378
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,650
Director!

379
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,560
What's the matter?

380
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,890
Do you

381
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,520
have a boyfriend?

382
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,760
No.

383
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,270
Give me your phone number then.

384
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,490
I have a husband.

385
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,630
What?

386
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,520
Honey!

387
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,010
I had fun today.

388
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,920
He has such a unique hairstyle.

389
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,060
I did well, right?

390
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,810
You were creepy.

391
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,230
When someone helps you,
you should say thank you first.

392
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,310
I'm hungry. Just drive.

393
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,450
Alright.

394
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,640
(How are you going to celebrate
your birthday? Do you have any plans?)

395
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,540
(You should take it.)

396
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,750
(It looks good on you.)

397
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,700
(You have to use it.)

398
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,860
I'm going upstairs for a meeting.

399
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,260
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

400
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,480
What would you like to order?

401
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,810
One Iced Americano
with two shots of espresso

402
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,030
and two pumps of vanilla syrup, please.

403
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
I'll have one Iced Americano.

404
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,860
I'll have the same as the first one.

405
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,820
Love you, my colleague.

406
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,390
I'll buy it for you next time.

407
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,530
Yuck, why is it so sweet?

408
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,060
This isn't your style.

409
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,060
How is it?

410
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,300
Whoa, man.

411
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,670
What's wrong with your taste?

412
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,420
I like it.

413
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,740
What?

414
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,870
You poor scoundrel.

415
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,240
If your work life is tough,
you must say it out.

416
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,450
How could you do this to yourself?

417
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,010
Why are you here?

418
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,910
Assistant Manager Jung
told off Min-seong again.

419
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,570
Seriously, that guy...

420
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,290
He's a total disaster for a trainer,
but he said I'm the disaster.

421
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,160
I have the worst boss.

422
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,340
I might stand up against him one day.

423
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,280
-You haven't done it yet?
-No.

424
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,740
But when he goes back to the office,

425
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,890
he'll say he admires
the assistant manager.

426
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,240
Man.

427
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,440
Of course, that's what I'll do.

428
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,350
I'm going to work here for a long time.

429
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,820
As long as they don't kick me out,
I won't leave on my own.

430
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,290
Honesty is your biggest charm.

431
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,210
Have you fallen for me?

432
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,530
Do you want to go out with me?

433
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,310
I'm not really into office romance.

434
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,060
What should I do, Hyun-seung?

435
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,450
-What should you do?
-Stop.

436
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,250
Hyun-seung!

437
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,230
It's your birthday soon.
What are your plans?

438
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,210
When is it?

439
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,080
Thursday.

440
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,410
Oh! Let's hang out that day.

441
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,590
No!

442
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,320
We won't meet up. No. Never.

443
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,490
I'll get going now.

444
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,740
Hey, hold on.

445
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,850
He downright refused.

446
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,050
Senior Yoon.

447
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,450
Yes?

448
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,170
What are you doing on Thursday?

449
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,800
Do you have any plans?

450
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,870
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

451
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,860
♫ Happy birthday, dear Hyun-seung! ♫

452
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,120
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

453
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,360
Cheers!

454
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,780
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

455
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,440
That hits the spot!

456
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,380
Wow, I'm full.

457
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,290
Beef for dinner and drinks afterward.

458
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,810
The birthday boy is buying everything.

459
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,850
Sorry for being a freeloader.

460
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,960
Stop being one then.

461
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,290
You buy the drinks.

462
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,310
-Me?
-Yes.

463
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,490
You said you feel sorry.

464
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,180
You should be paying then.

465
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,990
Are you finally paying?

466
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,960
Hey, I paid once in a while.

467
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,950
Everything is on me tonight.
You're all celebrating my birthday.

468
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,540
-You should've said that earlier.
-I was holding back on my appetite.

469
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,040
She never says she'll buy.

470
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,840
Why are you spending
your birthday with us?

471
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,560
You must have a lot of friends.

472
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,010
Right. Even if you have no girlfriend,

473
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,400
do you not have any friends either?

474
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,510
Come on, sir. I have a lot of friends.

475
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,250
I'm here because I like my teammates.

476
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,150
He's buttering me up.

477
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,250
Poor Hyun-seung,

478
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,730
you should meet people outside the office.

479
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,250
With your face and your talent!

480
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,820
I'll set you up...

481
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,560
He'll do well on his own.

482
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,760
What decade are you living in?
Stop bugging him.

483
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,700
Good job.

484
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,090
What? Bugging?

485
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,890
Assistant Manager Ahn, stop bugging him.

486
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,700
You're a terrible matchmaker.

487
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,420
Sir, you are nagging me now.

488
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,990
I didn't tell you, but

489
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,700
there are eight couples...

490
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,420
Are you waiting for a phone call?

491
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,300
No.

492
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,490
By the way, it's my treat here.
As a birthday gift.

493
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,650
I refuse.

494
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,220
Why? It won't be much.

495
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,750
That's why I refuse.

496
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,410
Tell me what you want then.

497
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,940
Nothing expensive though.

498
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,110
It doesn't have to be an object, right?

499
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,850
Later, when we finish here...

500
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,930
Excuse me.

501
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,660
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Okay.

502
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,160
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

503
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,810
You should make more friends.

504
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,300
Cheers.

505
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,240
Cheers.

506
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,520
BM Lee has finished his meeting.

507
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,400
We'll have one last drink when he comes.

508
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,390
Already? Why?

509
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,370
Let's hang out some more!

510
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,320
Karaoke! How about karaoke?

511
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,820
Karaoke? Sounds good!

512
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,280
Not for me.

513
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,290
I thought you liked it.

514
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,850
Why not? It's not that late.

515
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,510
Hyun-seung, you're coming, right?

516
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,330
-Of course, he will.
-Me?

517
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,490
Let's go to a karaoke bar. It's on me.

518
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,750
I don't know.

519
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,150
Let's go.

520
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,580
You're making me uncomfortable.

521
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,370
You have to go.

522
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,260
You'll go, right? You're going, right?

523
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,280
Stop, you're making me exhausted.

524
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,080
Let's go together.

525
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,420
I have to go to the restroom.

526
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,910
The restroom? Not karaoke?

527
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,970
Make it quick! Be ready!

528
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,500
It's dangerous.

529
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,389
You startled me! When did you get here?

530
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,530
Just now.

531
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,780
Seriously.

532
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,070
Did you have dinner?

533
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,350
Yes.

534
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,490
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

535
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,380
Did you drink a lot?

536
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,760
Moderately.

537
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,850
Which means you drank a lot.

538
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,990
Aren't you going to ask me
how the talk went?

539
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,760
I'm sure it went well.
It's you who did it.

540
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,000
It didn't go well.

541
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,420
It didn't?

542
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,790
What should I do?

543
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,070
What else can you do? Go see them again.

544
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,520
Why aren't you heading back?

545
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,150
Do you really want me to go?

546
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,640
Yes.

547
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,370
I'm leaving!

548
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,480
I actually did well.

549
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,040
Seriously.

550
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,250
Let's go, everyone's waiting.

551
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,860
Did you get home safely last night?

552
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,050
Yes.

553
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,650
You disappeared while
I was out for a second.

554
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,980
Did your friends call you?

555
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,830
Yes.

556
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,940
You were up all night, right?

557
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,320
You look really tired.

558
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,350
Chae Hyun-seung,
aren't you getting on the lift?

559
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,690
You two go ahead first.

560
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,420
What's the matter with him?

561
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,970
Who?

562
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,730
Hyun-seung. He doesn't look good.

563
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,670
I wonder if he's okay.

564
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,360
Aren't you paying
too much attention to him?

565
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,750
He's my trainee.

566
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,150
Are you jealous?

567
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,440
Probably?

568
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,410
Have a good day.

569
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,240
-I'm going upstairs for a meeting.
-Yes, sir.

570
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,190
General Manager Yoo.

571
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,730
(I'm going upstairs for a meeting.)

572
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,880
Do you want another beer?

573
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,750
Come by the shop tomorrow
and get your present.

574
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,400
She's taken.

575
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,460
That never crossed my mind.

576
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,470
That's why she doesn't care about me.

577
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,810
I had no idea.

578
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,710
How pathetic.

579
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,620
Is there someone you like?

580
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,170
did you confess to her?

581
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,130
I didn't even get to that part.

582
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,860
You like her a lot, right?

583
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,730
I guess so.

584
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,850
Are you trying to figure out
what to do now?

585
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,360
The weather is so nice.

586
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,740
It's so depressing.

587
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,410
Nobody asked me out on a day like this.

588
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,820
You're right, the weather is so nice.

589
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,880
Why aren't you on a date?

590
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,890
He's busy.

591
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,220
Again?

592
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,220
Why is your BM always
busy on the weekends?

593
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,910
It's suspicious.

594
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,450
It's because he's meeting the director.

595
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,130
Hey!

596
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,910
Darn it.

597
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,250
I heard that they are friends.

598
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,510
Yes, since high school.

599
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,700
They studied abroad together, too.

600
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,890
But why do I hear that they are cousins?

601
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,980
Probably because their names are similar.

602
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,440
Also, he got the BM position
soon after he got in.

603
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,000
-Is that a good thing?
-Nobody cares about it now.

604
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,730
Because

605
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,930
he's very capable.

606
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,480
You're so hyped when you
talk about your boyfriend.

607
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,460
-Do you like him that much?
-Yes, I like him a lot.

608
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,070
Will you introduce him to your mom?

609
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,500
Do you think about getting married?

610
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,540
You said you weren't interested.

611
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,660
I used to.

612
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,350
Used to?

613
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,260
If I introduce him to my mom,

614
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,040
she'll go berserk, right?

615
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,590
Are you really thinking
about marrying him?

616
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,880
It's okay, I have one here.

617
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,160
You always draw a hard line.

618
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,240
Play easy. It's not a tournament.

619
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,570
You'll blow out my knee.

620
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,480
One more round?

621
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,370
No, I need to leave now.

622
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,040
Where are you going?

623
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,200
Oh,

624
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,720
poor fellow.

625
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,570
You really are thinking
about marrying him!

626
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,840
So, stop suspecting him from now on.

627
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,670
No gossip, okay?

628
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,390
Okay.

629
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,470
What about your mom?

630
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,730
She'll go crazy when she finds out.

631
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,220
Why think about that already?

632
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,390
I don't even know
if he feels the same way.

633
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,530
Of course he feels the same way.

634
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,540
You guys have been
going out for two years.

635
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,270
If he doesn't feel the same way,
then that son of a...

636
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,600
Man.

637
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,580
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

638
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,970
You have someone you love.

639
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,750
I envy you.

640
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,810
You should start dating already.

641
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,850
Did you get some sleep?

642
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,780
Right, your present.

643
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,480
I should

644
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,390
stop, right?

645
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,570
She looked so happy.

646
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,340
Get back inside. Thanks for the clothes.

647
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,200
Call me whenever you need
a drinking buddy.

648
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,900
No way.

649
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,820
When I'm with you,
people think you're my girlfriend

650
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,430
and no woman will come near me.

651
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,260
You only think about yourself, is it?

652
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,940
You should think about yourself too.

653
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,680
They're here.

654
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,510
Bride Lee Hyo-joo,

655
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,270
groom Lee Jae-shin,

656
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,830
welcome.

657
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,880
I'll escort you to the second floor.

658
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,730
Do you know them?

659
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,590
Yes, they're our customers.

660
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,430
Why? Do you know them?

661
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,940
So, are you saying that

662
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,670
those two people

663
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,160
are getting married?

664
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,720
Ji-seung,

665
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,290
I can't give up

666
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,200
on this crush.

667
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,690
What?

668
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,070
What kind of dress should I make you wear?

669
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,270
A simple one?

670
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,220
Or a glamorous one?

671
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,140
What are you talking about?

672
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,500
Your wedding dress.

673
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,000
We need to think about that.

674
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,300
Hey! I'm not getting married right away.

675
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,510
It's good to be prepared in advance.

676
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:09,690
You have no friends or siblings,
but me to help you.

677
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,770
I'll be your big sister

678
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,430
and make arrangements for your wedding.

679
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,760
Thank you, Big Sister.

680
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,250
I'm so honored.

681
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,990
But first, take that eye booger out.

682
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:19,990
Eye booger?

683
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,470
The other side!

684
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,560
Stop talking nonsense
and get ready for work.

685
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:26,730
Bye.

686
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,190
Let's talk some more later.

687
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,690
Come home early!

688
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,060
-Okay?
-Whatever.

689
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,850
(The wedding is three months later.
What are you going to do?)

690
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,120
Did you have a good weekend?

691
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,140
Not so bad.

692
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,650
What about you? How are you doing?

693
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,550
Not so bad.

694
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,970
Hello.

695
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,420
Hi.

696
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,710
Pardon me.

697
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,880
Get on, Senior Yoon. Over here.

698
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,080
Okay.

699
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,540
Did you have a good weekend, sir?

700
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:02,110
I did. How about you?

701
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,060
Not so good for me.

702
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,210
I saw something awful.

703
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,720
You look really tired.
You must've been busy

704
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,840
going here and there.

705
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,110
Why don't you get off first, sir?

706
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,690
Sir?

707
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,710
Hyun-seung, what...

708
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,640
What's the matter?

709
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,980
It's not bad.

710
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,380
The title already says about
requesting for container purchase,

711
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,880
so you don't have to write that again.

712
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,130
I think you should take this phrase out.

713
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,110
The numbers are accurate, right?

714
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,010
Owing to the high expectation
for the new essence,

715
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,270
we received a good response for
Evaluation Team.

716
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,320
It's better than what we thought.

717
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,880
We're considering increasing the quantity.

718
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,870
We ran a cost simulation.

719
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,610
Even if we double the quantity,

720
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:45,120
it's still within the monthly budget.

721
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,870
If you approve it, the factory has agreed

722
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,140
to supply additional products this week.

723
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,380
What's wrong, Hyun-seung?

724
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,480
Sorry, my clothes caught on something.

725
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,260
Shall we do that?

726
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,370
Yes, check with the factory one more time.

727
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,260
(What on earth has gotten into you?)

728
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,500
Why are you acting like that to BM Lee?

729
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,520
What is it? Tell me.

730
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,040
I'm asking you now. What's going on?

731
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,140
Hyun-seung!

732
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,570
If you see anyone dating secretly,
just ignore them.

733
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,660
I'll put up with it for now

734
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:37,720
since you don't want to be discovered.

735
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,840
What are you talking about?

736
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,750
Put up with what and discover what?

737
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,510
-Can't you see BM Lee is...
-However,

738
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,450
if I think it's gone far enough,

739
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,840
I won't just stand by.

740
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,010
Because I'm protective.

741
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,080
I'll get going now.

742
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,530
Come on in.

743
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,280
Why are you drinking all of a sudden?

744
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,180
I just felt like it.

745
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,850
Why do you want to drink?

746
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,170
Did you talk with BM Lee
about getting married?

747
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,630
Did he say no?

748
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,760
Then what? Did something happen
with your product?

749
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,450
It's about Hyun-seung.

750
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,630
I think he wants to quit his job.

751
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,070
Your trainee? Why?

752
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,070
He's good at his job
and gets along with everyone.

753
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,700
He's doing great.

754
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,270
Did he confess his love for you
and get rejected?

755
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,950
Seriously.

756
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,840
I thought he was doing well too,

757
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,970
but it wasn't what it seemed, I guess.

758
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,450
I did my best because
he's my first trainee.

759
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,390
Well, if he wants to quit,
let him quit then.

760
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,980
It's his life anyway. What can you do?

761
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,690
Don't let it bother you.

762
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,210
That's right,

763
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,070
but I still hope he makes
the right decision.

764
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,050
(One month later)

765
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:33,060
(Mr. Lee Jae-shin has
made a reservation today.)

766
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,600
Two months...

767
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,380
Wedding dresses are really pretty
these days.

768
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,140
Look at this.

769
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:45,770
What is it?

770
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,100
If you start looking at wedding dresses,
it means it's time for you to get married.

771
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,140
I don't even have a boyfriend.

772
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,980
You don't need one to want to get married.

773
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,580
You should date someone.

774
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,300
Is that so?

775
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,200
It's good to date.

776
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,190
It's time, you know.

777
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,820
What style would be suitable for me?

778
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,370
You have to try them on first.

779
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,180
Get a boyfriend and go on a dress tour.

780
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:20,050
Are you going to get married
all of a sudden?

781
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,060
No, I'm not!

782
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,930
Ahn, doesn't your mouth hurt
with all the talking?

783
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,270
I'm going upstairs for a meeting.

784
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,850
Yes, sir.

785
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,570
I'm going back to work.

786
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,170
We'll get back to work too.

787
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,870
You should work, you know.

788
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,630
Over here.

789
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,490
What's up?

790
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:33,820
I'm sorry, but about tonight...

791
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,560
Director Lee said we have to go somewhere,

792
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,780
but I forgot.

793
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,460
Is it something important?

794
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:43,160
Yes, it's work. I can't get out of it.

795
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,330
I'm really sorry.

796
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,420
Since it's work, there's nothing
you can do.

797
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,190
Didn't you mention that
you have something to tell me?

798
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,680
It's almost our second anniversary.

799
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,030
Do you want to go on a trip?

800
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,540
Yes.

801
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,480
Think about where to go.

802
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,610
-We'll talk about it tomorrow.
-Okay.

803
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,960
You'll be late for your meeting. Go on.

804
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,320
Senior Yoon!

805
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,910
What are you doing here?

806
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,540
Are you free tonight?

807
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,700
Why?

808
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,380
It's something important.

809
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,800
There's something I need to show you.

810
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,580
You're free, right?

811
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:02,530
I think you are
because you were turned down.

812
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,930
-What are you talking about?
-I heard everything.

813
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,940
You were turned down
by the guy who seems like your boyfriend.

814
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,370
I wasn't turned down. He's not my...

815
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,310
You were turned down for sure.

816
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,690
Compared to what you'll face
in the near future,

817
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,250
this is nothing.

818
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,290
Anyway, you're free, right?

819
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:33,340
No, I don't have time for you.

820
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,950
Even if you're busy,

821
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,260
make some time for me.

822
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,720
That doesn't suit you at all.

823
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:15,920
Senior Yoon.

824
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,810
Don't put on that lipstick.

825
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,820
Please eat first if it's okay.

826
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:04,280
-Thank you, I'll pay you
-I can call you senior, right?

827
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,780
But I'm not an student.

828
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,700
Okay, sure.

829
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,920
If you're a marketer,

830
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,010
what brand do you represent?

831
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:23,150
KLAR.

832
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,080
Marketing Team at KLAR.

833
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,740
