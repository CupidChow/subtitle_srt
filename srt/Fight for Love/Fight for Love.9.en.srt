No one else is here,

just you and me.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,480
In broad daylight?

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
- That's not appropriate.
- Come on.

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,000
You bad boy.

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,120
Yun, Lady Yu.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,180
- Listen.
- You're so bad.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,040
We would never...

30
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,630
We would never

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,630
stoop to eavesdropping.

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,590
Why?

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,230
Don't you want the Crown Prince?

34
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,430
He's inside.

35
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,080
- Listen.
- Come catch me.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,920
Hurry.

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,150
Come on.

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,080
Got you.

39
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,550
You cheated.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,960
No one will find out, right?

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,990
It's just us.

42
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,990
Really?

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Don't run.

44
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,470
Don't be shy.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,190
Stop it.

46
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,150
What are you doing?

47
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,590
Just what you're thinking.

48
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,310
You knew this all along?

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,280
The Crown Prince is engaged

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
to our Tuantuan.

51
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,310
So of course I bribed an

52
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,680
Eastern Palace eunuch to keep an eye on him.

53
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,470
He even bought a dancer

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,750
from Fragrance House the other day.

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
I paid a lot of silver

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,710
for that information.

57
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,080
I was about to talk to him.

58
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,400
And since you happened to need him,

59
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,750
perfect.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
Two birds with one stone.

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,400
What two birds with one

62
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,870
stone?

63
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,310
You just want me to help you

64
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,150
catch him cheating.

65
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,750
But didn't I help you

66
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,590
find him?

67
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,960
And you said

68
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,910
going straight to

69
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,030
the Eastern Palace would look bad.

70
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
I only knew he'd be here.

71
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,150
I must've been crazy

72
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,000
to ask for your help.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,400
But I did help, didn't I?

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,360
Enough.

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,200
Stop arguing.

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,700
We all want the Crown Prince.

77
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Since he's here,

78
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,990
handle the serious matter first.

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
Lady Chu is right.

80
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,750
Yun,

81
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,590
open the door.

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
How would I open it?

83
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,280
You need me to teach you?

84
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,590
Like this

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,240
and this.

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Then it will open.

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,030
Go on, open it.

88
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,910
Why don't you do it?

89
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,870
I'm not the Marquis of Zhenguo.

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,920
You do it.

91
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,720
I can't.

92
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,120
You can, hurry.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
Go on.

94
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,470
Come on.

95
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,400
Come on.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,310
Stop it.

97
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,160
Come on, come on.

98
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,350
Who's there?

99
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,590
Your Highness!

100
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,560
Lady Chu is impressive.

101
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
- Greetings,
- Greetings,

102
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,360
Your Highness.

103
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,870
You barged into my room

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,470
without summons.

105
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,600
I could punish you for that, you know.

106
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,830
Oh, you dare?

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,070
Keeping a mistress in an inn,

108
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,150
you know it can't be seen.

109
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,790
Your are about to marry Tuantuan,

110
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,950
yet you do something

111
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,000
this disgraceful.

112
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,240
How are we supposed to

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,190
entrust Tuantuan to you?

114
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,720
As if your reputation outside

115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,600
is spotless, Song Wenchang.

116
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,870
And I'm the Crown Prince.

117
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,160
I will have a harem in the future.

118
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,550
After the wedding,

119
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,880
Qingping will be Crown Princess,

120
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,360
and one day Empress.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,270
Should an Empress

122
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,720
not tolerate other consorts?

123
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Can you compare yourself to me?

124
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,540
I've never had a betrothal.

125
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,270
If I make a promise to a lady,

126
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,150
I would never be

127
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,010
as fickle as you.

128
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,800
Your Highness is correct.

129
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,680
Forcing our way into your quarters

130
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,600
is indeed a capital offense.

131
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,450
I will go to His Majesty now,

132
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,800
explain everything,

133
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,270
and accept punishment.

134
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,620
I as well.

135
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,250
I came today

136
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,250
by order of the Eldest Princess,

137
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,120
but forcing entry was improper.

138
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,510
I will

139
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,920
return and beg her

140
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,760
pardon.

141
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
But...

142
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Right,

143
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,440
I'll inform my father and Tuantuan.

144
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,400
Stop.

145
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,750
Whatever you intend to do,

146
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,950
at least choose an appropriate place.

147
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,600
Hot wontons.

148
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,870
Her Highness used a pouch

149
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,950
to lead me to the inn,

150
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,310
she clearly knew what

151
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,680
the Crown Prince was doing.

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,680
But she's his aunt.

153
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,750
Why have me catch him in the act?

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,920
Wouldn't that harm the royal family's
reputation?

155
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,560
She is his aunt,

156
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,870
but compared to him,

157
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,310
she cares more about Lady Song

158
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,630
of the Duke of Hu's mansion,

159
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,560
Song Qingping.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,840
This Lady Song

161
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,240
has long treated Her Highness's

162
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
chronic headaches

163
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,350
and helped her greatly.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,120
So the Emperor betrothed her

165
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,960
to the Crown Prince.

166
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,040
Her Highness likely couldn't act openly,

167
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,070
so she had you run this errand.

168
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,190
First, to warn the Crown Prince

169
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,360
for her and Lady Song.

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,830
Second, to help our Wei family.

171
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,510
A plan that serves two sides,

172
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,430
clearly with Mr. Xue's touch.

173
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,350
But catching

174
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,480
the Crown Prince cheating

175
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,000
isn't exactly glorious.

176
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
You

177
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,680
won't spread this, right?

178
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,560
Do I look like someone who gossips?

179
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,590
If you don't

180
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
speak of it,

181
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,310
neither will I.

182
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,320
Good.

183
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,430
Looks like you won't need to worry

184
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,950
about tomorrow's banquet anymore.

185
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,420
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

186
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,820
(True Might)

187
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,740
(Spirit tablet of Wei Sijie)

188
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,620
(Spirit tablet of Lady Qian)

189
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,020
(Spirit tablet of Lady Liu)

190
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,860
(Undying Loyalty)

191
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,700
Father,

192
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,230
Mother.

193
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,910
Whether I inherit

194
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,870
the title today or not,

195
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,240
as long as I live,

196
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,510
the Wei family will not fall.

197
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,870
I will carry the Wei name for you,

198
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,340
defend the nation and the throne,

199
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,480
hold no regrets.

200
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,660
(Ancestral Tablets of the Wei Clan)

201
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,020
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

202
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,720
Uncle Yun,

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
who are we still waiting for?

204
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,440
Why aren't we eating?

205
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,320
So impatient.

206
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,360
Mother said many ladies

207
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,550
and gentlemen would come today.

208
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,030
But it's been two whole hours.

209
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,720
Did they get lost?

210
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,550
Uncle Yun,

211
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,240
should we go find them?

212
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
I am hungry.

213
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,350
Lingmo,

214
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,630
didn't you just have snacks?

215
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,470
Hungry again?

216
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,960
Go play with your brother.

217
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,230
Let's eat.

218
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,110
Tell the kitchen

219
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,420
to bring the dishes to the hall.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,840
We'll eat by ourselves.

221
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,060
(Defend the nation and the throne)

222
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,560
Yun,

223
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,960
I have an unreasonable request.

224
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,270
After today,

225
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,670
we're leaving the Wei Mansion.

226
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,750
Before we go,

227
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,480
I want to take one thing of Qin's

228
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,240
as remembrance.

229
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Of course.

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
What would you

231
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,960
like to take?

232
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,510
When Wei Qin was alive,

233
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,270
his spear was his treasure,

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,790
full of his marks.

235
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,840
I want to take it.

236
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,800
Can I?

237
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,110
Han,

238
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,390
those spears

239
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,150
were forged by the seven

240
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,220
of them together.

241
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,870
Just leave them here,

242
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,880
it's like the brothers are reunited.

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Yes.

244
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,150
Chun is right.

245
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
No,

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,840
take it.

247
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,630
I can't bear to part with it,

248
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,200
but in the end,

249
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,240
it's only an object.

250
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,200
They

251
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,120
may never have the chance

252
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
to go to war again.

253
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,020
If seeing the spear

254
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,510
lets you remember your days

255
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,480
here with my brothers,

256
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,440
then that's the best use of them.

257
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,240
And my brothers

258
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,150
would surely be glad.

259
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,680
Yun,

260
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,440
thank you.

261
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
Alright.

262
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,600
Enough waiting.

263
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,440
Let's wait a bit longer.

264
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,040
Just a little bit.

265
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,040
Yes.

266
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,870
Maybe they're already at the gate.

267
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,150
Let's go check.

268
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,420
- Okay.
- Let's go.

269
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,030
Han, take the children

270
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,200
to the back garden.

271
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,720
Go on.

272
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,560
Let's go.

273
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,790
That day you insisted

274
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,200
on this banquet,

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
did you imagine this scene?

276
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,550
Whether they come is their choice;

277
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,150
whether we hold

278
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,440
the banquet is ours.

279
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,720
Do all we can, leave the rest to fate.

280
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,870
If you don't even dare try,

281
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,750
not even an immortal

282
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,870
could save you.

283
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,320
You personally delivered an invitation

284
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,160
to Her Highness.

285
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,200
And I invited the Crown Prince.

286
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,150
But look at the result.

287
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,480
We did our part,

288
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,000
but fate is decided.

289
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,920
Then

290
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,040
let's bet:

291
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,350
Obverse—

292
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,350
someone will come.

293
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,960
Reverses—no one will.

294
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,350
Dare you?

295
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Why not?

296
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,710
See?

297
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,080
Fate has spoken.

298
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,960
People will come today.

299
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
Yu,

300
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,080
General Chu and Lady Jin have arrived.

301
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,510
The first to watch the joke is here.

302
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,160
Please.

303
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,870
- Linyang, you're here.
- Yu.

304
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,990
Are we late?

305
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,670
Thank you for coming, General Chu.

306
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Not late,

307
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,800
just right.

308
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,550
See? I told you.

309
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,390
Why rush?

310
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,000
Even if we arrived an hour later,

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
we'd still be first.

312
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,630
Maybe even last.

313
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,030
Jin,

314
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,510
today is an important day.

315
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,840
Behave yourself.

316
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,670
If you cause trouble,

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,840
you'll regret it.

318
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,000
I came to support you,

319
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
yet you're ungrateful.

320
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
Oh, Chu Yu,

321
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,510
you schemed so hard to marry

322
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,440
into the Wei family,

323
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,720
what did you gain?

324
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,550
Not a single guest came to this banquet.

325
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,000
If not for Linyang and me,

326
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,240
the Wei family's

327
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,550
disgrace would reach the heavens.

328
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,600
And you still put on airs.

329
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,440
Jin!

330
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm not wrong, am I?

331
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,560
My sister was rude.

332
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,050
Please forgive her, Marquis Wei.

333
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,510
General Chu, don't call me that.

334
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,240
I'm not the Marquis yet.

335
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
Don't worry.

336
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,120
On our way here,

337
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,390
we saw many carriages.

338
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,510
I think they're waiting for the right moment.

339
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,990
The right moment?

340
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,840
Probably waiting to see

341
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,720
who comes first.

342
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,030
The Eldest Princess has arrived.

343
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,590
The moment's here.

344
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,520
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
Greetings, Your Highness.

345
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,040
Rise.

346
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,350
Your Highness.

347
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,790
I didn't expect you to truly come.

348
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm not late, am I?

349
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,750
You arrived perfectly.

350
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,000
I actually hadn't planned to come,

351
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,510
but when I heard no one else was here,

352
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,160
my interest grew.

353
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,590
And thank you

354
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,200
for standing up for Tuantuan.

355
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,000
Hanmei prepared gifts for you.

356
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

357
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,030
Well then, aren't you going to

358
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,270
arrange a good seat for me?

359
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,150
This way, Your Highness.

360
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,830
Please come inside.

361
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,310
General Wei.

362
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,920
- Young Master Sun has arrived.
- Please.

363
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,130
- Alright.
- As for soup,

364
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,000
check if the guests like it

365
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,990
- or not.
- Minister Gu has arrived!

366
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,390
- If not, don't serve it.
- Yes.

367
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,350
- Go ahead.
- Censor Chen.

368
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,190
Yes.

369
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,710
- Vice Minister Tong.
- You came quick early.

370
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,110
Together?

371
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,950
Alright.

372
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,670
Yun,

373
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,070
how could the three prodigies of the

374
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,310
Duke of Hu's Manor not be here today?

375
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,040
Slowly.

376
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,040
Three steps ahead.

377
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,200
Yes, go on, go on.

378
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,390
Go.

379
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,110
Careful, steps.

380
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,750
I've met Mr. Song.

381
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,270
These two are...?

382
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,160
Okay, steady, steady.

383
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,270
The lady in yellow

384
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,030
is the Duke of Hu's only daughter,

385
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,440
Song Qingping, much favored

386
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,510
by the Eldest Princess.

387
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,510
The elegant gentleman

388
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,160
is Song Wenchang's half-brother,

389
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,000
Song Shilan.

390
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,080
The three of them

391
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,550
grew up together.

392
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,720
But it's changed now.

393
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,150
Yun,

394
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,960
this is the gift

395
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,880
I personally chose for you.

396
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,800
Come on, carry it inside.

397
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,480
Careful with your steps.

398
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,750
Lift it.

399
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,680
Higher. Yes.

400
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,520
Look out.

401
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,240
Slowly, yes.

402
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,240
Look, that is...

403
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,160
General Wei,

404
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,600
my brother

405
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,240
spent a whole day choosing

406
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,750
and crafting this himself.

407
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,590
He really put

408
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,110
his heart into it.

409
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,910
Do you see it?

410
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,590
This is the gift

411
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,960
I, Song Wenchang,

412
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,800
prepared for General Wei.

413
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,000
Guess what's inside.

414
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,280
(True Might)
what's inside

415
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,070
to match his status?

416
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,960
Must be quite the treasure.

417
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,000
I will never

418
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,110
give ordinary gifts.

419
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,550
You're Lady Chu Yu?

420
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,800
Yes.

421
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,310
I didn't get to greet you earlier.

422
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,560
No matter.

423
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,720
I came to thank you.

424
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,680
I heard you helped a lot

425
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,960
with the Crown Prince issue.

426
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,750
I'll reconsider

427
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,000
my marriage with him.

428
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,630
Lady Chu Yu,

429
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,440
you can call me Tuantuan.

430
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,030
Tuantuan.

431
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,960
Hiding it so mysteriously,

432
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,720
is it made of gold?

433
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,670
Don't rush.

434
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
A moment like this

435
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,240
needs some buildup.

436
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,550
Stop teasing.

437
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,400
Open it already.

438
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,000
It's just a rockery?

439
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,750
What do you mean "just" a rockery?

440
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
There's

441
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,240
great meaning behind it.

442
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,550
This golden miniature mountain

443
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,640
- Actually a rockery?
- symbolizes

444
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,830
my hopes for General Wei:

445
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,510
that he stands firm like Mt. Tai,

446
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,550
unshaken

447
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,400
in hardship,

448
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,750
and even if he falls,

449
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,200
he can rise again.

450
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,750
Congratulations, General Wei.

451
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,870
Yun, since I

452
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,310
learned you'd succeed the marquisate,

453
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,070
I ordered this made

454
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,270
in the likeness of Mt. Tai.

455
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,750
I wish you steadiness

456
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,590
and strength

457
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,000
as the Zhenguo Marquis.

458
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,670
Do you like it?

459
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,680
Today is a thank-you banquet.

460
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Marquisate?

461
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,590
We waited half the day

462
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,920
and saw no title bestowed.

463
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,550
Such a waste of my time.

464
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,310
Such a pretty girl,

465
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
why so sour-tongued?

466
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,110
Who are you?

467
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,040
My sister.

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,720
So you're the famed

469
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,960
first beauty of Huajing,

470
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,200
Lady Chu.

471
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,160
But what you said isn't quite right.

472
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,190
Jin,

473
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,510
what did I just tell you?

474
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,720
What's wrong with me telling the truth?

475
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,790
Lady Chu Jin, huh?

476
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,550
Let me broaden your horizons.

477
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,640
Are you still my friend or not?

478
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,400
When will you show up already?

479
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,200
His Highness the Crown Prince arrives!

480
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

481
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,000
Rise.

482
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,630
Wei Yun,

483
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,350
receive the decree.

484
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,720
By Heaven's mandate, the Emperor

485
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,440
confers upon Wei Yun,

486
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,030
for his talent,

487
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,440
virtue,

488
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,790
and loyal service,

489
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,270
the title of Marquis of Zhenguo

490
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,590
of the Great Sui,

491
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,360
grants him the Fish Tally,

492
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,310
and appoints him

493
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,130
Commander of

494
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,310
the Arsenal Bureau.

495
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,920
(Imperial Edict)
He'll supervise the Bureau.

496
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,550
Thus decreed.

497
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,640
I, Wei Yun,

498
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,480
receive the decree

499
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,400
and thank His Majesty.

500
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,510
(This is the Fish Tally to enter
the Arsenal Bureau.)

501
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,800
I know

502
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,240
you now favor the civil faction

503
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,680
led by Duke of Ning.

504
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,330
But since his accession, His Majesty

505
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
has always sought to balance civil
and military power.

506
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
You knowingly break this balance,

507
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,490
forming factions for private gain.

508
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,830
If His Majesty learns of it...

509
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,950
That's right.

510
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,790
You might lose your position

511
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,400
as the Crown Prince.

512
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm his only son.

513
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,270
What, will Father depose me?

514
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,790
His Majesty won't remove the heir,

515
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,030
but you haven't inherited the throne yet.

516
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,550
Great Sui is still His Majesty's.

517
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,750
If you continue to favor civil over military,

518
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,160
once you inherit the throne...

519
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,590
Among the generals,

520
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
only the Wei clan

521
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,590
can still deter foreign enemies.

522
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,920
If they decline as well,

523
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,310
and Great Sui and North Qi

524
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,200
go to war again,

525
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,520
Your Highness

526
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,550
will have to lead the army yourself.

527
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,030
Please think carefully.

528
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,900
Whether the Wei clan survives

529
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,750
depends entirely on Your Highness.

530
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,190
Your Highness,

531
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,160
about General Wei going to Fragrance House

532
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,240
during his mourning period,

533
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,550
can this matter be dismissed?

534
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,960
As for the Marquis visiting

535
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,280
Fragrance House while in mourning,

536
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,630
His Majesty has investigated.

537
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,830
It was a misunderstanding.

538
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,550
It was...

539
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,720
Mr. Song who

540
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,550
caused trouble there,

541
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,880
and the Marquis

542
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,310
stepped in

543
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,550
only to help

544
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,000
a friend.

545
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,280
You should

546
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,310
bear the blame, not him.

547
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,150
Mr. Song,

548
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,590
isn't that right?

549
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,480
Yes.

550
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,830
Yes, of course.

551
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,760
Yun,

552
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,800
it's all my fault.

553
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,310
I was young and foolish.

554
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,560
I caused trouble

555
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,200
and made you clean up after me.

556
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,590
And now

557
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,310
it's blown up into this huge joke.

558
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,190
Thankfully His Majesty

559
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,110
saw the truth

560
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,320
and cleared your name,

561
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,830
or I'd feel

562
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,200
terrible.

563
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,200
Since you know

564
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,720
you're ignorant

565
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,270
and idle,

566
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,200
you should

567
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,590
improve yourself.

568
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,640
If there's another "misunderstanding,"

569
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,550
forget Father,

570
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,680
I won't spare you either.

571
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,040
(For my friend,)

572
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,240
(I'll endure this.)

573
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,880
(What can you do to me?)

574
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,750
Thank you for the warning, Your Highness.

575
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,070
Didn't expect I'd end up taking all the blame.

576
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,510
I don't care, Yun.

577
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,840
I treat you so well,

578
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,830
you'd better treat me well too.

579
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,110
Thanks,

580
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,520
my friend.

581
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,520
Anytime.

582
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,720
Marquis.

583
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:08,460
(Defend the nation and the throne)

584
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:30,660
(True Might)

585
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,000
Congratulations, Marquis.

586
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,920
Today I receive His Majesty's favor,

587
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,750
inherit the duty of my forebears,

588
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,590
don armor,

589
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,030
defend the realm.

590
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,310
I offer this wine

591
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,040
to honor my ancestors

592
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,520
and to all of you.

593
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,310
May the world know peace

594
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,310
and live in clarity.

595
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,720
Today, I helped the Wei Mansion

596
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,880
by creating the right moment,

597
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,590
a congratulatory gift of sorts.

598
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,510
Are you satisfied, Chu Yu?

599
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,560
My thanks, Your Highness.

600
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,680
I should leave now.

601
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,040
Huan,

602
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,510
come with me.

603
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

604
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,720
No need.

605
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,750
The flowers in Qinxi Valley are in full bloom.

606
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm going to enjoy them.

607
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,510
Goodbye, Your Highness.

608
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,270
Your Highness.

609
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,800
(True Might)
- A toast to you.

610
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,840
- Everyone.
- Cheers.

611
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,190
General Chu.

612
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,790
- Mr. Song.
- Yun.

613
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,960
- Linyang.
- Yu.

614
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,800
Thank you.

615
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,920
Linyang,

616
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,200
you must drink more today.

617
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,630
Alright.

618
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,670
Marquis Wei.

619
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,320
Come on.

620
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,110
Congratulations.

621
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,840
Chu Yu,

622
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,400
did you marry into the Wei family

623
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,310
to investigate a case?

624
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,510
If so,

625
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,660
I'm now Minister of Justice,

626
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,060
I can help you.

627
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,140
I went through all the files

628
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,420
on Lord of Qin's treason case

629
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,460
and found shocking things,

630
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,020
very likely

631
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,340
tied to the Chu

632
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,460
and Wei families.

633
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,780
This isn't the place to talk.

634
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,900
The Lord of Qin treason case

635
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,900
was over twenty years ago.

636
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,890
Why do you want to investigate?

637
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,820
Have you forgotten

638
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,820
why I was exiled?

639
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,780
Six years ago,

640
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,140
the Gu family was implicated.

641
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,860
To save my life, my father

642
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,220
took the blame.

643
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,020
With General Chu's plea,

644
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,380
I was

645
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,580
only exiled.

646
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,820
You mean

647
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,780
there was more to the case?

648
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,460
When Lord of Qin traveled south,

649
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,780
he fell in love with a woman.

650
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,140
She later bore him a son.

651
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,860
He promised her happiness,

652
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
but after he returned,

653
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,620
he was accused of colluding with North Qi.

654
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,900
During the investigation,

655
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,380
that woman took Great Sui's

656
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,860
secrets and fled back to North Qi,

657
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,860
causing three of our cities

658
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,940
to fall into their hands.

659
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,660
Since then,

660
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,220
many of our people have been

661
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,820
unable to return home.

662
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,460
(Lord of Qin case file)

663
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,780
(The woman was North Qi's Princess Yunyang)

664
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,580
(Leaked military plans to the enemy)

665
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,860
So

666
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,740
she deceived Lord of Qin.

667
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,700
She was

668
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,340
Princess Yunyang of North Qi,

669
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,420
and her child

670
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,500
returned to North Qi with her.

671
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,060
If Lord of Qin was framed,

672
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,100
your father was framed too.

673
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,860
Though it's been fifteen years,

674
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,820
all of this could've been

675
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,380
North Qi's scheme.

676
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,860
North Qi has never stopped coveting Great Sui.

677
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,980
They're cunning

678
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,940
and ruthless,

679
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,060
willing to pay any price

680
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,540
to devour us.

681
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,060
The battle at Baidi Valley

682
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,180
was suspicious.

683
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,260
Surely you came to the Wei family

684
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,780
trying to uncover something.

685
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,740
Gu Chusheng,

686
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,900
when the Chu family fell,

687
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,420
was there not something strange?

688
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,820
And do you remember

689
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,580
it was my father who pleaded

690
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,860
for yours in court?

691
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,020
How can you forget that case?

692
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,860
I didn't forget it.

693
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,660
If I hadn't gone to the Court,

694
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,180
I wouldn't know any of this.

695
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,100
- Now it's still...
- It's too late.

696
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,660
Who is it?

697
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,060
Open the door!

698
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,220
Someone is targeting us!

699
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,460
Narcotic Incense...

700
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,460
Stay away from me.

701
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,580
Mr. Gu,

702
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,860
your beauty is with you.

703
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,300
That's as far as I help you.

704
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,900
I may be low,

705
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,700
but not this vile.

706
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,260
Yu...

707
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,820
I'm sorry.

708
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,700
I was careless.

709
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,340
Jin,

710
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,780
I have something big to tell you.

711
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,060
You always hated

712
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,900
that Chu Yu, right?

713
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,700
Today I avenged you.

714
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,980
I drugged Chu Yu

715
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,660
and locked her in a room with Mr. Gu.

716
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,900
Is that true?

717
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,460
She bullied you before,

718
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,900
so today I paid her back in full.

719
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,260
Everyone,

720
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,300
everyone!

721
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,900
I just went to the backyard

722
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,500
and saw something

723
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,260
indescribable.

724
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,740
Interested?

725
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,900
Come with me!

726
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,380
Well...

727
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,380
- Let's go.
- Let's see.

728
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,220
We should take a look.

729
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,100
Let's go.

730
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,940
Who would've thought

731
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,140
someone would have a secret tryst

732
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,140
at the Young Marquis's banquet?

733
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,580
Society is truly decaying.

734
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,460
Good thing I was quick

735
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,940
and locked them inside.

736
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,980
What are you waiting for?

737
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,860
Open the door!

738
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,260
Go on.

739
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,660
Young Master Sun,

740
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,380
must you push this so far?

741
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,180
Today's

742
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
Marquis Wei's banquet,

743
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,980
making a scene

744
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,700
helps no one.

745
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,020
General Chu, you're wrong.

746
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,740
If we let this go,

747
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,380
we'll only encourage corruption.

748
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,900
Why are you stopping me?

749
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,900
Do you know something?

750
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,540
Young Master Sun,

751
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,180
what are you looking for?

752
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,100
Impossible!

753
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,140
I swear there were two people.

754
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,260
Jin,

755
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,380
I was not lying!

756
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,140
What are you saying?

757
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,420
What does this have to do with me?

758
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,260
But...

759
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,180
Here's what happened:

760
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,620
Just now,

761
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
I was tired,

762
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,260
so after urging the dishes,

763
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,780
I came here to rest.

764
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,100
But the door

765
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,900
suddenly locked.

766
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,220
Could this be

767
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,820
Young Master Sun's doing?

768
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
Trying to ruin my reputation

769
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,420
with nothing but words?

770
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,740
That's right!

771
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,100
We can all testify for Yu.

772
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,860
- Yes!
- Impossible!

773
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,580
There were two people.

774
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,660
I saw it with my own eyes!

775
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,500
How did you stand up?

776
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,780
What are you implying?

777
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,940
If I don't stand,

778
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,700
what posture should I use

779
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,580
to face everyone?

780
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,940
Innocent people are fearless.

781
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,740
If you don't believe me,

782
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,580
search all you want.

783
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,340
But if you find nothing,

784
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,940
don't blame me for being rude.

785
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,740
Impossible!

786
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,840
There were definitely two people!

787
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,700
Wei Qiu.

788
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,940
Here!

789
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,300
Young Master Sun spread rumors

790
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,620
and caused trouble

791
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,860
at Marquis Wei's succession banquet.

792
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,460
Such disruption,

793
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,060
where does that put our lord's dignity?

794
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,540
Take him

795
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,820
to the magistrate.

796
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,380
- Yes.
- Wait!

797
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,260
- Move!
- No!

798
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,100
There were two people!

799
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,980
Believe me!

800
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,180
Please believe me!

801
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,580
Yu.

802
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,580
It was all a misunderstanding.

803
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,740
Chun,

804
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,860
look after the guests.

805
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,340
I need some rest.

806
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,940
Everyone, please.

807
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,020
Yu.

808
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Give me some time, Linyang.

809
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,260
But you...

810
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,100
I'm fine.

811
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,500
Jin,

812
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,740
come with me.

813
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,620
What's so special about this place

814
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,940
that keeps Tuantuan lingering so long?

815
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,900
Don't tell me

816
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,140
you fancy Marquis Wei

817
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,820
and can't bear to leave.

818
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,620
Just now whose eyes

819
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,390
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
were fixed on Lady Chu Jin?

820
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,980
Shilan called you three times

821
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,940
before you came out.

822
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,940
Now you're projecting onto others?

823
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,500
I am nearly

824
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
twenty.

825
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,340
Shouldn't I focus on

826
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,420
my future marriage?

827
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,740
Tuantuan, you are simply regretful

828
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,580
that you couldn't take the pulse

829
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,990
of Lady Chu, who suddenly felt unwell.

830
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,100
Only Shilan understands me.

831
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,660
Chu Yu helped me out,

832
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,020
and I did nothing for her.

833
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,180
Our brother and Marquis Wei

834
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,020
are close.

835
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,340
You'll have

836
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,500
plenty of chances to repay

837
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,580
Lady Chu Yu.

838
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,460
Come on.

839
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,660
Linyang, walk slowly.

840
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,620
My foot hurts.

841
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,100
Linyang.

842
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,340
Linyang!

843
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,580
Young Master Sun did that.

844
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,740
It had nothing to do

845
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,660
with me.

846
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,940
I already scolded him!

847
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,420
Linyang,

848
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,380
I swear

849
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,020
I'll cut ties with him from now on.

850
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,140
I did everything I could.

851
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,940
Linyang, please don't ignore me.

852
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,580
One should not make their family look bad.

853
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,420
You seem to forget,

854
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,780
but I haven't.

855
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,500
We'll

856
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,740
settle this at home.

857
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,840
General Chu.

858
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,980
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
I went

859
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,940
to several clinics

860
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,780
nearby.

861
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,940
It's too late,

862
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,260
the physicians

863
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,100
can't come.

864
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,460
Should I

865
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,940
try farther?

866
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,040
Brother, my medical box.

867
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,900
Okay.

868
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,740
General Chu.

869
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,340
Lady Song.

870
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,300
General,

871
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,020
are you looking for a doctor

872
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,180
to treat Lady Chu Yu?

873
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,020
I know some medicine,

874
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,860
perhaps I can help.

875
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,420
It's so late,

876
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,620
will this be too much a trouble for you?

877
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,660
Not at all.

878
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,500
Treating Lady Chu Yu

879
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,860
is never a trouble.

880
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,780
Why are you back again?

881
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,860
Seeing off guests

882
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,620
is handled by Chun and the others.

883
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,580
And I hid the fact

884
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,860
that you were drugged.

885
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,660
So,

886
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,660
I couldn't just

887
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,500
leave you alone.

888
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,740
Don't worry,

889
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,860
I'm not bored enough

890
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,580
to come back just to laugh at you.

891
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,940
If you didn't want to watch a joke,

892
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,420
why did I end up trapped

893
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,020
by Young Master Sun?

894
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,940
If you hadn't let your brother hold me off,

895
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,940
how would Sun have succeeded?

896
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,380
Besides,

897
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,580
didn't I help you get Gu Chusheng away?

898
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,500
You took him away

899
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,340
to protect

900
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,700
your family's reputation,

901
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,420
not for me.

902
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,020
You're part of the Wei family now.

903
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,700
Its reputation

904
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,460
is yours too.

905
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,300
Where did you take him?

906
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,700
Father clearly said

907
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,780
we shouldn't attend the banquet.

908
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,700
Why did you come?

909
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,300
And

910
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,060
why did Marquis Wei

911
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,100
tell me to "watch you carefully"

912
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,060
when he put you in the carriage?

913
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,540
What did you do?

914
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,500
Looks like, true or false,

915
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,580
you and Chu Yu

916
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,020
will always

917
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,660
be tangled.

918
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,940
I

919
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,020
am always the outsider.

920
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,500
Don't overthink.

921
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,100
Look at you.

922
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,500
How can I not?

923
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,420
Since you

924
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,580
admit I'm part of the Wei family,

925
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,340
you won't refuse

926
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,700
a small request like escorting me

927
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,620
back to my room, right?

928
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,860
In my arms

929
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,500
or on my back?

930
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,900
Can I choose neither?
