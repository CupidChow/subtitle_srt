21
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,980
(Qingzhou Yamen)

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
Chusheng,

23
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,430
sorry about today.

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,480
I shouldn't have drunk

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,350
so much with you,

26
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,710
causing your disagreement

27
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,950
with General Wei.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
Here's the medicine for swelling.

29
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,270
Remember to use it.

30
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,590
Thank you, Xu.

31
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,070
Sorry for you to see this.

32
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,360
I didn't expect you

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,560
to be such an affectionate man,

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,870
still pining

35
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,960
for Ms. Chu.

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,030
General Wei

37
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,520
was just too harsh,

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,990
not respecting you at all.

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,190
What's the deal

40
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,280
between General Wei and Ms. Chu?

41
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,870
If Wei Yun hadn't pestered her

42
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,710
and crossed the line,

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Yu wouldn't have ended up

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,750
in such a situation.

45
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,430
Wei Yun

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
is not as steady as Wei Jun.

47
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,560
He always acts

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,590
on a whim.

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Look.

50
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,110
He's even tried to set you up,

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,200
hasn't he?

52
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,360
Wei Yun just arrived in Qingzhou

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,910
and wanted to replace

54
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,750
the existing defense.

55
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,430
He said it was

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,590
to let the Wei Army
and the Qingzhou garrison

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,870
take turns on guard

58
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,000
to rest and regain strength.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,460
But in reality,

60
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,470
he just saw that you had

61
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,060
considerable prestige in Qingzhou

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,690
and wanted to marginalize you.

63
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,360
With so many years

64
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,300
in the officialdom,

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,660
you surely can see through his tricks.

66
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,870
General Wei holds a high position,

67
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,690
is deeply trusted by the Emperor,

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,500
and has military power.

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
It's only natural for him

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,130
to have such thoughts.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,300
You don't know.

72
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,110
Wei Yun's succession to the title
was unconvincing.

73
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,630
Many officials in the court

74
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,750
often impeach him.

75
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,240
He's eager to achieve military merits

76
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,970
to silence the gossip

77
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,680
and make the soldiers of the Wei Army

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,690
submit to him.

79
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,870
Be careful with him.

80
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,190
Once he has the chance

81
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,220
to achieve military merits

82
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,850
and gain more power,

83
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,500
Ms. Chu will be

84
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,750
even less likely

85
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,220
to return to your side.

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,120
Chusheng,

87
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,000
I was just speaking off the cuff.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,530
You mustn't take it to heart.

89
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,900
If he wants to achieve merits,

90
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,290
I'll let him.

91
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,140
Generals are bound to die in battle;

92
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,020
jars always break near the well.

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,430
If General Wei

94
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,100
dies on the battlefield,

95
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,220
then Yu will be mine.

96
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,500
Xu,

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,360
for the sake of your relationship

98
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,660
with my father,

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,220
please help me.

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,100
Crossbowmen, listen!

101
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,370
Shoot!

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,300
Stop!

103
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,370
General Chu,

104
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,710
the octagonal crossbow improved
by Commander Lu

105
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,700
is really amazing.

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,180
The mechanism is sturdy,

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,920
and the problem of excessive recoil

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
has been completely solved.

109
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,540
During the test,

110
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,300
it didn't hurt the crossbowman's wrist.

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,660
Compared to before,

112
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,860
the penetration power

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,340
has also increased significantly.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,730
North Qi first used
the octagonal crossbow

115
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,340
in Fengling City.

116
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,510
If we are to fight again
in Fengling City,

117
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,040
they'll surely use it again

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,980
to attack the city.

119
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,850
With this improved octagonal crossbow,

120
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,420
our chances of winning
will be much greater.

121
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,210
It's just a pity

122
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,430
that the mineral
for making the mechanism

123
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,370
is in short supply,

124
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,240
and we can't achieve mass production.

125
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,670
By the way,

126
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,830
hasn't Commander Lu already

127
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,830
arrived in Fengling?

128
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,770
Why haven't we seen him?

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,900
He went to find the Eldest Princess.

130
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,420
(General's Mansion)

131
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,850
Why did it suddenly explode?

132
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,170
Was it because of excessive fire?

133
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,300
Miss Song.

134
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,370
Miss Song.

135
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,610
Linyang,

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
I just wanted

137
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,270
to make these hemostatic herbs

138
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,220
into pills for the soldiers.

139
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,720
I didn't expect it

140
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,100
to turn out like this.

141
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,500
Are you hurt?

142
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,390
I dodged in time

143
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,580
during the explosion,

144
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,260
so I wasn't injured.

145
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,180
Linyang,

146
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,100
you care about me, right?

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,460
This is the pill I made.

148
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,970
It's very portable

149
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,220
and has many uses.

150
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,730
Linyang, I came...

151
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,940
Is it the right time?

152
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,130
Chu Yu.

153
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,540
Miss Song,

154
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,690
your umbrella.

155
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,200
Good.

156
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,140
Lu Qiba did a good job.

157
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,690
Linyang,

158
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,480
I came this time

159
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
to bring the Eldest Princess

160
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,420
back to Huajing.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,060
- Listen.
- Linyang,

162
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,270
don't rush

163
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,700
to persuade me yet.

164
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,080
Think about what to do

165
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
with your problems first.

166
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,540
Come on.

167
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,300
How can I persuade you?

168
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,030
I'm busy with drills and patrols

169
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,970
every day.

170
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
What problem could I have?

171
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,850
You don't know.

172
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,580
After you left,

173
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,130
the Duke of Hu visited us.

174
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,870
He first scolded you,

175
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,630
and then he hinted

176
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,080
that he wanted to arrange

177
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,200
a marriage with our family.

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,490
It's about Mr. Song

179
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,730
and Jin, right?

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,700
It's about Tuantuan and you.

181
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,730
Mother didn't know your feelings,

182
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,240
so she treated the Duke of Hu
to some good tea

183
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,300
and didn't dare to agree.

184
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,060
Linyang,

185
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,540
answer me.

186
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,040
What do you think about this?

187
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,450
We

188
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,610
are not suitable.

189
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,380
Yu,

190
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,970
don't bring this up again.

191
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,570
(Oh, no.)

192
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,100
(I can't leave her alone.)

193
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,490
Linyang, where are you going?

194
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,580
The mansion has long been empty.

195
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,810
With the sudden rain,

196
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,840
the barracks where the soldiers live

197
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,780
might leak.

198
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,970
I'll go check.

199
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Miss Song,

200
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,540
are you okay?

201
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,850
Linyang,

202
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,580
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

203
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,210
Sorry.

204
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,750
If you're scared,

205
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,670
put this cotton

206
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,610
in your ears.

207
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,900
It will help.

208
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,540
Linyang,

209
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,600
if you tell me

210
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,950
you only see me as a sister again,

211
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,940
I won't believe that.

212
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,910
You know
that I'm not afraid of loud noises.

213
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,970
I was pretending.

214
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,580
I've had at least 80 exploded jars

215
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,370
in my hands.

216
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,000
Even if I were scared,

217
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
I would've gotten used to it.

218
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,610
I bet you'd come,

219
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,900
and you really did.

220
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,460
Only when you truly love someone

221
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,700
can you tolerate their lies.

222
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,820
So,

223
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,120
you were worried about me,

224
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,600
which is why you didn't dare to bet.

225
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,900
Chu Linyang,

226
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,150
do you even know

227
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,300
that you like me?

228
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,420
Get some rest.

229
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,180
Linyang.

230
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,730
Chu Yu,

231
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,630
when I pretended to be scared

232
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,570
in front of Linyang,

233
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,770
you must've noticed, right?

234
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,130
Thank you for not exposing me.

235
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,340
You did a good job,

236
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,030
but Linyang

237
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,240
is an iron tree.

238
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,460
It'll be hard for him to bloom.

239
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,020
Chu Yu,

240
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,490
do you think

241
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,820
Linyang likes me?

242
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,970
Linyang

243
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,460
grew up in Fengling,

244
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,340
following Father to guard the city.

245
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,940
So, in his heart,

246
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,220
Fengling City is like his home,

247
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,960
and the people here

248
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,180
are like his family.

249
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,090
Therefore,

250
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,820
in my opinion,

251
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,130
Linyang surely likes you,

252
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,820
but Fengling is

253
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,060
too important to him.

254
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,500
The responsibilities and worries
on his shoulders

255
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,300
have held him back from coming to you.

256
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,220
Do you understand

257
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,330
what I'm saying?

258
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,460
I believe that one day,

259
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,800
Linyang will surely follow

260
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,810
his heart

261
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,900
and come to you.

262
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,420
But until then,

263
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,970
you must hold on.

264
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,540
You're right.

265
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,610
In this life,

266
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,920
it's not easy

267
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,960
to meet someone

268
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,010
you truly like.

269
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,260
There's no problem that can't be solved.

270
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,610
If you give up on happiness

271
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,610
out of fear,

272
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,540
that's just silly.

273
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,750
I must warm up

274
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,260
this cup of tea.

275
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,650
By the way, Chu Yu,

276
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,750
aren't you supposed to be

277
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,300
with Young Marquis Wei?

278
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,410
Why suddenly come to Fengling?

279
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,160
Once we find out

280
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,100
who is behind Yao Yong

281
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,540
and everything is settled,

282
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,450
I will confess

283
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,370
our relationship to everyone.

284
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,310
Life is not

285
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,850
only about love.

286
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,460
There are always more important things

287
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,770
waiting for us.

288
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,380
(Qingzhou Yamen)

289
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,930
If it's a welcome banquet,

290
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,750
don't you think

291
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,780
it's too late?

292
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,680
Lately, I've seen you busy

293
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,110
with the city's affairs.

294
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,270
You must be tired.

295
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,790
Today, I suddenly heard

296
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,030
that you're free,

297
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,410
so I set up this banquet.

298
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Sorry about my poor entertainment.

299
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,780
I'll punish myself with a drink.

300
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,860
Mr. Xu, don't rush.

301
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,690
If this drink is a punishment,

302
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,650
I'll accept it.

303
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,370
But you only invited me

304
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,410
and Supervisor Gu today.

305
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,740
You must want something.

306
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,720
I heard from the servants

307
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,680
that you two had

308
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,500
some disagreements two days ago.

309
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,920
So, I set up the banquet

310
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,980
to act as a mediator.

311
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,450
Please don't blame me for doing this

312
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,610
without asking your permission.

313
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,050
How could we?

314
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,020
Mr. Xu, do you know

315
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,540
that Supervisor Gu
spoke rudely that day,

316
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,300
causing the conflict?

317
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,500
I've heard something about it.

318
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,960
But now, with enemies before us,

319
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,850
we should work together.

320
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,310
However serious the grievances are,

321
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,270
you shouldn't fight

322
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,850
so fiercely at this moment.

323
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,160
If the people of Qingzhou

324
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,510
know about it,

325
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,720
how can they trust

326
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,260
the officials of Great Sui?

327
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,620
What do you think?

328
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,300
You're absolutely right.

329
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,720
That day,

330
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,930
General Wei and I

331
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,060
didn't think it through.

332
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,000
I know

333
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,020
what's important.

334
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,020
But even now,

335
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,070
I still think

336
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,310
that Supervisor Gu

337
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,260
was too rude that day.

338
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,500
To patch things up,

339
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,030
it depends on how far

340
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,300
Supervisor Gu can go.

341
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,610
As the saying goes,

342
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,260
a real man can bend and stretch.

343
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,500
One should take a step back

344
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,410
to achieve success.

345
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,490
What do you think,

346
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,100
Supervisor Gu?

347
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,310
That day, I spoke without thinking,

348
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,550
disregarding the bigger picture

349
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,540
and crossing the line.

350
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,410
General Wei,

351
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,660
please forgive me.

352
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,790
Is this the best

353
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,020
you can do?

354
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,340
I wonder

355
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,780
if this is good enough.

356
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,340
Barely.

357
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,610
Mr. Xu knows

358
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,300
that you two have been
working hard lately

359
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,120
and probably don't want to go
to the yamen,

360
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,710
so he asked us to bring the wine

361
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,810
and dishes here.

362
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,800
With General Wei

363
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,850
and Supervisor Gu there,

364
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,020
it's the same.

365
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,540
What do you mean by that?

366
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,300
Is their presence enough?

367
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,210
- I...
- We don't deserve the banquet?

368
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,540
Supervisor Gu is also there?

369
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,400
Yes.

370
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,770
General Wei and Supervisor Gu

371
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,110
are having a great time drinking.

372
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,680
It seems they will come back late.

373
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Understood.

374
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,620
You may leave now.

375
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,050
Yes.

376
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,210
Wenchang,

377
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,880
drinking can cause trouble.

378
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,820
Remember what General Wei told you?

379
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,100
(Always Diligent)

380
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,160
General Wei, you don't have

381
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,720
any important matters tomorrow, right?

382
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,780
Today,

383
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,860
let's just enjoy

384
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,060
the wine.

385
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,310
I especially brought

386
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,170
all this fine wine for you.

387
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,650
You set up this banquet

388
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,370
to reconcile

389
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,650
between me and Supervisor Gu.

390
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,220
The drink just now

391
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,430
is enough to show my respect.

392
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,040
Today, there's a change of guard.

393
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,300
I'll go check it out.

394
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,400
Goodbye.

395
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,340
General Wei,

396
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,850
you've just had one drink.

397
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,750
Wouldn't it be a waste

398
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,930
of all this delicious food?

399
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,610
Leave the change of guard

400
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,340
to the subordinates.

401
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,210
Rest assured.

402
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,450
Sit down

403
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,410
and continue

404
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,530
to drink.

405
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,780
I'll keep your reminder

406
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,260
in mind.

407
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,130
What do you mean, Mr. Xu?

408
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,270
Supervisor Gu,

409
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,150
I've already helped you get

410
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,220
the favorable timing and location
that you wanted.

411
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,880
The mind-numbing powder

412
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,100
he drank has also taken effect.

413
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,580
If you really hate him,

414
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,580
now is the best chance.

415
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,180
Gu Chusheng,

416
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,580
you want to kill me?

417
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,450
Supervisor Gu,

418
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,170
what are you waiting for?

419
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,740
Do you really think

420
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,060
you can kill me?

421
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,450
Wei Yun,

422
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,100
blame yourself.

423
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,610
Among so many women in the world,

424
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,060
you had to fall for Chu Yu.

425
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,820
Only if you die

426
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,210
can Yu possibly come back to me.

427
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,900
Gu Chusheng,

428
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,160
she has no more feelings

429
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,240
for you now.

430
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,450
You know it in your heart.

431
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,100
You want to kill me

432
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,540
just because you can't face this fact,

433
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,210
and you dare not admit

434
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,830
that your weighing of pros and cons

435
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,770
was wrong.

436
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,860
Gu Chusheng,

437
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,400
you are a coward.

438
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,340
Shut up!

439
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,350
You're on the brink of death,

440
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,650
yet you're still defiant.

441
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,930
You can't move, can you?

442
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,540
I'll send you on your way.

443
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,340
Supervisor Gu,

444
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,820
this is your last chance.

445
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,690
You have no way out.

446
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,140
Wei Yun is dead.

447
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,860
Wei Yun is dead!

448
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,000
Let go.

449
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,040
Let go.

450
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,250
Mr. Xu,

451
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,090
aren't you going to kill him?

452
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,310
Kill him.

453
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,350
Kill him.

454
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,180
Xu Lingzhang,

455
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,540
why are you helping
Gu Chusheng kill me?

456
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,100
General Wei,

457
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,920
since you're on the brink of death,

458
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I don't need

459
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,130
to hide it anymore.

460
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,790
I'm not helping him,

461
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,650
but using his hand to kill you.

462
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,140
But remember:

463
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,850
You won't be alone on the path to death,

464
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,410
because now

465
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,300
I'll kill

466
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,930
both of you.

467
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,130
You used me.

468
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,550
Don't blame me.

469
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,790
It's your fault to be

470
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,300
the people of Great Sui

471
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,540
in Qingzhou right now.

472
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,340
Qingzhou

473
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,610
belongs to me.

474
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
Anyone who tries to get their hands

475
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,890
on Qingzhou is my enemy.

476
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,210
What I've always wanted

477
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,680
is not to be the Military Governor

478
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,270
of Qingzhou

479
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,020
but the ruler of Qingzhou.

480
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,770
Don't be afraid.

481
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,060
For helping me hurt him,

482
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,130
I'll give you a quick death.

483
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,410
You weren't poisoned?

484
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,020
Why were you stabbed?

485
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,590
To reveal your true face,

486
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,650
this stab

487
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,340
is worth it.

488
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,540
So,

489
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,300
you knew it all along.

490
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,720
This playacting

491
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,080
has been quite exhausting for me.

492
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,240
Before today,

493
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,450
I couldn't be sure.

494
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,580
Thank you, Mr. Xu,

495
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,610
for confirming the truth.

496
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,690
Xu Lingzhang,

497
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,500
you can kill one or two people,

498
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,370
but you can't kill ten or a hundred.

499
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,620
Surrender now,

500
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,470
and I'll leave your body intact.

501
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,580
The outcome is still uncertain.

502
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,260
Don't be too happy too soon.

503
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,210
Outside this yamen,

504
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,200
it's already my world.

505
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,610
Mr. Xu, you can go out and see

506
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,410
if Qingzhou

507
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,070
is still

508
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,450
your world now.

509
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,210
It can't be.

510
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,650
This is impossible.

511
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,860
Mr. Xu.

512
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,510
Your leader

513
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,610
has become a prisoner.

514
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,030
Why

515
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,970
don't you surrender?

516
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,180
(Rule with Virtue)

517
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,070
Even if he had told you in advance

518
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,500
that today was a trap,

519
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,880
how did you know

520
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,550
about the soldiers

521
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,170
I had hidden in the city?

522
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,980
When I was looking through

523
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,550
the sealed case files,

524
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,020
I found a secret passage
in Qingzhou City

525
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,120
that leads directly into the city

526
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,930
from outside.

527
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,960
Charge!

528
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:01,840
Charge!

529
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,780
There must be a traitor by my side.

530
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,340
Mr. Xu,

531
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,550
with your intelligence,

532
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,920
you should've guessed it already.

533
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,580
The Emperor sent us here

534
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,820
because he sensed your disloyalty.

535
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,660
What we know

536
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,780
is more

537
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,020
than just the hidden soldiers.

538
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,960
Xu Lingzhang, you've been

539
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,980
embezzling taxes.

540
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,370
If there's a traitor,

541
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,930
it's you, who has betrayed Great Sui.

542
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,300
You two

543
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,510
had grievances,

544
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,580
yet you joined forces
to come against me.

545
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,930
Can you say

546
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,690
that this isn't also
for personal revenge?

547
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,260
Personal revenge?

548
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,510
What I've been doing is

549
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,300
for Great Sui and its people.

550
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,240
Even if there are disagreements

551
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,210
between us,

552
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,780
the swords in our hands

553
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,890
will only face the real enemies.

554
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,780
You've won,

555
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,410
but remember:

556
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,360
You've only

557
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,020
preserved Qingzhou today.

558
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,060
The real victory

559
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,420
has yet to be decided.

560
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,180
(Sui)

561
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
I wanted to save some effort

562
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,020
and use Xu Lingzhang to kill Wei Yun.

563
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,510
But I didn't expect him

564
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,900
to be so useless.

565
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,010
Forget it.

566
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,730
Let's stick to the original plan.

567
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,970
Yes.

568
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,440
When will Commander Gao,

569
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,380
sent by Su Can, arrive?

570
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,650
No later than tomorrow.

571
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,690
Qingzhou is full of Su Can's troops.

572
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,150
Princess Yunyang ordered me

573
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,420
to work with him in Qingzhou,

574
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,900
but he only gave me a commander.

575
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,630
It seems that tomorrow

576
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,920
I will have to spend some time

577
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,980
dealing with fools like Commander Gao.

578
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,020
(Qingzhou Yamen)

579
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,300
Supervisor Gu,

580
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,610
you were too harsh.

581
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,800
It was just acting.

582
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,770
Why take it so seriously?

583
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,330
How do you know
I'm not seeking personal revenge?

584
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,100
I just regret that this knife

585
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,730
didn't go in deep enough.

586
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,690
You won't.

587
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,580
I saved you that day,

588
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,130
so today in Qingzhou,

589
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,380
you won't kill me.

590
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,490
What?

591
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,030
Do you think

592
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,020
I'm returning a favor?

593
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,450
It's not a favor.

594
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,530
It's justice.

595
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,640
It's justice for you
to capture Xu Lingzhang,

596
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,650
and it's also justice

597
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,170
for you to protect me.

598
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,980
Gu Chusheng, I said

599
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,980
you are a good official.

600
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,610
Does that mean

601
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,610
I can't kill you?

602
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,420
North Qi is stirring,

603
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,100
and a big war is imminent.

604
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,340
Without me,

605
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,690
Great Sui will lose a fierce general.

606
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,450
Wei Yun,

607
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,960
you are

608
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,980
overestimating yourself.

609
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,650
The world can do without anyone.

610
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,250
Great Sui is not short of people,

611
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,860
but it lacks

612
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,460
useful people.

613
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,460
Both civil and military talents

614
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,980
are essential.

615
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,540
I have never looked down on you,

616
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,500
nor will I underestimate myself.

617
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,460
What matters, and what doesn't?

618
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,420
My life doesn't matter;

619
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,210
the realm matters.

620
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,740
Wei Yun,

621
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,650
it's not your time to die.

622
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,550
From what I know of Xu Lingzhang,

623
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,710
what he said just now

624
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,730
seems a bit suspicious.

625
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,080
To avoid future troubles,

626
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,540
I'll go and interrogate him.

627
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,980
So, you were just pretending,

628
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,650
showing off in front of Supervisor Gu?

629
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,070
If I stab you,

630
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,170
will it hurt?

631
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,980
Do you really think I'm made of iron?

632
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,840
Alright, alright.

633
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
No need for more talk.

634
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,490
Hurry up and find a physician.

635
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,340
Let's go.

636
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,510
General,

637
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,850
Commander Lu sent a letter today.

638
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,810
Ms. Chu has rushed to Fengling City.

639
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,980
She should be there by now.

640
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,820
(Sui)

641
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,500
(Even this bell)

642
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,420
(is going to leave me, too.)

643
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,780
(Fengling City)

644
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,060
Last time,

645
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,020
we suffered a crushing defeat.

646
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,260
We held our ground.

647
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,980
It's not a complete defeat.

648
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,590
Otherwise, Fengling

649
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,020
would've been North Qi's territory.

650
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,130
Linyang,

651
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,380
you like Tuantuan, right?

652
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,610
I wonder when Commander Lu

653
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,290
will come back.

654
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,730
Linyang, you've gone bad.

655
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,710
You know how to change the subject now.

656
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,780
Answer me.

657
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,680
Fine, I won't tease you anymore.

658
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,650
Let's get down to business.

659
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,300
Yu,

660
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,280
there was a blood-red plum blossom

661
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,500
in the Eldest Princess's room,

662
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,440
and the phoenix hairpin

663
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,610
was also found near Fengling.

664
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,290
Does this mean

665
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,900
that there might be

666
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,730
a North Qi stronghold near Fengling?

667
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,820
Most likely.

668
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,210
Wei Yun suspects the Eldest Princess,

669
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,010
but you don't?

670
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,450
She wouldn't.

671
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,810
She would never do

672
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,210
anything to betray Great Sui.

673
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,780
Unless

674
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,380
she was bewitched by Xue Hanmei.

675
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,940
I've also sent scouts

676
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,420
to search in a wider area.

677
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,510
Commander Lu will come back

678
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,600
as soon as he has any news.

679
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,820
Don't worry too much.

680
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,820
It seems

681
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,560
that a battle with North Qi

682
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,610
is inevitable.

683
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,260
We need to strengthen

684
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,500
the defense of Fengling.

685
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,860
(Qingzhou Yamen)

686
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,820
General Wei,

687
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,190
you are not fully recovered.

688
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,130
Leave the patrol

689
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,900
to Wenchang and me.

690
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,300
Don't worry.

691
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,170
Yu gave me the best wound medicine.

692
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,220
It's the war drum.

693
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,190
Judging by the direction,

694
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,680
it seems to be from the south.

695
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,130
General,

696
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,160
North Qi has gathered
tens of thousands of troops.

697
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,210
They're already here.

698
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,370
Xu Lingzhang's rebellion
has just been suppressed,

699
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,940
and North Qi sends an army.

700
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,300
The timing

701
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,980
is just too coincidental.

702
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,560
I'm afraid it's not a coincidence.

703
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,130
As for the reason,

704
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,420
we'll see when we get there.

705
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,500
(Qingzhou City)

706
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,450
Yun,

707
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,840
how could it be Shen You?

708
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,860
(Qingzhou)

709
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
This is the garrison map

710
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,100
of North Qi sent by the scout.

711
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,870
- Wei Qiu.
- Yes.

712
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,140
(Main camp: 10,000)
Strengthen

713
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,390
(Northwest: 2,000)
these areas.

714
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,280
Yes.

715
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,220
I will arrange it now.

716
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,650
Pass on my order.

717
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,170
The entire army is on alert.

718
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,380
Get ready for battle.

719
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,610
Yes.

720
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,400
Wait.

721
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,360
Why?

722
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,300
Why aren't we fighting?

723
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,760
The positions and the number

724
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,410
of soldiers on this map
are too detailed.

725
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,910
If North Qi really intends to attack,

726
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,610
why would they let us know?

727
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,050
Why would they do this?

728
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,060
They are reminding us

729
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,510
that even if we have dealt
with Xu Lingzhang,

730
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,070
the real danger in Qingzhou

731
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,010
has not passed.

732
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,490
North Qi

733
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,590
is probably playing

734
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,610
a much bigger game.
