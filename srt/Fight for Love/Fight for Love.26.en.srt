00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,320
You made it yourself?

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,920
Wait a moment.

23
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,910
Jin!

24
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,350
Jin!

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,880
Jin, wait for me.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,310
Jin, wait.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,350
Even if we've had

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,710
our disagreements,

29
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,070
I hope you'll accept

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,400
this painting.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
Consider it a gift

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,030
from the old Song Wenchang.

33
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,080
Song Wenchang, listen.

34
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,600
Even if you helped me today,

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,940
things between us wouldn't change.

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
Song Wenchang,

37
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,310
one step closer,

38
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,080
and I'll throw stones at you.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,930
You know

40
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,780
I'm capable of it.

41
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,590
Today, you've seen it.

42
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm neither virtuous

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,870
nor gentle.

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,750
I just wanted

45
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,030
to marry better than my sister

46
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,230
and wanted to catch your attention,

47
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,230
so I pretended to be
a lady in front of you.

48
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,470
So,

49
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm not the Chu Jin

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
you thought I was.

51
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,030
Take the painting back.

52
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,590
Jin,

53
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,510
this is a special surprise

54
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,390
I prepared for you.

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,100
Unluckily, I'm not good at painting

56
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,960
and couldn't capture

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,190
even a fraction of your beauty.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,850
Actually, I've always known

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,470
what kind of woman you are.

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,880
Sometimes, you offend people

61
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,750
without realizing it.

62
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
You...

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
How can you slander me?

64
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,080
I...

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,240
I wouldn't dare.

66
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,750
If I did,

67
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,800
I'd trip while walking,

68
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,270
get bitten by a dog,

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
or get struck by lightning.

70
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,270
I...

71
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,480
You still care about me?

72
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,360
Don't flatter yourself.

73
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,240
I just think

74
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,510
since we have no relationship now,

75
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,830
you don't need to swear like that.

76
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,960
Ever since I met you,

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,340
every smile and frown of yours

78
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,030
makes me prone to overthinking.

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,880
Jin,

80
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,430
I like

81
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,270
the real you.

82
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,030
The principles that stand between us

83
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,030
will be resolved.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
But until then,

85
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,030
please let me

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,430
continue to like you.

87
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,480
Whether you like me or not is up to you.

88
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,070
Will you give up

89
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,630
just because I say no?

90
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
No.

91
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,710
Jin.

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Jin.

93
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,430
Jin, you agreed, right?

94
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,760
Jin.

95
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,350
Jin, you agreed, right?

96
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,940
(True Might)

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Yun.

98
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,480
You didn't have the meal with us.

99
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,490
Are you still upset with me?

100
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,480
Chun, what you said that day

101
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,320
wasn't wrong,

102
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,070
but neither is my love for Chu Yu.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
Don't blame yourself.

104
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,000
I didn't come today

105
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,240
to argue right or wrong

106
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
with you.

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,120
I just want

108
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
to speak my mind.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
These words

110
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,720
are not for our family

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
or you.

112
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,510
They're only for Yu.

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
As a man,

114
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,700
you can't understand
the hardships of a woman.

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
For a woman,

116
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,870
to commit to a relationship

117
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,720
requires more courage,

118
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,000
because we have to sacrifice more.

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,430
I believe

120
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,430
you can protect Yu

121
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,270
and share

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,830
all her joys and sorrows.

123
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,520
But, Yun,

124
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,680
gossip

125
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
and public condemnation

126
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,560
are not the most terrifying things.

127
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,830
We can endure inner pain

128
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,530
and withstand the words of others.

129
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,720
But the most terrifying thing

130
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,830
is that after we've given everything,

131
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,080
you

132
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,430
wake up

133
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,530
from your youthful passion.

134
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,560
- Chun.
- People are fickle.

135
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,830
Besides, you're still so young.

136
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
You say you like her

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,840
and love her now,

138
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,270
but can you distinguish between liking,

139
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,120
dependence,

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,960
possession,

141
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,560
and even desire?

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
How long do you mean

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
by forever?

144
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,710
Chun,

145
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,270
you think I don't know

146
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,360
if I truly like her.

147
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,000
Then tell me.

148
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
How can I tell

149
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,020
that my feelings for her are real?

150
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
Go to a place where she isn't.

151
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,510
Don't see her.

152
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,840
Don't be disturbed by anyone.

153
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,840
Just stay quietly there.

154
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,120
You can meet more women

155
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
and more people.

156
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,720
You'll find that in this vast world,

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
there are better women.

158
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,000
You can even try a relationship.

159
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
If you still want her

160
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
after seeing the world,

161
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,360
it'll depend

162
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,000
on your thoughts then.

163
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,720
(The Emperor once told me)

164
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,850
(about the matters of Qingzhou.)

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,220
(I've not yet given an answer.)

166
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
(It's time to make a decision.)

167
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,700
(Spring Breeze House)

168
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,960
It seems that you

169
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,270
are planning to take on

170
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,210
the mission in Qingzhou.

171
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,590
Xu Lingzhang,
Military Governor of Qingzhou,

172
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,270
has repeatedly defaulted on taxes.

173
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,960
Even when he does pay,

174
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,600
the amount is always short.

175
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,110
The Emperor intends to investigate

176
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,550
whether he is lining his own pockets.

177
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,750
I cannot shirk this duty.

178
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,360
But I don't understand.

179
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,510
Since I've been appointed,

180
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,510
why do you need to go as well?

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,610
There are more than just you

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
whom the Emperor values.

183
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,390
This is of great importance

184
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,200
and cannot afford any mistakes.

185
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,510
There is no need to worry.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,840
I can handle it

187
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,510
even without you.

188
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,120
You don't seem

189
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,060
like someone who seeks credit.

190
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,510
Why have you accepted this mission?

191
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,350
Could it be

192
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,750
to avoid Chu Yu?

193
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,110
I am going

194
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,840
to figure something out.

195
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
Moreover, Qingzhou is on the border.

196
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,550
If we do not resolve this,

197
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,790
there will be future troubles.

198
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,240
You pride yourself
on serving the country,

199
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,360
yet you're also doing it for yourself.

200
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,910
But I will not put personal desires

201
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,900
before national affairs.

202
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,070
I have requested the Emperor's decree

203
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,560
to bring the Song brothers

204
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
with me to Qingzhou.

205
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,120
I hope for a pleasant cooperation

206
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
with you.

207
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,120
Is your deliberate reminder

208
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,460
to prevent me from causing you trouble?

209
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,640
I act with courtesy first

210
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,510
and force if necessary.

211
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,150
But I believe that you

212
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,750
can prioritize our duties.

213
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,130
As for anything beyond duties...

214
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,030
We can try our best.

215
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,020
(Be Honest and Impartial)

216
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,440
Father,

217
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,770
we've been holding this for an hour.

218
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,360
You should calm down now.

219
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Besides,

220
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,480
this vase is quite expensive.

221
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,510
It'd be such a waste to break it.

222
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,080
If you can't even hold a vase,

223
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,870
how can you guard Qingzhou?

224
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,270
You're overestimating yourselves.

225
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,390
The lesson I gave you last time

226
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,600
was too lenient.

227
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,550
You clearly haven't taken

228
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,790
my words to heart.

229
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,670
You can't blame us for this.

230
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,270
The Emperor ordered Yun
to guard Qingzhou,

231
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,840
and he recommended us.

232
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,270
If you are angry,

233
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,840
you should reason with Yun.

234
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,150
It's unfair

235
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,990
to only punish us.

236
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,200
What good would it do to talk to him?

237
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,440
Right now, I want to ask you two

238
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,390
whether you really want

239
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,270
to go to Qingzhou.

240
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,680
If not,

241
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,550
I will swallow my pride

242
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,150
and ask the Emperor

243
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,550
to revoke the order.

244
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,150
Father,

245
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,600
I don't care. I must go.

246
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,320
I don't want to spend my days

247
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,490
as a good-for-nothing idler.

248
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,020
I want to prove to Jin

249
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,390
that I am a man

250
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,390
who can defend Great Sui

251
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,630
and protect her.

252
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,580
Wenchang, stop talking.

253
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,270
What an ambitious man.

254
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,110
What about you?

255
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,270
What do you think?

256
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,250
If Wenchang insists on going,

257
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,030
I will stay by his side

258
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,160
to reassure you.

259
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm not asking about him.

260
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm asking what you think.

261
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,600
Do you want to go
to the Qingzhou battlefield?

262
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,360
Though you've been working

263
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,260
in the Ministry of War

264
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,880
and have shown your skills

265
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,200
in Dingfeng Valley,

266
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,390
you must understand

267
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,270
that those experiences are insignificant

268
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,790
like a drop in the ocean

269
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,350
compared to a real battlefield.

270
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,750
You need to think this through.

271
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,790
Father,

272
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,630
I am willing to go.

273
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,120
A man should have lofty ambitions.

274
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,830
As descendants of a military family,

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,340
we should charge into battlefields

276
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,370
and defend our homeland.

277
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,000
Although we are young,

278
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,870
we also want to contribute

279
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,950
to the people of Great Sui.

280
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,000
Are you indirectly calling me

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,870
a sparrow?

282
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,240
I don't mean that.

283
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,200
Good.

284
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,870
This is the spirit of our family.

285
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,680
Get up.

286
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,960
Father,

287
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,030
does this mean you agree?

288
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,350
An old steed still aspires
to travel a thousand miles.

289
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,000
Though I am old,

290
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,630
my ambition

291
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,720
as a general

292
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,870
has never been lost.

293
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,270
With Great Sui in turmoil,

294
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,600
General Chu has requested to return

295
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,720
to guard Fengling City.

296
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,360
How can we

297
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,120
stay in Huajing

298
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,630
and enjoy peace?

299
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,870
Bring it.

300
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,230
Back then,

301
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,200
it was with this very blade

302
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,360
that I guarded our western border.

303
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Later,

304
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,200
when Great Sui became stable,

305
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,200
I fell ill.

306
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,360
The physician advised me to rest,

307
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,680
and gradually,

308
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,510
I lost the chance

309
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,630
to return to the battlefield.

310
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,440
Wenchang,

311
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,110
I've been remiss

312
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,120
in teaching you and failed

313
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,750
to groom you into a pillar of society.

314
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,470
Today,

315
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,150
I'm extremely gratified

316
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,390
that you can follow

317
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,030
the Marquis of Zhenguo

318
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,470
to guard Qingzhou

319
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,360
and gain some experience.

320
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
Today,

321
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,720
I'll hand this blade

322
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,630
to you,

323
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,720
hoping that you'll protect the nation

324
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,240
and achieve great military merits.

325
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,680
Father,

326
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,230
I know

327
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,640
that what I am taking over

328
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,870
is not just this blade

329
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,630
but also the aspirations

330
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,480
and backbone

331
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
of our family.

332
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,710
Rest assured.

333
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,270
I'll let everyone know

334
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,000
that your sons

335
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,480
are not good-for-nothings.

336
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,580
I'll live up to your expectations

337
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,630
and restore

338
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
the vigor of your past.

339
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,790
I know you are not ordinary.

340
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
This trip to Qingzhou

341
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,000
is both an opportunity and a test.

342
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,630
Shilan,

343
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,360
I believe in you.

344
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,320
I'm Song Wenchang.

345
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm Song Shilan.

346
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,240
We won't fail our mission.

347
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,150
We'll surely guard our nation.

348
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,900
(Be Honest and Impartial)

349
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,060
(Huajing City)

350
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,400
By the grace of Heaven,

351
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,070
I now appoint Wei Yun,
General of Huaihua,

352
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,510
to lead troops to Qingzhou.

353
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,720
Left General Song Wenchang,

354
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,310
Right General Song Shilan,

355
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,440
and Supervisor Gu Chusheng
will accompany him.

356
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,590
Chu Linyang, General of Anyuan,

357
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,590
will lead troops to Fengling.

358
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,440
I hope all of you
will not betray my trust

359
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,510
(Huajing City)
and enhance our nation's prestige.

360
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
Thus decreed.

361
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,760
Let's go.

362
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,940
(Sui)

363
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,720
Why the sudden move to the border?

364
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,520
Is there any movement from North Qi?

365
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,960
With Young Marquis Wei there,

366
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,750
the border will surely be safe.

367
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,680
Mr. Gu, Mr. Song, and Mr. Chu

368
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,790
are no less capable.

369
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,160
Wei Yun and Gu Chusheng

370
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
just left like this?

371
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,790
Mr. Song left as well.

372
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,350
I've given up on Song Wenchang.

373
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,480
He chose to fight.

374
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,510
That's his own business.

375
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,930
Don't mention it again.

376
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
My lady

377
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,680
also rejected them.

378
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,200
Now, they left together

379
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,720
to go to Qingzhou.

380
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,510
Are they planning to make up

381
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,650
for their romantic failures
with military success?

382
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,540
What are you talking about?

383
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,030
My Lady, be gentle.

384
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,440
If there really is a war,

385
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,790
who'd be romantic

386
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,680
on the battlefield?

387
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,550
I just feel wronged

388
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,510
for you.

389
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,790
What would I feel wronged?

390
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,000
They have their things to do,

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,680
and I have mine.

392
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,640
Without romance,

393
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,930
can't I handle important matters?

394
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,310
I agree with Yu.

395
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,830
Alright, come with me.

396
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,670
Let's go.

397
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,030
You can just go home.

398
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,870
No need to come here.

399
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,200
If you can come, why can't I?

400
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,040
Alright, have it your way.

401
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,310
What about me?

402
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,440
I'm your sister.

403
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,280
Come down.

404
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,150
Hurry up.

405
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,030
How strange.

406
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,070
I heard that the Eldest Princess

407
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,400
has many followers.

408
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,960
Why haven't I seen any?

409
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,480
My lady said

410
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,680
that the Eldest Princess
has been exhausted

411
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,950
and has taken those followers

412
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,780
to enjoy the spring.

413
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,850
So, only some maids

414
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,000
and guards are left

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,920
in the mansion now.

416
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,260
The Eldest Princess I know

417
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,880
would never do such a thing.

418
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,210
Has something happened

419
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,350
to the Eldest Princess?

420
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,160
When Huajing was locked down,

421
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,380
who else could leave Huajing

422
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,690
except for the Eldest Princess?

423
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,350
I always felt that something
was fishy about Xiang,

424
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,030
but I didn't have any evidence.

425
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,280
Go.

426
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,070
Hurry up.

427
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,910
Let's go.

428
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,000
Wanyue.

429
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,040
Yu,

430
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,720
will there be a mechanism here?

431
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,430
Yu,

432
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,890
(Wonderful Night, Affairs in Chambers)
look at the erotica.

433
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,110
Go over there.

434
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,520
Put them back.

435
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,880
My eyes are hurting.

436
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,350
Come here.

437
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,790
What's wrong now?

438
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,200
There's blood.

439
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,430
A plum blossom.

440
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,270
Did I help you a lot today?

441
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,480
Yes.

442
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,600
Your contribution is the greatest.

443
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,790
I knew it.

444
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,070
I must be useful.

445
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,440
You're also a general's daughter.

446
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,890
How could you be useless?

447
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,630
Wanyue.

448
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,170
(Chu Mansion)
What a surprise

449
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,690
- Wei Long?
- that you're so sweet.

450
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,190
My Lady.

451
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,670
It really is you.

452
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,560
Didn't you go to Qingzhou with Yun?

453
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,560
Why are you here?

454
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,510
Can we talk privately?

455
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,180
Since the Eldest Princess left Huajing,

456
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,680
His Lordship has also been suspicious.

457
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,750
He suspects the Eldest Princess?

458
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,510
His Lordship thinks

459
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,510
that the Eldest Princess was suspected

460
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,620
due to the North Qi assassins
in Qinxi Valley,

461
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,200
especially on the day Xiang confessed,

462
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,550
but she left Huajing.

463
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,510
Everyone found it very odd.

464
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,750
So he didn't stop

465
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,750
investigating further.

466
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,920
Has he found the Eldest Princess?

467
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,670
Near Fengling City,

468
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
we only found this hairpin,

469
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,600
but we couldn't find her.

470
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,290
His Lordship is going to Qingzhou.

471
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,190
Knowing that General Chu
is going to Fengling,

472
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,680
he sent me to bring this hairpin

473
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,520
to you.

474
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,160
Alright, I understand.

475
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,440
I will look for the Eldest Princess.

476
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,030
Let him focus on Qingzhou.

477
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,160
His Lordship also said

478
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,310
that Commander Lu is

479
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,750
also guarding near Fengling City.

480
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,590
You can use him if you need.

481
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,000
Alright.

482
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,920
Pass on a message to him for me.

483
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,660
Tell him to be careful.

484
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,630
Yes.

485
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,820
(Chu Mansion)

486
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,670
My Lady.

487
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,110
My Lady,

488
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,790
let me go with you.

489
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,430
I can also fight.

490
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,440
I won't be a burden

491
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
to you.

492
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,960
I'm going to Fengling.

493
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,070
It's very dangerous.

494
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,960
I know.

495
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,110
I know

496
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,110
you're asking me to stay in Huajing

497
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,030
to protect Madam Chu

498
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,030
and Ms. Chu Jin.

499
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,390
But

500
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,880
I want to stay by your side.

501
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,150
Wanyue,

502
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,480
I know you want to be my spear.

503
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,030
But my brother and I

504
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,200
need more support.

505
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,670
Do you understand?

506
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,200
Yu!

507
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,440
My Lady, go. I'll stop them.

508
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,680
Yu, don't go.

509
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,590
Why didn't you stop your sister?

510
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,490
How could I know

511
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,790
that she'd pack up so quickly?

512
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,960
Mother,

513
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,920
don't be angry.

514
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
I know I was wrong.

515
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,590
Do you still know I'm your mother?

516
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,830
You're leaving without saying a word.

517
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,200
Do you want to sneak away again?

518
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,310
Last time, I tried to stop you

519
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,680
from marrying Wei Jun.

520
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,070
Later, I realized I was wrong.

521
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,680
This time, I think

522
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,960
you must have your reasons for leaving.

523
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,310
So, I won't stop you.

524
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,790
I'm just here

525
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,510
to say goodbye.

526
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,110
Here.

527
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,510
Take this.

528
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,520
Go.

529
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,000
Remember

530
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
to be careful.

531
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,680
Don't push yourself too hard.

532
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,680
When you have time,

533
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,200
remember to write to me

534
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,470
and let me know you're safe.

535
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,830
I'll be waiting for you

536
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,070
in Huajing.

537
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,550
Mother, go inside.

538
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,400
It's windy outside.

539
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,270
No.

540
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,560
This time,

541
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,510
I want to see you leave.

542
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,070
If you're worried,

543
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,920
just give her more money.

544
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,550
I'll reluctantly

545
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
go with her.

546
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,800
Nonsense.

547
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,400
Is the battlefield a place

548
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,510
you should go to?

549
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,440
Why can Yu go

550
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,310
and I can't?

551
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,680
What if I insist on going?

552
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,440
Alright, alright.

553
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
I'm just teasing you.

554
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,910
Not to mention Fengling.

555
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,230
Even Qingzhou is so far away.

556
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,680
How can I go there?

557
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,200
What's this?

558
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,440
Mother is right.

559
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,310
When you have trouble,
don't force yourself.

560
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,830
Just do your best.

561
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,670
You're my only sister.

562
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,310
I don't want to lose you again.

563
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm not good

564
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,920
at making dumplings,

565
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,510
but you should at least eat one

566
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,200
on the road for good luck.

567
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,310
You must come back safe and sound.

568
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,550
When you come back,

569
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,960
I'll cook noodles for you.

570
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,240
I don't think

571
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,000
you're a good cook.

572
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,720
If you weren't my sister,

573
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,000
you wouldn't even get to taste it.

574
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,590
Jin,

575
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,150
thank you.

576
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,000
Take care of Mother at home.

577
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,230
Take care of yourself as well.

578
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,510
I will surely come back safely.

579
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,030
Yu...

580
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,920
General,

581
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
we still have some way to go.

582
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,960
Have some water and food first.

583
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,240
General.

584
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,150
General...

585
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,000
Come out.

586
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,030
I begged Chu Shan

587
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,440
not to tell you.

588
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,030
If you're angry, blame me.

589
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,880
Do you know

590
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,990
that I'm heading to Fengling City?

591
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,040
I know.

592
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,110
I do want to help you

593
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,750
take care of your health,

594
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,440
but that's not all.

595
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,680
I am a physician.

596
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,640
Only by traveling can I

597
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,750
improve my medical skills.

598
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,680
So, I'm going to Fengling City

599
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,500
to contribute my own strength

600
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,850
like those soldiers

601
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,440
on the front line

602
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,540
and treat the people of Fengling City.

603
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,230
Fengling City is a harsh and cold place.

604
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,400
You can't endure it.

605
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,800
Warfare

606
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,160
is no joke.

607
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,440
Miss Song, please go back.

608
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,230
It's not far from Huajing here,

609
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,160
and it's still early.

610
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,480
I won't go back.

611
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,640
Everyone treats me

612
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,790
like a canary in a cage.

613
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,920
Linyang, do you think so too?

614
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,960
Chu Yu

615
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,310
grew up in Fengling City.

616
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,960
She's so good.

617
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,590
How hard can it be

618
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,070
in Fengling City?

619
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,950
Miss Song,

620
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,200
I've made it clear

621
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,430
in front of the Spring Breeze House

622
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,400
last time.

623
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,880
I only treat you

624
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,720
as a younger sister.

625
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,980
I have no feelings for you.

626
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,350
You have lofty ambitions,

627
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,240
and you're not suitable for me.

628
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,070
It's only right for siblings

629
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,310
to help each other.

630
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,030
Linyang,

631
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,160
if you really see me as a sister,

632
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,640
you wouldn't persuade me to go back.

633
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,820
The more you persuade me,

634
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,020
the more you care about me,

635
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,080
right?

636
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,570
While it's not far from Huajing,

637
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,510
I'll have someone send you back.

638
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,240
Chu Shan,

639
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,590
escort Miss Song back.

640
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,760
If anything happens,

641
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,960
I'll hold you accountable.

642
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,870
Yes.

643
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,720
Linyang.

644
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,560
Organize the troops.

645
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,720
We'll set off now.

646
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,720
Alright.

647
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,910
Miss Song,

648
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,440
please don't make it hard for me.

649
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,350
Miss Song, let's go.

650
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,840
- Give me a hand.
- Don't dawdle.

651
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,680
Keep up.

652
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,350
Hurry up and follow.

653
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,680
I'm going anyway.

654
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,280

Miss Song,

658
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,700
why do this?

659
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,720
The journey is long.

660
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,390
It'll take several days on horseback.

661
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,790
Are you going to run there?

00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,950

I'm Xu Lingzhang,
Military Governor of Qingzhou.

725
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,360
Greetings, General Wei.

726
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,800
Greetings, Supervisor Gu.

727
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,710
You've traveled a long way.

728
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,630
You must be exhausted.

729
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,470
It is our duty.

730
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,880
No need to stand on ceremony.

731
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,680
You're too kind.

732
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,900
(Xu Lingzhang, Military Governor)
The city is too small

733
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,030
to accommodate the Wei Army

734
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,000
in the city.

735
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:38,860
Moreover,

736
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,650
if the army were to be stationed
in the city,

737
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,170
it'd cause panic among the people,

738
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,640
which would be counterproductive.

739
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,840
So...

740
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,670
I am ashamed.

741
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,810
You've considered everything

742
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:48,980
for the people.

743
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,690
No wonder they speak highly

744
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,640
of you.

745
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,000
It's only right for us

746
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,770
to station outside the city.

747
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,380
Why should you be ashamed?

748
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,440
Moreover, the Emperor

749
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,510
has sent us

750
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,400
to help guard the city

751
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,280
to ease the people's worries

752
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,460
about North Qi's invasion.

753
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,160
Indeed.

754
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,360
Among all the officials,

755
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,300
you're the most diligent

756
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,550
in submitting memorials,

757
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,630
covering every detail.

758
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,840
The Emperor also appreciates

759
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,960
your years of hard work

760
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,710
and has sent us

761
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,150
to share your burden.

762
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,390
Alright.

763
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,760
Please come in.

764
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,510
I wonder

765
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,880
what you meant earlier

766
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,190
about sharing my burden.

767
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,240
I have noticed

768
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,610
that the soldiers guarding the city

769
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,270
(Always Diligent)
all look exhausted.

770
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,030
Why not let them rest well

771
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,670
and let my army take over the defense?

772
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,550
We can alternate later

773
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,440
and take turns on duty.

774
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,590
Mr. Xu,

775
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,910
what do you think?

776
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,030
Thank you for your consideration.

777
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,870
However,

778
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,360
you and your deputies

779
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,510
have traveled a long way.

780
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,500
You must be very tired.

781
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,770
You need to rest longer.

782
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,150
Besides, my soldiers have been stationed

783
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,630
in Qingzhou for many years.

784
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,000
This sudden change

785
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,510
would inevitably cause them

786
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,350
a lot of doubts.

787
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,360
So I think we should

788
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,190
talk about it later.

789
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,590
Thanks for your consideration.

790
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,840
But if the Emperor knows

791
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,360
that our arrival

792
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,150
hasn't helped you at all,

793
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,360
he might be upset with us.

794
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,920
General Wei, don't worry.

795
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,880
I will report to the Emperor

796
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,960
truthfully.

797
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,320
Then I'll leave it to you.

798
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,710
Mr. Xu, you're thoughtful.

799
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,880
Your concerns are reasonable.

800
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,960
General Wei, Supervisor Gu,

801
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,400
you're both young talents,

802
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,880
handsome and capable.

803
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,840
If only I had

804
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,510
an unmarried younger sister.

805
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,000
I am curious.

806
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,440
If you had to choose

807
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,150
between me and Supervisor Gu,

808
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,190
who would you choose?

809
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,110
It'd depend on who she likes.

810
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,350
I have official duties to attend to.

811
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,840
Goodbye.

812
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,990
Supervisor Gu,

813
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,200
there are some things

814
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,910
that you should let go of early.

815
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,630
Don't force it.

816
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,000
I'll say the same to you.

817
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Wei Yun came

818
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,070
and wanted to reassign you

819
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,730
and replace the city's garrison

820
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,980
with his own men.

821
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,920
The Emperor of Great Sui

822
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,590
obviously wants to take action
against you.

823
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,880
What consideration?

824
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,510
It sounds very righteous,

825
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,150
but it is just

826
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,000
to take away your power.

827
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,360
I am

828
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,400
really worried for you.

829
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,110
I think I should

830
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,030
give you a reminder.

831
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,880
Once Wei Yun and Gu Chusheng are dead,

832
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,280
Great Sui will have
no more capable people.

833
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,030
When the news gets back to Huajing,

834
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,000
even if the Emperor

835
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,360
wants to deal with you,

836
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
he will be powerless.

837
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,670
You surely understand how to survive

838
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,880
when cornered.

839
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,510
Be decisive.

840
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,190
When everything becomes

841
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,880
a done deal,

842
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,150
I don't think

843
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,510
you'll have any room for maneuver.

844
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,320
But you can rest assured.

845
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,230
If you cooperate with Mr. Xue,

846
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,880
he will keep his word.

847
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,030
And I can assure you

848
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,070
that when the time comes

849
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,000
for you to rule Qingzhou,

850
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,030
it will also be the day

851
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,880
Mr. Xue sends congratulations.

852
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,960
Have I made myself clear,

853
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,110
Mr. Xu?

854
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,360
Qingzhou will be

855
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,440
their resting place.

856
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,000
Today, I invited you for a drink

857
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,670
to catch up

858
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,630
and

859
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,950
to apologize

860
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,090
for my unintentional actions.

861
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,400
I've heard a bit about the matter

862
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,150
among General Wei, Ms. Chu,

863
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,320
and you.

864
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,880
I just didn't expect

865
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,550
that General Wei

866
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,000
would embarrass you

867
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,110
right in front of me.

868
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,880
General Wei is young, talented,

869
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,590
and arrogant.

870
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,910
However,

871
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,110
if not for my father,

872
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,000
I would've already been

873
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,960
a Minister.

874
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,590
And Wei Yun

875
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,840
wouldn't have treated me
with such disrespect.

876
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,710
Your father was very kind to me.

877
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,960
If I ever get the chance,

878
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,360
I will certainly recommend you.

879
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,110
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

880
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,880
Supervisor Gu,

881
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,720
can you explain to me

882
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,280
what this is?

883
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,800
General Wei, don't be too loud.

884
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,500
She spent

885
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,820
almost a month on it.

886
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,670
She ruined

887
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,420
about ten of them.

888
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,150
This one looks the most like her.

889
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,710
Have you seen it enough?

890
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,360
If you have, give it back to me.

891
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,840
Wei Qiu,

892
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,400
burn it.

893
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,240
Yes.

894
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,280
Wei Yun,

895
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,880
do you think that everyone can pretend

896
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,000
that nothing happened

897
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,670
once you leave Huajing?

898
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,440
Who caused Yu to be criticized?

899
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,330
Who made Yu the target

900
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,360
of public condemnation?

901
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,800
Can you say that you don't have

902
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,510
any covetous intentions towards Chu Yu?

903
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,550
What are you doing?

904
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,840
How can you hit him?

905
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:38,950
Young Master.

906
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,360
Guards!

907
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,710
Guards! The Marquis of Zhenguo...

908
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,840
Shut up.

909
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:43,910
How dare you!

910
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,050
Stop talking about it!

911
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,630
