I'm Wei Shuo, deputy general

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
of the Bureau.

24
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,400
Commander Lu is with a visitor.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Not sure when he's free.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
If you can wait,

27
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,120
wait in the reception room.

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,790
No problem.

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,950
His Lordship ordered me

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
to see Commander Lu today.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,000
I will wait,

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
whatever it takes.

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,710
Alright. Come this way.

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,140
(Arsenal Bureau)

35
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,590
We're responsible

36
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,120
for the entire process of weapons

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
from design to production.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,150
So, civil and military officials

39
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,520
all eat and sleep here.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,520
So,

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
it's crowded.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,150
At court,

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,590
those officials are adversarial.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,030
- They've never cooperated.
- Again.

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,360
How ironic.

46
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,920
Didn't get enough to eat? Again.

47
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,120
That's the location

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,960
on the blueprint.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
Be careful.

50
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,710
You can stop here.

51
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,750
Be careful.

52
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,360
- Alright.
- Done. There you go.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,640
Next.

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,920
Alright.

55
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,990
- Is that it?
- Was it modified?

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
Is it here?

57
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,840
All we need now is this.

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
Alright. Put it here.

59
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,750
Here we are.

60
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,800
You stay here

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,640
and wait.

62
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,430
Thank you.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Commander Lu,

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,590
I took her to the reception room,

65
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,030
as directed.

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,630
Since when do we

67
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,870
have another reception room?

68
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,520
Different guests

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,520
are received in different rooms.

70
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,910
The woman who came here today

71
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,280
is the dancer at Fragrance House, right?

72
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,960
Young Marquis,

73
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,360
you're too generous.

74
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,030
Using our resources to please a woman.

75
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,280
I'm impressed, really.

76
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,710
How did you recognize her?

77
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,360
The beauty of a woman

78
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,470
does not lie entirely in her face.

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,240
Women have their own charm

80
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,750
with different shapes.

81
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,310
And I have my own way

82
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,600
to appreciate them.

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,440
Lu Qiba,

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,070
watch your mouth.

85
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,830
Irritated?

86
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,190
Before she's even yours,

87
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,560
you're already defending her.

88
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Young Marquis,

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
since when are you

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,950
such a romantic?

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
Lu Qiba,

92
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,750
we have a mole here.

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,830
When I plant a pawn,

94
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,830
someone will take action.

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,870
It does not conflict

96
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,710
with our cooperation.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,070
Young Marquis,

98
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
you are wrong

99
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,150
about one thing.

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,000
You're in the Arsenal Bureau,

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,920
but it doesn't mean

102
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,680
you can exceed your duty

103
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,310
and make decisions for me

104
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,600
in this place.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,870
It seems you have

106
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,270
more faith in your sweetheart,

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,040
than in me,

108
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,430
the deputy commander.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So...

110
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,040
I will let you do

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
as you wish.

112
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,300
(Loyalty, Marshal)

113
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,150
Wei Yun

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,070
just became the Marquis of Zhenguo

115
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,720
and got the Fish-shaped Tally.

116
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,830
Then, he couldn't wait

117
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,480
to have our bureau investigated.

118
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,600
Do you know

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,430
why he's doing this?

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,240
Umm...

121
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,830
Alright.

122
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,920
I won't keep you guessing.

123
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
According to him,

124
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,120
the octagonal crossbow's blueprint

125
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,390
we previously discarded

126
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,310
was in the hands of the North Qi army.

127
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,270
North Qi?

128
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,680
How is that possible?

129
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,360
He suspects that someone in our bureau

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,750
stole the blueprint

131
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,430
and committed treason.

132
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,270
Treason?

133
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,600
- Yeah.
- How is that possible?

134
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,920
And I,

135
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,600
Lu Qiba,

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,430
is the traitor

137
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,680
they have identified.

138
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,480
- No way.
- That's impossible.

139
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,560
- Impossible.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
You aren't like that.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,240
Yeah. You aren't that kind of person.

142
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,360
That's nonsense.

143
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,600
Exactly.

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,830
Besides, the crossbow's design

145
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,750
was abandoned long ago.

146
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,000
Even in that case,

147
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,830
he should have sold a new blueprint.

148
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,310
Don't be ridiculous.

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,040
He wouldn't sell anything.

150
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,720
Alright.

151
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,710
Yeah.

152
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,830
Wen Yun is terrible.

153
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,720
How could he accuse me of that?

154
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,560
How would I possibly

155
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,870
be the traitor?

156
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,360
So, I argued with him

157
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
and locked him up in the secret room.

158
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,000
I need

159
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,120
to get to the bottom of this.

160
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,160
Otherwise, all of us

161
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,190
may suffer

162
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,120
what happened twenty years ago.

163
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,070
Let's investigate, then.

164
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,120
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

165
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,070
That's right, Commander.

166
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,160
We will fully cooperate with you.

167
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,720
Before this case

168
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,270
is thoroughly investigated,

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,240
no one shall

170
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,600
release Wei Yun

171
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,480
for any reason

172
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,430
unless I approve.

173
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
Yes, Commander.

174
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,350
Wei Yun?

175
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,310
Why are you here?

176
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,150
I...

177
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,470
Catch her.

178
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,390
I've got something to look into.

179
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,480
But I promise you.

180
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,670
What I'm doing

181
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,120
won't harm you or your family.

182
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,510
You stole the Fish-shaped Tally

183
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,600
and broke in here under my name.

184
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Why should I trust you?

185
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,320
What on earth are you up to?

186
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,270
Still trying to escape?

187
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,720
What if I am?

188
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,200
I thought about explaining it.

189
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,480
But even if I told you,

190
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,120
you still wouldn't help, right?

191
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,110
Watch out.

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,040
You...

193
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,910
Why are you still alive?

194
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,600
Young Marquis Wei is blessed.

195
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,270
He would not die

196
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,720
before a traitor like you.

197
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,390
Besides,

198
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,750
his sweetheart is here.

199
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,120
With a great helper,

200
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,360
he must be lucky.

201
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,480
This is the power of love.

202
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,710
Commander Lu.

203
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,480
Your Lordship.

204
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
Spare me, Your Lordship.

205
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,870
Wei Yun.

206
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,480
This isn't over

207
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,120
between you and me.

208
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,270
After I deal with Wei Tongfeng,

209
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,080
I'll come back to you.

210
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,480
Young Marquis,

211
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,360
can't you tell me

212
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,600
what you're really up to?

213
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,150
I told you,

214
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,230
she and I

215
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,990
aren't together.

216
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,720
Wei Tongfeng,

217
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,600
under such circumstances,

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,480
do you still not confess?

219
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,320
I don't know

220
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,240
what you mean.

221
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,630
Like I said,

222
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,960
what I did today

223
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,750
as directed by Commander Lu.

224
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,840
It's Commander Lu

225
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,600
who should be punished.

226
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,360
Did he also order you

227
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,960
to kill me?

228
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,000
Earlier, he told everyone

229
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,320
that I accused him of treason

230
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,240
and he locked me up out of anger.

231
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,150
A loyal man

232
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,120
would fully assist him

233
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,030
in an investigation

234
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,000
to prove his innocence.

235
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,870
But you did the opposite.

236
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,960
Because you have a guilty conscience.

237
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,870
You think when I'm killed,

238
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,960
the investigation will go nowhere.

239
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,870
Even if it's exposed someday,

240
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,720
Lu Qiba will be

241
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,840
your scapegoat.

242
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
It's a plan to kill two birds
with one stone.

243
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,550
How could you not be tempted?

244
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,750
Do you know what you deserve

245
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,360
as a traitor like that?

246
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,240
So what if I'm the traitor?

247
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,080
Wei Yun,

248
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,600
you dare not kill me.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
You can't kill me, either.

250
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,750
If you kill me,

251
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
you will never know

252
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,840
who bribed me.

253
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,080
I'm not interested

254
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,550
in your confession.

255
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,360
Even without you,

256
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,390
I can still find out the truth.

257
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,390
You're not in any position
to threaten me.

258
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,510
Hey, man.

259
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,030
You're just going to leave?

260
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,710
Come on.

261
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,550
Under no circumstances can you

262
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,360
leave me with a dead body.

263
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,200
What am I supposed to do?

264
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,230
I have things to do.

265
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,240
You're the deputy commander.

266
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,440
You're in charge

267
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,110
of the rest.

268
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,840
What are you going to do?

269
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,000
To get a wife?

270
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,990
I...

271
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,270
Wei Shuo.

272
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,110
Take care of this.

273
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,360
I'll go see the fun.

274
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,550
Your pawn is quite something.

275
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,960
She managed to escape.

276
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,000
How did she open that?

277
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,710
Wait for me.

278
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,790
(I can't give in)

279
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,480
(unless I have to.)

280
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,510
My Lady,

281
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,510
you didn't take me again.

282
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,960
I didn't want you to worry.

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
Come on.

284
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,870
Don't frown.

285
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,150
Our cover is blown.

286
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,840
Wei Yun knows what I've been up to.

287
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,630
Good, then.

288
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,440
Let's leave here.

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,960
Leave?

290
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,750
Then, our efforts will be wasted.

291
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,960
I think he's interrogating Wei Tongfeng

292
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,120
and won't be back soon.

293
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,800
Don't worry.

294
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,080
As long as I keep denying it,

295
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,390
he can't do anything to me.

296
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,600
How about

297
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,120
I get a physician to check on you?

298
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,030
No need.

299
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,960
I have no time for that.

300
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,600
I need a solution to today's crisis.

301
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,600
Otherwise,

302
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,630
my family will get stuck.

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,840
I have to rely

304
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,510
on Wei Yun's morals.

305
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,390
Wei Yun?

306
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,750
Is it appropriate for you

307
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,590
to come in so late?

308
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,590
Chu Yu,

309
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,720
shall I praise you for being fearless

310
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,320
or scold you for being bold?

311
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,510
I'm indeed impressed.

312
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,670
How dare you run away from the Bureau

313
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,360
and come back here?

314
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,080
- You...
- Wanyue.

315
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,390
Go out and close the door.

316
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,600
He came so late at night.

317
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,030
He must want to tell me

318
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,960
something private.

319
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,910
Don't let others see.

320
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,110
What?

321
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,960
You want to confront me, right?

322
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,840
Why are you silent?

323
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,110
Scared?

324
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,510
Watch out!

325
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,110
Chu Yu.

326
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,120
Now, we're even.

327
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,590
Play dead.

328
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,550
Just now, you saved my life.

329
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,880
I don't want to fight you now.

330
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,310
You have a chance

331
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,240
to explain everything.

332
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,310
I don't owe you a thing.

333
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,880
Even if I'm up to something,

334
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,480
it must be something righteous.

335
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,590
Even if you push me,

336
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,680
I won't explain anything.

337
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,160
The mechanism of the crossbow.

338
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,520
Why do you

339
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,920
have this mechanism?

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You know that crossbow?

341
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,070
Then, you must know

342
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,310
it's an invention of the Arsenal Bureau.

343
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,070
This one is from the North Qi.

344
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
My father and brother risked for it.

345
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,070
I gave it to...

346
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,720
Wei Jun gave it to you?

347
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,070
Before my big brother died,

348
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,270
he gave me this mechanism.

349
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,000
But he didn't mention

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,110
it was from you.

351
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,880
You knew from the start

352
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,110
about the mole in your bureau.

353
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,880
So, you let me

354
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,000
take the Fish-shaped Tally

355
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,960
and wanted to use me

356
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,160
to uncover that mole.

357
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,880
You were using me.

358
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,200
I used you. That's true.

359
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,630
But Chu Yu,

360
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,840
since the first day

361
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,830
you came to this family,

362
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,000
how many times have you used me?

363
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,480
I had it all planned out,

364
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,510
except for Wei Jun.

365
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,200
I didn't know he would tell you.

366
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,110
In your eyes,

367
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,960
I must look ridiculous.

368
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,510
Chu Yu, I can't figure you out.

369
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,960
So, I don't know

370
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,440
why you believe my big brother

371
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,310
but don't believe me.

372
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,400
Why should I believe you?

373
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,590
Your sword

374
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,440
has been at my throat

375
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
since the moment

376
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,400
I came to this family.

377
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,440
Why should I believe you?

378
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,960
Why should I bet my life

379
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,800
on someone like you?

380
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,110
All right, then.

381
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,590
I don't want to continue this.

382
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,480
Nor do I want to stay

383
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,590
in your mansion.

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,840
Congratulations.

385
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,320
You win.

386
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,550
(I gave it my all.)

387
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,080
(But in the end,)

388
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,960
(it was pretty much worthless.)

389
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:55,940
(By Wei Jun)

390
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,590
(Chu Yu,)

391
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,030
(since you've made a decision,)

392
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,510
(how could you easily give up?)

393
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,160
You've been living here this whole time.

394
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,240
How do you not know about this letter?

395
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,510
Entrusted by Ms. Chu,

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,030
we'll investigate the leak
in the Arsenal Bureau.

397
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,440
Concerning some secrets,

398
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,720
it will be perilous.

399
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,830
Though Ms. Chu is as excellent as men,

400
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,400
men in our family
should bear the responsibility.

401
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
But in the coming battle,

402
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,160
I don't know if I can survive.

403
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
If I fail to come back alive,

404
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,720
whoever finds this letter

405
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,640
should obey my last wish

406
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,680
and give a hand

407
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,720
to Ms. Chu.

408
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,440
Maybe I have done

409
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,750
too many bad things in the past.

410
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,790
When I showed kindness,

411
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,790
I got my comeuppance.

412
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,790
Had I known

413
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,960
about this letter,

414
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,400
I didn't have to end up like this.

415
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,390
Mr. Wei Jun.

416
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,880
Trust is a two-way thing.

418
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,030
It's true that you suspected me.

419
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,440
I also made unfair assumptions.

420
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,070
But the crossbow case

421
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,920
involves too much.

422
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,790
Wei Tongfeng is merely

423
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,790
an abandoned pawn.

424
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,400
If I agree

425
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,510
to be honest with you,

426
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,550
will you

427
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,790
stay in my family

428
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,030
and investigate it with me?

429
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,550
What if I don't accept

430
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,510
your apology?

431
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,510
If you don't,

432
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,160
I'll be waiting here.

433
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,270
Until you accept it.

434
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,430
You...

435
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,670
Chu Yu. Chu Yu.

436
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,840
Chu Yu.

437
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,760
It hurts.

438
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,430
It hurts.

439
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,040
Don't.

440
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,200
Don't let anyone know it.

441
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,280
Don't.

442
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,080
Rest assured.

443
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,070
I won't tell anyone.

444
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,240
I will take good care

445
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,200
of Her Ladyship.

446
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,920
Your Lordship,

447
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,440
what else do you command?

448
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,670
Take care of her.

449
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,310
If you need anything,

450
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,160
ask Wei Qiu for it.

451
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,040
These days,

452
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,070
I gave her a hard time.

453
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,440
You finally sound nice.

454
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,160
I'll come to see her tomorrow.

455
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,590
What happened?

456
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,830
Why did she faint

457
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,310
for no reason?

458
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,840
Has he left?

459
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
You were pretending?

460
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,110
When I was out there,

461
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,510
I was so worried.

462
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,750
If I hadn't pretended to faint,

463
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,030
I wouldn't know

464
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,510
how to continue just now.

465
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,350
Alright.

466
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,510
Next time, I'll signal you in advance.

467
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,520
Is it alright?

468
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,910
Don't be angry.

469
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,750
Lie back there.

470
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,510
Otherwise, your wound

471
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,350
will bleed again.

472
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,790
Let me see.

473
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm fine.

474
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,960
I just don't understand.

475
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,310
Why do you have to avoid him like that?

476
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,440
We can't be too careful.

477
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,440
Who knows

478
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,030
if he decided to work with me

479
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,510
because he read Wei Jun's letter

480
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,160
and had a momentary impulse?

481
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,680
Anyway,

482
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,720
I need to take advantage of this family

483
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
to investigate the crossbow case.

484
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,720
Wei Yun and I

485
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,960
are inherently unequal.

486
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,960
What if he regrets it someday

487
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,510
and decides to discard me?

488
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
That makes sense.

489
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,510
But even if he regrets it someday...

490
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,000
Recently...

491
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,510
At least recently,

492
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,030
he won't cast me aside.

493
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,720
Just now, he made me faint.

494
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,270
If he wants to expel me,

495
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,240
won't he feel guilty?

496
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,920
Oh, I've learned that.

497
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,270
It's always so wise of you.

498
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,550
You're being tactical.

499
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,790
Have a good rest.

500
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,200
You've had a tough time.

501
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,100
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

502
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,070
Very good.

503
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,960
The more you eat,

504
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,000
the sooner you'll recover.

505
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,050
Would you like

506
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,960
another bowl of it?

507
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,190
Your Lordship, wait for me.

508
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
I want no more.

509
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,590
You...

510
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,790
Go out and tell them

511
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,630
I'm still in bed

512
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,470
and haven't woken up.

513
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,200
It's so early.

514
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,070
Wei Qiu,

515
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,200
why are you shouting?

516
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,510
If you wake her up,

517
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,000
I'll hit you.

518
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,670
Your Lordship.

519
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,750
How is she now?

520
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,200
Thank you for your concern.

521
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,920
She's doing much better.

522
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,160
But she isn't awake yet.

523
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,280
Let her sleep, then.

524
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,110
I just don't know

525
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,030
what she likes.

526
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,270
So, I've prepared

527
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,320
some food and toys.

528
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,270
When she wakes up,

529
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,030
please tell her.

530
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,200
Yesterday, I caught her in the act,

531
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,350
but I didn't expect her to be hurt.

532
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,400
I want to apologize.

533
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,070
When I finish

534
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,160
today's work in the Bureau,

535
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,680
I will explain everything

536
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,670
to General Chu.

537
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,680
And I will keep investigating

538
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,550
the rest of the case.

539
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,400
All she needs to do is recuperate.

540
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,590
Alright.

541
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,680
I heard it.

542
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,800
Hurry.

543
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,430
Here.

544
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,040
Your Lordship,

545
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,660
you're being so sincere.

546
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,310
Why are they still so wary of you?

547
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,790
I saw Ms. Chu hiding

548
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,720
behind the window.

549
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,160
That simply means

550
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,750
she doesn't trust me enough yet.

551
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,280
And...

552
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,920
To maintain her cover,

553
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
you should call her

554
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,080
"My Lady"

555
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,940
whenever you see her.

556
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,790
I...

557
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,310
Hope you'll get well soon.

558
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,550
There are characters on each one.

559
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,510
Hope everything goes well.

560
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,200
We'll go through everything together.

561
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,720
Did he spend the whole night

562
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,920
carving all this?

563
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,760
I think...

564
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,200
Work together very well.

565
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,790
I think His Lordship

566
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,790
really wants

567
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,680
to work with you.

568
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,960
Shall we

569
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,480
trust him this once?

570
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,900
(Make concerted effort)

571
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,280
Do you remember?

572
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,240
No way.

573
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,790
This fan

574
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,920
is named "Always Fan".

575
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,070
It can kill the enemy

576
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,510
before he even notices it.

577
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,560
What do you think?

578
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,560
Now, I'm giving it

579
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,560
to you.

580
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,270
You'll carry it.

581
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,240
Now, to business.

582
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,280
In the past few days,

583
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,520
I've investigated

584
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,720
the man behind Wei Tongfeng.

585
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,750
Now, I'm giving this

586
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,920
to you

587
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,270
and the fan.

588
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,480
Lu Qiba,

589
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,920
don't deal with me the way

590
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,760
you pursue a woman.

591
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,030
These things

592
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,070
can't erase

593
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,240
our grievances.

594
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,720
Come on, Wei Yun.

595
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,310
Do I have to

596
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,680
say that word?

597
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,920
All right, then.

598
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,320
I admit.

599
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,830
In the past,

600
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,750
I didn't submit to you.

601
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,310
I didn't know you

602
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
or trust you, either.

603
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,750
The point is...

604
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,000
I didn't want to ruin
Wei Jun's hard work.

605
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,140
But now,

606
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,780
I think no one but you

607
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,780
will really develop our bureau.

608
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Wei Yun.

609
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,780
Your Lordship,

610
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,780
I am

611
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,180
sorry.

612
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,980
(Details of Wei Tongfeng's Case)

613
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,420
Compared to an apology,

614
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,340
I expect you to tell me

615
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,500
why you gave me a hard time.

616
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,620
And I hope you will

617
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,020
always be honest with me.

618
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,260
Don't worry.

619
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,180
Every time

620
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,260
I promise something

621
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,500
or trust someone,

622
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,980
I'll keep my word.

623
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,380
(Yao Yong may have bribed Wei Tongfeng.)

624
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,860
Wei Tongfeng

625
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,340
is a regular visitor at Fragrance House.

626
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,500
I sacrificed too much

627
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,420
just to investigate him.

628
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,780
Pretty,

629
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,340
you're wearing really nice makeup.

630
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,020
You look more beautiful.

631
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,900
Mr. Lu, how many

632
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,060
sweet words

633
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,340
do you actually have?

634
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,020
I'm interested

635
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,980
in Wei Tongfeng,

636
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,060
your regular customer.

637
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,060
If you tell me

638
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,420
who he has been seeing lately,

639
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,020
you will

640
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,420
get the money

641
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,060
and I'll sweet-talk you differently

642
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,580
three hundred times.

643
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,140
No wonder we haven't

644
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,220
seen you around lately.

645
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,580
So, you're interested in something else.

646
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,140
A few days ago,

647
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,260
he often took me to Spring Breeze House

648
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,660
to meet a man.

649
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,460
The pretty lady told me

650
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Wei Tongfeng

651
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,420
always took her to Spring Breeze House

652
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,060
to meet a man.

653
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,780
So,

654
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,380
I stalked that man.

655
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,780
I found out...

656
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,220
In the Baidi Valley battle,

657
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,260
Yao Yong was with the Crown Prince

658
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,420
and he almost died.

659
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,260
When the latter is suspicious,

660
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,700
Yao Yong can't be clean.

661
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,020
We can't let go

662
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,140
of the slightest suspicion.

663
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,420
We must pursue it.

664
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,620
Thank you.

665
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,220
You're a great help.

666
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,460
You really are Jun's brother.

667
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,340
When he took over this job,

668
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,940
he also patted me like that.

669
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,940
Your Lordship,

670
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,740
everybody is waiting.

671
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,380
(Marshel)

672
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,380
(Loyalty)

673
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,580
(Justice)

674
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,140
I'm Lu Qiba, deputy commander
of the 1st Division

675
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,620
and the whole bureau.

676
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,540
I'm Zhao Anjun, from the 2nd Division

677
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,380
of the Bureau.

678
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,500
I'm Wei Shuo, from the 3rd Division

679
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,460
of the Bureau.

680
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,580
I'm Gao Yi, from the 5th Division.

681
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,180
All the divisions are here.

682
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,020
We're yours to command.

683
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,780
Greetings, Your Lordship.

684
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,740
We're yours to command.

685
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,260
I'd like to ask you all.

686
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,220
What is the Arsenal Bureau?

687
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,980
The Arsenal Bureau

688
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,580
is the weapon of Great Sui.

689
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,580
It guards the nation

690
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,780
and protects its people.

691
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,460
I want you to remember.

692
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,140
We protect our nation and its people.

693
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,860
We defend this world.

694
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,940
If anyone dares

695
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,940
to invade our nation,

696
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,060
this is how they'll end up.

697
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,260
Yes, Your Lordship.

698
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,940
We'll always remember that.

699
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,500
Where is the banner?

700
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,220
Here it is.

701
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,940
(Wei)

702
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,380
(Wei)

703
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,180
(Wei)

704
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,500
Raise it.

705
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,420
(Wei)

706
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,060
(Wei)

707
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,780
(Wei)

708
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,540
(Wei)

709
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,500
(Chu Mansion)

710
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,500
Your pulse is stable.

711
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,860
But...

712
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,420
Inside it

713
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,700
are silver acupuncture needles.

714
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,180
I've used them for five years.

715
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,100
I value them more than my own life.

716
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,500
Miss Song,

717
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,780
why did you do that?

718
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,220
Great.

719
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,820
General Chu,

720
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,140
I was worried

721
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,500
that your condition had worsened.

722
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,820
But I saw you catch it

723
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,220
really fast.

724
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,140
No big health problems.

725
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,020
You just need to improve

726
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,860
blocked meridians.

727
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,340
Miss Song, may I ask

728
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,900
who taught you?

729
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,990
How long have you been learning?

730
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,940
General Chu,

731
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,500
hope I won't scare you.

732
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,580
Actually,

733
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,340
I learned all this by myself.

734
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,620
But don't worry.

735
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,220
It's been five years.

736
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,940
I often feign illness and learn

737
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,060
from imperial physicians in the palace.

738
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,940
I've also saved many people in secret.

739
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,460
Did you get those scars

740
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,420
when you practiced

741
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,980
on yourself?

742
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,100
They look ugly.

743
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,940
But they're the proof

744
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,380
of how I've come this far.

745
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,700
Come on.

746
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,220
Look.

747
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,340
I also got these scars

748
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,980
from the battles

749
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,980
against the North Qi army.

750
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,460
I don't think they're ugly.

751
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,060
Instead,

752
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,620
without them,

753
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,620
I wouldn't be what I am now.

754
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,780
If in the future,

755
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,140
you still need arms

756
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,420
for acupuncture practice,

757
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,820
you can use mine.

758
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,620
- I...
- My skin is tough.

759
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,940
I'm not scared.

760
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,900
Maybe different arms

761
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,380
will help you improve.

762
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,860
What if

763
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,380
I hurt your arms?

764
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,380
I have faith in your medical skills.

765
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,300
So,

766
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,020
have faith in yourself.

767
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,540
Umm...

768
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,180
I'll teach you how to massage

769
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,620
for massive vital energy

770
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,620
