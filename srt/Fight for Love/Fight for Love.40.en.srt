(Wei)

(Song, Wei, Chu)

23
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,250
Why would the Great Sui army

24
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,790
be here?

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,790
Go find another way out.

26
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,230
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,600
we have nowhere left to retreat.

28
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,120
No one knows my movements today.

29
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,790
How could you be here?

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
Zhao Yue,

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
your many misdeeds

32
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,790
bring you more

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,120
than public anger today,

34
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,790
but also fate.

35
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,190
The uprising army,

36
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,330
led by the City Lord of Xuan,

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,630
will soon reach Qizhou.

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,190
Our plan

39
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,670
has reached its final step.

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
Excellent.

41
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,350
Finally, the day has come.

42
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,230
Last time, bombing the workshop

43
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,910
was not enough.

44
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,510
However,

45
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,980
Zhao Yue would never wait for death.

46
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,190
Amid the chaos in North Qi,

47
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,350
he'll surely try to escape.

48
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,400
With 11 cities rebelling

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,120
and our army at the border,

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,280
escaping

51
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,350
through Baidi Valley to Dongliang

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,670
is his only choice.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,840
Leave this to me.

54
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,600
I'll return to Qingzhou now

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,400
and tell Shilan to go to Baidi Valley.

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,500
We'll be there to block his last retreat

57
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,700
before he arrives.

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,720
Wenchang,

59
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,980
once you leave Qizhou,

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,630
you will be pursued.

61
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,560
Be careful.

62
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,840
I will not fail

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
my mission.

64
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,900
(Song)

65
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,540
(Song, Wei)

66
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,750
Wei Yun,

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,670
you deliberately let me

68
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,670
leave the Palace.

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,880
How could I let you die there?

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,160
Baidi Valley

71
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,510
will be the best place for your burial.

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
Baidi Valley...

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,910
I remember now.

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,190
Your father and brothers
and 70,000 Wei troops

75
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,550
died in Baidi Valley.

76
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,840
But today, I still stand here.

77
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,760
They are probably waiting

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,600
for you in the underworld.

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
Zhao Yue,

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,110
you stole

81
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,430
my octagonal crossbow blueprints

82
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,200
and slaughtered our soldiers.

83
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,160
You relied on Queen Mother Yunyang

84
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,720
to seize Su Can's throne.

85
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,200
Who do you think you are?

86
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,080
You're just a thief.

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,520
Today,

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,740
I'll let you see the true power

89
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,080
of the octagonal crossbow.

90
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
As the Deputy Commander of the Bureau,

91
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,830
I request to fight!

92
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,350
No more words.

93
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,800
Let's just go.

94
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,160
You failed

95
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,200
to defend Qingzhou.

96
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,720
How dare you provoke me?

97
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,310
You must have no generals left.

98
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,160
Even someone as useless as Song Wenchang

99
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,550
is allowed to lead troops.

100
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,700
Since I'm here leading the Song Army,

101
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,780
I am not afraid of you
exposing my wounds.

102
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,990
As the Left General,

103
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,150
I request to fight!

104
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,000
Zhao Yue,

105
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,480
you fancy yourself extraordinary,

106
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,280
plotting schemes

107
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
to seize our realm.

108
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,600
As the General of the West,

109
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
I request to fight!

110
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,640
How dare you

111
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,230
judge me?

112
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,280
All the people of Great Sui

113
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,430
have such a right.

114
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,300
It's not just for my father

115
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,400
but for the countless heroes

116
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,350
who died on the battlefield.

117
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,390
As the General of the Northwest

118
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,600
and Chu Jianchang's daughter,

119
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,990
in the name of the Chu Army,

120
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,240
I request to fight!

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,440
Zhao Yue,

122
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,040
I'm not fighting alone today.

123
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,600
My father and brothers
and 70,000 soldiers

124
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,350
died in Baidi Valley because of you.

125
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,720
The loyal spirits of Wei heroes

126
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,990
stand with me today.

127
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,390
Yes.

128
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,350
With Changming here,

129
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,520
don't you dare harm me.

130
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,710
Step aside.

131
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,020
The Eldest Princess...

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,470
I'm willing

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,990
to die

134
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,400
for Great Sui.

135
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,400
Soldiers of Great Sui,

136
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,750
attack!

137
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,310
Chu Yu,

138
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,960
have you forgotten

139
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,800
our promise?

140
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,710
Today

141
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
is the long-planned

142
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,910
final battle.

143
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,550
Li Changming.

144
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,470
Do not worry about me.

145
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,600
I'd never forget.

146
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,110
Everyone, listen up.

147
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,910
We won't return

148
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,600
until North Qi is destroyed

149
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,640
and Zhao Yue is dead!

150
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,720
We won't return

151
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,430
until North Qi is destroyed

152
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,990
and Zhao Yue is dead!

153
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,720
We won't return

154
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,350
until North Qi is destroyed

155
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,280
and Zhao Yue is dead!

156
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,040
We won't return

157
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,640
until North Qi is destroyed

158
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,600
and Zhao Yue is dead!

159
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Charge!

160
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,230
Charge! Charge!

161
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,160
Charge!

162
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,540
(Wei)

163
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,920
Everyone,

164
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,810
protect the King.

165
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,050
Break through the encirclement!

166
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,950
Yes!

167
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,390
Chase!

168
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,240
Your Majesty, we have no way out.

169
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,670
Though I'm the ruler of North Qi,

170
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,480
I have never truly seen

171
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,430
the lands of North Qi.

172
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,430
These blood-stained lands

173
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,040
are exactly what I want.

174
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,970
Changming, what do you think?

175
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,910
Peace across the realm

176
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,910
and a world free of war

177
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,120
are what a prosperous nation needs.

178
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,430
These lands soaked in blood

179
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,590
are hell,

180
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
not the human world.

181
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,180
The best comes out of the worst.

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,040
With fresh blood,
I shall cleanse Great Sui

183
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,120
and fulfill my lifelong wish
to unite the world.

184
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,040
What's wrong with that?

185
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,240
It is a pity

186
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,590
that I may never see that day again.

187
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,240
I thought fate favored me,

188
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,790
yet in the end,

189
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,430
I am left with only my life.

190
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,710
Even if I die today,

191
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,120
I will never let go

192
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
of your hand.

193
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,040
He has the Eldest Princess.

194
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,160
Changming, look.

195
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,830
As long as you are here,

196
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,190
they will not dare kill me.

197
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,670
Is that so?

198
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,520
I do not think so.

199
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
Because the blade that will kill you

200
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
is in my hands.

201
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
Zhao Yue,

202
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,960
do you know

203
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,040
that I was the one to kill

204
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,070
the child in my womb?

205
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
I knew long ago that the medicine

206
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,190
contained oleander.

207
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,000
I provoked you into killing the consort

208
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,040
and imprisoning your mother

209
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,160
to exacerbate the coup.

210
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,430
Zhao Yue,

211
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,790
your greatest enemy

212
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,070
has never been Chu Yu

213
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,710
nor Wei Yun.

214
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,240
It has always been me.

215
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,040
Li Changming,

216
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,520
why did you do this?

217
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,580
Because you are unworthy.

218
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,670
You are unworthy of being

219
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,640
a true ruler

220
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,880
and even more unworthy

221
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,640
of possessing complete happiness.

222
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
And your brother deserves it?

223
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,190
Did he not also use you

224
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,630
to claim the throne he sits on today?

225
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,760
That was my choice.

226
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,590
When you took me in back then,

227
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,520
was that not your choice as well?

228
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,520
You approached me first.

229
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,880
Our meeting was a mistake

230
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,830
because fate

231
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,070
bound us together.

232
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
You said you loved me,

233
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,670
yet you used me.

234
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,520
In this life, I have never done

235
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,830
anything I regret.

236
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,000
The only thing I regret

237
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,520
is saving you that day.

238
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,000
Changming,

239
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,000
before you,

240
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,520
I was never the King of North Qi.

241
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,400
I was your Xue Hanmei.

242
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
I have only one question for you.

243
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
Have you ever loved me?

returning at night.

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,950
Your kiss is to tell me

263
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,790
that you do love me.

264
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,120
Hanmei,

265
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,360
in the next life,

266
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,070
let's not be born into a ruler's family.

267
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,630
All right.

268
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,320
I promise you.

269
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,550
Changming, look.

270
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,790
As long as you are here,

271
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,640
they will not dare kill me.

272
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,630
Is that so?

273
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,430
I do not think so.

274
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,670
Because the blade that will kill you

275
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,790
is in my hands.

276
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,710
Though I've returned to North Qi,

277
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,310
(Qi)
it seems everything I have

278
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,480
was given to me by others.

279
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,160
My mother gave me the throne;

280
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,280
the officials gave me authority.

281
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,430
The only one I truly have

282
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,430
is you.

283
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,550
Since childhood,

284
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,040
everyone mocked me, cursed me,

285
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,910
and drove me away

286
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,320
because I'm baseborn.

287
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,370
There's no place for me.

288
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,360
I once thought

289
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,580
that becoming the King of North Qi

290
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,680
would change everything.

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,870
But now,

292
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,860
what difference is there?

293
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,870
In their eyes,

294
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,040
I am still baseborn.

295
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,590
It's never changed.

296
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,390
In this vast land,

297
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,520
the only one I can have is you.

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,840
I once wished

299
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,720
to place everything in this world

300
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,880
before you,

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,840
yet never thought

302
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,920
that you'd mean everything to me now.

303
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,630
Your Highness.

304
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,600
Your Highness,

305
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,480
we can go home now.

306
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,710
Chu Yu,

307
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,080
I am sorry.

308
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,280
I will make you break your word.

309
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,150
Your Highness,

310
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,590
I have the antidote pill

311
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,430
Tuantuan gave me.

312
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,350
It can temporarily suppress the poison.

313
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,630
Once we return to Huajing,

314
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,220
we'll surely find a way to save you.

315
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,310
I can't go back.

316
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,710
I've fallen in love

317
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,790
with someone I shouldn't have.

318
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,830
I made Zhao Yue who he is today.

319
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm responsible for half of his sins.

320
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,040
Even with Hanmei's blood,

321
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,070
his crimes can't be washed clean.

322
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,350
I will pay

323
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,440
for the remaining half.

324
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,190
Hanmei,

325
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,060
I've come to accompany you.

326
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,120
Yu.

327
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,430
I am here.

328
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,600
I can't cry.

329
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,790
It is not yet time to cry.

330
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,240
There is still Queen Mother Yunyang.

331
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,120
Yu,

332
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,790
I am with you.

333
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,120
So are we.

334
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,150
Yue

335
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,110
was defeated in the end.

336
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,720
We jointly issue this declaration today

337
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,390
to establish peace
between Great Sui and North Qi.

338
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,350
Since the 18th day of the 3rd month

339
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,720
in Year 6 of Yuanle,

340
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,110
the two states have agreed:

341
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,320
First,

342
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
North Qi shall return

343
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,310
Yun City, Bai City,

344
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,150
and Yingzhou to Great Sui.

345
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,890
It's been properly arranged.

346
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,320
Second,

347
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,200
North Qi ceases hostilities for 50 years

348
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,040
to maintain neighborly peace.

349
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,040
These two terms benefit both nations,

350
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,630
and both nations gladly accept them.

351
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,440
Between heaven and earth,

352
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,920
harmony is precious.

353
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,390
Let this be our lesson.

354
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,960
Let us uphold this pact

355
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,000
and preserve our friendship

356
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,590
for generations to come.

357
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,680
You had the chance to strike us.

358
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,390
Why did you choose

359
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,480
to sign this treaty with me?

360
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,440
Why care so much
about these three cities?

361
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,100
We only go to war

362
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,280
to protect our homes and our nation,

363
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,580
not to seize land or take cities.

364
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,390
What war brings

365
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,310
is not only so‑called victory

366
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,440
but wounds and sorrow.

367
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,060
(Queen Mother Yunyang)

368
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,350
(Your Highness, do you see?)

369
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,160
(Your lifelong wish is fulfilled.)

370
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,870
(We will take you home.)

371
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,920
I'm Qi Lan from the 6th Division.

372
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,830
I've completed my mission.

373
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,190
Today,

374
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,590
I shall return.

375
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,820
(Qizhou Posthouse)

376
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,820
(Fengling City)

377
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,060
For as long as I can remember,

378
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,380
Fengling has been

379
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,160
the most important stronghold
of Great Sui.

380
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,550
My father died here in battle.

381
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,480
My brother was wounded here.

382
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,480
The Chu Army

383
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,390
fought countless battles here,

384
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,330
sacrificing many lives.

385
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,250
I've also done everything I can

386
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,480
to protect this place.

387
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,040
From today onward,

388
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,550
Fengling

389
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,630
will no longer be a border city.

390
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,200
The people here

391
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,870
will no longer face blades and spears

392
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,920
but can live

393
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,630
in freedom and peace.

394
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,550
Yun,

395
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,390
we did it.

396
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,550
We can return to Huajing.

397
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,280
We can

398
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
openly be together.

399
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,910
Yu,

400
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,140
before I return home,

401
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,370
there is one more thing I must do.

402
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,280
I traded three years guarding the border

403
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,440
with the Emperor in exchange

404
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,760
for this trip to North Qi.

405
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,360
Now that we've safely returned,

406
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,720
I must fulfill my promise.

407
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,760
Very well.

408
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,790
Three years.

409
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,550
I will wait for you.

410
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,800
But

411
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,070
if you dare be late,

412
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,790
I will take Xiaoqi

413
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,070
to live somewhere you can never find us.

414
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,120
To you,

415
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,420
I will never break my word.

416
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,340
(Sui)

417
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,480
I punched him in his face.

418
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
I didn't see that.

419
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,630
It was me.

420
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,990
Commander Lu.

421
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,880
Wenchang.

422
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,360
How are you?

423
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,180
We're returning in triumph.

424
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,350
I'm truly a hero

425
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,150
this time, right?

426
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,200
Your achievements

427
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,360
are indispensable.

428
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,960
I forgot to ask you last time.

429
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,680
Yun has been away
from the Arsenal Bureau for so long.

430
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,700
Surely, someone noticed.

431
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,310
If word reaches the Emperor,

432
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,280
will you

433
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,200
be implicated?

434
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,440
Though the Emperor tacitly allowed

435
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,510
Young Marquis Wei to leave,

436
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,690
he never ordered me
to withdraw the defenses.

437
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,580
If the delegation returns safely,

438
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,150
I can redeem my fault with merit.

439
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,280
But if anything goes wrong,

440
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,680
I will bear responsibility.

441
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,790
Young Marquis Wei went to North Qi

442
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,210
to fight for our country.

443
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,720
I had no reason to stop him.

444
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,020
I'm as loyal to the sovereign

445
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,390
and the nation

446
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,560
as the rest of you.

447
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,360
Good.

448
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,790
As expected

449
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,630
of my brother.

450
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,840
Shilan,

451
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
I wronged you last time.

452
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,950
I...

453
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,080
I apologize.

454
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,190
Wenchang,

455
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,440
I suddenly remembered

456
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,110
that you owed me something

457
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,200
back in Qingzhou.

458
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,230
What did I owe you?

459
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,960
I will repay it.

460
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,390
Song Shilan!

461
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,010
Catch him!

462
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,440
Are you afraid that I'll surpass you,

463
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,380
so you want to stop me?

464
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,280
Ms. Chu.

465
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,120
What are you doing?

466
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,200
General Chu has a message for you.

467
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,390
He said his legs

468
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,230
are almost healed.

469
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,360
When you return to Huajing,

470
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,760
he might even

471
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,600
greet you in person.

472
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,760
Really?

473
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,670
That is wonderful.

474
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,150
For his legs

475
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,000
to recover so quickly,

476
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,040
it seems the little thing I left him

477
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,110
worked quite well.

478
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,960
Stop flattering yourself.

479
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,310
It must be thanks

480
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,880
to Tuantuan's skills in medicine.

481
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,000
All right.

482
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,840
Both ways worked.

483
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,630
When we return to Huajing,

484
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,500
I will prepare

485
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,780
a generous gift for each of you.

486
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,590
However,

487
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,240
the ox chair you made for Linyang

488
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,210
may have to sit unused.

489
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,480
It's okay.

490
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,350
If not now,

491
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,290
he'll need it someday.

492
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,870
I meant

493
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,590
when one reaches an old age,

494
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,030
one will not be able to walk, right?

495
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,150
If you talk nonsense again,

496
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,150
I will put it to use right now.

497
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,070
Sorry, I was wrong.

498
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,120
Do not dodge.

499
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,110
Do not dodge.

500
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,950
Catch him! Catch him!

501
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,280
I can surely catch you.

502
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,760
Stop running.

503
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,040
Catch him.

504
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,550
Don't let him get away.

505
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,630
Favored by fate,

506
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,480
I've ruled for many years.

507
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,590
I've heard that sages fear destiny,

508
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,920
and emperors rule in cycles.

509
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,920
As the Crown Prince,

510
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,440
Li Huan is virtuous and talented

511
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,630
and will be a wise ruler.

512
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,870
He shall succeed me

513
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,630
and ascend as Emperor.

514
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,390
Thus decreed.

515
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

516
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,650
The peace at the border with North Qi

517
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,780
for 50 years

518
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,590
is the achievement of Envoy Chu Yu,

519
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,040
who led the delegation
to negotiate peace.

520
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,280
Reward her.

521
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,190
Chu Yu,

522
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,590
a woman who accomplished

523
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,070
what many men

524
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,440
dared not attempt,

525
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,860
is hereby granted the title

526
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,070
of General of Beifeng.

527
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,590
(In Year 1 of Shunping,)

528
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,240
(Chu Yu became
the General of Beifeng,)

529
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,550
(the only female general of Great Sui.)

530
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,950
(Thereafter,)

531
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,310
(the imperial exams)

532
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,760
(were opened to women,)

533
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,350
(creating a path for women)

534
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,390
(to serve as officials.)

535
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,070
(Wei Yun became the Duke of Zhenguo.)

536
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,920
(To stabilize the nation,)

537
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,520
(he volunteered to guard the border
for three years.)

538
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,940
(Three years later)

539
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,520
- Rest more.
- Here.

540
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,470
Thank you.

541
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,120
Ma'am,

542
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,480
this is enough.

543
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,000
Careful.

544
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,080
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

545
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,680
Let me take your pulse.

546
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,840
- Sure.
- Jin.

547
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,310
Why are you also here?

548
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,480
Is there no training today?

549
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,000
Yun will return to report today.

550
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,790
So, I asked General Chu
for half a day off

551
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,280
- to welcome him.
- You can't go.

552
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,430
Why not?

553
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,760
I know.

554
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,520
Yu must have told you

555
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,710
to stop us.

556
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,960
Why is Shilan

557
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,800
not with you?

558
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,240
Has he gone already?

559
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,920
General Song went to Tugu Temple.

560
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,960
He went to Tugu Temple too?

561
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,360
Too?

562
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,260
(Tugu Temple)

563
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,460
I want one.

564
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,700
I heard they are very effective.

565
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,630
I know.

566
00:33:59,050 --> 00:33:59,920
Is this the right way?

567
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,760
What should we write?

568
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,640
Write our names.

569
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,020
(Song Shilan: May peace come.)

570
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,540
(Jiang Chun: May prosperity fall.)

571
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,140
(Huajing City)

572
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,300
(Sui, Wei)

573
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,700
(Wei)

574
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,050
After three years at the border,

575
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,670
we finally return to Huajing.

576
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,550
Your Lordship,

577
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,330
you haven't seen Ms. Chu
for three years.

578
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,440
Do you feel bitter?

579
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,590
I don't feel bitter

580
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,390
about anything else

581
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,520
but being apart from her.

582
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,840
She is here.

583
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,010
Bravo!

584
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,580
(Wei)

585
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,340
(Huajing City)

586
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,880
For your dance,

587
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,190
I'd gladly die before you.

588
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,360
Wei Yun,

589
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,960
I've come to marry you.

590
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Will you marry me?

591
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,880
I will.

592
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,660
Young Master,

593
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,270
Duke Wei returns today.

594
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,270
The General of Beifeng

595
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,520
is dancing upon the gate tower.

596
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,040
The road to the Palace is blocked.

597
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,800
Take another route.

598
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:09,860
(Gu Mansion)

599
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,960
I didn't expect there to be

600
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,780
such a beautiful place outside Huajing.

601
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,630
All these years, we've hurried along,

602
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,040
but today, at last,

603
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,110
we have the chance to stop

604
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,710
and truly behold these lands.

605
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,880
We have always spoken of lands,

606
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
but what exactly do they represent?

607
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,400
They represent young generals,

608
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
riding a fierce horse,

609
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,590
shedding their blood

610
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,440
on the battlefield with a spear,

611
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,000
willing to sacrifice without regret.

612
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,230
♪Snow falls silently, soft and light♪

613
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,050
(Court of Judicial Review)
They represent

614
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,210
righteous and loyal scholars,

615
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,570
seeking the well‑being of the people

616
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,270
(Qingzhou City)
at court,

617
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,520
pondering for the state

618
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,920
in the countryside.

619
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,000
When the world is at peace,

620
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,510
they represent officials
who perform their duties

621
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,190
and the people who live happily,

622
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,960
doing their utmost

623
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,750
to secure the future for generations.

624
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,710
When foreign enemies invade,

625
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,280
they represent any ordinary person

626
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,180
who can become a hero,

627
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,440
defending

628
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,580
every inch of their nation.

629
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,520
Life lasts but a hundred years,

630
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,630
yet the lands endure,

631
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,400
and the state remains.

632
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,160
That is sustained

633
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,270
by generations of people

634
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,440
who love this land.

635
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,110
Great Sui has never lacked

636
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,230
those with ambition,

637
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,450
running tirelessly for the people,

638
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,720
sacrificing for righteousness.

639
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,590
We protect the lands.

640
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,000
It is not only a duty

641
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,880
