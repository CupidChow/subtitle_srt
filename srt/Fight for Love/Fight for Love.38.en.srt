21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,950
Great news.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Consort of Mei is with child.

23
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,430
She's with child?

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
Changming,

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,790
you're carrying my child.

26
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,630
Tell me.

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,080
Am I dreaming?

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,430
Of course not.

29
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,230
Child...

30
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,510
I didn't expect this either.

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,070
Good. Good.

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,040
Whatever medicine you need,

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,230
just let me know.

34
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,110
I'll spare no expense.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,510
As long as you make her

36
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,350
have a safe delivery,

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,390
you'll be rewarded.

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,640
Thanks, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll go prepare the medicine

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,160
for Her Grace.

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,060
Your Highness.

42
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,220
Are you sure she's pregnant?

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,780
If your diagnosis is wrong,

44
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,700
I will not spare you.

45
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,380
Your Highness,

46
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,940
I'm sure about that.

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,380
Her Grace has difficulty conceiving.

48
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,260
This is truly a heaven-sent gift.

49
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,260
But her constitution is rather weak.

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,500
She must be very cautious.

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,140
She won't be out of danger

52
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,940
until her pregnancy is more stable.

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,220
You cannot keep the child.

54
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,620
Why?

55
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,220
You wouldn't have said such a thing

56
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,900
if it were Noble Consort Chen's child.

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,300
Because I am not from North Qi.

58
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,260
So, the child I'm carrying

59
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,420
is illegitimate.

60
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,900
It can't live.

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,060
I don't think of it like that.

62
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,460
Mother, after you gave birth to me,

63
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,980
I was called "illegitimate child".

64
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,540
Now, I'm the King of North Qi.

65
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,780
How could I let my child

66
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,340
suffer the same thing?

67
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,540
From now on,

68
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,860
you and the child

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,140
are my everything.

70
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,260
If it's a boy,

71
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,460
he will be the Crown Prince.

72
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,020
If it's a girl,

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
she will be

74
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,540
the happiest princess.

75
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,580
Changming,

76
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,980
whatever you want,

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,500
I will grant it.

78
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,020
How dare you!

79
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,580
Who's breaking in here?

80
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,800
Don't let that noise

81
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,660
disturb her.

82
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,940
(Bright and Virtuous)

83
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,820
Without my permission,

84
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,660
how could anyone break in?

85
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,380
Kill that assassin.

86
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,200
- Yes.
- Stop.

87
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,260
Yue,

88
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,100
do you really not know who is out there?

89
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,860
Her Highness fainted.

90
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,700
As the envoy,

91
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,540
can't I come to see her?

92
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,140
You know it's Chu Yu,

93
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,100
the envoy from Great Sui.

94
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,900
No matter what your reason is,

95
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,780
as long as she dies in our palace,

96
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,180
it won't do good to our nation.

97
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,300
What if she were to die outside?

98
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,220
That assassin impersonated an envoy

99
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,140
to sabotage the peace talks.

100
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,060
She must have evil intentions.

101
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,260
Kill her.

102
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,020
What are you waiting for?

103
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,620
You must kill her

104
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,660
at whatever cost!

105
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,100
Yes.

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,940
You...

107
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,500
Do you really not want

108
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,420
your throne anymore?

109
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,460
Sorry, but I must attend to my consort

110
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,580
and your grandchild.

111
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,620
I won't be seeing you out, Mother.

112
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,980
You...

113
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:13,980
Kill!

114
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,260
You want to kill me here

115
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,100
for no reason.

116
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,700
Zhao Yue,

117
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,500
you will not get what you want.

118
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,660
In the middle of the night,

119
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,940
you hunt our envoys.

120
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,620
You have some nerve.

121
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,380
Count me in.

122
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,100
I'll kill you all.

123
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,020
Don't fight.

124
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,900
Her Highness ordered

125
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,100
the delegation be protected.

126
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,340
Nobody is allowed to fight here.

127
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,580
(Queen Mother's Order)

128
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,480
- Let's go.
- Go.

129
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,020
Why are you two here?

130
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,340
We heard there was an assassin.

131
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,460
We thought Zhao Yue

132
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,300
would kill you.

133
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,740
So, we came out for you.

134
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,660
Luckily, we found you here.

135
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,220
Ms. Chu,

136
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,180
you're way too charming.

137
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,220
Your pursuer

138
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,460
came all the way here for you.

139
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,140
He's quite determined.

140
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,540
Shut up.

141
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,980
Let's go back there.

142
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,540
Come on.

143
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,180
That was a fierce fight.

144
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,260
I didn't make a move.

145
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,230
- Let's go.
- Alright.

146
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,020
Don't look at me.

147
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,140
I don't know why he came.

148
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,500
Yun,

149
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,220
weren't you confined
in the Arsenal Bureau?

150
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,100
Why are you here?

151
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,420
I had my means.

152
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,940
Zhao Yue is cunning.

153
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,140
This journey must be full of dangers.

154
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,540
A big shot like you has come here.

155
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,820
Wouldn't it be more dangerous?

156
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,980
The locals have only heard of my name.

157
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,780
Few of them have seen me.

158
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,620
Even if they have my portrait,

159
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,980
they might not recognize me.

160
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,140
Fine, then.

161
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,220
So, Yun,

162
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,700
you're back on the team.

163
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,500
Gongsun Lan helped me sneak in.

164
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,260
So, Gongsun Lan

165
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,180
is your agent in North Qi.

166
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,380
- He's one of us?
- He's one of us?

167
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,740
As the deputy commander

168
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,980
of the Arsenal Bureau,

169
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,260
it's time that you knew

170
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,140
the exact location

171
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,500
of the long-hidden 6th Division.

172
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,820
He...

173
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,860
That man

174
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,740
is quite believable.

175
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,300
When a deputy commander like me

176
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,160
met him,

177
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,420
he acted arrogantly

178
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,620
as if he didn't know me.

179
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,540
But it turns out he's one of us.

180
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,100
He's believable enough.

181
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,700
So far, he has infiltrated

182
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
into the royal court.

183
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,860
When necessary,

184
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,730
he will be

185
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,780
our most powerful ally.

186
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,460
Did he tell you something else?

187
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,980
You probably realized that as well.

188
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,860
Yunyang and Zhao Yue

189
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,820
appear to get along well.

190
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,100
But in reality,
they don't trust each other.

191
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,140
I understand that Zhao Yue
doesn't want peace talks.

192
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,820
But today, two things

193
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,860
were very strange.

194
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,660
First,

195
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,740
Her Highness requested
to become a consort.

196
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,860
Second,

197
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,980
I was assassinated

198
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,380
right on the street.

199
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,300
We'll have to wait and see.

200
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,460
I told Gongsun Lan

201
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,420
to keep an eye on Her Highness.

202
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,700
Luckily, Yunyang wants peace talks.

203
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
So, we can be safe

204
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,140
in the posthouse.

205
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
So, are you going back

206
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,620
to Mr. Gongsun's place?

207
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,140
Yeah.

208
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,900
Tonight,

209
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,380
are you going back there?

210
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,860
Aren't you tired?

211
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,140
Don't want me to get in?

212
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,700
Walls have ears.

213
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,340
We're in Qizhou, after all.

214
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,300
Tonight,

215
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
there's no way

216
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,340
I could live here.

217
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,500
I must go back to Mr. Gongsun's place.

218
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,620
You want me to stay?

219
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,700
Of course not.

220
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,900
I'll see you out.

221
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,780
(Zhonggong Gate, Qi)

222
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,740
(Yifen Hall)

223
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,660
(Chengtian Hall, Qi)

224
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,060
(Bright and Virtuous)

225
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,500
Your Highness,

226
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,700
these are rewards

227
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,900
from His Majesty.

228
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,220
And the gifts

229
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,100
from the City Lords.

230
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,460
His Majesty almost emptied

231
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,300
the palace treasury.

232
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,780
The King is here.

233
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,140
Your Highness,

234
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,900
you should bow to His Majesty.

235
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,860
She is with child.

236
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,980
From now on,

237
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,980
she doesn't need

238
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,180
to bow to anyone.

239
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,660
Get out, all of you.

240
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,900
Changming,

241
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,980
how do you feel today?

242
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,940
I saw that.

243
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,460
You sent away the gifts

244
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,340
from the City Lords

245
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,580
and from me.

246
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,780
Do you not like them?

247
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,860
Now, I'm Consort of Mei

248
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,780
and I'm carrying your first child.

249
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,820
Do you

250
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,060
and the City Lords think

251
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,380
I only deserve

252
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,660
these poor things?

253
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,300
But these are

254
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,980
the best things in North Qi.

255
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,460
Even one single pearl from my brother

256
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,340
is worth all these jewels.

257
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,420
The City Lords may not know.

258
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,020
What about you?

259
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Is it that you don't respect me

260
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,660
or is it that your subjects

261
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,820
don't respect you?

262
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,700
If you don't like these gifts,

263
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,580
I'll have them thrown away.

264
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,140
What do you want?

265
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,660
I'll have the nation searched

266
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,740
to get it for you.

267
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,300
Really?

268
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,020
I want to be the queen of North Qi.

269
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,980
Can you make me that?

270
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,420
Never mind.

271
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,020
I don't want to push you.

272
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,820
After all, the Queen Mother

273
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,580
is in charge of the nation.

274
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,100
Changming,

275
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,620
trust me.

276
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,980
No one but you will be my queen.

277
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,900
Give me a little more time.

278
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,100
Alright.

279
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,420
I'll give you some time.

280
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,220
Currently,

281
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,380
you can't make me the Queen.

282
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,060
So, you should make me

283
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,460
an agate coronet symbolizing the status

284
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,700
of the Queen.

285
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,260
Can you do that?

286
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,860
That's easy.

287
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,620
Even if you want the moon,

288
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,860
I will find a way

289
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,700
to get it for you.

290
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,860
Tomorrow, I'll issue notices

291
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,700
throughout the city.

292
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,860
I'll ask everyone

293
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,380
to find the best agate

294
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,220
for you.

295
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,900
I've heard

296
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,460
a pregnant woman

297
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,700
will always have fair skin

298
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,260
if she takes a milk bath every day.

299
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,780
From now on, I want the best milk

300
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,740
for my bath every night.

301
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,420
Can you grant me this?

302
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,980
I will grant you

303
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,740
anything you wish for.

304
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,400
Wontons.

305
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,220
Hot wontons.

306
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,180
(Notice: Consort of Mei is with child.
The King wants agate for her.)

307
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,060
What is this?

308
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,820
Consort of Mei.

309
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,940
It's her again.

310
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,500
Why is it her again?

311
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,860
What does it say? Let's go and see.

312
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,100
Imperial notice?

313
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,860
It says the King requests agate

314
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,940
for Consort of Mei.

315
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,940
How could common people have that?

316
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,780
Yeah.

317
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,940
There's a reward.

318
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,380
Do you have any?

319
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,300
Not at all.

320
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,140
Let's go, then.

321
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,140
Come on.

322
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,980
What? Her Highness is with child?

323
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,140
(Qizhou Posthouse)

324
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
So, that day,

325
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,780
Her Highness didn't faint on purpose.

326
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,940
Her Highness is with child.

327
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,100
We should

328
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,660
take her back home even sooner.

329
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,460
Today, people on the street

330
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,420
all cursed Her Highness.

331
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,060
If she gives birth

332
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,900
to Zhao Yue's child,

333
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,140
let alone in North Qi,

334
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,540
there will be no place
for her even in Great Sui.

335
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,180
What about my tea?

336
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,940
Get some yourself.

337
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,020
What?

338
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,980
Her Highness isn't

339
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,260
extravagant or self-indulgent.

340
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Something's fishy.

341
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,020
Earlier, I sent Gongsun Lan

342
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,980
to see Her Highness

343
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,660
and enlist her help from within.

344
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,100
I think the request for agate

345
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,420
was a guise used by Her Highness.

346
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,820
But anyway,

347
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,420
where can we find some agate?

348
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,900
Yun City is close to mountains
and rich in gemstones.

349
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,900
I'm afraid this is why Her Highness

350
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,580
asked for some agate.

351
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,380
She's clever, indeed.

352
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,180
You got it.

353
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Well, that's decided.

354
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,580
Zhao Yue must have had

355
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,420
his men watch us.

356
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,540
Then, we'll split up.

357
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,020
Later, let's meet at Qiyang Shop.

358
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,380
Come on.

359
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,540
I miss Jin.

360
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,660
I miss Mingliu, too.

361
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,100
Stop this useless talk.

362
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,940
Move now.

363
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,460
When you came,

364
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,340
did anyone stalk you?

365
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,980
The two of us

366
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,860
are shrewd enough.

367
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,380
We shook the stalkers off.

368
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,180
Master is waiting inside.

369
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,860
Come in, please.

370
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,500
There you go.

371
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,300
Your Lord...

372
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,300
Sit, please.

373
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,820
Impressive, sir.

374
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,580
I didn't expect

375
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,380
to see such a big secret room

376
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,820
back here.

377
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,780
You're so good at faking, Mr. Gongsun.

378
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,180
As we met the other day,

379
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,240
you pretended you didn't know us.

380
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,540
I live in this country,

381
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,180
so I have to keep a low profile.

382
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,940
Ms. Chu,

383
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,340
it's what you wanted.

384
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,900
Thank you.

385
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,780
I want to take Her Highness away.

386
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,100
As far as you know about Zhao Yue,

387
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,940
what are our chances?

388
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,420
Let me be frank.

389
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,820
Zhao Yue is a romantic.

390
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,740
Before he's dethroned,

391
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,860
you want to take Her Highness away...

392
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
Absolutely impossible.

393
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
What if I insist?

394
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,180
If the Queen Mother helps...

395
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,220
A fifty percent chance.

396
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,820
Thank you, sir.

397
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,460
We'll take care of the rest.

398
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,740
(Zhonggong Gate)

399
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,580
Your Highness,

400
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,780
here are all the gifts

401
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,140
from other consorts.

402
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,100
They really can't wait.

403
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,180
The King is here.

404
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,140
Glad they're sensible.

405
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,820
What do you think?

406
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,860
Anything you like?

407
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,220
Your consorts

408
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,900
gave more thought to the gifts

409
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
than the City Lords.

410
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,020
I'm somewhat satisfied.

411
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,660
Good.

412
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,180
You asked for some milk.

413
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,140
I've had it poured in the bathing pool.

414
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,300
You can bathe tonight.

415
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,460
I've heard

416
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,820
the people have been complaining

417
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,540
about the milk I want.

418
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,580
You don't mind?

419
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,860
My subjects should take my orders.

420
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,140
Besides,

421
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,620
it's their honor

422
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,940
to give you their milk.

423
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,780
Like I said,

424
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,060
no matter what you want,

425
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,260
I will get it for you.

426
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,060
Changming,

427
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,300
come and see.

428
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,220
This is the agate

429
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,660
you wished for.

430
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,340
Take a look.

431
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,860
(Emerald)
Anything you like?

432
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,100
(Pink Jade)

433
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,020
(Ruby)

434
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,100
Can't you find

435
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,660
one single piece of nice agate

436
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,820
in this state?

437
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,300
Zhao Yue,

438
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,300
look at the quality

439
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,420
of the agate they offered.

440
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,860
They're actually fooling me.

441
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,580
Do I not

442
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,780
deserve the best agate

443
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,580
just because I'm not the Queen?

444
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,340
Don't be angry, Changming.

445
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,260
If you don't like any of them,

446
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,780
I'll have my men look for more.

447
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,260
If you get sick from anger

448
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,940
and harm the child,

449
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,180
it would be bad.

450
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,500
(Come on, Chu Yu.)

451
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,460
(Don't let me down.)

452
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,100
(Envoy's Token)
We're envoys of Great Sui.

453
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,460
We present a treasure.

454
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,340
His Majesty ordered

455
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,820
the envoys shouldn't get in

456
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,940
unless summoned.

457
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,820
So, you've been prepared.

458
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,740
You don't want us to get in.

459
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,060
Please take a message.

460
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,460
We won't see the King or Consort of Mei,

461
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,060
but the Queen Mother.

462
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,780
In this box

463
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,940
is the best agate.

464
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,260
And it's for

465
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,220
the most noble Mother Queen.

466
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,940
Will you reject us when we want

467
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,340
to offer a treasure?

468
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,260
During peace talks,

469
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,140
if you shut out

470
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,980
the envoys

471
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,180
and the news gets out...

472
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,580
From a small point,

473
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,340
you're provoking us.

474
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,740
From a big point,

475
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,980
you'll start another war.

476
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,660
Are you able to bear

477
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,860
the consequences?

478
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,860
Go inform the Queen Mother.

479
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,660
Her Highness summoned

480
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,980
the envoys for an audience.

481
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,060
Come with me, then.

482
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,740
Why did you

483
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,020
requested an audience?

484
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,660
To preserve the peace of North Qi.

485
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,300
I'd like to see

486
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,180
how a woman from Great Sui

487
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,060
can preserve the peace of my nation.

488
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,340
The King ascended the throne

489
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,740
and issued the first notice,

490
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,530
asking all his people

491
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,890
to find a mere piece of agate.

492
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,140
And he asked his people

493
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,220
to offer the best milk

494
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,460
to the royal palace.

495
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,060
When exploited like this,

496
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,180
the people suffered badly.

497
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,380
And he did all this

498
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,980
just to amuse Consort of Mei.

499
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,580
Yeah, Your Highness.

500
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,460
You should think carefully.

501
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,980
If Consort of Mei remains here,

502
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,340
how can your precious son

503
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,580
rule this country properly?

504
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,310
Then North Qi will

505
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,700
fall into great chaos.

506
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,020
How dare you!

507
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,460
My son has just become the King

508
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,620
and he's still young.

509
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,180
If Li Changming weren't bewitching him,

510
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,220
he wouldn't neglect his duties.

511
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,980
It's all her fault.

512
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,540
She egged my son on

513
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,660
to do these absurd things.

514
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,340
You must be aware
of the current situation.

515
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,740
If Consort of Mei gives birth to a son,

516
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,060
he will be the Crown Prince immediately.

517
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,980
Then, I'm afraid

518
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,300
you can't turn things around.

519
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,780
If you let us take her away,

520
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,340
the King will focus on his duties

521
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,460
and you will be relieved.

522
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,900
Say what you have to say.

523
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,660
If you let us take her away,

524
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
we promise

525
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,380
we'll keep a good-neighborly friendship

526
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,500
and start no war.

527
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,060
That's all?

528
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,300
North Qi lost two battles

529
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,340
while our troops are in high spirits.

530
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,780
If a war breaks out again,

531
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,980
your people won't bear

532
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,460
the suffering of war.

533
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,660
Besides,

534
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,140
if someone makes trouble

535
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,740
from inside your court,

536
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,180
North Qi will never be peaceful again.

537
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,740
All this relies

538
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,900
on your decision.

539
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,620
Alright.

540
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,180
I agree.

541
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,700
Then, Your Highness,

542
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,940
I should see Consort of Mei

543
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,260
to proceed with this.

544
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,580
You must see her alone.

545
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,020
Thank you.

546
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,420
People get together

547
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,940
in pursuit of gain.

548
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,420
This is also why people

549
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,740
fall apart.

550
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,100
Cooperate?

551
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,780
Until this evil woman is dead,

552
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,540
there will never be peace in our nation.

553
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,020
Have your men stand by.

554
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,460
Once they leave North Qi,

555
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,220
find a chance to kill that woman.

556
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,140
By then,

557
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,860
she will have been killed
on their watch.

558
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,620
It has nothing to do

559
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,540
with our nation.

560
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,820
Yes.

561
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,660
Your Highness.

562
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,220
Chu Yu?

563
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,060
Your Highness.

564
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,020
Chu Yu,

565
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,060
how did you get in here?

566
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,300
Why are you alone?

567
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,700
Song Wenchang and Lu Qiba

568
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,540
are also here.

569
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,940
I managed to see Queen Mother Yunyang

570
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,100
for the sake of agate.

571
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,140
I knew

572
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,220
you would come.

573
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,620
I've persuaded Queen Mother Yunyang.

574
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,820
She will help us

575
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,340
to take you away from here.

576
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,260
I can't go back.

577
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,380
Why?

578
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,620
I'm with child.

579
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,220
I should take advantage of it.

580
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,700
When I stay here,

581
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,100
I can not only restrain Zhao Yue

582
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,340
but also cooperate with you

583
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,900
from within.

584
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,540
North Qi is like a quagmire.

585
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,100
The longer you stay,

586
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,020
the more danger there is.

587
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,740
As long as you get away,

588
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,740
any plan

589
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
can be reconsidered.

590
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,980
I know you care about me.

591
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,540
Now, Zhao Yue has a problem

592
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,660
with Queen Mother Yunyang.

593
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,420
But he's the King of North Qi.

594
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,420
If you take me away,

595
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,180
you'll be against a country

596
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,020
all by yourself.

597
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,740
It's not that easy

598
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,020
in this foreign land.

599
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,820
I'm helping you

600
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,220
and also helping myself.

601
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,500
Very well.

602
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,260
I know it's hard

603
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,500
to change your mind.

604
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,300
I also have faith

605
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,900
in your judgment and ability.

606
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,580
But His Majesty is waiting for you.

607
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,420
Please take good care of yourself.

608
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,980
I will kill Zhao Yue myself

609
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,020
to apologize to those people

610
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,860
he had killed.

611
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,780
Before that,

612
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,460
I will take good care of myself.

613
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,980
I'm waiting for the day

614
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,020
when I return to Great Sui with you.

615
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Go back and don't worry.

616
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,340
Take care.

617
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,100
I will answer for the harmful outcomes

618
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,140
from my relationship with Zhao Yue.

619
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,620
You don't need

620
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,940
to suffer

621
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,780
in this bitter world.

622
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,100
Chu Yu,

623
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,460
I will not be returning with you.

624
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,260
You and I won't meet again

625
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,460
until Zhao Yue is dead.

626
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,420
Your Majesty,

627
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,220
our guard reported something.

628
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,340
The delegation visited the Queen Mother

629
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,580
with a box of agate.

630
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,380
They stayed in her palace

631
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,420
for about one hour.

632
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,580
Her Highness even had them escorted

633
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,100
to Consort of Mei's palace.

634
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,820
Queen Mother. It's her again.

635
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,220
I endured her ruling beside me.

636
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,380
I also endured my forced marriage.

637
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,740
A mother like her doesn't love me,

638
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,940
and she wants my child

639
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,820
to lose its mother.

640
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,900
And Chu Yu...

641
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,780
How dare you try to take Changming away?

642
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,460
Since you have a death wish,

643
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,140
I will grant it.

644
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,940
Give out my order.

645
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
All the imperial guards

646
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,940
go with me to intercept them.

647
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,980
Yes.

648
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,820
Send another team

649
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,340
to besiege the Queen Mother's palace.

650
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Without my permission,

651
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,820
no one can get in or out.

652
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,940
But Your Majesty...

653
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,100
She and the delegation

654
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,940
have secret dealings.

655
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,020
This is treason.

656
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,540
Anyone who speaks for her

657
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,380
is an accomplice.

658
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,540
Get out of here now!

659
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,940
Yes.

660
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,540
Get out of my way.

661
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,540
Sorry, Your Highness.

662
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,820
It's the King's order.

663
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,420
No matter what happens tonight,

664
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,420
Your Highness must not leave the palace.

665
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,620
If I insist on going out,

666
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,380
what will you do?

667
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,860
How dare you!

668
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,020
You're defying me.

669
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,580
So hungry to die?

670
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,940
Get out of my way.

671
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,220
I wouldn't dare.

672
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,540
But I also must not

673
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,980
violate the King's order.

674
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,620
His Majesty said,

675
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,740
he would

676
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,220
explain to you the next day.

677
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,380
Your Highness, it's late.

678
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,700
Go have a good rest.

679
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,140
You go fetch

680
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,020
the tonic from Noble Consort Chen.

681
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,820
I'll drink it and go to bed.

682
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,020
Ask them to guard out there.

683
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,420
I don't want to see them.

684
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,660
Yes.

685
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,060
Zhao Yue is actually trying
to kill them.

686
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,260
After they talked to the Queen Mother,

687
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,580
Zhao Yue would move.

688
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,200
He and his mother

689
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,400
won't be reconciled again.

690
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,660
Mr. Gongsun,

691
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,020
I want my spear and a horse.

692
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,860
It's time I should move.

693
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,220
Now?

694
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,260
Now.

695
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,300
Yu, don't be afraid.

696
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,980
We will fight our way out.

697
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,420
Chu Yu,

698
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,100
you will not take Changming away.

699
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,980
Give up now.

700
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,420
The Queen Mother made a deal with me.

701
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,140
She has also agreed

702
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,660
to our terms.

703
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,300
I am the King of North Qi.

704
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,940
You negotiated with my mother instead.

705
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,660
Whatever your agreement is,

706
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,980
it will be invalid.

707
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,380
Are you sure?

708
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,900
But I think

709
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,140
your mother knows more
about how to rule a nation.

710
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,220
And she knows better
about how this nation

711
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,060
should develop.

712
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,100
Zhao Yue,

713
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,260
you're an unworthy king.

714
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,300
(Kangsheng Gate)

715
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,820
Kill!

716
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,060
Report!

717
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,220
Your Majesty.

718
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,940
A letter of challenge

719
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,020
was shot at the palace gate.

720
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,240
(Zhao Yue, you're too immoral
to be tolerated. I want to kill you.)

721
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,500
(Do you dare to fight me? By Wei Yun)

722
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,740
Wei Yun?

723
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,820
Give out my order.

724
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,980
Lock down Qizhou immediately.

725
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,500
You guys,

726
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,100
go out with me to see what's happening.

727
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,660
The rest of you,

728
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,980
kill all three of them here.

729
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,260
Yes!

730
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,940
You're a poisonous seed.

731
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,580
You and Zhao Yue

732
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,900
could almost

733
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,020
take my entire body

734
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,620
and mind.

735
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,900
I can imagine what you look like.

736
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,940
You must be

737
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,300
a very good kid.

738
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,060
Obedient

739
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,580
and lovely.

740
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,380
How I wish I could raise you.

741
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,700
But Great Sui

742
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,020
matters the most to me.

743
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,860
You came at the wrong time.

744
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,460
I'm sorry.

745
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,540
I can't let you live.

746
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,060
In your next life,

747
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,460
remember to come find me.

748
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,660
(Li Changming,)

749
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,780
(you must remember.)

750
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,740
(What you're suffering now)

751
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,420
(is the price for your past compassion.)

752
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,860
(If I can save the people)

753
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,100
(by getting rid of this bitter fruit,)

754
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,700
(it will be my self-atonement.)

755
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,980
