=Episode 24=

21
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,030
One of the things

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,810
I've deceived you about

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,750
is that I never told you

24
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,670
that I'm better at poison-making

25
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,810
than practicing medicine.

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,830
Medicine and poison
have been inseparable.

27
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,960
Miss Song and you

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
are so close.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,870
Didn't she tell you this?

30
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,340
(Youban Pavilion)

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
Take care of them.

32
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,750
Yes.

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,410
Don't blame me.

34
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,150
If I hadn't left myself a way out

35
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,730
in front of you today,

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,680
my life

37
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,520
would truly be

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
in your hands tonight.

39
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,310
Do you remember?

40
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,310
When we first met,

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,310
you kindly saved me,

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,910
who deliberately got close to you,

43
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,190
allowing me to take root

44
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,310
in Huajing City.

45
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,870
Now, it's time for me

46
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,280
to repay you.

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,590
If I had known,

48
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,630
I should've killed you back then.

49
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,310
You won't.

50
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,470
You've toiled for Great Sui

51
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,190
for decades.

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,400
It's time for you to rest.

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,430
Starting tomorrow,

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,520
I will take over your mansion.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,190
Rest assured.

56
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,400
I will thoroughly clean up

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,150
those who should not stay

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
for you.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,840
How dare you!

60
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,400
Keep an eye on her.

61
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,150
Yes.

62
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,220
Last time in Qinxi Valley,

63
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,420
Gu Chusheng almost exposed

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,100
Yao Yong's meeting with the assassins.

65
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,460
I managed to make the assassins appear,

66
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,220
forcing Yao Yong to act,

67
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,620
pinning all the blame

68
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,820
on him.

69
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,540
Then I risked my life to save Changming,

70
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,400
which made her let her guard down

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,900
against me.

72
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,460
But this time...

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,500
It seems I underestimated

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,740
Chu Yu and Wei Yun.

75
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,580
With just a note,

76
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,780
they have cornered me like this.

77
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,200
Though you've controlled

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,480
the Eldest Princess for now,

79
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,740
it won't be long

80
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,660
before someone else here finds out.

81
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,380
If Changming doesn't show up for long,

82
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,030
others will surely get suspicious.

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,490
Yao Yong is dead,

84
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,370
Shen You has disappeared,

85
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,860
and all my left and right arms

86
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,120
in Great Sui have been cut off.

87
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,060
We can't stay

88
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,660
in Great Sui anymore.

89
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,300
Why don't you

90
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,820
just kill the Eldest Princess?

91
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,580
Using her death as a reason

92
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,820
to disperse the attendants,

93
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,460
you can easily slip away.

94
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,900
She's more useful when she's alive.

95
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,820
With the city under martial law,

96
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,180
she's the only way

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,100
to get Emperor Chunde's decree

98
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,820
and leave Huajing smoothly.

99
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,920
Also, if we keep her as a hostage

100
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,800
in North Qi,

101
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,740
it'll also do us good.

102
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,900
But now,

103
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,620
Chu Yu and Wei Yun's attention

104
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,580
might still be here.

105
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,540
It won't be easy for you

106
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,460
to take

107
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,740
the Eldest Princess away.

108
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,500
Then let's create some trouble for them,

109
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,180
making them busy,

110
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,260
and we will have a chance to escape.

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,340
However,

112
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,780
this plan is not foolproof.

113
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,780
If they see through it,

114
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,900
neither of us will get away safely.

115
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,240
If you hadn't saved me,

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,500
I would've died at the hands

117
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,780
of the Eldest Princess long ago.

118
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,440
For your life-saving grace,

119
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,180
I'm willing to repay with my life.

120
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,180
You're the best to me.

121
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,700
I will never abandon you

122
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,520
unless it's absolutely necessary.

123
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,100
Shen You really has

124
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,340
a lot of patience.

125
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,720
We've been waiting here

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,460
for days,

127
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,220
yet he hasn't done anything.

128
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,420
He probably has discovered

129
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,580
our presence,

130
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,340
so he dares not act rashly.

131
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,300
This stalemate

132
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,380
isn't getting us anywhere.

133
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,820
(Ruyi Inn)

134
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,060
- Fire!
- Move!

135
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,020
- Fire!
- Move!

136
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Make way!

137
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Fire!

138
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,060
- Help!
- Fire!

139
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,900
Fire!

140
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,900
My Lady,

141
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,540
since we already know

142
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,860
that man is a North Qi spy,

143
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,060
why bother going there?

144
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,180
No.

145
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,980
If I don't visit him

146
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,300
as usual,

147
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,060
he will surely get suspicious.

148
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,620
As part of the Wei family,

149
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,740
I have to do something.

150
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,460
Let's go.

151
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,900
Wang Lan.

152
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
My Lady, what's wrong?

153
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,300
My belly...

154
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,440
Are you about to give birth?

155
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,460
Go get help.

156
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,380
She once saved me.

157
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,500
How could I harm her?

158
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,340
Go!

159
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,420
Help!

160
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,620
Help!

161
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,180
You...

162
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,020
You can't leave.

163
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,620
Don't worry; I won't leave.

164
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,180
Ms. Wang,

165
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,180
try to relax

166
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,720
and breathe out slowly.

167
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,660
I use this method when I'm in pain.

168
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,020
It always works.

169
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,140
Ms. Wang.

170
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,220
Shen You, let go of Ms. Wang.

171
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,180
If you insist on capturing me,

172
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,340
Ms. Wang

173
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
and the child in her womb

174
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,180
will not be safe.

175
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,060
You...

176
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,580
The choice is yours.

177
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,860
You can't leave.

178
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,500
My Lady,

179
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,740
are you alright?

180
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,980
Help!

181
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,620
My Lady.

182
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,980
My Lady.

183
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,900
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

184
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,260
Chun, why look so worried?

185
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,020
Does Lingshu look heinous

186
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,140
and scare you?

187
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,860
Stop joking.

188
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,380
If Wei Qiu and a clinic

189
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,180
hadn't been nearby,

190
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,060
you and this child

191
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,500
would've been in danger.

192
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,700
Chun, don't worry.

193
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,640
Lan escaped death this time.

194
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,580
Great fortune will surely follow.

195
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,500
Yu,

196
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,780
I heard from Lisheng

197
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,420
that after Wei Qiu came back,

198
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,420
he received military punishment.

199
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,500
It's my fault

200
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,940
this time.

201
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,780
I was too reckless.

202
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,100
It's not Wei Qiu's fault.

203
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,260
Please, Yu,

204
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,420
talk to Yun for me,

205
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,580
and ask him not to blame Wei Qiu.

206
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,940
Don't worry.

207
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,880
Even if you don't say it,

208
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,420
Yun must know in his heart.

209
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,260
I think Lingshu

210
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,020
has eyes just like Rong.

211
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
But his mouth

212
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,100
is extremely similar to Lan's.

213
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,820
Come on, let me hold him.

214
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,620
Be careful.

215
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,980
How is Lan?

216
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,540
Your Lordship,

217
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,720
both of them are safe.

218
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,100
The physician said

219
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,020
that although Ms. Wang is fine,

220
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,580
she has been frightened

221
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,660
and needs to recover for a while.

222
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,760
Why not look at her before you leave?

223
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,400
Lingling has been crying out

224
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,440
to see her sister.

225
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,100
Since you came first,

226
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,300
you get the privilege
of seeing her first.

227
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,980
Lingshu, look.

228
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,500
This is Uncle.

229
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,940
Your uncle.

230
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,420
I know your uncle

231
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,780
has been planning

232
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,780
to use Shen You to expose

233
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,460
the man behind him.

234
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,260
Unfortunately,

235
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,700
he escaped this time.

236
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,340
Your uncle must be very upset,

237
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,540
right?

238
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,320
Shen You is related
to the octagonal crossbow.

239
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,840
Now that he escaped,

240
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,860
your clue met a dead end.

241
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
Wei Qiu

242
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,700
did his best in that situation.

243
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,640
- I don't want to punish him.
- I know.

244
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,880
You did the right thing.

245
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,940
If I were you,

246
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,660
I would have done the same.

247
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,420
And I know

248
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,000
you've long regarded Wei Qiu

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,140
as your brother.

250
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,780
I believe

251
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,940
you won't let it end like this.

252
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,980
Shen You must still be in Huajing.

253
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,420
I'll seek permission now

254
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,340
to seal off the city.

255
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,860
Yu,

256
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,660
thanks for talking to me like this.

257
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,740
What for?

258
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,740
When have we

259
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,380
ever needed to be so polite?

260
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,300
Do you want a hug?

261
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,580
Here?

262
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,620
Isn't it a bit too brazen?

263
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,060
Hold Lingshu.

264
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,820
What are you thinking?

265
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,300
Come on.

266
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,620
Be careful.

267
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,260
Be careful.

268
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,980
Lingshu.

269
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,900
Look, this is Uncle.

270
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,420
Lingshu is crying.

271
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,780
It's all your fault.

272
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,460
Mr. Xue.

273
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,900
Mr. Xue.

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,540
Mr. Xue.

275
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
Wei Yun's men followed me too closely.

276
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,260
I barely managed to escape.

277
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,620
Please spare my life.

278
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,780
Have mercy, please.

279
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,180
You're the leader of my elite agents,

280
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,260
yet you failed to kill

281
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,100
a weak scholar

282
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,780
and almost got captured.

283
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,620
What use are you to me?

284
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,740
Mr. Xue,

285
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,980
I've run out of antidotes.

286
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,480
If it weren't for desperation,

287
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,580
how dare I come to see you?

288
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,140
Rest assured.

289
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,180
No one knows

290
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,060
I came here.

291
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,700
I promise.

292
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,300
I won't fail next time;

293
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,620
otherwise,

294
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,140
I will take my own life.

295
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,300
If I hadn't controlled you with poison,

296
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,300
wouldn't you have gone to Wei Yun

297
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,140
and betrayed me?

298
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,140
I dare not.

299
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,820
I am loyal.

300
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,760
How could I betray you?

301
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,780
Please, give me the antidote.

302
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,100
I can't bear the pain anymore.

303
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,180
Chu Yu and Wei Yun

304
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,020
are suspicious now.

305
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,600
We can't wait any longer.

306
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,300
We must immediately proceed

307
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,480
to the next step of the plan.

308
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,780
So, what do you plan to do?

309
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,420
Xiang will take care of it.

310
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,420
Next,

311
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,500
there will be a good show.

312
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,500
The Emperor's order:

313
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,700
Seal the city gates now.

314
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,140
Yes.

315
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,860
Close the gates.

316
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,340
(Huajing City)

317
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,040
Your Lordship,

318
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,660
the Xisheng Gate
has also been fortified.

319
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,660
Shall we take a look?

320
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,900
It's him, right?

321
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,740
Yes.

322
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,740
Let's go.

323
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,590
That figure...

324
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,780
It really is him.

325
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,020
This woman...

326
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,660
What are you holding?

327
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,060
I...

328
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,660
(Romance of the Marquis)

329
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,500
(Romance of the Marquis)

330
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,940
Ladies and gentlemen,

331
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
let me tell you a story

332
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,460
of a rare and extraordinary tale.

333
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,060
(Wei Yun, Chu Yu)

334
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,180
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

335
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,940
Chun.

336
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,980
Yu,

337
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,520
this is the most popular novel
in Huajing now.

338
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,080
(Romance of the Marquis)
It's said to be based on you and Yun.

339
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,300
(Romance of the Marquis)

340
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,420
Although

341
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,460
you suddenly joined our family,

342
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,020
you have shown deep affection

343
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,340
and loyalty to our family lately.

344
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,580
I admire you

345
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,580
greatly.

346
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,460
In my eyes,

347
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,740
you are clear-headed

348
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,580
and strong.

349
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,340
You should know what to do

350
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,500
and what not to do.

351
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,220
Chun,

352
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,820
are you reminding me?

353
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,060
No.

354
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,820
It's already a done deal.

355
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,260
Everyone in Huajing

356
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,660
has known about this.

357
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,460
I only have one question.

358
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,060
When did it start?

359
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,460
When Jun was alive...

360
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,300
No.

361
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,100
There was nothing
between Wei Jun and me.

362
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,920
The feelings between Wei Yun and me

363
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,300
may not be accepted by the world,

364
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,180
but there is no trace of indecency.

365
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,860
Since you know it's not accepted
by the world,

366
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,980
why haven't you stopped it?

367
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,740
Can I just stop my feelings

368
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,220
if I want to?

369
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,700
Don't you know

370
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,260
who you are

371
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,500
to Wei Yun?

372
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,780
Though it is a chaotic era now,

373
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,420
what people value most

374
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,620
is still reputation.

375
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,260
Even if I believe

376
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,860
that the affection between you two

377
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,920
started after Jun's death,

378
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,100
what about others?

379
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,580
Now this novel has caused

380
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,020
a stir throughout Huajing City.

381
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,340
Yu,

382
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,520
you may not care about your reputation,

383
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,620
but our family has to.

384
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,340
In fact, Yun has given me
the divorce paper.

385
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,460
We have been discussing

386
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,580
when to tell everyone,

387
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,160
but fate has played us.

388
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,700
We failed to hide it from anyone.

389
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,740
In fact, our relationship

390
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,580
is never incestuous.

391
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,160
We just don't follow proper procedures.

392
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,260
Though it is indecent in your eyes,

393
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,660
we haven't hurt anyone.

394
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,500
Why should we be so wronged

395
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
for a relationship?

396
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,420
Why don't you take another path

397
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,700
and find another man?

398
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Chun, you've always been

399
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,020
diligent and responsible

400
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,660
in managing our family.

401
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,260
I chose to live here as a widow,

402
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,340
guarding our family,

403
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,580
because Mother handed me

404
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,140
the family jade pendant.

405
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,220
From that moment on,

406
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,060
I was not just myself anymore.

407
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,820
So,

408
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,700
don't hate me.

409
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,420
Of course.

410
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,020
I can understand.

411
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,260
I love him,

412
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,980
and I want to be with him.

413
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,860
I never felt that this relationship

414
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,740
was wrong to others,

415
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,460
because I only value reason,

416
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,940
not ritual teaching.

417
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
But I never mean

418
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,180
to hurt others.

419
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,580
I can understand

420
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,640
what you are worried about.

421
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,340
Don't worry.

422
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,420
I will surely give you an explanation.

423
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,060
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

424
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,500
My Lady,

425
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
what about His Lordship?

426
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,780
Shall we not inform him?

427
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,580
Let it be.

428
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,500
I will do my business,

429
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,120
and I will see him when I want to.

430
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,860
I'm just not

431
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,060
Wei Jun's wife anymore.

432
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,580
I'm not giving him up.

433
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,700
This rumor is very suspicious.

434
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,520
I need to go back
to the Chu Mansion first.

435
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,180
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

436
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,340
Where is she?

437
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,580
She's left.

438
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,340
Stop.

439
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,980
If you truly care for her,

440
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,140
stay here today.

441
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,860
Chun,

442
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,940
this matter can be resolved.

443
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,300
Resolve what?

444
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,860
The rumors,

445
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,620
or the feelings between you two?

446
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,180
You already know it?

447
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,680
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

448
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,380
what could this novel

449
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,740
decide?

450
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,580
Yun,

451
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,020
you are still young.

452
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,300
So what?

453
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,780
Because I'm young,

454
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,500
my love for someone

455
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,380
isn't real?

456
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,820
And I can't have what I want,

457
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,820
just because you say so,

458
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,220
right?

459
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,460
But she is your sister-in-law.

460
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,900
She is not my real sister-in-law.

461
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,620
There was never any true affection

462
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,500
between Jun and her.

463
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,740
That's nonsense!

464
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,580
Chun,

465
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,460
I truly

466
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,980
love Chu Yu.

467
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,420
I used

468
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,380
to be troubled by it.

469
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,880
I've endured it for so long.

470
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,620
I thought

471
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,580
that I could just

472
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,900
keep this feeling to myself,

473
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,340
but

474
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,900
I can't.

475
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,100
We've laid the groundwork,

476
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,280
- but...
- Wei Yun,

477
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,460
your father and elder brothers

478
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,360
sacrificed their lives

479
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,920
to earn our family's honor.

480
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,940
Your mother,

481
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,380
to defend the family's reputation,

482
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,820
chose death over disgrace.

483
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,820
And you?

484
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,580
Do you even know

485
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,940
that you are part of our family?

486
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,740
Lisheng.

487
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,620
(Tablet of Wei Jun, General Zhongwu)

488
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
I have reminded you

489
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,900
time and again

490
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,380
that you are no longer a young master,

491
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,820
no longer the boy

492
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,340
who is pampered and loved.

493
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,140
You are the Marquis of Zhenguo.

494
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,260
When you violate the family rules,

495
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,900
you should be disciplined

496
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,380
as a warning to others.

497
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,500
Stop right there.

498
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,500
Today, unless you kill me,

499
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,260
I will go to see her.

500
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,220
Do you have to make it so hard for me?

501
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,540
(Tablet of Wei Jun, General Zhongwu)

502
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,340
Jun knew everything.

503
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,700
I'll still accept the punishment.

504
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
But if you want me to give up Chu Yu,

505
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,260
I can't do it.

506
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,720
Since you want to discipline me,

507
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,880
I might as well do it myself.

508
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,500
Wei Qiu,

509
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,460
bring the family whip.

510
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,900
(Tablet of Wei Jun, General Zhongwu)

511
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,980
Your Lordship...

512
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,820
The Marquis hereby orders:

513
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,280
According to the family rules,

514
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,040
I disrespected my elder brother

515
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,320
and brought shame to my family.

516
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,500
I deserve 99 lashes.

517
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,100
Your Lordship,

518
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,220
your wounds have just healed.

519
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,660
Wei Qiu,

520
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,540
start now!

521
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,580
Regardless of my status,

522
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,980
I've developed feelings for Chu Yu.

523
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,740
This is my first mistake.

524
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,100
I couldn't restrain my feelings

525
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,500
and wanted to disturb her.

526
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,860
This is my second mistake.

527
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,220
I admired her

528
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,260
but couldn't protect her.

529
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,140
This is my third mistake.

530
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,500
But I love her

531
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,820
and want to be with her forever.

532
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,340
That's not my fault.

533
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,140
I may have a thousand faults,

534
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,740
but wanting to be with her

535
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,700
isn't one of them.

536
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,940
Yun!

537
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,700
Stop it.

538
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,580
Do you know

539
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,540
what you will face in the future?

540
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
Do you know

541
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,220
how much gossip she will face?

542
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,900
Yun,

543
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,820
fatal knives are not only
on the battlefield.

544
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,180
Those harsh words

545
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,860
can also kill her.

546
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,060
What's the point of this?

547
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,260
What can you gain from this?

548
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,260
Don't you understand?

549
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,020
However pure your feelings are,

550
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,340
they are still considered dirty
in this world.

551
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,740
It's all

552
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,580
to love her openly and honestly.

553
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,020
From today on,

554
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,340
I will love her

555
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,340
with dignity

556
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,260
and integrity.

557
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,500
Chun,

558
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,300
no one can stop me.

559
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,100
No one.

560
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,940
Yun...

561
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,780
Yun!

562
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,860
(Chu Mansion)

563
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,340
How shameless!

564
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,940
Disgracing the family!

565
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,900
What's going on?

566
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,220
I have no idea.

567
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,060
So many people.

568
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,580
What are you doing?

569
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,420
- Stop!
- Stop it!

570
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,320
- Stop it!
- Stop!

571
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,820
- Stop!
- Stop it!

572
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,940
- How could she do this?
- Disgracing the family!

573
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,780
Everyone, stop!

574
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,420
This family

575
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,260
is really shameless.

576
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,580
Look at them.

577
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,140
They don't follow proper conduct.

578
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,540
- Throw!
- Stop!

579
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,380
Stop it!

580
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,220
It's her.

581
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,580
- Yu.
- Linyang.

582
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,460
- Stop it!
- Take it out on me!

583
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,980
Splash her!

584
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,820
Hurry up.

585
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,900
Shameless!

586
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,740
How despicable!

587
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,380
How shameless!

588
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,540
Good.

589
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,820
- Linyang.
- They deserve it.

590
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,260
They deserve it.

591
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,460
Let them splash.

592
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,100
What a jerk!

593
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,620
- Jin.
- Jin.

594
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,140
- Don't go!
- Fortunately,

595
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,420
I didn't continue to pursue you.

596
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,280
Such a family

597
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,820
would've ruined my family's reputation.

598
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,660
- Right.
- Right?

599
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,630
What a despicable family.

600
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,060
(Chu Mansion)
Shameless!

601
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,900
Isn't it?

602
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,980
Chu Yu,

603
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,430
this is your business.

604
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,900
Why do we have to suffer humiliation

605
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,560
because of you?

606
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,020
Isn't she Mrs. Wei?

607
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,060
Oh, no. We don't know if she's Mrs. Wei

608
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,740
or the Marchioness of Zhenguo.

609
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,260
You're right.

610
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,580
Isn't this

611
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,780
going too far?

612
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,580
- Mother.
- Shameless!

613
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,700
Disgracing the family!

614
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,660
Shameless!

615
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,820
Disgracing the family!

616
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,660
It's all your fault!

617
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,780
If it were me, I would've hanged myself.

618
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,260
Let go of him!

619
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,100
Let go!

620
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,980
Let go of him!

621
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,580
Put him down!

622
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,820
He's killing him!

623
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,700
- Let go.
- What are you doing?

624
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,540
Let go!

625
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,980
Wei Yun,

626
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,820
let him go!

627
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,380
Let him go!

628
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,500
He will die if you keep this up!

629
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,820
Wei Yun.

630
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,660
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

631
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,820
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

632
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,980
Are you alright?

633
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,280
The Marquis of Zhenguo

634
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,780
is saving a beauty.

635
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,580
What a good deed.

636
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,700
Shameless!

637
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,780
How shameless!

638
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,900
Isn't it?

639
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,940
Yu!

640
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,140
Yu!

641
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,980
How dare you splash me!

642
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,140
If you ever do it again,

643
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,900
I will tear down your mansion gates!

644
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,340
Get lost!

645
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,700
(Disgracing the family)

646
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,300
- He serves it.
- He's right.

647
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,340
Exactly.

648
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,200
With your poor personal conduct,

649
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,700
you two don't deserve your positions.

650
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,640
Just you wait.

651
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,580
There's still justice.

652
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,660
It will not spare you.

653
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,080
That plaque was earned

654
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,260
by your father

655
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,700
with his military merits.

656
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,400
You've disgraced yourselves.

657
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,860
What do you need this plaque for?

658
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,020
Take it down!

659
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,340
- Exactly.
- Take it down!

660
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,820
- Take it down!
- Take it down!

661
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,600
- Take it down!
- Take it down!

662
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,580
Take it down!

663
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,420
Don't you dare!

664
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,420
Take it down!

665
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,420
You don't deserve it.

666
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,100
It's a disgrace to your father's name.

667
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,580
Take it down! Take it down!

668
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,420
Hurry!

669
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,860
Take it down for me!

670
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,580
A bunch of shameless people!

671
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,580
Take it down!

672
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,340
Come on!

673
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
Take it down!

674
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,740
Take it down!

675
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,500
(Chu Mansion)

676
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
- Take it down!
- Take it down!

677
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,980
Take it down!

678
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,140
(Chu)

679
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,300
Chu Linyang!

680
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,460
What are you doing?

681
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,860
What's so important about a plaque?

682
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,820
Today, I will take it down

683
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,500
and place it here.

684
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,260
Everyone can step on it.

685
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Everyone can curse at it.

686
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,980
The reputation of my family

687
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,300
never relies on a single plaque.

688
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,460
My family

689
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,740
and I are here.

690
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
As long as my family

691
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,220
stands in this world for one more day,

692
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,660
the family name will not fall.

693
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,140
The reputation of my family

694
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,740
lies in the court

695
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
and with the people.

696
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,420
Everyone can see

697
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,820
what we've done.

698
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,540
Your smear won't change anything.

699
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,060
If anyone still has doubts,

700
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,300
come to me!

701
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,940
Let's go.

702
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
- Wait here.
- You wait.

703
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,700
Let's go.

704
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,180
Let's go now.

705
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,780
Linyang.

706
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,060
Did you get hurt because of this?

707
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,460
It's nothing.

708
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,260
What you've suffered

709
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,420
is merely physical pain,

710
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,180
but what Yu has endured

711
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,620
is public opinion.

712
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,300
For a woman,

713
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,420
it is no different from a hanging.

714
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,500
But no one can see her wound.

715
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,660
I can see it.

716
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,380
I asked you about this.

717
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,980
If I want to carve out a path for Yu,

718
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,180
will you believe me?

719
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,820
That's not important.

720
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,020
I have always prioritized Yu.

721
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,820
But Yu's actions

722
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,060
are only driven by her heart.

723
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,700
Back then,

724
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,420
at the risk of being criticized
by everyone,

725
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,660
she wore her red dress

726
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,000
and married your brother.

727
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,940
If it weren't

728
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,500
for today's incident,

729
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,260
I think

730
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,260
she would still choose you

731
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,100
without hesitation.

732
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,740
Yes.

733
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,500
She is indeed a woman

734
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,940
who fears nothing.

735
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,500
But even the most fearless person

736
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,220
has a soft spot in their heart.

737
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,340
Her soft spot

738
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,620
is Father.

739
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,620
In her heart,

740
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
her feelings for Father

741
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,980
are more important

742
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,460
than her feelings for you.

743
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,700
Moreover,

744
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,180
the impact of this incident

745
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,310
on your family

746
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,040
is far less than that on us.

747
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,640
You are the Marquis of Zhenguo,

748
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,880
a descendant of a century-old family.

749
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,940
In this matter,

750
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,580
you can extricate yourself.

751
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,820
But Yu can't.

752
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,380
I know.

753
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,820
I've seen what happened today.

754
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,460
In this world,

755
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,180
it is not easy for a woman to live,

756
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,980
let alone be deliberately framed

757
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,740
and bear unfounded

758
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,580
sins of filth.

759
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,540
Even with a clear conscience,

760
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,860
one has to be stripped

761
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,780
by baseless rumors.

762
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,300
Rumors and slander

763
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,300
often ruin women.

764
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,900
The world

765
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,940
doesn't care about the truth.

766
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,580
They just want to join

767
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,420
the commotion.

768
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,460
Do you know

769
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,380
gossip can also be fatal?

770
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,480
But I have the ability

771
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,580
to stand in front of her

772
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,360
and protect her for a lifetime.

773
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,480
How can you protect her?

774
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,340
By killing all the gossips?

775
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,640
We will talk about the matters

776
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,600
between you two later.

777
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,380
Yu has already taken

778
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,500
the divorce paper.

779
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,900
She'll stay with us.

780
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,140
Young Marquis,

781
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,940
go back now.

782
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,300
How could he do this?

783
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,260
Why?

784
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,020
Please stop crying.

785
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,020
Linyang,

786
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,940
you are my eldest son.

787
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,380
You'll inherit the family property

788
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,740
and bring glory to our ancestors.

789
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,220
But you ruined your reputation

790
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,300
for your sister.

791
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,420
You even took down our plaque.

792
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,100
Chu Linyang,

793
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,940
you've spoiled your sister so much.

794
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,460
What do you

795
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,060
take your parents for?

796
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,420
Mother.

797
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,420
Mother,

798
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,700
I did all that

799
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,260
for our family.

800
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,900
Linyang,

801
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,980
stop talking nonsense.

802
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,620
Have you also been driven mad

803
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,260
by Yu?

804
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,460
Jin,

805
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,340
you've always asked me

806
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,460
why I always protect Yu

807
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,060
so unreasonably.

808
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,460
What I did

809
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,560
is also for our family.

810
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,700
You always accuse Yu

811
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,700
of being outrageous.

812
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,100
Do you know

813
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,900
she's taking great risks

814
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,060
for our family?

815
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,460
What do you mean?

816
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,340
You think Yu

817
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,700
ruined her reputation

818
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,860
by marrying Wei Jun,

819
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,820
but it was never

820
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,260
for herself.

821
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,300
She was to find out

822
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,060
the truth behind Father's death.

823
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,860
So, Yu did all this

824
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,940
for our family?

825
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,180
Why didn't you tell me
and Mother earlier?

826
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,980
Father's death

827
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,140
is involved in many things.

828
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,940
If outsiders knew

829
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,180
that we were investigating this,

830
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,780
we'd be dismissed

831
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,660
and imprisoned at best

832
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,100
and killed

833
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,660
at worst.

834
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,460
Mother,

835
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,140
if you didn't know

836
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,780
any of this,

837
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,940
Jin and you

838
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,620
would live an easier life.

839
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,020
Let Yu and me

840
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,580
take the burden of this.

841
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,700
Mother,

842
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
Yu is indeed rebellious

843
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,400
and doesn't listen to advice.

844
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,260
As the widow of Wei Jun,

845
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,900
she did fall in love with Wei Yun

846
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,420
and implicated our family.

847
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,860
But without these burdens,

848
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,420
the affection

849
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,500
between her and Wei Yun

850
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,060
could also be considered normal.

851
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,020
Linyang,

852
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,100
today,

853
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,980
tell me everything

854
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,780
