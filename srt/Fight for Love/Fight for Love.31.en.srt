00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm not

82
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,510
your fellow.

83
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,270
But I am.

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,960
How is it?

85
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,720
I'm your good fellow, right?

86
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,070
If it weren't for my quick eyes

87
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,120
and agile hands,

88
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,630
you wouldn't have gotten back

89
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,040
your spear.

90
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,610
Look at what I've gone through

91
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,390
on this trip.

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,120
This is not just a workshop;

93
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,680
it's an underground city.

94
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,480
It's as big as twice my bureau.

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
The war chariot

96
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,270
was hoisted by a zip line.

97
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,800
Come on.

98
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,310
There was only

99
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,430
a one-way channel.

100
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,630
I ran around to lay the fuses

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,070
and set the explosives.

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,270
I was exhausted.

103
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,110
My hand

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
was even cramping.

105
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,560
I've done so much.

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,870
It's okay for me to call you Wei

107
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,150
from now on, right?

108
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
Lu Qiba.

109
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,800
Chu Yu, look at him.

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,740
He'll hit me even now.

111
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,790
Thank you.

112
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,030
Lu Qiba,

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
thank you.

114
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,480
You two...

115
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm your good fellow, after all.

116
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,600
Don't laugh at me,

117
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,390
but when I first saw the war chariots

118
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,870
in the workshop,

119
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,730
my self-esteem was almost gone.

120
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,490
I didn't expect
that they sacrificed so many lives

121
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,930
to test the octagonal crossbow.

122
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,560
For a weapon,

123
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,190
they'd stop at nothing.

124
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,950
They completely disregard

125
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,170
the lives of their own people.

126
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,480
It's too cruel.

127
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,920
If the premise of winning a battle

128
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,800
is like this,

129
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,390
I'd rather never be able to make

130
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,050
a war chariot in my whole life.

131
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Lu Qiba,

132
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
everyone

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
has principles to uphold.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,840
You are right.

135
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
Otherwise,

136
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,360
why would North Qi have used

137
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,370
your discarded mechanism

138
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,920
on the battlefield in another form?

139
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,310
But they are doomed to fail.

140
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,790
Alright.

141
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,120
Time to go back to Fengling.

142
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,120
The Chu troops resting here,

143
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,630
Father,

144
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,000
I will carry on your will

145
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,600
and never retreat,

146
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,240
even at the cost of my life.

147
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,630
Kill!

148
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,750
Kill! Kill! Kill!

149
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
Kill! Kill! Kill!

150
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
I'm here!

151
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,390
Don't even think about
taking one step forward.

152
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
I have fought for years.

153
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,320
My life long dedicated to the nation.

154
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,550
Even if I die in battle,

155
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,200
I must dedicate myself

156
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,960
to heaven and earth,

157
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,480
and to guard the nation's gate!

158
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,620
(Sui)

159
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,990
The reinforcements are here.

160
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,000
The reinforcements
sent by the court are here!

161
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,300
(Sui)

162
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,040
Linyang!

163
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,110
Linyang!

164
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,350
Linyang.

165
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,320
We made it.

166
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,670
North Qi has retreated.

167
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,750
We have held Fengling City.

168
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,150
Linyang!

169
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,470
Linyang,

170
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,270
I'm back.

171
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,440
General Chu, rest easy.

172
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,870
Young Marquis Wei killed Su Can;

173
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,670
Chu Yu and I destroyed

174
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,360
the underground crossbow workshop.

175
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,610
Qingzhou and Fengling are safe now.

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,840
We have won

177
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,080
this battle.

178
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,150
- Linyang?
- General Chu?

179
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,080
Linyang!

180
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,020
Linyang!

181
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,390
Linyang!

182
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,120
Linyang?

183
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,900
(General's Mansion)

184
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,840
I thought

185
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,870
I'd never see you again.

186
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,550
Linyang,

187
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,150
you should rest now.

188
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,200
Tuantuan,

189
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,720
when will my body

190
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,840
be able to recover?

191
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,510
You risked your life

192
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,200
to destroy the war chariot.

193
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,890
The fact that you came back alive

194
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,000
is already the best outcome.

195
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,750
As for your leg...

196
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,840
Is there nothing you can do?

197
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,750
I have accomplished

198
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,180
everything I've ever sought.

199
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,750
I asked for Fengling to be safe,

200
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,080
for Great Sui to be peaceful,

201
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,270
and for the octagonal crossbow,

202
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,320
which devastated my family,

203
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,750
to disappear from the world.

204
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,280
All causes and effects have dissipated.

205
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,840
I have no regrets now.

206
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,600
All of this is thanks to you.

207
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,630
Thank you,

208
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,990
Tuantuan.

209
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,000
You are a good physician.

210
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,670
Am I just

211
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,320
a good physician to you?

212
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
Tuantuan,

213
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,670
not everything in this world

214
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,320
has to end

215
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,360
with being together.

216
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,360
Is that your answer?

217
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,120
I never lie.

218
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,680
Since the day we met,

219
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,240
you've always been hesitant.

220
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,680
But I believed you had feelings for me,

221
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,240
so I confessed my feelings

222
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,720
and followed you to Fengling.

223
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,800
I...

224
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,720
I've done my best,

225
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,750
and I've gotten my answer.

226
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,960
I won't bother you anymore.

227
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,350
General Chu, you should rest well.

228
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,670
Tuantuan,

229
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I was a man with a death wish,

230
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,510
never expecting to survive.

231
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,720
Meeting you...

232
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,270
You are the best physician for me.

233
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,350
How is General Chu now?

234
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,950
He's fine.

235
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,400
Tuantuan has checked for him.

236
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,680
His leg injury

237
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,880
won't heal in a short time,

238
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,390
but fortunately,

239
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,310
his life is not in danger.

240
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,930
That's a stroke of luck in misfortune.

241
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,080
Yu,

242
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,200
the worst is over.

243
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,240
Things will get better.

244
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,540
I wonder how the Eldest Princess

245
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,830
is doing in North Qi.

246
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,920
I've sent people to inquire.

247
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,030
We should get the news soon.

248
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,000
North Qi has been defeated.

249
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,800
Zhao Yue's foundation is unstable

250
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,310
and will need time to recuperate.

251
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,590
The Eldest Princess

252
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,550
is his leverage against Great Sui.

253
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,390
So, don't worry.

254
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,270
However bold he is,

255
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,350
he won't dare to neglect her.

256
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,340
Another piece of good news.

257
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,840
Su Can's death

258
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,440
has eased the crisis in Qingzhou.

259
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,590
(Su Can's death caused chaos)

260
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,100
(among the North Qi troops.)
They have

261
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,020
(We've reclaimed Qingzhou.)
reclaimed Qingzhou.

262
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,400
(From Gu Chusheng)

263
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,960
To gain an advantage,

264
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,640
he went for the worst.

265
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,790
That's his style.

266
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,960
What's wrong?

267
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,000
Are you jealous again?

268
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,890
I don't like you mentioning him.

269
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,240
You brought him up first.

270
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,280
How can you blame me?

271
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,980
You can't act like you know him

272
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,000
so well.

273
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,440
I don't want to see that.

274
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,510
You're the Marquis of Zhenguo,

275
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,980
yet you're still like a young boy
when you're jealous.

276
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,200
That's because you said...

277
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,920
You said that you'd choose

278
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,760
neither of us.

279
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,440
Don't worry.

280
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,790
No matter what,

281
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,830
I can't upset you,

282
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,350
right?

283
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,480
Look at the state you're in.

284
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,370
If people see you, it'll be a joke.

285
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,320
Alright.

286
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,310
I like you, I like you.

287
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,150
I like you the most.

288
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,110

(General's Mansion)

299
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,730
I just bought the pastries.

300
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,160
They're freshly made; have a taste.

301
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay.

302
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,870
- Have one.
- Let's eat together.

303
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
Here.

304
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Does it taste good?

(Huajing City)

306
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,200
(In Year 6 of Yuanle,)

307
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,030
(Wei Yun, General of Huaihua,)

308
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,510
(struck as the vanguard and led)

(to defeat North Qi in Qingzhou)

314
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,240
(and Fengling,)

315
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,240
(making Great Sui prosperous again.)

(Chu Mansion)

317
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,310
Linyang, Yu,

318
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,160
cover for me later, okay?

319
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,170
You're the one

320
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,610
who insisted on coming back with us.

321
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,960
Where's that courage

322
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,000
to sneak to Qingzhou now?

323
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,000
You're scared now?

324
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,350
Linyang, help me later, okay?

325
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,630
Don't help her.

326
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,280
You're back.

327
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,750
- Mother.
- Mother.

328
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,590
We're back.

329
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,200
Mother, our heroes,

330
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,750
who have won the battle, are back.

331
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,790
You're back.

332
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,550
You're all back.

333
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,310
You're all here.

334
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,260
You're all here.

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,830
You're all here...

336
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,110
Linyang,

337
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,110
what happened to your leg?

338
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,270
Mother,

339
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,110
don't worry.

340
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,510
My leg can be healed.

341
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
Don't be sad.

342
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,350
We're already lucky

343
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,400
to come back alive.

344
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,240
- That's right.
- Linyang is right.

345
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,080
We're already lucky

346
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,060
to come back alive.

347
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,240
You're back, huh?

348
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,980
Will you run away again?

349
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,270
Will you do it again?

350
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,250
Mother, I'm wrong. Sorry.

351
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,240
Will you run away again?

352
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,220
Mother, I'm wrong.

353
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,070
Mother, I'm wrong.

354
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,960
Will you do it again?

355
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Yu, save me!

356
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,870
Yu!

357
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,280
You ran, huh?

358
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,250
- Yu, help!
- How dare you?

359
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,450
- How could you?
- Sorry.

360
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,650
- Mother.
- Mother.

361
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,960
Good.

362
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,590
It's good that you're back.

363
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,720
It's good that you're back.

364
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,030
I have no other wishes now.

365
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,210
I just hope that you are all

366
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,270
safe and sound.

380
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,150
The Ministry of Rites
shall bestow rewards

381
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,020
on the entire army.

382
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,110
The Imperial Medical Bureau
shall try its best

383
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,680
to treat the General of Anyuan.

384
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

385
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,440
Marquis of Zhenguo,

386
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,160
you beheaded the King
of Northern Qi, Su Can,

387
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,680
and deserve the foremost merit.

388
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,210
Wenchang, Shilan.

389
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,440
You two have also

390
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,110
impressed me greatly.

391
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,440
Before, your father

392
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,650
forbade you from going to war.

393
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,310
We underestimated your talents.

394
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,590
Your Majesty,

395
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,310
Supervisor Gu lost Qingzhou,

396
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,450
and surrendered to Northern Qi.

397
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,960
This is a fact known to all.

398
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,240
Therefore, I believe

399
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,550
he should not only not receive rewards,

400
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
but should be charged with a crime.

401
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,160
Marquis of Zhenguo,

402
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,720
what is your opinion?

403
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,350
Your Majesty,

404
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,480
Supervisor Gu feigned surrender

405
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,350
to buy time for me

406
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,920
to kill Su Can,

407
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,020
thus relieving the crisis
in Qingzhou and Fengling.

408
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,720
Had he failed,

409
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,130
we'd also have been guilty
beyond pardon.

410
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,310
Duke of Ning,

411
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,400
should we all be punished as well?

412
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,800
This...

413
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,510
With his body,

414
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,000
Supervisor Gu held Qingzhou

415
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
and protected

416
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,640
the people within the city.

417
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,550
I am a Wei.

418
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,450
I despise traitors the most.

419
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,720
If Supervisor Gu had truly betrayed us,

420
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,400
I'd never have allowed him

421
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,540
to return to Huajing alive.

422
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,390
Your Majesty,

423
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,240
without Supervisor Gu's sacrifice

424
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,180
and cooperation with us,

425
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,840
it'd be hard for us to reclaim Qingzhou.

426
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,910
Indeed, Your Majesty.

427
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
Supervisor Gu

428
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
helped us protect

429
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,940
the people of Qingzhou.

430
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,720
I once heard that Supervisor Gu

431
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,590
and the Marquis of Zhenguo

432
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,510
were at odds,

433
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,170
but it seems now

434
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,120
that civil and military officials
are united.

435
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,720
Very good.

436
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,080
Very good.

437
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,630
Gu Chusheng,

438
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,920
your achievements are remarkable.

439
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,880
You are hereby promoted
to Minister of Personnel.

440
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,050
Thank you, Your Majesty.

441
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,590
Your Majesty,

442
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,070
there was another person

443
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,090
who contributed to Fengling's victory.

444
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,200
Chu Yu, daughter
of the General of the Northwest,

445
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,600
infiltrated the hot spring villa,

446
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,610
risked her life to destroy
the crossbow workshop,

447
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,000
and brought peace to Fengling.

448
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,240
Do you wish

449
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,960
to request a reward for Chu Yu?

450
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,280
Your Majesty,

451
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,400
I do wish to speak...

452
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,070
General Chu Jianchang's daughter...

453
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,280
I know her.

454
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,160
She is also your sister-in-law.

455
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,640
Let me think

456
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,750
about how to reward a woman

457
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,510
who has slain enemies
on the battlefield.

458
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,110
By the way,

459
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,200
Duke of Ning, anything to report?

460
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Your Majesty,

461
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,640
though the war
between our two nations has eased,

462
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,440
true peace has yet to come.

463
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,880
We should send envoys soon
to pursue peace talks,

464
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,550
so that Great Sui

465
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,160
may enjoy lasting stability.

466
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,480
I shall think

467
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,400
on this as well.

468
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,840
Your Lordship,

469
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,750
the Emperor invites you
to join him for lunch.

470
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,950
Sure.

471
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,420
Thank you, Eunuch Huang.

472
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,080
Wei Yun,

473
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,320
here's a reminder.

474
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,350
You just now referred to her

475
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,430
not as Mrs. Wei,

476
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,830
but as Ms. Chu.

477
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,350
I fear the Emperor

478
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,830
does not favor such

479
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,830
self-serving wording.

480
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,240
You're quite good

481
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,550
at reading imperial intent, Minister Gu.

482
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,000
But why stay behind

483
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,880
just to warn me?

484
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,440
Perhaps you're also serving yourself.

485
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,960
My warning this time

486
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,240
is sincere.

487
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,340
It's to thank you

488
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,410
for defending me just now.

489
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,030
I only did so for the sake of Great Sui.

490
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
I don't usually

491
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
serve myself.

492
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,390
Young Marquis,

493
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,930
didn't you plan to use your merit

494
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,270
to win a chance

495
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,400
to be with Ms. Chu?

496
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,920
Did the Emperor refuse you?

497
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,270
It's worse.

498
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,340
He didn't even let me ask for it.

499
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,400
You don't want money

500
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,960
nor rank, or title.

501
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,960
Shouldn't that please

502
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,800
the Emperor?

503
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,480
I know you have a pure heart,

504
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,830
hoping that all who toil

505
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,750
will receive their due.

506
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,030
But our nation

507
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,270
truly needs a sage.

508
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,320
Your Majesty,

509
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,030
I do not understand

510
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,480
what you are trying to say.

511
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,240
In this turbulent world,

512
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,920
he needs to convince everyone

513
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,440
that his existence

514
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,350
will bring victory every time.

515
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,350
Before the people,

516
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,030
he may speak of justice,

517
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,640
law, and the people,

518
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,510
but the only thing

519
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,160
he cannot speak of

520
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,240
is his own desire.

521
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,960
The realm,

522
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,310
the peace of the land,

523
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,030
and the people.

524
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,200
Each of these

525
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,310
must weigh more
than the woman by his side.

526
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,750
Great Sui has finally

527
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,750
won a victory.

528
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,590
The Emperor must've made a decision.

529
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,720
But when it falls upon me,

530
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,240
it's not so easy to accept.

531
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,110
All sages have always been lonely.

532
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,870
Could it be

533
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,720
that the Emperor wants you

534
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,660
to live alone forever?

535
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,150
Wei Qiu, you...

536
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,720
You'd better start

537
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,560
reading more books.

538
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,270
I want one.

539
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,070
Sir, me, too.

540
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,640
- I'll take two!
- I was here first!

541
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,720
Sir, I want one!

542
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,560
Give me one!

543
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,200
Give me one!

544
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,620
You'll all get one. Help yourselves.

545
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,310
Sir, sir.

546
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,640
You'll all get one.

547
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,440
I want this one!

548
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,000
- Here's the money.
- Take it yourself.

549
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,200
What's plastered all over the streets?

550
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,600
The Marquis of Zhenguo slays Su Can!

551
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,340
It wards off evil!

552
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,080
Come and buy one!

553
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,960
You'll all get one!

554
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,800
Plenty for everyone!

555
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,510
This one's mine!

556
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,030
Come on, take one yourself!

557
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,310
How ridiculous.

558
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,030
Indeed.

559
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,350
How ridiculous.

560
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,000
Your Majesty, how did you know

561
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,590
what the Marquis of Zhenguo wanted?

562
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,110
How could I not know

563
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,240
about Ms. Chu and him?

564
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,800
I am already old,

565
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,320
and it's time for me to think

566
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,160
about Huan's future.

567
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,000
Huan must have

568
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,880
both reliable allies

569
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,150
and loyal followers.

570
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,880
For the realm to remain stable,

571
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,920
some must cast aside

572
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,960
their personal desires.

573
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,840
Wei Yun

574
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,110
cannot merely be Wei Yun

575
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
nor

576
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,760
just the Marquis of Zhenguo.

577
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,480
Your Majesty,

578
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,790
since you have such expectations

579
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,910
of the Marquis of Zhenguo,

580
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,480
does that mean you already have

581
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,710
a plan against North Qi?

582
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,070
Changming is still in North Qi.

583
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,360
This matter

584
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,440
must be carefully considered.

585
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,070
In diplomacy,

586
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,590
we must pursue peace talks
with North Qi.

587
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,200
In military affairs,

588
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,550
we must establish

589
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,290
a war god so fearsome

590
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,150
that North Qi will tremble at his name.

591
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,510
No wonder you chose
the Marquis of Zhenguo.

592
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,670
He did kill the King of North Qi

593
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,230
and rescued Great Sui

594
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,760
from peril.

595
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,550
Yet such a man,

596
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,880
entangled in love,

597
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,000
will surely have a weakness.

598
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,670
A portrait of the Marquis of Zhenguo.

599
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,350
- The Marquis's portrait.
- Give me one.

600
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,540
- Give me one!
- Me, too!

601
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,880
You're never late.

602
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,550
What happened today?

603
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,930
The Marquis secured the northern border,

604
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,570
killed Su Can,

605
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,790
and brought peace to Qingzhou.

606
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,920
They're glorious feats,

607
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,860
yet to you young ladies,

608
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,670
all you see

609
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,800
is romance and passion.

610
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,360
Ten copies of The General in White!

611
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,710
Sure, we have them.

612
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,320
What about the Marquis's portraits?

613
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,230
We've got plenty.

614
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,480
On my way here,

615
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,190
I saw the same scene.

616
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,670
Young Marquis Wei risked his life

617
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,080
to kill the King of North Qi.

618
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,070
Such a feat is indeed legendary.

619
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,960
That it's taken Huajing by storm

620
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,800
is hardly surprising.

621
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,840
Still,

622
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,480
the fervor seems a bit too much.

623
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,110
Huajing is the capital.

624
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,900
For such a great stir to rise,

625
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,320
someone must be fanning the flames

626
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,160
behind the scenes.

627
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,910
It seems the Emperor is determined

628
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,910
to make Wei Yun

629
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,800
the pillar that steadies Great Sui.

630
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,190
(Teahouse)
The Marquis's portraits

631
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,150
are sold out,

632
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,510
but I still have portraits

633
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,550
of the Left General

634
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,880
and the Right General.

635
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,840
Who wants their portraits?

636
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,390
You should've said so earlier.

637
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,070
I chased all the way here for nothing.

638
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,710
I don't want their portraits.

639
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,550
I only want the Marquis's portrait.

640
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,400
- Exactly.
- Yes.

641
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,610
I want the Marquis's portrait.

642
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,640
Don't go!

643
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,760
Don't go!

644
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,600
Let's go.

645
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,710
Let's check another vendor.

646
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,360
Come on.

647
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,160
(Song Generals, Wenchang, Shilan)
Paintings!

648
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,840
Take a look at the paintings!

649
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,000
Brave generals are few in Great Sui.

650
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,760
Shilan,

651
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,200
your performance

652
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,400
in the battle of Qingzhou

653
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
was outstanding.

654
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,320
Your future will surely be bright.

655
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,480
Chusheng, are you advising me

656
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,440
not to care about short-term gains
and losses?

657
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,030
I was able to go to Qingzhou

658
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,170
thanks to Young Marquis Wei's
recommendation.

659
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,800
It let me fulfill my ambition.

660
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,400
So, rest assured.

661
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
I bear no resentment.

662
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,510
Instead, I truly admire

663
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,710
Young Marquis Wei's courage.

664
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,800
Besides, it seems

665
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,160
that you

666
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,360
and Young Marquis Wei

667
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,230
have eased your tensions quite a bit.

668
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,710
The prosperity of Great Sui

669
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
cannot rely on one man alone.

670
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,210
As long as we stay united,

671
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,800
we will achieve great things.

672
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,230
I've always known

673
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,150
that truth.

674
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,950
Here.

675
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,580
(Teahouse)

676
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,540
(True Might)

677
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,760
You're back.

678
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,550
Chun.

679
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,920
It's quite lifelike.

680
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,480
I'm going.

681
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,110
Yun.

682
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,000
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)
Why tear it?

683
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,870
Chun,

684
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,400
the commoners outside

685
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,340
are just making a fuss.

686
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,880
How could you join them?

687
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,280
I feel proud.

688
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,160
Yun,

689
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,360
our family

690
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,670
has regained its former glory.

691
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,390
I think

692
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,000
if the deceased could see us now,

693
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,880
they would be proud, too.

694
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,740
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)

695
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,280
Everyone sacrificed greatly

696
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,190
to win the battles of Qingzhou

697
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,630
and Fengling.

698
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,140
But to single out one man

699
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,980
for all the praise is not a good thing.

700
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,920
I fear there are people

701
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,060
stirring the waters

702
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,900
behind the scenes.

703
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,980
Yun,

704
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,580
you're overthinking it.

705
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,300
I'll go check on Chu Yu.

706
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,180
She nearly lost her life

707
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,120
at the hot spring villa,

708
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,580
and her brother fought desperately

709
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,280
to guard Fengling.

710
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,900
There are countless unsung heroes.

711
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,100
Others may not feel sorry for them,

712
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
but I do.

713
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,820
If I know this and still stay silent,

714
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,420
I can't live with myself.

715
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,220
- Yun...
- Chun,

716
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,380
I've made up my mind.

717
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,340
She and I risked our lives

718
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,180
to protect the realm,

719
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,700
yet we can't even fight

720
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,620
for our own happiness.

721
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,460
How could I accept that?

722
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,420
Even in my darkest hour,

723
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,940
what I thought about

724
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,220
was when we could

725
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,060
love freely once.

726
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,780
So,

727
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,060
I have to go see her.

728
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,940
So, nothing can stop you now.

729
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,460
Are you going to discipline me again?

730
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,700
Fine.

731
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,920
I can go and see her afterward.

732
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,020
Wei Qiu.

733
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,340
Why would I stop you?

734
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,340
I am a woman

735
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,460
of my word.

736
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,180
If you've thought it through,

737
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,900
then be ready
to face all that comes after.

738
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,540
Thank you, Chun.

739
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,740
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)

740
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,660
(Marquis of Zhenguo, Wei Yun)

741
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,420
I don't think this painting is good.

742
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,000
It doesn't capture even a fraction

743
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,920
of Wei Yun's spirit.

744
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,500
It's fine.

745
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,360
It looks quite like him.

746
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,060
We're here.

747
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,070
(Langkeng Fish Tavern)
Remember?

748
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,540
Father used to bring you here

749
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,180
to drink

750
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,180
Rose Dew.

751
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,500
Of course.

752
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,980
The owner here

753
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,420
never opens before the Xu hour.

754
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,740
Luckily,

755
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,180
we don't curfew.

756
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,540
That's right.

757
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,660
He'd never brought me here.

758

00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,820
Coming right up.

761
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,260
Linyang,

762
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,140
tell me.

763
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,540
What we're doing

764
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,020
is meaningful, right?

765
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,540
Of course.

766
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,620
When Father took us

767
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,020
to the battlefield when we were kids,

768
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,660
he always told us,

769
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,140
"Life is hard."

770
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,940
"You must"

771
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,020
"protect yourselves."

772
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,500
Back then, I was too young

773
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,420
to remember the next line.

774
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,260
"Life is hard."

775
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,480
"You must protect yourselves,"

776
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,540
"so you can protect others."

777
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,180
I used

778
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,940
to feel indignant.

779
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,500
Why are we

780
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,780
always the ones left behind?

781
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,180
Perhaps it's because of our humble roots

782
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,140
or harsh fate.

783
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,840
In this tangled web

784
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,820
of Great Sui's politics,

785
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,400
we're simply not meant
to have a name.

786
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,420
Yu...

787
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,220
But this time,

788
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,700
after returning to Huajing,

789
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,340
I saw the faces

790
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,620
in the city renewed.

791
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,780
The people's smiles

792
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,220
were genuine

793
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,380
and peaceful.

794
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,380
And at that moment, I knew

795
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,100
that protecting others

796
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,340
is meaningful.

797
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,500
As expected of you.

798
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,200
