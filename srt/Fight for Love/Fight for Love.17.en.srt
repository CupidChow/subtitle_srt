21
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,680
Gu Chusheng's pursuers

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
must have arrived nearby.

23
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,390
You ride and leave first,

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,510
leaving marks along the way

25
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,400
so Chu Yu can find us.

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,680
Also,

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,560
take my horse

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
and lead away some of them.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,070
I still can't figure out

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,280
how you found me.

31
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,070
I've erased all the traces

32
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,280
along the way

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,920
and only left marks

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
for Chu...

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
She even told you this?

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,900
(Wood)
You mean that wood?

37
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,530
I have nothing to hide from Yu,

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,360
so she treats me with honesty.

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,620
You should be grateful

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,910
that she told me,

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,030
or you'd really die here today.

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,590
You're so good at taking credit.

43
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,310
What I should be grateful for

44
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,240
is that Chu Yu
still remembers this code.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,080
The ones

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,030
I should thank most

47
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,280
are the tacit understanding

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,190
between her and me.

49
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,590
Why isn't she here?

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,110
There's something more important

51
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,870
than saving you.

52
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,970
More important than...?

53
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,060
Has Yao Yong started a rebellion?

54
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,070
Wei Yun,

55
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,660
how could you let her face danger alone?

56
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,150
If there's no foolproof plan,

57
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,750
I'd never leave her in Huajing.

58
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,590
Gu Chusheng,

59
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,870
if you can think one step ahead,

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,630
I can think five.

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,590
Now, you don't even pretend

62
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,340
in front of me anymore, do you?

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,870
You should worry more about yourself.

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,630
Our current situation

65
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,150
is not safe.

66
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,920
Where are you going?

67
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,400
You're really generous.

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,680
It's just material things.

69
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,150
How's it outside?

70
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,470
They've learned their lesson.

71
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,330
They sent in four,

72
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,630
and I deliberately let one escape

73
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,470
to send a message.

74
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,920
Why are you so sure

75
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,560
that these decoys

76
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,270
can fool those people outside?

77
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,000
Your place is not that big,

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,190
yet they sent in two teams,

79
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,800
one after another, to investigate.

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,310
It shows the leader is extremely alert,

81
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,920
but overly cautious,

82
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,310
which will make him hesitate.

83
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,800
So, I left one person

84
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
to send a message,

85
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,310
hoping he would exaggerate.

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,310
That'd be our chance.

87
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,680
It's been the Zi hour,

88
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,100
but Yao Yong hasn't shown up.

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,660
Did he sense something was wrong

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,740
and change the location?

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,870
Yao Jue has broken free;

92
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,000
Yao Yong will surely notice,

93
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,300
but there are few feasible routes
in Dingfeng Valley,

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,830
mostly in the low-lying valley bottom,

95
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,950
which are easily ambushed.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
For safety,

97
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,800
he has only this one route to take.

98
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,150
Someone's coming.

99
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
Hurry.

100
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,380
- Mother.
- Don't run.

101
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,220
There are vagrants.

102
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,110
Stop.

103
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Don't run.

104
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,680
It's Yao Yong's men.

105
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Stop.

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,840
- Hurry.
- Ms. Chu.

107
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,310
These commoners

108
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,390
might not be a coincidence.

109
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,200
How about this?

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,440
I'll take a team

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,700
and go to the back mountain

112
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,760
to form a pincer movement

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,520
so as not to reveal our position.

114
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,680
Charge!

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
Okay.

116
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,880
Let's go.

117
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,710
This is my first time
on the battlefield.

118
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,510
Though it's not a very big one,

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm still a divine soldier.

120
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,100
Don't forget our purpose today.

121
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,240
Stay alert.

122
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Okay.

123
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
Form up and protect the commoners!

124
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,910
Yes!

125
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,560
Ms. Chu, you've kept your word.

126
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,560
I let my cousin spread the news

127
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
to lure you here.

128
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,480
There are also the Duke of Hu's sons.

129
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,560
What a pleasant surprise.

130
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,150
Where's Wei Yun?

131
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,120
He doesn't need to come here.

132
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,270
To deal with you,

133
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,310
I'm enough on my own.

134
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,560
Ms. Chu,

135
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,750
don't be too confident.

136
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,240
You're outnumbered.

137
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,720
Today, you have no way

138
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,870
to escape Dingfeng Valley.

139
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,510
I'll first send you to reunite

140
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,510
with Chu Jianchang and his daughter.

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Then I'll have a go at Wei Yun.

142
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Yao Yong,

143
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,830
you colluded with North Qi.

144
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,920
The 30,000 Chu troops in Fengling City

145
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,680
and the 70,000 Wei troops
in Baidi Valley

146
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,820
all perished because of you.

147
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,960
Today,

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,310
even if I die here,

149
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,360
I won't let you destroy
the peace of Great Sui.

150
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
Is that so?

151
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,720
Then let's see

152
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,560
if you have the luck

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,120
to live to that day.

154
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,680
Kill!

155
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,220
General Yao instructed us
before he left.

156
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,830
They first lured Wei Yun and the others

157
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,870
out of Huajing City.

158
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,630
He ordered us to go and support them

159
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,900
so as to launch a pincer attack

160
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,260
and give them a hand.

161
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
Yes.

162
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,900
(Yao Mansion)

163
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,870
- Who are you?
- Jiang Chun

164
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,380
from the Marquis of Zhenguo's family.

165
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,250
Zhang Han

166
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,690
from the Marquis of Zhenguo's family.

167
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,720
Just you two?

168
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,710
And us as well.

169
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
How come you're here?

170
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,360
You mean Yao Yong

171
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,750
keeps many private soldiers

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,510
in the mansion?

173
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,970
There aren't many family members there.

174
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,720
Even with the soldiers

175
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,630
and the servants,

176
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,000
it's only over 30 people.

177
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
But lately, they've had to purchase

178
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,240
30 to 50 dan of rice and flour

179
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,320
every few days.

180
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,550
It seems there are

181
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
over 100 people hidden there.

182
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
The weapons

183
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
I found in his study

184
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,470
must be for these people.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
No wonder Yao Yong is so arrogant.

186
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,900
He's been lying low in Huajing

187
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,750
for so many years.

188
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,600
How well he's been hiding.

189
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,480
But we don't have many troops,

190
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,170
and it's hard to fight on two fronts.

191
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,000
Leave this to us.

192
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,360
You've received the divorce paper.

193
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,120
Why side with outsiders

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,200
against your own cousin?

195
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,970
If General Yao is punished,

196
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,100
you'll be implicated, too.

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,820
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

198
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,030
I can be

199
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,030
a lady of the Yao family

200
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
and the wife of Wei Feng,

201
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,600
but I will never be

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,700
an accomplice to my enemies.

203
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,440
Don't waste words with him.

204
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,510
They killed my husband.

205
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,500
They deserve to die.

206
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,900
Charge!

207
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,720
Kill!

208
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,630
With me here,

209
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,940
do you still think you can escape?

210
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,240
Charge out together!

211
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,840
I'm an old man;

212
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,870
Still, I can fight

213
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,950
with young people like you.

214
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,660
Kill!

215
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,960
Song Shilan,

216
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,720
you even brought reinforcements.

217
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,720
Let me see

218
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,120
who will have the last laugh.

219
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,150
Today,

220
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,750
thank you for your help.

221
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,200
On behalf of my family

222
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,550
and Yun,

223
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,480
I thank you.

224
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
Ms. Jiang, my pleasure.

225
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,350
Take him away.

226
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,710
This trick won't last over four hours.

227
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,730
There will be a tough battle.

228
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,300
I may not be able to take care of you.

229
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
Can you hold

230
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,630
onto that dagger?

231
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,150
This bamboo tube contains

232
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,460
the evidence of Yao Yong's collusion

233
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,040
with North Qi,

234
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,150
proving his crime

235
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,670
of treason.

236
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,510
No wonder he wants to kill you.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,040
It's not the time for you

238
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,170
to make your last will yet.

239
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
Since I promised Chu Yu

240
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,440
to save you,

241
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,440
I will never go back on my word.

242
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,030
In your eyes,

243
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,630
I'm just a man

244
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
who abandoned Chu Yu for power.

245
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,150
My life is probably

246
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,840
not as important

247
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,970
to you as this bamboo tube.

248
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,200
Your life doesn't matter,

249
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,720
but my promise to Chu Yu

250
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600
matters greatly.

251
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,270
Have you already fallen

252
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,630
so deeply in love with her?

253
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,870
Decoys.

254
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,920
Stop.

255
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,270
Pass my order:
Prepare to break the door.

256
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,110
Yes.

257
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,320
So many arrows.

258
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,710
There must be a lot of them.

259
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,330
I'll try to hold on as long as I can.

260
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,200
Don't get in the way.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,840
The bamboo tube

262
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,080
is with you.

263
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,710
If I don't come back,

264
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,220
leave with the bamboo tube.

265
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,470
If you lose it,

266
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,630
I'll hold you accountable.

267
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,110
Wei Yun,

268
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,110
with your martial arts skills,

269
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,520
you can easily take the bamboo tube

270
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:51,960
and leave.

271
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,150
They only want to kill me.

272
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,440
I'm saving you

273
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,670
not just because of Chu Yu.

274
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,920
I hate you,

275
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,080
but you are a decent official.

276
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,180
The current court needs

277
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,440
people like you.

278
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,320
So today,

279
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,690
I'm protecting you
for the sake of Great Sui.

280
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,960
Just this once.

281
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,080
As long as I stand here today,

282
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,750
you won't be able to open

283
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,030
the door behind me.

284
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,870
Archers.

285
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,590
Chu Yu,

286
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,720
with your current investigation,

287
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,540
you still don't have any evidence.

288
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,780
Today, Wei Yun and I split up

289
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,960
to bring back

290
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,110
the evidence of your treason.

291
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,720
Ms. Chu,

292
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,860
don't waste words with him.

293
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,830
He's just bluffing.

294
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,220
The Court of Judicial Review

295
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,180
will make him confess.

296
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,560
I'll count that

297
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,960
as my trophy

298
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
this time.

299
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
The Chu and Wei spirits

300
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,340
can rest in peace now.

301
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,480
As for when

302
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,560
and how you die,

303
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,710
it will be decided
by the laws of Great Sui.

304
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,910
Yun.

305
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,790
Gu Chusheng is inside.

306
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,630
Take him away.

307
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,310
We'll deal with the people outside.

308
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,270
Okay.

309
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,210
Young Marquis, Ms. Chu,

310
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,240
be careful.

311
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,690
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

312
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,670
Yun.

313
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,610
That man sent out a signal

314
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,450
before he died.

315
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,110
There might be more of them nearby.

316
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,560
Mr. Gu,

317
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,520
what have you discovered

318
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,020
that so many people want to kill you?

319
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,700
It's the evidence of Yao Yong's treason,

320
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,170
hidden inside a bamboo tube.

321
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,240
No wonder.

322
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,680
We'll lead the charge

323
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,520
and break through.

324
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,550
Young Marquis,

325
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,590
we finally meet.

326
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,800
Who are you?

327
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,340
(Shen Yu, a spy from North Qi)
That's not important.

328
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,590
What's important is

329
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,160
that none of you will survive.

330
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,960
Gu Chusheng,

331
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,800
give me the tube.

332
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,940
Wei Yun.

333
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,030
I don't trust you

334
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,450
with something so important.

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,840
Chase.

336
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,200
Time to show our loyalty.

337
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,440
Kill them!

338
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,110
Archers.

339
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,160
You have nowhere to run.

340
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Hand over the tube,

341
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,510
and I'll give you

342
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,550
a quick death.

343
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,760
Shoot!

344
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,880
How foolish.

345
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,590
There's a rapid stream down there.

346
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,060
Perhaps it's the only way out

347
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,750
on this dead-end road.

348
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,730
Dare you take a gamble?

349
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,150
What?

350
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,720
You don't trust me?

351
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,320
I do.

352
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,070
No matter how hard this is...

353
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,830
No matter what happens...

354
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,720
I'm willing to be with you.

355
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,680
I'm willing to fight with you.

Yes.

369
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,590
Just now, my sisters-in-law and I

370
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,070
have captured all the remnants
of Yao's faction

371
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,920
in Huajing City.

372
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,640
Huajing City should be safe now.

373
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,560
Uncle, do you know

374
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,240
that this time it was Ms. Chu

375
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,380
who entrusted me with this?

376
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,070
Since I got married,

377
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,850
this is the first time
I've accomplished something.

378
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,000
You've never forgotten the Wei family.

379
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,830
I haven't forgotten

380
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,000
their code of conduct.

381
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,160
Uncle, you've always told me

382
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,510
that their actions

383
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
are respectable.

384
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,240
In these years living with them,

385
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,440
what I've heard

386
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,430
and seen

387
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,240
has really

388
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,440
touched me.

389
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,590
You're right.

390
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
In this world,

391
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,200
everyone's path is hard.

392
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,200
Everyone will encounter many things:

393
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,290
family members leaving,

394
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,830
betrayal, being framed,

395
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,260
and hitting rock bottom.

396
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,520
Everyone will have this moment.

397
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,920
But, Jiu,

398
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,310
the key is the choice.

399
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,510
Life is a journey of self-cultivation.

400
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,790
To transcend the world,

401
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,980
one must first engage with it.

402
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,430
After seeing great sorrow,

403
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,500
great suffering, and great evil
in the mortal world,

404
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,610
if one can still maintain
their true self,

405
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,350
that is true goodness.

406
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,390
Uncle,

407
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,240
I may not understand now,

408
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,050
but I'm willing to spend my whole life

409
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,020
to understand it.

410
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,960
Well said.

411
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,240
Your Highness,

412
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,200
the turmoil at Yao Mansion
has been suppressed,

413
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,570
and Yao Yong has been captured.

414
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,990
You don't need to see His Majesty

415
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,230
at today's early court session.

416
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,510
As a general of our dynasty,

417
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,200
Yao Yong dared to commit treason.

418
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,630
This matters a lot.

419
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,600
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)
I must go

420
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,740
to the early court session.

421
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,870
Hanmei?

422
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,520
I know

423
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,200
that you'll go to the Palace today.

424
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,980
I've heard about Yao Yong's rebellion,

425
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,850
and there might still be rebels
in the city.

426
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,000
I hope you

427
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,920
will allow me to escort you.

428
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,590
Hanmei!

429
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,280
Your Highness.

430
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,920
I'm glad you're safe.

431
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,680
Call the imperial physician!

432
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,520
Yes.

433
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,040
Hanmei...

434
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,800
Your Highness,

435
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,920
the place where Mr. Xue was injured

436
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,400
is just a hair's breadth from his heart.

437
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,550
It's extremely dangerous.

438
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,480
Whether he will wake up or not

439
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,590
depends on his fortune.

440
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,830
In the coming days,

441
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,350
someone must always be by his side.

442
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,560
I am a witness

443
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,920
to Lord of Qin's treason

444
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,760
years ago.

445
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,270
Whether he did it intentionally

446
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,350
or unintentionally,

447
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,460
Great Sui paid the price

448
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
of three cities.

449
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,790
Since then,

450
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,590
the name North Qi

451
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,590
has become a thorn

452
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,270
in my heart,

453
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,070
causing it

454
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,750
to ache terribly.

455
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,310
That day in Qinxi Valley,

456
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,830
the items from North Qi were found.

457
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,590
How could I not be suspicious?

458
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,000
But today, you...

459
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,440
I can't remember which day it was

460
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,880
that you volunteered to come

461
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,470
and risk your life
to gather herbs for me,

462
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,240
saying you wanted to heal my injuries.

463
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,270
What medicine can't I find?

464
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,550
Why go up the mountain yourself

465
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,110
and get hurt like this?

466
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,030
This herb only grows

467
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,200
on cliffs and steep walls.

468
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,400
No one will risk their life
to gather it.

469
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,040
But for you,

470
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,750
the risk is nothing.

471
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,110
I command you:

472
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,920
Never to gather herbs again.

473
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,350
Your Highness,

474
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,760
I'm hurt.

475
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,240
How could I not understand

476
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,750
that as long as I stay away from love,

477
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,550
I won't get hurt?

478
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,270
How could I possibly like you?

479
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,750
And yet today,

480
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,160
you risked your life

481
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,000
to save me.

482
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,590
I shouldn't doubt you anymore.

483
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,350
Hanmei,

484
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,920
I'll stay right here with you.

485
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,310
I want to see you wake up.

486
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,680
Do you hear me?

487
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,270
If her attendant

488
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,740
hadn't protected her from the blade,

489
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,030
I would've lost Changming.

490
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,480
Huang Quanyou,

491
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,200
pass on my imperial decree.

492
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,440
Make sure to get Yao Yong to talk

493
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,240
and root out every last remnant

494
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,830
of North Qi in Huajing City.

495
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,140
(Huajing City)

496
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,200
Thanks. I can't eat.

497
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,310
Don't worry.

498
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,110
Young Marquis Wei and Ms. Chu

499
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,200
are not easy targets.

500
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,960
A few spies won't be able

501
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,220
to do anything to them.

502
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
Here, eat something.

503
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,440
Eat something.

504
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,600
Look at yourself.

505
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,000
You're more worrisome than they are.

506
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,870
Young Master,

507
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,200
it seems someone is coming back.

508
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,670
Where's Yu?

509
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,100
General Chu,

510
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,200
it's just a short distance.

511
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,110
What's the rush?

512
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,750
We're finally back.

513
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,510
Chusheng,

514
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,400
can you hold on?

515
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,350
It's okay; don't worry about me.

516
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,120
We need to get back to Huajing asap

517
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,270
to inform the others

518
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,820
to find Chu Yu and Wei Yun.

519
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,720
Okay.

520
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,030
Mr. Song,

521
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,920
where's Yu?

522
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,760
Wei Yun and she

523
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,810
went towards Pingjin Cliff

524
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,160
to draw the pursuers away.

525
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,890
General Chu, please take some men

526
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,110
to support them.

527
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,960
They went alone?

528
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,390
How many pursuers are there?

529
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,280
About 20 to 30,

530
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,280
including archers.

531
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,510
Chu Shan, Wanyue,

532
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,350
Wei Qiu,

533
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,790
follow me to provide support.

534
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,320
Commander Lu...

535
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,510
I'm precious.

536
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,480
Promise me some wine every day

537
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,880
- until I vomit.
- Then forget it.

538
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,390
I'm just joking.

539
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,390
I'll go with you.

540
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm at your service.

541
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,550
If you fall on the way,

542
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,240
Ms. Chu will surely beat me up.

543
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,630
I'll go, too.

544
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,310
Mr. Song,

545
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,110
since Yu has entrusted Mr. Gu to you,

546
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,950
please ensure

547
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,960
his safe return to Huajing.

548
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,240
The Duke of Hu

549
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,920
has been waiting
for you and your brother.

550
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,390
Commander,

551
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,750
one of them is injured.

552
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,640
They must be hiding nearby.

553
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,240
We cannot let them

554
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
escape again.

555
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,800
Keep searching.

556
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,240
Chu Yu?

557
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,800
Chu Yu...

558
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,350
Chu...

559
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,720
Wei Yun,

560
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,390
you're awake.

561
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,720
Don't move.

562
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,520
How are you?

563
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,470
Is your leg in too much pain?

564
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,280
No, it isn't.

565
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,920
Where did you just go?

566
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,830
I went out to see

567
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,160
if there were any useful herbs,

568
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,640
but it was pouring rain outside

569
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,510
and too dark.

570
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,500
I couldn't find anything.

571
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,110
But I found something else good.

572
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,200
I can make grilled fish for you.

573
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,390
I'll help.

574
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,520
No need.

575
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,920
Just stay here.

576
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,760
I'll take care of it.

577
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,040
Sit still.

578
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,280
I don't know when Linyang

579
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,510
will find us.

580
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,230
It won't be that easy.

581
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,510
I don't know if you like fish.

582
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,800
Let's just fill our stomachs first.

583
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,280
Once you regain some strength,

584
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,320
we'll go out

585
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
and see if there's a village nearby.

586
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,910
We'll find a physician for you first.

587
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,300
Though the Yao remnants
have all been captured,

588
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,960
the Eldest Princess was still attacked

589
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,880
outside her mansion,

590
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,510
causing panic in Huajing.

591
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,030
Yao Yong's fate

592
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,070
needs to be decided asap.

593
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,760
Where is Yao Yong?

594
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,000
Isn't this Mr. Gu?

595
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,670
What an honor to have you

596
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,960
preside over my case.

597
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,550
You don't look surprised

598
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,200
that I'm still alive.

599
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,030
Your butler has confessed to everything.

600
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,190
You colluded with North Qi,

601
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,000
stole military secrets,

602
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,710
killed Wei generals

603
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,550
and the Wei Army,

604
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,130
and caused chaos in Huajing
with the intention of rebellion.

605
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,190
Each of these charges

606
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,370
is backed by solid evidence.

607
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,510
Yao Yong,

608
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,760
if you confess truthfully,

609
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,630
I can plead for your family

610
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,550
to be spared.

611
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,630
Why would I kill you?

612
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,550
Well.

613
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,550
The winner takes all.

614
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,000
Since I'm here now,

615
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,920
you can say

616
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,320
whatever you want.

617
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,750
You set a trap for Chu Yu

618
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,480
and Wei Yun in Dingfeng Valley

619
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,130
and sent assassins to kill me
in Qinxi Valley.

620
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,400
That day,

621
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
I didn't reveal my whereabouts.

622
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,070
How did you know?

623
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,680
Wei Yun,

624
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,240
how are you feeling?

625
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,840
So hot.

626
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Wei Yun.

627
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,200
Wei Yun,

628
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,440
can you hear me?

629
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,950
Wei Yun,

630
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,710
talk to me.

631
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,630
Wake up.

632
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,030
Wei Yun, can you hear me?

633
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,870
I'm cold.

634
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,200
Cold?

635
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,130
How are you feeling now?

636
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,840
Do you feel better?

637
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,810
I won't let anything happen to you.

638
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,430
Wei Yun.

639
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,550
Wei Yun.

640
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,550
Wake up, Wei Yun.

641
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
Wei Yun.

642
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,390
I'm sorry.

643
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,510
I'm so sorry.

644
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,840
At Pingjin Cliff,

645
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,510
I...

646
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,030
We were

647
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,280
out of options.

648
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,110
I had no choice

649
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,110
but to gamble with you.

650
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,350
I...

651
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,510
When you wake up,

652
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll never gamble again.

653
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,630
Whether it's a hail of arrows

654
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,710
or a sea of fire,

655
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,070
I'll go through it with you.

656
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,710
- Wei Yun.
- So cold.

657
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,360
Cold?

658
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,200
I'm cold.

659
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,680
Here.

660
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,510
Do you feel better?

661
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,640
Wei Yun,

662
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,910
please.

663
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,240
I beg you.

664
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,430
For...

665
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,200
You can't...

666
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,110
I beg you, Wei Yun.

667
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,950
Wake up.

668
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,870
You promised to be with me on this road.

669
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,800
You can't leave me alone.

670
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,910
Please,

671
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,280
wake up.

672
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,360
I beg you.
