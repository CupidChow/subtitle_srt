21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
This really isn't appropriate.

22
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,710
I was thoughtless.

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,550
I really was.

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,070
But I have a favor to ask.

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,710
I can't see you

26
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,310
without Her Highness's permission.

27
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,710
But it's about Her Highness.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,760
I had to resort to this unwise plan.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,940
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

30
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,840
Your... Your Lordship.

31
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,630
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,310
Tell me.

33
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,990
Why is she here?

34
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,910
You think some of the followers

35
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,800
of Her Highness

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,870
have hostile intentions?

37
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,470
Why do you say that?

38
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,310
The gifts I made for Her Highness

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
ended up in Qiju Store.

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,310
I made them myself.

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,470
There are many of them,

42
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,310
yet they're unique.

43
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,430
I don't think Her Highness

44
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,270
sold my gifts.

45
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,430
So, it means

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,630
someone stole them.

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,470
I see many followers here.

48
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,470
How is one follower

49
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,590
selected?

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
Talent is valued.

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,590
That's all?

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,280
Looks are just an added bonus.

53
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,010
So one has to be both talented

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880
and handsome

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,590
for Her Highness to even notice him.

56
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,870
So, are you clear

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,030
about their backgrounds?

58
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,870
Is she clear?

59
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
Of course.

60
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,800
We do check their backgrounds

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
and histories.

62
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,190
This is strange.

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,310
Don't you suspect me

64
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,550
of stealing them?

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
If I suspected you,

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,400
I wouldn't be telling you.

67
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,630
I'm just worried.

68
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,150
It will be bad enough

69
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,030
if he just wants money.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,400
But if he wants to hurt Her Highness,

71
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
things will be worse.

72
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,680
Mrs. Wei, I didn't know

73
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,190
you and Hanmei were so close

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,680
that you met up at night.

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

76
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,030
Yes.

77
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,270
Tell me.

78
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,680
I'll hear what you have to say

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,240
before I decide whether to punish you.

80
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,150
Your Highness,

81
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,360
Mrs. Wei...

82
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,190
She asked me not to tell you.

83
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,120
Well, Your Highness.

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,920
I... I made the decision alone

85
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,430
to meet Mr. Xue.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,120
He didn't know anything.

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,240
But just now, you called me Hanmei.

88
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,800
Shortly after you lost your husband,

89
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,560
you took a fancy to my follower.

90
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,600
You've changed so quickly.

91
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,920
It's quite a surprise.

92
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,190
What can I say?

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,680
Perhaps it's my destiny

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,750
to be entangled in matters of the heart.

95
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,720
In that case,

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,120
I will give Hanmei to you.

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,400
What do you say?

98
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,470
Please forgive me.

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,430
I was just joking.

100
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,040
Please don't take it seriously.

101
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,800
I know I was wrong.

102
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,120
Punish me as you wish.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,240
I don't care how you

104
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,560
conduct yourself out there.

105
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
But this is my mansion.

106
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
You can't see any of my men

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,160
without my permission.

108
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,120
For the sake

109
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,240
of our past acquaintance,

110
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll let it slide this time.

111
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
But if it happens again,

112
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,600
I won't let you off.

113
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,590
Do you understand?

114
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,870
I understand.

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
Forget it.

116
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,270
Even if I offered

117
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,800
that Hanmei could go with you,

118
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,270
he wouldn't be willing.

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
Your Highness,

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,680
Mrs. Wei was

121
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,920
only joking.

122
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,830
She admires you.

123
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,120
She wanted to be close

124
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,680
and give you a perfect gift,

125
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,510
but didn't know what to say.

126
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,270
So, she sneaked in like that.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,840
That's right.

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,870
My reputation

129
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,740
isn't the best.

130
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,040
But I know my limits.

131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,830
I came up with this foolish plan

132
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,000
just for a chance to get closer to you.

133
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
In that case,

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,870
I won't punish you.

135
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,000
I do want a gift.

136
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,720
What I need right now

137
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,070
is a perfect solution.

138
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
What is that?

139
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,120
You can count on me to get it for you.

140
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,920
One hundred thousand taels?

141
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,920
Why don't you

142
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,120
have your followers

143
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,430
put their heads together?

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,630
If they had any good ideas,

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,240
I wouldn't be asking you.

146
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,000
Last year, there were floods
across the nation.

147
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,680
His Majesty allocated funds

148
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,710
for those victims.

149
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
That has put a strain
on the national treasury.

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,270
If my brother

151
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,750
had any other choice,

152
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,560
he wouldn't have come to me for money.

153
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,000
Those prominent nobles in the capital

154
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,480
meet and have a banquet

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
every few days.

156
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,360
Such a luxurious life.

157
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,160
But when we need money

158
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,240
for disaster relief,

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,120
they tighten their purse strings

160
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
for fear of bad impacts

161
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,830
on their decadent lives.

162
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,750
They turn a blind eye
while our people suffer

163
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,000
and our soldiers struggle

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,960
on the borders.

165
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,000
My brother can't force them.

166
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,120
But I'm not afraid to play the villain.

167
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,270
If those nobles and officials

168
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,110
would donate money

169
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,030
to fill the treasury,

170
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,550
all the problems

171
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,480
of civilians and armies

172
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,750
could be solved.

173
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,910
This is exactly

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,030
what bothers Her Highness.

175
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,120
Hanmei has thought of a way

176
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,840
to help me persuade those people

177
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,000
to contribute.

178
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,320
All we need is the right opportunity.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,000
Mr. Xue is clever.

180
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,510
He certainly lives up
to being your favorite.

181
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,750
That's right.

182
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,750
Hanmei is the most capable follower

183
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,840
I've ever had.

184
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,880
Mrs. Wei,

185
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,960
have you got an idea?

186
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,720
Your Highness,

187
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,080
may I use Qinxi Valley?

188
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,750
Qinxi Valley?

189
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,720
It has hills and streams.

190
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,270
So, it's a perfect place

191
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,360
for nobles to gather.

192
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,870
You want me to hold

193
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,720
luxurious banquets

194
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,360
like they do?

195
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,720
Exactly.

196
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,660
You'll hold banquets,

197
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
lavish ones.

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,870
Those people love banquets

199
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,960
and they're big spenders.

200
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,000
So, we can hold an auction banquet

201
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,840
that will attract them.

202
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,300
Auction banquet?

203
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,380
Your Highness,

204
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,380
you can entrust me

205
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,260
with this banquet.

206
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,700
I can also draft a list

207
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,220
of necessary guests.

208
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,300
Your Lordship.

209
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,460
How is Ms. Chu doing?

210
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,020
Was she punished?

211
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,180
Don't worry.

212
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,460
They talked quite civilly.

213
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,580
Nothing bad happened.

214
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,100
Ms. Chu is awesome.

215
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,420
She sneaked in there.

216
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,180
Her Highness didn't punish her.

217
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,300
I even heard

218
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,940
Her Highness might allow her

219
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,780
to pick from the followers.

220
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,020
Followers?

221
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,020
Yes.

222
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,820
Just now,

223
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,180
why did you say that?

224
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
You almost got me into trouble.

225
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,660
What if Her Highness

226
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,660
decided to punish us?

227
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,980
She has a soft spot for you.

228
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,580
So, she wouldn't blame you.

229
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,380
Besides,

230
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,420
you helped her solve an urgent problem.

231
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,740
She will appreciate

232
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,740
this gift very much.

233
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,540
(Youban Pavilion)
But...

234
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,700
Her Highness has many manors.

235
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,220
Many of them are more grand

236
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,060
than Qinxi Valley.

237
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,220
Mrs. Wei,

238
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,300
why did you pick that place?

239
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,420
Do you think

240
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,700
that's inappropriate?

241
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,780
Not at all.

242
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,500
Located on the outskirts,

243
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,020
it's quite a distance.

244
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,060
It's a remote,

245
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,060
but great location.

246
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,460
Located south of Huajing City,

247
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,540
it attracts wealth.

248
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,700
Besides,

249
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,900
you must keep in mind

250
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,820
what I told you.

251
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,660
Make sure no one harms Her Highness.

252
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,540
Alright. It's settled, then.

253
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,060
By the way,

254
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
if you need to see Her Highness again,

255
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,220
just send word.

256
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,260
Don't climb walls.

257
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,500
But I have a feeling

258
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,180
you were using me tonight.

259
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,260
So, now,

260
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,100
we're even.

261
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,500
We are.

262
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,740
Her Highness noticed
you seemed to enjoy

263
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,780
the pastries on the table.

264
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,140
She had this prepared

265
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,060
for you to take home.

266
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,580
Thank you.

267
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,540
Wen Yun?

268
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,580
Thank you, Mr. Xue,

269
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,700
for showing her the way.

270
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,780
I remember the way out.

271
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,900
Thank you, but no need to see us out.

272
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,540
To the outside world,

273
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,420
I favor Hanmei

274
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,980
(Eight Characters)
for his looks

275
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,420
and talent.

276
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,100
No one could possibly know

277
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,660
he would have found his way
into my heart

278
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,740
even without the looks

279
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
or the talent.

280
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,100
No.

281
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,260
No.

282
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,500
Don't.

283
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,860
Don't be scared.

284
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,500
I'm here.

285
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,940
I'm here with you.

286
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,020
Your Highness,

287
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,820
shall I stay with you

288
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,940
throughout the night?

289
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,660
Once someone of the royal family

290
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
was involved in a fight for the throne,

291
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,540
it would be a tragedy.

292
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,540
Fortunately, Mr. Xue had medical skills

293
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,500
and healed all your scars.

294
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,340
He healed more

295
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,420
than just the scars.

296
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,740
Do you actually believe

297
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,020
the excuse

298
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
Mrs. Wei gave?

299
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,100
Chu Yu never seeks me out

300
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,620
unless she wants something.

301
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,580
This time, she even climbed in.

302
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,740
And her acting was terrible.

303
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,220
If you didn't believe her,

304
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,780
why did you agree

305
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,700
to her auction banquet?

306
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,580
Chu Yu is intriguing.

307
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,660
I'm also curious to see

308
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,420
what she's going to do.

309
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,180
And besides,

310
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,540
I do need a banquet like that.

311
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
We'll enjoy the show.

312
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,140
Mrs. Wei is certainly one of a kind.

313
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,860
I had no idea

314
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,660
you and she

315
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,180
were so close.

316
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,900
Right under my nose,

317
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,060
the two of you made eyes.

318
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,260
What?

319
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,540
Are you

320
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,180
having an interest

321
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,020
in this special lady?

322
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Are you angry again?

323
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,780
You're free

324
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,940
to like anyone you choose.

325
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,540
I'm the Eldest Princess.

326
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,060
Must I bind you to me?

327
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,580
Right.

328
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,820
You're right, Your Highness.

329
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,860
It's entirely my freedom

330
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,540
to choose which woman I favor.

331
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,060
What's so funny?

332
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,020
When I offered to let you go with her,

333
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,900
you refused.

334
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,460
If you really meant it,

335
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,700
I would have no choice but to obey.

336
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,140
After all,

337
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,940
I'm merely a follower.

338
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,940
Get out!

339
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,980
As you wish.

340
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,060
I'll take my leave.

341
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,300
You're really leaving.

342
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,060
Now, you're obedient.

343
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,540
Why the long face?

344
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,500
Because I didn't tell you?

345
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,700
I knew you would come,

346
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,220
but why did you start with Xue Hanmei?

347
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,500
If there's a problem

348
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,820
with one of those followers,

349
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,940
I should start

350
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,820
with an acquaintance.

351
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,860
But Xue Hanmei

352
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,820
isn't an acquaintance.

353
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,020
What if he's the one

354
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,940
who has a problem?

355
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,500
You're being strange.

356
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,940
I...

357
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,220
You...

358
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
You could just speak.

359
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Why did you move over?

360
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,260
And you...

361
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,820
You touched me.

362
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,420
Just a gentle stroke.

363
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,740
You look a bit pale.

364
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,980
Do you feel unwell?

365
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,100
Really unwell?

366
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,340
Then tell me what's wrong.

367
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,660
Tell me about it.

368
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,780
Come on. You can whisper.

369
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,500
Sit back there,

370
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
and I won't be angry.

371
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,860
Who said you were angry?

372
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,420
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

373
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,820
Xiaoqi,

374
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,740
are you here for me?

375
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,460
You cute little thing.

376
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,220
Chu Yu,

377
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,300
give it a new name, will you?

378
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,260
I think Xiaoqi is a good name.

379
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,140
Right, puppy?

380
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,060
If my brother were still alive,

381
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,380
would you really marry him?

382
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,980
Why did you ask

383
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,500
such a weird question?

384
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,300
If...

385
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,940
I mean, if.

386
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,980
Your brother was one of the best men

387
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,380
in this world.

388
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,820
If he were alive,

389
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,740
he might have met another girl.

390
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
But in this world,

391
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,820
there are no "ifs".

392
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,380
What should I bring
to the auction banquet?

393
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,660
How about I bring you?

394
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,740
I won't give you up.

395
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,700
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

396
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,060
Be with me.

397
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,740
If you refuse,

398
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,860
I'll tell everyone

399
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,380
that you're trying to hit on me.

400
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,580
What scares you?

401
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,420
Does this mean

402
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,740
you like me?

403
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,540
I don't like you.

404
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,740
If you don't like me,

405
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,860
why would you hide

406
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,060
my bell?

407
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,820
If you don't like me,

408
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,100
why would you get jealous

409
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,980
when you saw me

410
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,860
talk to another man?

411
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,580
If you don't like me,

412
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,580
why can't you even look at me now?

413
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,460
Back in the Spring Breeze House,

414
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,300
you were the first man I saw.

415
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,580
I know you like me.

416
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Am I right?

417
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,020
Wei Yun.

418
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,220
Why would I have a dream like that?

419
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,220
Wei Yun,

420
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,100
how could you do this?

421
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,540
No.

422
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,020
Nothing happened between them.

423
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,420
What if I do it anyway?

424
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,500
(Qinxi Valley)

425
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,580
Ms. Chu Jin.

426
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,300
Ms. Chu Jin,

427
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,660
I thought you wouldn't come.

428
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,420
Thank you for the invitation.

429
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,260
It's your first invitation.

430
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,660
Of course I'd come.

431
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,420
Ms. Chu Jin.

432
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,140
Wenchang,

433
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
you're quite active.

434
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,860
When you don't even know love,

435
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,700
you won't understand.

436
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,540
She's the prettiest woman in town.

437
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,700
If I didn't move,

438
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,020
someone else would.

439
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,140
Why isn't General Chu here?

440
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,220
My brother is too busy with work

441
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,860
to come here.

442
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
That makes sense.

443
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,060
General Chu is a quiet man

444
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,620
and he doesn't like noisy places.

445
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,820
Oh, Ms. Chu Jin.

446
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,060
I've got a certain herb

447
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
that is good for General Chu's health.

448
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,620
I was wondering when I could deliver it.

449
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,220
Since we've met now,

450
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,060
please take it to him.

451
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,020
You certainly care about him.

452
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,700
Allow me to thank you on his behalf.

453
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,420
Quan'er.

454
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,420
Yes, My Lady.

455
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,780
This is for the herb.

456
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,140
If it's not enough,

457
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,860
I'll pay the rest another day.

458
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,100
You get me wrong.

459
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,020
That's not what I mean.

460
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,180
I'm just concerned

461
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,380
about General Chu's health.

462
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,860
I can't take the money.

463
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,900
You must take it.

464
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,300
Ms. Chu Jin,

465
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,020
I'm not helping General Chu

466
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,740
to earn any money.

467
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,660
You can reject it,

468
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,780
but I must give you some.

469
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,700
I can't take this.

470
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,020
Please, take it.

471
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,180
Ms. Chu Jin, take it back.

472
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,020
- What happened?
- Take it.

473
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,170
- Weren't they fine?
- No.

474
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,580
- Ms. Chu Jin.
- Please, take it.

475
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,500
It's been a moment.

476
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,580
Why are you arguing?

477
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,180
Ms. Chu Jin misunderstood me.

478
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,380
She insists on paying me

479
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,420
for General Chu.

480
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,980
I can't take the money.

481
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,340
It's my rule.

482
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,220
I never take anything I don't deserve.

483
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,340
And it's right when a patient

484
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
pays for his treatment.

485
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,340
Miss Song, please, just take it.

486
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,020
Mrs. Wei is here.

487
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,020
She looks gorgeous.

488
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,780
The Marquis of Zhenguo

489
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,060
is really wealthy.

490
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Her clothes

491
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,620
and jewels

492
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,860
are all exquisite.

493
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,380
I hadn't noticed before,

494
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,220
but today, she looks stunning.

495
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,300
Ms. Chu Yu,

496
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,340
you look gorgeous.

497
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,020
Are you saying

498
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,540
I wasn't gorgeous before?

499
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,860
You know

500
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,020
that's not what I mean.

501
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,180
I certainly know.

502
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,180
Jin.

503
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,980
Did you come with Linyang?

504
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,740
Ms. Chu Jin.

505
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,420
Here.

506
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,660
What is this, Mr. Song?

507
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
It's the auction banquet.

508
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,380
I know

509
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,940
you must have many treasures.

510
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,860
But since you're my guest,

511
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,900
I should prepare one for you.

512
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,220
So,

513
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,460
it's the birthday gift

514
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,500
I received last year.

515
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,140
Ms. Chu Jin,

516
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,380
hope you'll like it.

517
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,380
I thought you might think

518
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,020
I didn't have any treasures.

519
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,020
Not at all.

520
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,820
I invited you.

521
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,340
So, I wouldn't let you pay.

522
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,780
That's just good hospitality.

523
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,980
It's my rule, too.

524
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,320
Your literary talent has improved.

525
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,940
So has yours, Chang.

526
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,650
The color you used last time was nice.

527
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,230
Yeah.

528
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,070
You flatter me.

529
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,870
Glad you like it.

530
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,540
Of course. Let's go.

531
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,260
Gu...

532
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,120
It's a really nice place.

533
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,820
Yeah. The view over there is good, too.

534
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,580
It's too hot.

535
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,340
General Yao.

536
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,780
Mrs. Wei.

537
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,620
I've heard a lot about you.

538
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,340
I heard in the Battle of Baidi Valley,

539
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,260
you fought fearlessly,

540
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,180
regardless of life.

541
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,540
And you were wounded.

542
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,500
It's a blessing for our nation

543
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,580
to have a patriot like you.

544
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,420
I also saw how you knelt

545
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,340
in front of the palace gate all night.

546
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,460
You're extraordinary

547
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,980
just as people say.

548
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,340
Where is Young Marquis?

549
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,700
I was too busy working

550
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,220
to attend his succession banquet

551
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,380
or congratulate him.

552
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,700
I only had some gifts sent.

553
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,340
This time, I'm hoping

554
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,580
to congratulate him in person.

555
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,260
Yao Yong won't reject

556
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,980
Her Highness's invitation.

557
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,220
So, he will be there.

558
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,860
In that case,

559
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,300
let's split up.

560
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,740
One of us stalls Yao Yong at the banquet

561
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,020
while the other sneaks into his house

562
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,220
for some evidence.

563
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,500
Be very careful

564
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,500
during the banquet.

565
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,220
Don't have a problem with him.

566
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,740
Why do I have to be there?

567
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,380
I fight as well as you.

568
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,540
You didn't tell me before you

569
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,500
sneaked in there.

570
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,060
So, on this matter,

571
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,180
I have the final say.

572
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,180
Fine.

573
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,020
Since we can't agree,

574
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,060
let's leave our luck

575
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,900
in the hands of fate.

576
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,700
Coin toss.

577
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,980
Heads, you'll go. Tails, I'll go.

578
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,180
Deal?

579
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,700
(Yuanle Coin)

580
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,900
We had a deal.

581
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,020
Heads.

582
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,340
(Yao Mansion)
I'll go to the Yao's.

583
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,820
How could a marquis like you

584
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,100
even cheat?

585
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,380
Thanks for your concern.

586
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,620
Wen Yun

587
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,580
is also busy working today.

588
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,260
Once he's done,

589
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
he will come.

590
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,580
Send word to my family.

591
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,740
Yes.

592
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,580
General Yao.

593
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,020
Are you leaving already?

594
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,940
I have a family emergency.

595
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,340
I'm too worried to stay.

596
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,420
I have to go.

597
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,300
Her Highness hasn't arrived yet.

598
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,660
Is it appropriate

599
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,900
for you to leave now?

600
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,260
The Eldest Princess is here.

601
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,900
Think about it.

602
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,500
Now that you're here,

603
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,020
if you leave now,

604
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:11,980
you will ruin

605
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,620
Her Highness's mood.

606
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,220
Master is out today.

607
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,740
The two of you must stay alert.

608
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,580
No one enters the study.

609
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,180
If anything happens,

610
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,660
let me know immediately.

611
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,420
(Wise and Wily)
Yes.

612
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,100
Don't you remember

613
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,940
his warning?

614
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,020
Crows like shiny things.

615
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,340
They usually steal silver.

616
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,340
It will be fine.

617
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,340
If you don't go, I'll get it all.

618
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,460
Here's some more.

619
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,660
That's a lot.

620
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,500
- Go.
- Come on.

621
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,420
(Wise and Wily)

622
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,740
Greetings, Your Highness.

623
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,980
Rise.

624
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,780
Sit.

625
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

626
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,820
All of you are

627
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,020
either nobles

628
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,500
or high-ranking officials.

629
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,260
I stated why I would

630
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,660
hold this auction banquet

631
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,700
on the invitation.

632
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,800
Since you're here,

633
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,500
you must be prepared.

634
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,500
I don't need to say more.

635
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,540
Hanmei.

636
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,740
The first item is from Her Highness.

637
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,220
This is a white jade ring.

638
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,860
It looks smooth

639
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,060
and shiny.

640
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,300
Truly priceless.

641
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,220
It was from His Majesty.

642
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,420
The one and only throughout the nation.

643
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,980
Her Highness did her part.

644
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,100
Let's see what you will offer.

645
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,220
(This is from His Majesty.)

646
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,780
(Who would dare to bid?)

647
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,820
Since nobody wants

648
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,420
to be the first bidder,

649
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,740
I will

650
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,180
start you off.

651
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,980
I bid 100 taels

652
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,340
for this jade ring.

653
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,180
No one else bids

654
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,380
for this white jade ring.

655
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,140
So, it's sold for 100 taels.

656
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,460
Congratulations, Your Highness.

657
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,220
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

658
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,980
A gear lock.

659
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,340
I can open it.

660
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,580
When?

661
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,100
In a quarter.

662
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,620
You truly are awesome, Mrs. Wei.

663
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,380
You're brave enough to pioneer

664
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,940
and you have a sincere

665
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,100
and devoted heart.

666
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,340
You flatter me.

667
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,980
General Yao.

668
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,780
You went to the battlefront.

669
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,820
You must know

670
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,460
about the hard life of border soldiers.

671
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,500
I wonder

672
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,940
what treasure

673
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,820
you're going to offer.

674
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,980
How about I buy your dagger

675
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,500
with 80 taels?

676
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,740
What do you say?

677
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,860
Thank you, General Yao.

678
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,180
80 taels.

679
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,020
Sold.

680
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,300
General,

681
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,620
did you really not bring anything?

682
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,860
It's generous of you.

683
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,620
It's halfway through.

684
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,140
You may take a break.

685
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,740
Get my carriage to the gate.

686
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,780
We're going back.

687
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,860
Yes.

688
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,340
Help! An assassin!

689
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,340
North Qi assassin!

690
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,620
That's Ms. Chu Yu's voice.

691
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,020
Assassin? Where?

692
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,580
Such audacity!

693
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,060
Seal this place.

694
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,220
Yes.

695
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,340
How dare you?

696
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,060
The assassin ran back there.

697
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,100
Stay put.

698
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,740
Gu.

699
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,220
I'll lead some guards to get him.

700
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,540
I'll join him.

701
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,620
Granted.

702
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,780
Your Highness, there's an assassin.

703
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,620
My Lady.

704
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,780
Your Highness, an assassin sneaked in.

705
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,140
He was using a scimitar,

706
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,660
the kind only the North Qi people use.

707
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,420
That's a lie!

708
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,260
(Yao Yong secretly keeps weapons.)

709
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,420
General sent word back.

710
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,620
Wei Yun might be in here.

711
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,460
Only the study is unchecked.

712
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,820
Close in on it.

713
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,860
Don't let them run away.

714
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,020
(Wise and Wily)

715
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,980
Just now in the yard, I saw with my eyes

716
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,220
that you cut

717
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
your own arm.

718
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,780
Is that true?

719
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,780
Why would I do that?

720
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,940
Ms. Wang, did you see it wrong?

721
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,100
I swear I didn't.

722
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,420
And I swear

723
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,140
I saw what happened

724
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,940
and I'm telling the absolute truth.

725
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,460
Otherwise...

726
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,500
Otherwise, may I

727
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,460
be struck dead.

728
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,180
If Ms. Wang is telling the truth,

729
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,460
does that mean Mrs. Wei

730
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,740
made up the assassin story

731
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,100
to make people suspect

732
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,300
that Her Highness

733
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,580
is colluding with the North Qi?

734
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
We'll know

735
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,980
if Mrs. Wei was assassinated

736
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,780
after she's examined.

737
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,420
You used to be a physician.

738
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,020
Go check on her

739
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,220
and prove her innocence.

740
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,900
Yes.

741
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,660
General Yao, you're overstepping.

742
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,860
Since when

743
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,140
are you the master

744
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,500
of this place?

745
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,940
Why do you have the final say?

746
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,300
Your Highness,

747
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,300
I wouldn't dare.

748
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,620
I just want you to be safe.

749
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,260
And who do you think you are?

750
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,780
How can you be a physician

751
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,620
as he says you are?

752
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,780
Who can vouch for you?

753
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,260
Your Highness,

754
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,860
he went to battles with me.

755
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:55,720
There, I...

756
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,820
You want to vouch for your man,

757
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,780
no problem.

758
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,280
Then why do you

759
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,620
have to doubt

760
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,580
what Mrs. Wei says?

761
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,300
And besides,

762
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,860
he's a strange man.

763
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,140
How could he check on her?

764
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
General Yao,

765
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,100
what are you actually up to?

766
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,980
It was thoughtless of me.

767
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
Please summon an imperial physician

768
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,580
to examine Mrs. Wei.

769
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,380
Don't bother.

770
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,460
Tuantuan.

771
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,180
Yes, Your Highness.

772
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,940
Oh, no.

773
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,220
Let's go.

774
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,060
After him.

775
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,020
It's a cut of a dagger, not a scimitar.

776
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,140
That assassin was vicious.

777
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,060
Her wound is very long,

778
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,940
just like a red crescent moon.

779
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,060
It's a deep cut and looks dreadful.

780
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,300
He must have

781
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,660
stabbed her with great force.

782
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,940
Your Highness,

783
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,300
you need to figure out

784
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,780
how that assassin sneaked in here

785
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,740
and why he tried to kill Ms. Chu Yu.

786
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,900
Someone dared to kill

787
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,580
in broad daylight.

788
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,020
He was being outrageous.

789
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,260
How come?

790
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,660
You were always so fierce, weren't you?

791
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,740
Why did you get hurt this time?

792
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:50,980
