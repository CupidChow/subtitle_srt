21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,710
I'm begging you, Wen Yun.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,790
Wake up.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,960
Wen Yun.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,120
How do you feel?

25
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,280
Since when

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
did you become so chatty?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,080
Just for the people?

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Of course.

29
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,080
What else could it be for?

30
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,590
What if it was for you?

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,750
It was certainly for me.

32
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,360
If something happened to you,

33
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,120
what would I tell your family?

34
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,000
And I'd be seen as a traitor to the nation.

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Don't worry.

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm not going to die that easily

37
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,310
before I've had my revenge.

38
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,590
And for you,

39
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,750
I must survive.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
What do we do?

41
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,310
We tracked all this way

42
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,750
but have found no trace.

43
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,630
Only this cliff is unsearched.

44
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,630
They couldn't have
jumped down, could they?

45
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,920
There's a waterway down below.

46
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
Her Ladyship knows that.

47
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,680
Maybe too many pursuers were running

48
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,560
after the two of them.

49
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,760
Jumping is risky,

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,430
but it's possible they survived.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
Wanyue,

52
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,240
that's Young Marquis Wei Yun.

53
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,920
He always moves carefully.

54
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,510
Why would he risk their lives?

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
Strategies vary.

56
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,540
His Lordship

57
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,510
isn't opinionated.

58
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,270
That's right.

59
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,800
General,

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
we've checked everywhere.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We found no other traces.

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
Any good idea, Commander Lu?

63
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
General Chu,

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
you're clever.

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,200
Let's go.

66
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,160
Don't worry.

67
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm clever enough

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,870
to handle all of this.

69
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
I promise I'll bring them back

70
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,960
safe and sound.

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Look at this.

72
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,950
A compass?

73
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,160
You have fine taste.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,160
But this compass

75
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
I designed

76
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,720
is quite different from ordinary ones.

77
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
As people say,

78
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,750
harmony brings good fortune,

79
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
while discord

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,560
brings ruin.

81
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
Watch carefully.

82
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,510
The compass needle

83
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,240
isn't moving erratically.

84
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,270
That means...

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,270
There's no evil around.

86
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
No need to worry, guys.

87
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,040
Go check over there.

88
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
Weird stuff.

89
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,110
General,

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
what should we do next?

91
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,880
Search carefully.

92
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
The needle...

93
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,960
I...

94
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
Well...

95
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,160
It's moving erratically.

96
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
But you all heard

97
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,560
what Wanyue just said.

98
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,160
There's rushing water down below.

99
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,040
Maybe they will land...

100
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,270
On their feet.

101
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,710
Wanyue,

102
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
you know this area best.

103
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,560
Lead the way down.

104
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,270
Yes.

105
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,350
Let's go.

106
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,600
I have a new idea.

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
What?

108
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,960
General Chu, wait for me.

109
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,760
Wen Yun.

110
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,510
Wen Yun, you can't sleep.

111
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,160
You must stay awake.

112
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
Hang in there.

113
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
How about you talk to me? Alright?

114
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
Let's talk.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,960
- Careful.
- Alright.

116
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,670
Be careful.

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,360
If you have nothing to say,

118
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,360
then I will ask.

119
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,720
You can't cook.

120
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,510
But your grilled fish

121
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,350
tasted great.

122
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Learned from your father?

123
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,440
Of course.

124
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,960
When we were at the border,

125
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,840
we couldn't have any meat

126
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
until the Spring Festival.

127
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,270
So,

128
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,630
my father caught fish in the river

129
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,870
and forbade everyone else

130
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,200
from taking my food.

131
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,480
Gradually,

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,030
I learned from him

133
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,360
how to roast fish.

134
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,200
I couldn't do that as well as he.

135
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,630
But tell me.

136
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,720
Did that fish taste great?

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
Of course.

138
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,630
It was so tasty.

139
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,600
You're like your father.

140
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,960
He said the same thing.

141
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,960
According to my father,

142
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,510
I was most like him

143
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
among all his children.

144
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,350
How?

145
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,840
I have no ambitions, just like him.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,510
All I want is peace and quiet,

147
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,630
so I can live a simple,

148
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,720
carefree life.

149
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I remember my father asked me

150
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,360
whether I wanted to get married

151
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,840
or do something else.

152
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,630
I told him

153
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,960
I would find a place

154
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,720
that few people knew.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,960
There was natural beauty

156
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,240
and fine weather.

157
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,550
A house would shelter me from the rain.

158
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,030
A yard would allow me
to gaze at the stars.

159
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,960
Regular meals would be enough.

160
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
Now,

161
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,750
I also want Xiaoqi to be around.

162
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,480
Xiaoqi?

163
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,150
It's a cute puppy

164
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,360
and doesn't bark.

165
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,510
It also helps me shoo away sparrows.

166
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Adorable, isn't it?

167
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
Oh, yeah, the puppy.

168
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,510
Or...

169
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,270
Or what?

170
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,350
Yu.

171
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,320
I like you.

172
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,270
I warned myself not to.

173
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,960
But I just can't help

174
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,840
loving you.

175
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,480
Actually, most of the time,

176
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm jealous of the puppy

177
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,200
named Xiaoqi.

178
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,150
I never dared to say it.

179
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,630
But under the circumstances,

180
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
I have to tell you.

181
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,270
Then, even if I die,

182
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,360
I won't have regrets.

183
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,240
I want to be a part

184
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,200
of your future.

185
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,990
Yu.

186
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
Please tell me.

187
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720

How do you feel?

209
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,720
Great. Your fever is gone.

210
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,350
The sun is out.

211
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,720
So, the rain stopped.

212
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,480
Come on. Let's go out.

213
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,000
I need to get you a physician.

214
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,230
Come on.

215
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Your leg hurts, right?

216
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,110
Then...

217
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,040
Who's there?

218
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,750
Well,

219
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,590
don't be scared.

220
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm not a bad person.

221
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,750
And you are...?

222
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,510
I'm from a nearby village.

223
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,720
My name is Shen.

224
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,030
This forest is very remote.

225
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,270
Few people come here.

226
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,070
Compared to me,

227
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,510
strangers like you

228
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,350
seems more suspicious.

229
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,590
We are...

230
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,400
My wife Yu and I

231
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,760
are from Qingzhou.

232
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,880
We were on our way
to see relatives in Huajing City.

233
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,590
When we were passing Pingjin Cliff,

234
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,440
we encountered some bandits

235
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,720
who were killing and robbing.

236
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
They robbed us

237
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,200
of all our belongings

238
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,270
and even pushed us off the cliff.

239
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,150
Luckily,

240
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,030
we fell into the pool

241
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,640
and barely survived.

242
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,920
But my leg was hurt.

243
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,680
I wonder if there's a physician

244
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,670
in your village.

245
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,830
How about you go to my house

246
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,070
and figure it out?

247
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,160
Lady Yu,

248
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,680
please remove the bandage

249
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
from your husband's wound

250
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,270
and let me check the condition.

251
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,800
Don't move.

252
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,070
Why is it so severely bruised?

253
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,960
Don't worry too much.

254
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,960
The wound is just too deep.

255
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
Fortunately, the bleeding

256
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,640
stopped in time.

257
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,440
The bruises look horrible,

258
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,590
but his leg can be saved.

259
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,070
If the treatment was delayed,

260
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,400
your husband couldn't survive

261
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,350
unless his lower leg was amputated.

262
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,950
Ms. Shen,

263
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,880
my wife is delicate.

264
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,640
Please don't scare her.

265
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,390
Don't move.

266
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,070
I'm just a villager,

267
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,440
but I've seen

268
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,280
a more severe wound.

269
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,480
Without timely treatment,

270
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,000
that man lost his lower leg.

271
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,750
I know.

272
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,440
You don't want your wife to be worried.

273
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,590
But if you refuse

274
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,590
to receive treatment,

275
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,790
your minor injury

276
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,840
will end up serious.

277
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,200
Ms. Shen,

278
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,960
is there a cure?

279
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,510
I know a massage technique

280
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,240
to unblock the congested blood vessels.

281
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,590
With good blood flow,

282
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,750
his leg would be all right.

283
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,830
It sounds simple.

284
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,750
But...

285
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,590
It's all right.

286
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,920
Do we need

287
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,200
some rare herbs?

288
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,430
Tell me.

289
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,110
I will get them

290
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,200
at whatever cost.

291
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,550
It takes a lot of effort

292
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,160
to clear the blockage.

293
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,960
It takes a lot of strength.

294
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,750
Two hours is needed for a day.

295
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,760
And it must be done

296
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,160
for several consecutive days.

297
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,400
If you want to try,

298
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,200
I will teach your wife

299
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,160
how to massage.

300
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,640
You'll massage your husband.

301
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
My wife is weak

302
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,240
and has little strength.

303
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,830
Ms. Shen, you must know

304
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,000
some men in your village.

305
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,240
Please invite someone

306
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,080
to massage me.

307
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,110
I'll pay him well.

308
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,920
The massage therapy

309
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,270
will take more than a day.

310
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,030
No one else

311
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,590
can help you as handily as Lady Yu.

312
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,240
Besides,

313
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,960
your leg is a private part.

314
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,270
If a stranger massages you,

315
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,240
he'd feel awkward,

316
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,830
even if you are a man.

317
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,830
You're a couple, anyway.

318
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,270
You've been intimate before.

319
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,510
No need to be shy.

320
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,400
Right.

321
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,550
You're right, Ms. Shen.

322
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
No one

323
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,920
will take care of him

324
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,760
like I will.

325
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,310
You teach me, then.

326
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,350
Alright.

327
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,000
I... Umm...

328
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,030
Let's get in there.

329
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,870
Alright.

330
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,790
You have a great memory.

331
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,270
You picked it up so quickly.

332
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,680
In that case,

333
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,520
I'll be going then.

334
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,200
Today, massage him for another hour.

335
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,400
Do it for a few days

336
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,830
and your husband's leg

337
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,790
will be all right.

338
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,720
Thank you, Ms. Shen.

339
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,830
So, you pretended it didn't hurt.

340
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,350
Who said that?

341
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,270
It's just hot in here.

342
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,350
Are you in pain?

343
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,800
No.

344
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,760
No?

345
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
Why can't you feel anything?

346
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,080
Don't worry.

347
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,310
Even if I were to lose my leg,

348
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,480
I would still be a great man.

349
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,920
What are you talking about?

350
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,160
That's not what worries me.

351
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,960
I fear I may massage you wrongly.

352
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,640
If you really lose this leg,

353
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,960
what will you do?

354
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,830
Well, in that case,

355
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,030
I'd still be the marquis

356
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,880
who had no ambitions.

357
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,920
I'd take you to Sishui

358
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,310
and stay there as a local gentry.

359
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,560
Don't be ridiculous.

360
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,240
By then,

361
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,440
no one would want to marry you.

362
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,160
I never planned on marrying anyone.

363
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,830
I just want you around.

364
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,310
How about you feed me?

365
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,960
For a lifetime.

366
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,310
We'll bring the rest of the family.

367
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,480
Xiaoqi will go, too.

368
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,720
I think we can

369
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,790
all stay there

370
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,190
as local celebrities.

371
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,070
You have no ambition at all.

372
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,070
No one would even believe it.

373
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,160
I won't let it go

374
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
until I see Yao Yong dead.

375
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,350
That guy lurked

376
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,200
in Huajing City for many years.

377
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,310
He has powerful backers.

378
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,680
If we hadn't found

379
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,520
enough clues,

380
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,720
those people would

381
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,070
have devoured Huajing City.

382
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
When we go back,

383
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,030
we must uncover his backers.

384
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,720
He was so treacherous
even in the capital

385
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,790
and killed so many people.

386
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,680
I must kill him myself.

387
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,030
So far,

388
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,790
this village seems safe.

389
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,400
Later, I'll think of a way

390
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,720
to send word to my brother

391
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,200
and reassure him.

392
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
Tomorrow...

393
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,440
Tomorrow, we'll go back.

394
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,920
Actually, I think

395
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,000
that's enough for today.

396
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,920
I feel much better.

397
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,920
Yeah. I also think

398
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,200
that's enough time.

399
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,110
You should get some rest.

400
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
I'll go get you some food.

401
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,240
Yeah. It will get my strength back.

402
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,840
Alright.

403
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,590
Chu Yu,

404
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,070
what on earth

405
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,480
were you thinking of?

406
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,750
That was treatment.

407
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,000
You were helping Wen Yun.

408
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,000
Ms. Shen.

409
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,350
So, you can not only hunt

410
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
but also fish.

411
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,270
Madam Wang next door

412
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,110
asked me to fix this.

413
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,000
Her husband and son died at a young age.

414
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,110
Usually,

415
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,640
she makes a living by fishing

416
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,550
in the river out there.

417
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,590
Fish in that river are small.

418
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,240
Other nets aren't available.

419
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,790
So, every time the net is torn,

420
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,200
I'll mend it for her.

421
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,240
Such a talent, Ms. Shen.

422
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,550
Did you make all these things, too?

423
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,070
Oh, these things.

424
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,790
My husband Cui made them.

425
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,040
Look.

426
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,550
He made this dustpan

427
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,830
for Mr. Li.

428
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,910
He made this chair

429
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,200
for Madam Lin.

430
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,720
And that one...

431
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,350
Look.

432
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,590
With so many things around,

433
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,440
I just can't remember.

434
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,200
Many old people

435
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
live in this village.

436
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,000
Very few villagers are of my age.

437
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,830
So, we help them

438
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,110
as much as we can.

439
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,160
What about their families?

440
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,270
They're not here?

441
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,110
They joined the army.

442
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,880
There have been wars.

443
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,680
Soldiers are from almost every family.

444
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,310
If Cui's leg...

445
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,400
He would also be on the battlefield.

446
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,070
So, Mr. Cui is the man

447
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,000
who was amputated?

448
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,830
Sorry, I...

449
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,870
It's fine.

450
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,920
Neighbors help each other.

451
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,070
That's not just in our village.

452
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,790
It's more common in border towns.

453
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,030
Their fathers, brothers, and sons

454
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,030
are heroes who fought

455
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,350
to defend our nation.

456
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,270
Cui and I feel happy

457
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,110
when we can help them.

458
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,150
Before,

459
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,510
North Qi didn't take

460
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,920
three cities from our nation.

461
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,820
Qingzhou and Fengling City

462
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,400
didn't use to be border areas.

463
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,680
Huajing City was relatively safe, too.

464
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,960
But now...

465
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,070
People won't be happy

466
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,590
unless the war finally ends.

467
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,040
It will end.

468
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,680
It will someday.

469
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,920
How's your husband's leg?

470
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,400
I massaged him,

471
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,200
and I think it helped.

472
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,830
Oh, Ms. Shen.

473
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,920
Is there a way to send a message

474
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
to the town?

475
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,920
We're leaving tomorrow.

476
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,880
But he has difficulty walking.

477
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,240
So, I want to send word

478
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,200
to my relatives in town

479
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
and ask them to meet us.

480
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,280
There is a way.

481
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,200
But your husband's leg

482
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,070
hasn't recovered.

483
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,200
He needs to rest for days.

484
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,720
And there has been bad weather lately.

485
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,750
If his wound gets wet

486
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,920
in the rain,

487
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,310
it could get worse.

488
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,110
Actually, our village is remote enough.

489
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,030
Those bandits won't come here.

490
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,030
Why don't you stay here

491
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,110
until his leg recovers?

492
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,750
We can never

493
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,590
be too careful.

494
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,200
The bandits want money.

495
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,350
When they fail

496
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,680
to get anything valuable here,

497
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,000
they will leave.

498
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,160
You don't need to worry.

499
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,720
Feel free to stay here.

500
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,080
In that case,

501
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,240
we'll gladly accept your help.

502
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,350
This way.

503
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,390
The grilled fish

504
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,920
is my father's special dish.

505
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,240
It must be Yu who made it.

506
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,830
It must be her.

507
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,280
What did I say?

508
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,070
See?

509
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,790
I told you my compass

510
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,720
would help.

511
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Don't worry.

512
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,200
The two of them must be alive.

513
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,920
We'll keep searching for them

514
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,790
along the waterway.

515
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,640
Soon, we'll find them.

516
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,480
Let's go.

517
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,510
Trust me

518
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,440
and I'll solve all your problems.

519
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,520
Yun,

520
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,030
how does your leg feel?

521
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,350
It's... It's alright.

522
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,520
What did I say?

523
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,750
You're young.

524
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,240
You must have great recuperative powers.

525
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,550
I'll be relieved, then.

526
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,630
Shen,

527
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,640
I'm back.

528
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,750
They...

529
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,920
Are we having some guests?

530
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,510
This is Lady Yu

531
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,400
and her husband Yun.

532
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,720
Don't worry.

533
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,560
They're not bad guys.

534
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,720
Be seated.

535
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,000
Sit, please.

536
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,270
Let me guess,

537
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,550
Shen brought you back, right?

538
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,070
She's always a woman

539
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,630
beautiful and good-hearted.

540
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,070
She can't bear the trouble.

541
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,510
She always does her best

542
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,960
to help people in need.

543
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,070
That's right.

544
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,190
You must be Mr. Cui.

545
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,880
Ms. Shen just mentioned you.

546
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,880
She was so helpful

547
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,720
that she saved us.

548
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,920
We're very grateful.

549
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,680
What are you talking about?

550
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,350
You must be tired.

551
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,190
Today, you can rarely drink.

552
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,400
Relax yourself.

553
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,240
Alright.

554
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,510
Why is the wine milk-white?

555
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,030
He brewed it himself.

556
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,870
It's not strong wine.

557
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,630
Lady Yu, can you drink?

558
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,280
Would you like some?

559
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,760
Yun is injured.

560
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,390
He won't drink, and neither will I.

561
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,070
But when the two of us

562
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,280
were in Qingzhou,

563
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,400
we heard the milk wine

564
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,880
was unique in North Qi.

565
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,110
I didn't know

566
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,360
Mr. Cui could also brew it.

567
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,280
I only know a little.

568
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,550
He isn't good
at literature or martial arts.

569
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,550
Luckily, he's good with his hands.

570
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,960
He tasted it when he was at the border.

571
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,710
So, he secretly brewed some

572
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,760
to satisfy himself.

573
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,320
He doesn't usually drink much.

574
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,160
That's right.

575
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,240
Oh, I see.

576
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,110
Like you said,

577
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,280
the two of you

578
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,960
are from Qingzhou, right?

579
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,320
Did a war start there again?

580
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,350
No.

581
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,070
We just got married.

582
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,150
So, we planned to rely on relatives

583
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,990
in Huajing City

584
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,320
and do a small business.

585
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,000
So, you just got married.

586
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,630
Come on.

587
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,070
I wouldn't know before you confessed.

588
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,840
Did I say something wrong?

589
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,200
She's a bit shy.

590
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,510
She isn't too close to me in public.

591
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,000
So, between us,

592
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,760
I'm the outgoing one.

593
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,550
Sorry for that.

594
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,870
Don't say that.

595
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,030
Let's eat.

596
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,030
- Eat.
- Come on.

597
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,870
Let's start to eat.

598
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,160
Come on.

599
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,840
Here, Lady Yu.

600
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,870
Here, Shen. Have some meat.

601
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,990
Yu.

602
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,360
No need to pretend in here.

603
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,910
What's on your mind?

604
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,960
I'm thinking

605
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,670
this room is too small.

606
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,440
There's only one bed and one quilt.

607
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,550
Tonight,

608
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,280
how are we supposed to sleep?

609
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,150
You're right.

610
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,110
I didn't notice it.

611
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,440
I'll go ask Ms. Shen

612
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,280
if there's another room.

613
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,400
What kind of newlywed couple

614
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,360
would sleep separately?

615
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,430
Besides,

616
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,110
you heard them

617
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,590
over dinner.

618
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,760
Mr. Cui

619
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,070
could brew North Qi's wine milk.

620
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
So, he's very likely

621
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,720
to be from North Qi.

622
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,920
Ms. Shen saved us.

623
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
But Mr. Cui

624
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,590
clearly doesn't believe

625
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,480
our identities.

626
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,880
It's better to be safe than sorry.

627
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,630
We should be careful.

628
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,510
I'll get an extra quilt.

629
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,320
I'll take the floor.

630
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,910
No.

631
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,280
The floor's too damp.

632
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,280
And you're injured.

633
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,150
You can't be sleeping there.

634
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,110
Also, the floor is dirty.

635
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,590
If we use the quilt on it,

636
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,320
they might figure out our secret

637
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,510
when they see it tomorrow.

638
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,510
It's fine.

639
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,710
Just one night.

640
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,280
Tomorrow, we'll get up and leave.

641
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,960
You're injured.

642
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,800
You'll use the quilt.
