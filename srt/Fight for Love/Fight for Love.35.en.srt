21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,760
I hate to see Zhang Deng like that.

22
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,070
I want to kick him.

23
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,760
We came on horseback.

24
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,070
Why is it a carriage now?

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,970
Perhaps Ms. Chu was worried

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,790
that you'd be uncomfortable
riding a horse,

27
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,760
so she asked Wanyue
to arrange a carriage.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,960
Get in.

29
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,000
Why is it broken?

30
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,590
Young Master,

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,310
I just went to relieve myself.

32
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,110
When I came back, it was like this.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm not being suspicious,

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,630
but now that you're the Chancellor,

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,120
someone is bound to be envious.

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,150
It wasn't me.

37
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,270
Don't worry.

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,750
If it were Wei Qiu,

39
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,010
he wouldn't have been so gentle.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
You'd have lost the carriage

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,030
and shafts.

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,150
How about this?

43
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,590
I'll give you a ride.

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,920
Sure.

45
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,270
You're so kind.

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,470
How can I refuse?

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,310
Zhang Deng, you go back.

48
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,280
Your Lordship, Chancellor Gu.

49
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,270
Please.

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,030
These are all carefully prepared

51
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,680
by Ms. Chu for His Lordship.

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,520
Even these minor details

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,870
were personally taken care of.

54
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,550
When I get back,

55
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,400
I'll thank Yu properly.

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,400
I like everything she prepared.

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
Chancellor Gu,

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
you'll have to bear with me

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,280
and follow my preferences.

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,590
It's Zisun tea.

61
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,450
Would you like to try some?

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,240
No need.

63
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,690
I'm not used to this tea.

64
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,750
Let me see what else is prepared.

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,950
I have unique tastes.

67
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,160
If there's nothing

68
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,720
that suits your taste...

69
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,560
Just drink more water.

70
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,370
You don't need to put on a show

71
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,290
in front of me.

72
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,360
You've given up the power

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,810
that comes with being second to none,

74
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,120
and you can't marry Yu

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,070
in this life.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,430
It's all in vain.

77
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,480
I feel sorry for you.

78
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,830
Now, you are truly

79
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,680
second to none.

80
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,750
So, you should focus more

81
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,830
on the people.

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,630
As you wish.

83
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,600
I won't stoop to your level.

84
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,190
As long

85
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,830
as I have this dessert

86
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,800
prepared by her for me,

87
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,230
that's enough.

88
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,490
Since we don't see eye to eye,

89
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,970
let's just stop talking.

90
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,760
Your Lordship, look!

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,300
- So many butterflies.
- Look.

92
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,360
It's made of paper.

93
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,360
In this world,

94
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,390
only she could come up

95
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,240
with so many quirky ideas.

96
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Chancellor Gu,

97
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,030
I have to go.

98
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,270
Sorry about stopping here.

99
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,510
Xiaoqi,

100
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,390
do you think he'll like

101
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,950
the surprise I prepared for him?

102
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,270
No matter what,

103
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,680
I just hope he can be happier

104
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,790
and more at ease.

105
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,110
Isn't that right?

106
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,750
Such a grand

107
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,630
and elaborate display,

108
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,480
with so many new tricks.

109
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
You're amazing.

110
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,320
Are you pleased?

111
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,230
It's been a long time
since I laughed so heartily,

112
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,020
but I'm also afraid
that these happy days

113
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,560
won't last long.

114
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,840
Tomorrow,

115
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,790
let's visit the Duke of Hu

116
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,120
to see

117
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
if he has any solutions.

118
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,960
Caught in the whirlpool of the court,

119
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,440
we are but a cocoon.

120
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,750
It's either binding ourselves in it

121
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,200
or being shattered to pieces.

122
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,000
Fortunately, with your company,

123
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,540
I hope we can break free
and become a butterfly.

124
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,340
(Spring Breeze House)

125
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,600
Welcome, please come in.

126
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,440
Alright.

127
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,560
Today,

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,630
I should call you Chancellor Gu.

129
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,390
Gu,

130
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,980
you've brought your family

131
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,550
back into the public eye,

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,580
and you've returned

133
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,110
to the position your father once held.

134
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,040
That's not easy.

135
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
We're happy for you.

136
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,390
You two,

137
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,960
don't be formal with me.

138
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,150
Chusheng,

139
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,420
we've seen your determination

140
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,790
and ability.

141
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,440
Most importantly,

142
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,360
your courage to burn your boats

143
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,940
is truly admirable.

144
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,540
I'd be content

145
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,700
if I could clear my family's name.

146
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,820
Your family's grievances

147
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,780
have come to an end.

148
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,660
However, the current situation

149
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,220
has become very delicate.

150
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,660
How so?

151
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,880
In the battles of Qingzhou and Fengling,

152
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,980
Wei Yun made the most contribution.

153
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,260
Yet the Emperor has neglected him

154
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,780
and lost faith in him.

155
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,020
Young Marquis Wei, acting on impulse,

156
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,060
has ruined his future.

157
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,100
He's disregarded

158
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,180
the Emperor's authority.

159
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,460
The Emperor has given him a chance,

160
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,900
but he refused to grasp
this imperial favor.

161
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,060
If you say it that way,

162
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,980
the situation is indeed delicate.

163
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,040
The Emperor values the balance
between civil and military officials.

164
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
Now, with Chusheng on the civil side,

165
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,820
the military...

166
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,060
Shilan,

167
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,620
if it were you,

168
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,100
what would you do?

169
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,580
I'm willing to bear that burden.

170
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,540
(Gu Mansion)

171
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,220
Why are you here?

172
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,780
Can I have a chat with you?

173
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,900
I know that my father's safe return

174
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,060
to his hometown

175
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,900
must have been thanks

176
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,100
to your help.

177
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
Today,

178
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,580
I've come to thank you.

179
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,060
No need.

180
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,500
On the day of our divorce,

181
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,900
I promised

182
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,860
to do one thing for you.

183
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,920
This is fulfilling that promise.

184
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,780
Ms. Wang,

185
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,060
did you come here just for this?

186
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,340
Seeing you speak

187
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,980
in front of me,

188
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,740
it feels like we're back
in the old days.

189
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,540
Though

190
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,540
we are no longer married,

191
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,180
we are still old acquaintances.

192
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,300
Mr. Gu,

193
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,660
you'd at least let me
finish speaking, right?

194
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,180
We've been divorced.

195
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Unless necessary,

196
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,380
we won't meet again.

197
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,580
What about her?

198
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,220
With a single imperial decree,

199
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,700
the Emperor has forever fixed Chu Yu

200
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,140
in the position of Mrs. Wei.

201
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,780
You've calculated everything,

202
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,660
but you didn't anticipate this, right?

203
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,980
That title means

204
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,500
she can never remarry.

205
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,060
You wanted to use the Emperor

206
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,700
to break them apart,

207
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,740
but you lost her, too.

208
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,620
Cleverness has backfired.

209
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,420
Do you have anything else to say?

210
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,660
During my visit today,

211
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,340
I've said all the good

212
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,820
and bad words I wanted to say.

213
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,460
It's indeed time for me to leave.

214
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,340
I remember

215
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,300
that your birthday is coming up.

216
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,820
Chancellor Gu, I wish you

217
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,980
a long

218
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,940
and solitary life.

219
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,700
(Yifen Hall)

220
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,780
Zhao Yue is not available today,

221
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,860
so it's you who'll accompany me?

222
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,780
As someone without a title or status,

223
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,580
I'm truly honored.

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,180
Your way of treating guests

225
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,980
in North Qi is quite intriguing.

226
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,300
As a woman,

227
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,340
I naturally understand

228
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,740
the loneliness in the Palace.

229
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,300
You spend all your days here.

230
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,820
I feel sorry for you.

231
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,460
So, I came to tell you

232
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,700
some interesting stories from outside.

233
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,800
Beautiful but not seductive;

234
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,420
gorgeous but not vulgar.

235
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,740
No wonder Yue is so captivated by you.

236
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,660
Stop beating around the bush.

237
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,740
I don't think

238
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,600
that compared to handling state affairs,

239
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,140
you prefer to be here,

240
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,420
sparring with me.

241
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,700
How boring.

242
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,940
Yue's father was from Great Sui.

243
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,080
In the eyes of the people of North Qi,

244
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,680
he is less than an illegitimate child.

245
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,580
Yet no one stopped Yue

246
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,100
from ascending the throne.

247
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,900
Do you know why?

248
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,540
It's because of my support.

249
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,860
I even arranged for Yue

250
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,380
to marry two consorts

251
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,300
to stabilize his kingship.

252
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,660
Today is the day of Yue's wedding

253
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,980
with Noble Consort Chen.

254
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,980
You once seduced the Lord of Qin

255
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,060
and got

256
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,660
three cities from him.

257
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,820
As a ruler, Zhao Yue

258
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,780
also has to rely on selling his charm

259
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,860
to secure his kingdom.

260
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,060
Like mother, like son.

261
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,700
Didn't you also use

262
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
a marriage deal to secure

263
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,060
the throne

264
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
for your brother?

265
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,900
To achieve a goal,

266
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,980
I'll do anything.

267
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,980
That is my resolve.

268
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,260
I will not allow anyone

269
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,740
to stop Yue

270
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,460
from becoming an emperor.

271
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,420
Zhao Yue now needs to rely
on marriage alliances

272
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,660
to stabilize his throne,

273
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,180
which shows that your position

274
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,320
in North Qi is also unstable.

275
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,940
If you kill me,

276
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
aren't you afraid

277
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,260
that Great Sui will come after you?

278
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,740
Emperor Chunde is weak and sickly.

279
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,500
Crown Prince Li Huan is incompetent.

280
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,060
As for Wei Yun,

281
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,820
if I hadn't helped him

282
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,980
in secret,

283
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,020
how could he

284
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,220
have killed Su Can?

285
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,500
I don't kill you

286
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,060
because I don't want Yue to become

287
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,460
estranged from me because of you.

288
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,380
Moreover,

289
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,740
do you think that you still have

290
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,980
any reputation in Great Sui

291
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,820
as the Eldest Princess?

292
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,300
You are nothing

293
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,100
but a rootless duckweed.

294
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,260
You took three cities

295
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,580
from Great Sui.

296
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,020
I can also turn North Qi

297
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,700
upside down,

298
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,380
never to have peace.

299
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,420
A grand wedding, is it?

300
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,100
Your Highness, don't be sad.

301
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,820
If the King wants to be a ruler,

302
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,340
he has to pay some price.

303
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,980
His heart towards you has never changed.

304
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,580
Go tell him

305
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,700
that I'm ill.

306
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,500
What?

307
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,180
I asked you to send for him.

308
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,260
Whether he comes or not is his business,

309
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,740
but if you don't pass the message,

310
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,620
and one day he asks,

311
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,260
it will be your fault.

312
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,900
Can you bear that?

313
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,860
Zhao Yue,

314
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,300
you chose this path yourself,

315
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,740
and you must bear

316
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,100
all the consequences.

317
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,620
What's wrong with you, Changming?

318
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,700
You're fine.

319
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,500
I heard from the Queen Mother

320
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,160
that you're getting married today.

321
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,140
I haven't spoiled your joy, have I?

322
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,120
You already know everything.

323
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,740
It's tiring to talk with my head up.

324
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,020
Sit down.

325
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,780
I don't want

326
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,860
to repeat myself.

327
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,060
Sit down.

328
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,020
Yes.

329
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,660
I know you're getting married today,

330
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,380
but what if

331
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,820
I want you

332
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,140
to stay with me tonight?

333
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm marrying Noble Consort Chen

334
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,380
to gain the support of the City Lords.

335
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,060
Changming,

336
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,260
it's not easy to stabilize

337
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,560
the court of North Qi.

338
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,340
You used to ask me

339
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,140
why I never touched you.

340
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,180
It's because I like you.

341
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,620
But the man I like

342
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,700
is the you in the past.

343
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,380
If you're no longer pure,

344
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,420
I won't like you anymore.

345
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,460
No.

346
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,060
I can still be the man you like.

347
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,380
Is that so?

348
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,900
But as the King of North Qi,

349
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,700
you can't even choose

350
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,700
your bedmate tonight.

351
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,620
How can you still be

352
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,940
the man you once were?

353
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,900
Your Highness,

354
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,980
Noble Consort Chen
has sent for the King.

355
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,260
If you want to leave,

356
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,220
I won't force you.

357
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,940
But if you stay,

358
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,980
I have a gift

359
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
for you.

360
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,420
Send her people away.

361
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,940
What gift do you have for me?

362
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,540
Of course,

363
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,580
it's our wedding night.

364
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,620
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

365
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,060
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)

366
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,300
I don't understand

367
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,280
what Shilan is thinking.

368
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,980
Now, the Emperor appoints him

369
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,420
as the General of the West

370
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,960
in charge of the military affairs
of Qingzhou and Fengling.

371
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,580
This is clearly intentional.

372
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,260
Yet he actually accepted the decree.

373
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,340
Today, Yun and I

374
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,140
were planning to visit the Duke of Hu,

375
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,260
but the Emperor's decree

376
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,860
has put the Wei and Song families

377
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,820
on opposite sides.

378
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,620
Yun,

379
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,720
are you really not angry

380
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,180
about what Shilan did?

381
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,620
Shilan deserves his promotion

382
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,700
for taking back Qingzhou.

383
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,820
I'm just curious

384
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,420
why the Emperor issued the decree
at this time.

385
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
In that case,

386
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,720
let's not just sit here.

387
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,580
Shilan should be back by now.

388
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,920
I'll go ask him myself.

389
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,260
Your Lordship,

390
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,660
General Song has brought some soldiers.

391
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,620
They're outside now.

392
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,380
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

393
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,740
As soon as you were promoted,

394
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,780
you brought men to surround my mansion.

395
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,780
Did I

396
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,780
misjudge you,

397
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,580
or does power really blind you

398
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,660
so that you've lost your true self?

399
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,900
You know how much

400
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,700
the people admire you now,

401
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,900
yet you still do such absurd things.

402
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,500
Is this really your true nature?

403
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,380
Shilan,

404
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,660
what are you doing?

405
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,420
This is Yun's mansion.

406
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,940
Yun is our friend.

407
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,560
Tell your men to leave.

408
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,580
Wenchang.

409
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,980
If he can't handle

410
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,920
such a small situation,

411
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,660
how can he be the Marquis of Zhenguo?

412
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,340
Young Marquis Wei,

413
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,340
do you still remember

414
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,800
that you are the Marquis of Zhenguo?

415
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,100
My behavior

416
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,100
is none

417
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,940
of your business.

418
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,780
As the General of the West,

419
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,940
by the Emperor's verbal decree,

420
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,780
I'll escort Wei Yun
to the Arsenal Bureau.

421
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,860
You're not to leave without summons.

422
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,520
If you defy the decree,

423
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,460
you'll be defying the Emperor.

424
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,780
Song Shilan,

425
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,900
Yun gave you a chance to earn merits.

426
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,260
How can you do this to him?

427
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,460
Young Marquis Wei hasn't spoken yet.

428
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,310
How can you presume

429
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,280
to speak on his behalf?

430
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,500
Wenchang,

431
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,260
you should know the consequences

432
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,220
of defying an imperial decree.

433
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,740
The Arsenal Bureau
is not a dangerous place.

434
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,340
Why would I defy the decree?

435
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,700
Or perhaps

436
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,860
you want me to defy it,

437
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,620
so you can earn the reputation

438
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,060
of being loyal and dutiful.

439
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,700
I have a few words

440
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,620
to say to my family.

441
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,900
You surely can wait

442
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,940
for just a moment, right?

443
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,900
Yun,

444
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,660
are you really going to go?

445
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,660
Yu, you must stop him!

446
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,780
General,

447
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,140
this seems to go against the rules.

448
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,860
In Huajing City,

449
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,220
force should not be used lightly.

450
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,760
If the Marquis is willing to cooperate,

451
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,140
I will grant him this favor.

452
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,340
Yes.

453
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,780
Come here.

454
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,960
Have you also believed
those slanderous words,

455
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,880
thinking that Yun has failed
the Emperor's trust

456
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,120
and is unfit to be the Marquis?

457
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,960
Song Wenchang,

458
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,780
I am your brother.

459
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,660
Now, you question me for an outsider.

460
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,860
Don't you find that ridiculous?

461
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,220
You are my brother,

462
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,620
but I also risked my life for Yun.

463
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,340
I side with justice, not kinship.

464
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,780
You know Yun

465
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,740
has done nothing wrong,

466
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,880
yet you'll still lock him up

467
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,620
in the Bureau.

468
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,280
What are you thinking?

469
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,380
Wenchang,

470
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,180
why are you still so naive?

471
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,260
You know the consequences

472
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,500
of defying the Emperor.

473
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,220
How the Emperor treats the Weis now

474
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,060
is how he will treat us in the future.

475
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,980
Even so,

476
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,100
you'd still

477
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,540
stand up for Yun,

478
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,380
right?

479
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,920
The position of the General of the West

480
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,420
is both a ladder to success

481
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,980
and a death warrant for me.

482
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,700
But no matter how hard it is,

483
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,980
I will hold it firmly

484
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,020
in my hands.

485
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,060
Song Shilan,

486
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,820
I truly don't understand you.

487
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,060
How could you sacrifice a brother

488
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,220
for fame and rank?

489
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,420
Yes.

490
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,620
You never understood me

491
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,960
because

492
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,380
you never wanted to.

493
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,580
I've come this far step by step;

494
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,900
I won't stop for anyone.

495
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,980
Wenchang,

496
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,640
if you want to stop me,

497
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,940
go ahead.

498
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
I'd love to see

499
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,380
if you have the ability to do so.

500
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,940
Yu, I...

501
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,780
I know.

502
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,500
This is not a dead end.

503
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,660
We will surely find a way out.

504
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,340
If the road ahead is full of thorns,

505
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,280
let's cut through them.

506
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
You and I are each other's swords.

507
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,100
Even if the sky falls,

508
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,660
I will face it with you.

509
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,460
I'm willing to face it with you.

510
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,980
Wei Qiu,

511
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,220
while I'm away,

512
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,500
I leave the family in your hands.

513
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,500
I will not fail

514
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,900
your trust in me.

515
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,400
Young Marquis Wei.

516
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,620
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

517
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,460
It's getting late.

518
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,660
It's time to leave.

519
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,840
I'll wait for your return.

520
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,620
You won't have to wait long.

521
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,100
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

522
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,780
Is it really worth it

523
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,540
to risk yourself and the entire family

524
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,180
for the sake of love?

525
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,900
Enough nonsense.

526
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,600
Aren't you supposed
to take me to the Bureau?

527
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,740
Lead the way.

528
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:11,860
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

529
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,940
Yu,

530
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,120
will Yun really be okay

531
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,020
this time?

532
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,420
I believe in him.

533
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,300
Where is Zhao Yue?

534
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,580
Why haven't I seen him

535
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,980
since I got up today?

536
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,360
The King went to court
early this morning.

537
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,060
Before leaving, he instructed

538
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,300
that you must wait for him to return

539
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,280
and have lunch together.

540
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,020
There's still some time before lunch.

541
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,380
I'd like to take a walk in the garden.

542
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,820
Go fetch the pomegranate dress

543
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,100
that Zhao Yue gave me.

544
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,540
I think the true red color

545
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,580
will complement my makeup today.

546
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,780
According to the rules of North Qi,

547
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,420
only the Queen

548
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,820
is permitted to dress in true red.

549
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,100
Please do not make it hard for us.

550
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,940
Didn't Zhao Yue say

551
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
that only by wearing that dress

552
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,340
can I leave this Palace?

553
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,140
The Queen Mother has decreed:

554
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,860
This woman disregards the palace rules

555
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,300
and confuses the ruler.

556
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,420
Take her down.

557
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,860
Yes.

558
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,420
(King's Order)
The King said

559
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,280
the Eldest Princess is
a distinguished guest.

560
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,840
(King's Order)
Without his permission,

561
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,180
no one can be rude to her.

562
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,260
Hurry up and leave.

563
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,940
How dare you come to accuse me?

564
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,540
On the wedding night,

565
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,120
she made you snub Noble Consort Chen.

566
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,740
She's causing chaos in the harem.

567
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,300
How can I keep her?

568
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,420
This is my decision.

569
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,380
Punish me if you want.

570
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,920
What does it have to do with Changming?

571
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,260
What kind of attitude is this?

572
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,980
Li Changming is up to no good.

573
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,780
It is already leniency

574
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,380
that I do not kill her.

575
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,940
And she dares to dress

576
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,580
in true red,

577
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,100
parading around.

578
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,540
I gave her that dress.

579
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,060
Everything was with my permission.

580
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,140
I've told you this many times.

581
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,980
Indulging in love will lead to mistakes.

582
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,420
The political situation
is not yet stable.

583
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,740
We still need

584
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,540
the City Lords to fight for you.

585
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,020
You are now the King of North Qi.

586
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,140
The King?

587
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,820
I am so restricted everywhere.

588
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm not like the King at all.

589
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,860
Even the beggars are freer than I am.

590
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,460
You tell me you've prepared
everything for me,

591
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,900
but I feel like

592
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,420
I am truly

593
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,340
empty-handed now.

594
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,740
Am I your son?

595
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,380
No.

596
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,660
Power and authority

597
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,260
are your true sons.

598
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,220
I am just a pawn,

599
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,060
a puppet

600
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,220
in your hand.

601
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,060
You told me not to hate you,

602
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,780
but do you really love me?

603
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,220
Yue.

604
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,460
If I do not love you,

605
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
why did I let you

606
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,860
sit on this throne?

607
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,060
Without this throne,

608
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,660
who can you protect?

609
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,180
Think about it yourself.

610
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,500
Mother,

611
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,640
all that's left by my side is Changming.

612
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,020
I will never let her go.

613
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,540
Whether it's court affairs

614
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,860
or taking consorts,

615
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,100
I've done

616
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,140
everything you want me to.

617
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,260
But please, Mother,

618
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,060
do not harm Changming.

619
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,420
Then you should consummate

620
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,740
with Noble Consort Chen sooner.

621
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,660
As long as the City Lord of Xuan

622
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,900
does not come to trouble me,

623
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,340
of course,

624
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,620
I will not trouble

625
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,900
Li Changming.

626
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,580
Go see Noble Consort Chen now.

627
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,100
I will not pursue

628
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,940
the matter of today.

629
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,420
Alright.

630
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,620
I agree.

631
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,940
Bring them back.

632
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,420
And tell Li Changming

633
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,980
that the King is busy today

634
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,300
and will not go see her.

635
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,300
(I will not always)

636
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,540
(be so controlled by others.)

637
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,580
The Queen Mother has summoned us back.

638
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,000
No need to arrest her for now.

639
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,180
Let's go.

640
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,180
Your Highness,

641
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,060
the King said

642
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,100
that no matter what,

643
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,540
he will not wrong you.

644
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,780
One day,

645
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,260
he'll surely make you legitimate

646
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,380
to dress in true red.

647
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,700
I hope so.
