21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,900
(Langkeng Fish Tavern)

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,560
I had such a hard time

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,480
finding you.

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,790
Come on, General Chu.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
Look over here.

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,200
Considering

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,870
you have difficulty walking,

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,640
I made you

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,070
this Qiba Ox Chair.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,120
Take a look.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,960
What do you think?

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,950
Ox Chair?

33
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,630
It doesn't look like an ox.

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Let me try.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
How does it feel?

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
Good, huh?

37
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,550
Feels good.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,870
This chair,

39
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,190
in appearance and structure,

40
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,560
bears a resemblance

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,750
to the Wooden Ox designed

42
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,590
by Zhuge Liang.

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
Commander Lu, I guess

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,150
you named it after that.

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,520
Quite knowledgeable.

46
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,800
So, that's how it works.

47
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,800
Can this chair

48
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,430
allow me to travel like the wind

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,840
or move across the ground?

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
Well...

51
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,030
Neither.

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,240
So, what makes it different

53
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,750
from my own chair?

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
I could have made a better one.

55
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,870
I had originally intended

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
to build you

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,080
a combat wheelchair.

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,360
But the problem is,

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,910
I think it's now

60
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,870
a time of peace.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
So, I gave it up.

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,750
Instead of making a fancy chair,

63
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,870
I prefer to make it practical.

64
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,200
Look at your chair.

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
It's big and heavy.

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,030
And look at my little chair.

67
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,910
It's light and handy.

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,750
It's easy to fold and store.

69
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,800
You can operate it

70
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,710
all by yourself

71
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
and move around freely.

72
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,030
I put a lot of effort into this.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
General Chu,

74
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm quite thoughtful, right?

75
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,030
Thank you.

76
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,430
We're buddies.

77
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,360
Don't say that.

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,630
It's good. Make one for me.

79
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,750
Don't be kidding.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,080
I specially made this

81
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
for General Chu.

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
You want one? Sure.

83
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,200
I'll break your legs.

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,190
Just kidding.

85
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,990
Try it.

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,280
Give it a try.

87
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,030
- Come on.
- Come on.

88
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,960
Hurry up.

89
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,120
- Try it.
- Come on. Try it.

90
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,000
You try it yourself.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,840
Alright. I'll do it.

92
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,030
It's effortless.

93
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,710
See? Light, isn't it?

94
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,030
- Alright.
- Very agile.

95
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,910
Turn around. Go.

96
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,280
Come on. Move a few steps.

97
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,840
Move. Move some steps.

98
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,120
Go ahead.

99
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,150
Move.

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
They're too noisy.

101
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
(Langkeng Fish Tavern)

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,030
It's quieter over here.

103
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,750
What are you doing here?

104
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,280
I've missed you all day.

105
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,520
Did you miss me?

106
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,710
What's the use of that?

107
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,000
Today, you went to the palace

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,840
for a reward.

109
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,950
So, Linyang and I came out

110
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,790
to have some fun.

111
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,270
I...

112
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,400
Here's your Rose Dew.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,190
We won the battle,

114
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,560
but I was very confused

115
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,750
and even bewildered.

116
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,150
What for?

117
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,430
All of you contributed a lot.

118
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,750
Why did His Majesty only make me

119
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,920
the God of War of Great Sui?

120
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,790
Today,

121
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,270
I pleaded with His Majesty for us.

122
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,510
Why did he even reprimand me?

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,960
His Majesty must have his reasons

124
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,830
for our country.

125
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,310
You don't need to oppose him

126
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,350
because of me.

127
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
But Yu...

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,040
We're willing to risk our lives

129
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,680
fighting for our country.

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Even if we suffer,

131
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,120
we never complain.

132
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,830
We're giving it our all.

133
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,040
But even our simplest joy

134
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
has been denied.

135
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,960
I don't understand.

136
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
Nor do I want to.

137
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,800
The highest may have a fall.

138
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,800
This honor

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
may bring you trouble.

140
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,480
You and I

141
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
don't necessarily

142
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,870
have to get married.

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
I don't care.

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
But I care.

145
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,190
You took the divorce paper

146
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,030
and went back home.

147
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I want to marry you,

148
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,680
with dignity.

149
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,800
I don't want to remain worried

150
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,240
even when we meet in secret.

151
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Alright.

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Does it have to be so hard

153
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,160
to marry you?

154
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,060
(Langkeng Fish Tavern)

155
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,520
General Chu,

156
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,720
Tuantuan sneaked off to Fengling City

157
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,630
without permission,

158
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
so she's grounded now.

159
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,390
She can't come here today.

160
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,350
Is she alright?

161
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,600
Qingping helped me a lot.

162
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,160
Whatever happens,

163
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
I want her

164
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,950
to be safe and happy.

165
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
That sounds familiar.

166
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,030
Tuantuan

167
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,870
said something similar to me.

168
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,600
General Chu,

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
you don't need to deny

170
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,680
your care for someone you love.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,430
Life is already

172
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,360
hard enough.

173
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,720
Don't be harsh to yourself.

174
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,630
You seem to have tacitly accepted

175
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,560
their relationship.

176
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,070
In your own case, I hope...

177
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,200
Yu made her choice.

178
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,800
I won't interfere.

179
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,720
Young Marquis Wei is trying his best

180
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,880
to be with Yu.

181
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,130
When he's with her,

182
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,510
I feel relieved.

183
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,240
As for the future,

184
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,560
they need to face it themselves.

185
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,160
You're quite reasonable

186
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,600
in your sister's case.

187
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,920
I hope you can

188
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,070
do the same for yourself.

189
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,470
- Come on, drink.
- Let's drink.

190
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,360
I knew you were all here.

191
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,800
- Jin.
- Jin.

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
I went to your house.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,060
Your mother said you were asleep.

194
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
Jin,

195
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,750
come and sit.

196
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,870
Sit.

197
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,270
Did you really go?

198
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,790
Of course. How would I leave you alone?

199
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,920
Madam,

200
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,920
one more cup, please.

201
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,510
I'll go fetch it.

202
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,230
Jin.

203
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
It's Rose Dew.

204
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,720
Father loved it very much.

205
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,870
You can taste some.

206
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,790
Linyang,

207
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,790
I can drink now?

208
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,630
You're an adult now.

209
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,790
Of course you can.

210
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,630
Here.

211
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,040
Alright.

212
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,670
We are all here.

213
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,350
It's so good.

214
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,670
We're drinking and enjoying it.

215
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,270
But our country is in crisis.

216
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,590
We can't relax.

217
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm a woman,

218
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,390
but I can also fight off enemies

219
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,390
and defend Great Sui.

220
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,360
I will make my name

221
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,750
go down in history.

222
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,480
Of course.

223
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,510
Who says women can't

224
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,390
fight battles?

225
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,590
A toast to you.

226
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
Even if

227
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't make peerless weapons,

228
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,320
no one in this world

229
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,720
can surpass me but myself.

230
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,470
It makes sense.

231
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,750
I...

232
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,590
Song Wenchang.

233
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,120
What if I lost once?

234
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,240
I'll get up from where I fell.

235
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,800
Song Wenchang

236
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,750
is done being a dandy.

237
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,910
It's my turn.

238
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,350
I, Chu Jin,

239
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
can't save people

240
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,790
like Qingping,

241
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
or fight battles

242
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
like my sister.

243
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,720
But

244
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,630
I will excel

245
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,470
in my own endeavors

246
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,840
and follow my own path.

247
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,230
From this day on,

248
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,590
I will take

249
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,550
the peace of Great Sui as my mission

250
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,840
and let our country

251
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,000
enjoy a prosperous time.

252
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,960
And me.

253
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,840
My family's always been loyal,

254
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
with many sacrifices.

255
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
But when I'm around,

256
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
North Qi won't stand a chance.

257
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,390
I will bring those who lost their homes

258
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
back home.

259
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,840
Recover our lost hand.

260
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,320
I know you all came here

261
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,840
to show your support for me.

262
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,200
I'll also swear.

263
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,200
I, Chu Linyang,

264
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,390
have weak legs

265
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,510
and can't stand up.

266
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,360
But I'm still determined

267
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,390
to protect our country.

268
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,240
I can't fight now.

269
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,510
Lu Qiba,

270
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,670
the only one who can beat you

271
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
is yourself.

272
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,200
But I'm the one

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,840
who can help you.

274
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,200
Good.

275
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,470
Don't worry.

276
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
I'll often come to bother you,

277
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
General Chu.

278
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,030
Despicable North Qi armies.

279
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,150
They stole my blueprints

280
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,590
to make crossbows

281
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,630
and chariots.

282
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,080
I also make this vow now.

283
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,960
I will make

284
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
better weapons.

285
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,720
We'll banish North Qi,

286
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,280
recover lost land,

287
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,360
and take back Her Highness.

288
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,040
Cheers.

289
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,360
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

290
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,200
Drink it up.

291
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,670
Your Highness,

292
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,520
the king had someone

293
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,700
bring some Great Sui cuisine.

294
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,080
He wanted you to eat.

295
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,720
Zhao Yue trusts you a great deal, right?

296
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm Ping.

297
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,790
His Majesty sent me to serve you.

298
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,840
To spy on me, is that it?

299
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,080
His Majesty said

300
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,390
I didn't need

301
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,510
to report anything to him.

302
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,790
Now, you're here in our court.

303
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,200
He can rest easy.

304
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,500
Can he really be relieved?

305
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,550
Su Can is dead,

306
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,720
but he can't ascend the throne just yet.

307
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,600
He must be very anxious.

308
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Don't worry.

309
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,390
His Majesty

310
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,320
will get the throne.

311
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,990
Mother.

312
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,440
Mother.

313
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,590
Mother.

314
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
Mother.

315
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,240
You're not a child anymore.

316
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,270
Why are you still so reckless?

317
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,510
Mother,

318
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,680
I am back.

319
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,510
This is how a future king

320
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,630
should behave.

321
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,870
How I regret failing

322
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,720
to capture Fengling and Qingzhou.

323
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,330
There's no rush.

324
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,480
Now, Su Can is dead.

325
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,270
North Qi

326
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,120
will belong to us.

327
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,190
All these years in Great Sui,

328
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,120
I often dreamed of my childhood

329
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,150
when I was with you.

330
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,440
You...

331
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,870
You will take the throne soon.

332
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,000
You must not

333
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,870
say anything like that.

334
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,510
You must always remember.

335
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
You're destined to be a king.

336
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,120
In the future,

337
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,960
you will rule the whole world.

338
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,840
A sovereign must be ruthless.

339
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,840
You must be ruthless to Mother.

340
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,550
You must also be ruthless

341
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,670
towards Li Changming.

342
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,160
Mother,

343
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,490
without her,

344
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,820
I wouldn't have succeeded.

345
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,360
Without her great power,

346
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,630
I wouldn't

347
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,470
have hidden there.

348
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,940
That was before.

349
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,870
Now,

350
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,580
you're going to be the King of North Qi.

351
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,550
She is merely a tool to you.

352
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,840
You must not develop feelings for her.

353
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,840
I dealt with the Lord of Qin of Great Sui,

354
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,750
and managed to get the three cities.

355
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,390
If I had been swayed by emotion,

356
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,120
would we have come this far?

357
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,990
But things are different.

358
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,730
She's in my country now.

359
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Mother,

360
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,630
why can't I

361
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,840
rule the world

362
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,000
and still be with the one I love?

363
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,990
What?

364
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,790
Are you blaming your mother

365
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,510
for that woman?

366
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,960
I wouldn't dare.

367
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,960
You're just back

368
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,160
with little support.

369
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,150
She's the Eldest Princess of Great Sui.

370
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,320
If you're involved with her too much,

371
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,750
you'll be criticized.

372
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,550
Right now,

373
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,320
your priority is to take the throne.

374
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,840
Do you remember?

375
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,920
You're right, Mother.

376
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,110
I'll keep it in mind.

377
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,320
Remember.

378
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,790
State affairs come first.

379
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,480
The others don't matter.

380
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,840
Yes.

381
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm tired.

382
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,630
You go back for some rest.

383
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,670
Mother, look at the vegetables
I just bought.

384
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,710
Are they fresh?

385
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,320
Come on, Mother.

386
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,150
Linyang went out for a drink yesterday,

387
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,360
and weren't you happy?

388
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,360
Why do you look so worried again?

389
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm worried about your sister.

390
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,150
It's really hard for her to be

391
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,440
with Wen Yun.

392
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,200
Hi, Madam Chu.

393
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,030
It's been quite some time

394
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,480
since you visited me, the matchmaker.

395
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,630
Mother,

396
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,790
you went to see a matchmaker?

397
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,750
Some days ago,

398
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,840
I was worried

399
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,150
about your marriages.

400
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,630
You know what?

401
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,910
Your eldest daughter is great.

402
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,910
But no matter how beautiful she is,

403
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,030
she is a widow.

404
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,510
She needs to remarry soon.

405
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,840
Then, people will stop

406
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,240
gossiping about her.

407
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,840
Madam Chu, are you worried

408
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,960
that the Marquis of Zhenguo

409
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,270
will be jealous?

410
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,830
Mother, don't listen to her.

411
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Let's go.

412
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,350
I'd like to see

413
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,440
if you can recommend someone

414
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,790
worthy of my daughter.

415
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,200
If you fail,

416
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,790
I will smash

417
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,160
your reputation.

418
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,510
Come on, madam.

419
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
I'll show you some.

420
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,070
- Come this way.
- Mother.

421
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,910
Mother.

422
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,140
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

423
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,640
Line up, please.

424
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,310
Wait a minute here.

425
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,150
Giving out food?

426
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,110
- Food?
- We'll have food.

427
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,160
They're so kind.

428
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,160
Come on.

429
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,200
They're giving out food.

430
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,760
- Here.
- Great.

431
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,700
- Food, at last.
- Thank you.

432
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,590
Here it is.

433
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,590
Thank you. Thank you.

434
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,000
- Take it.
- Thank you.

435
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,350
Thank you. Thank you.

436
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,190
Here. Take it.

437
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,520
Yun.

438
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,680
Since you're back,

439
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,000
you should check

440
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,640
our account books.

441
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,150
Chun,

442
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,590
you do a great job in that.

443
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,750
I won't check them.

444
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,830
You should check them.

445
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,200
Because of the war,

446
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,510
many refugees have fled here.

447
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,980
Chun and I agreed

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,200
to give out some porridge.

449
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,000
Our expenses will be

450
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,160
much higher than usual.

451
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,350
You should check it.

452
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,160
Giving out food is a worthy cause.

453
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,350
Lan, you have my full support.

454
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,510
We should go now.

455
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,430
Found it.

456
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,500
(Spring Breeze House)

457
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,590
This way, please.

458
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,280
Madam Chu, come in, please.

459
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,640
Come upstairs, please.

460
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,000
Thank you.

461
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,400
My Lady.

462
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,480
Another zither player.

463
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,070
Let's go. You don't get it.

464
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,950
My Lady.

465
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,510
Why must Madam

466
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,400
take you here?

467
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,550
I don't know.

468
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,390
It's strange.

469
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,000
Mother.

470
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,270
Why have we suddenly

471
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,160
come here?

472
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,270
You'll meet someone here.

473
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,590
Meet someone?

474
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,110
Who would I meet?

475
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,590
Yu,

476
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,200
I've come to know

477
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,640
why you married Wen Jun.

478
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
You're young,

479
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,270
but have to sacrifice so much.

480
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,590
You never complained,

481
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,400
but I feel sorry.

482
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,110
Mother.

483
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,480
I've given it a lot of thought.

484
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,200
If he truly loves you,

485
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,160
why hasn't he proposed to you yet?

486
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,920
He must have second thoughts

487
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,750
now that he's in a position of power.

488
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,110
No.

489
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,960
We've just returned.

490
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,440
And we need some time

491
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,200
for the past rumors to fade.

492
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,240
Have you forgotten about it

493
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,550
when our plaque

494
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,550
was defaced with ink?

495
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,310
Silly girl.

496
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,480
With the divorce paper,

497
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
you're a single woman.

498
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,550
Besides,

499
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,640
you were badly injured

500
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,720
in the battles.

501
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,030
I think

502
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,720
if you don't start planning

503
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,830
for your own future,

504
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
it will be too late.

505
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,510
Oh, Madam Chu.

506
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,680
You've finally come.

507
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,760
- Ms. Bao.
- Today,

508
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,830
many talented young men

509
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,510
will attend the poetic gathering here.

510
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,680
You can

511
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,330
take a good look at them

512
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,490
with your daughter.

513
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,000
This way, please.

514
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,830
You know exactly

515
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,030
who is spoken for

516
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,070
and who is available.

517
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,030
- Rest assured.
- So,

518
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,110
- it's a blind date.
- The rich families in town

519
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,950
and noble families...

520
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,840
I can't leave now.

521
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,550
I know everything

522
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,310
about them.

523
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,440
This way, please.

524
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,190
Come on. Take a look.

525
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,040
There they are.

526
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,000
- This is Song Shilan,
- Go upstairs, please.

527
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
the son of Duke of Ning's concubine.

528
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,680
He's talented

529
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,830
in civil and military.

530
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,720
He made contributions in Qingzhou,

531
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,660
following Young Marquis Wei.

532
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,960
Now,

533
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,680
he's a popular young man to be selected.

534
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,240
We know this man.

535
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,080
He won't do.

536
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,440
He's Song Wenchang's brother.

537
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,510
If I marry him,

538
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,830
I'd have to call Jin

539
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,720
"Elder Sister".

540
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,190
Awkward hierarchy.

541
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,240
I didn't think of that.

542
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,510
Then, look at that man.

543
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,670
-  Vice Minister Zhang Anl.
- Sit, please.

544
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,720
He's good-looking

545
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,760
and even-tempered.

546
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,110
He's a legitimate child.

547
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,350
Most importantly,

548
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,640
he was very devoted to his wife.

549
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,630
What do you mean?

550
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,240
Will Chu Yu be his concubine?

551
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,920
How would I dare?

552
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,310
Zhang An's wife

553
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,030
passed away over a year ago.

554
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,110
So, he's a good match

555
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,750
for your daughter.

556
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,830
No.

557
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,200
He's cursed in marriage.

558
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,040
I don't approve.

559
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,720
Then, this one.

560
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,350
- Compared to General Song,
- Go upstairs, please.

561
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,400
this one is riding high on his career.

562
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,480
He's now Minister of Personnel.

563
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,480
His Majesty holds him in high regard

564
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,790
and has appointed him

565
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,920
as Junior Tutor to the Crown Prince.

566
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,270
Mr. Gu

567
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,880
is now divorced from Ms. Wang.

568
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,550
And Ms. Chu Yu

569
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,790
should be familiar to him.

570
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,680
He still has feelings

571
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,590
for you, anyway.

572
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,680
How do you know that?

573
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,030
Every time I matchmake for him,

574
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,610
he tells me his heart still belongs

575
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,160
to you.

576
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,440
A good man doesn't backtrack.

577
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,080
Any other options?

578
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,480
Will you really not consider him?

579
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,310
You certainly have

580
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,000
extraordinary taste.

581
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,350
That one.

582
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,680
That is Censor Wang.

583
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,310
He's also a young talent.

584
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,000
What do you think?

585
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,350
Hi, Gu.

586
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,630
Chusheng, sit.

587
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,160
Today,

588
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,000
I have some good news

589
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,110
to tell you, Zhang.

590
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,910
What is that?

591
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,910
The Duke of Ning

592
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,350
has resumed peace talks.

593
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,950
This time,

594
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,960
His Majesty consented.

595
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,680
What kind of good news is that?

596
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,110
Theoretically,

597
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,190
North Qi is in chaos

598
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,270
for its king's recent death.

599
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,680
It's the best time

600
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,520
to attack them.

601
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,030
But...

602
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,870
I understand.

603
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,680
Before Her Highness

604
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
comes back from North Qi,

605
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,240
an attack won't be authorized.

606
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,150
But Her...

607
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,680
Even though Her Highness

608
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,920
was deceived by Zhao Yue,

609
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,940
she could still pose a threat.

610
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,510
Now, all the officials

611
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,480
speak critically of Her Highness.

612
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,640
No one wants

613
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,960
to undertake the peace talks.

614
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,310
Even worse, if someone goes there,

615
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,550
he might lose his life.

616
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,550
I know.

617
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,390
As friends,

618
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,960
you want my career to be smooth.

619
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
But in this world,

620
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,400
some sacrifice everything

621
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,240
for their ambitions

622
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,670
while others seek

623
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,680
only a stable life.

624
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,480
And I

625
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,030
happen to be the latter.

626
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,760
It's just my advice.

627
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,680
Zhang, don't overthink it.

628
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,200
Chusheng is right.

629
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,240
Come on, let's drink.

630
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,630
Cheer.

631
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,640
Isn't that Ms. Chu Yu?

632
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,830
What is she doing here?

633
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,390
I'll be right back.

634
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,110
Are you curious

635
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,000
why Gu can't let go of his feelings

636
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,150
for Ms. Chu Yu?

637
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,310
I'm just curious

638
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,960
why everyone

639
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,510
gets so hung up on love.

640
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,880
I have no interest

641
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,920
in romance whatsoever.

642
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,920
Think about it.

643
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,510
Why is no one ambitious?

644
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,000
Why don't they want success?

645
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,880
I don't understand.

646
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,310
Those who get stuck in love

647
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,310
are all successful, aren't they?

648
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,840
For example,

649
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,110
the one who just rushed over.

650
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,070
That sounds a bit hurtful.

651
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,550
Does none of them meet your standards?

652
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,800
Any more options?

653
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,270
- Umm...
- My Lady,

654
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,110
Gu Chusheng is here.

655
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,070
Madam Chu,

656
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,960
it's been years

657
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,110
and I haven't visited you.

658
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,520
My apologies.

659
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,160
It's kind of you, Mr. Gu.

660
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,030
What a coincidence to meet you.

661
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,040
It's not.

662
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
I came here for Chu Yu.

663
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,680
For me?

664
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,920
Why?

665
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Why are you so on guard?

666
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,440
Every time I see you,

667
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,510
it seems there's bad news.

668
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,200
Do you hate me so much now?

669
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,800
- Gu Chusheng.
- Try this.

670
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,200
I was thinking

671
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,880
you usually act honorably in big cases.

672
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,070
That's why I didn't want to argue here.

673
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,400
Before you do anything,

674
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,200
you'd better think carefully.

675
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,880
You're here for a matchmaking session.

676
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,400
Why can't I try one more time?

677
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,030
What's that?

678
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,870
And look at this.

679
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,900
(Hope you feel as I do.
I won't fail our love.)

680
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,230
(Flowers bloom. I want you back.)
Hope you feel as I do.

681
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
I won't fail our love.

682
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,390
It's...

683
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,350
On the day Qingzhou fell,

684
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,480
I was kneeling,

685
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,310
subjected to humiliation over and over.

686
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,350
I was thinking of you, then.

687
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,630
Chu Yu,

688
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,880
even if you hate me,

689
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,960
I don't want to miss this chance.

690
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,160
I turned down all marriage proposals

691
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,350
because I was waiting for you.

692
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,400
It doesn't matter if you're Ms. Chu

693
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,110
or Mrs. Wei,

694
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,960
I don't care.

695
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,670
Yu,

696
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,960
I just hope you feel as I do.

697
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,310
I won't fail our love.

698
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,750
Isn't that Marquis of Zhenguo?

699
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,510
Why is he also here?

700
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,630
Come in, please.

701
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,570
Your dishes are all served. Enjoy them.

702
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,000
Isn't that His Lordship?

703
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,840
Yeah.

704
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,580
(Flowers bloom.
I want you back. By Gu Chusheng)

705
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,640
Why are you here?

706
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,480
If I hadn't come,

707
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,110
your mother would have

708
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,950
found you a husband.

709
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,550
Since when can my mother

710
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,590
make decisions for me?

711
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,790
Young Marquis,

712
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,920
are you here for tea as well?

713
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
I suppose you also

714
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
came here to see

715
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,350
who Mrs. Wei would choose.

716
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,590
I'm not here

717
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,720
just for tea.

718
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,240
No matter what,

719
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,400
you're not

720
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,790
the right man for me, Mr. Gu.

721
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,640
So, help yourself.

722
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,070
Stay calm.

723
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,880
Obviously, he's provoking you.

724
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,240
I know.

725
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,350
But when you remain my weakness,

726
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,590
people will never stop

727
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,830
using you against me.

728
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,590
And you will get hurt at last.

729
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,240
Yu,

730
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,550
I don't need you

731
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,480
to always protect me.

732
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,110
Ms. Chu is here to choose a husband,

733
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,680
and I am still unmarried.

734
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,110
Why can't I be

735
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,640
one of her options?

736
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,280
Wei Yun.

737
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,630
Wei Yun,

738
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
do you realize the consequences of this?

739
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,750
Since I dared to come here,

740
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,550
I'm not afraid of any consequences.

741
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,480
Since Madam Chu is

742
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,320
choosing a husband

743
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,720
for Ms. Chu Yu,

744
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,790
I have something to say.

745
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,200
Madam Chu,

746
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,350
Yu and I fought together,

747
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,190
and I fell in love.

748
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,720
Later, we risked our lives

749
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,560
in those two cities.

750
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,760
It made us realize

751
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,110
our feelings for each other.

752
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,070
Our relationship is genuine.

753
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,400
We went through everything.

754
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,160
So, I can't let her

755
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,240
marry someone else.

756
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,350
Nor do I want us

757
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,680
to remain ambiguous in the world.

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,820
♪Thoughts ablaze like beacon's fire♪

759
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,130

Mr. Gu,

764
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,350
if you must have an answer today,

765
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,550
I will give it to you.

00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
is the man

768
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,960
I love.

769
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,510
He is now.

770
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,950
He always will be.

771
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,350

Your Lordship,

775
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,670
today,

776
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,160
you dared to declare this

777
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,240
in public.

778
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,160
I'm quite relieved.

779
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,750
You have

780
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
my family's blessing.

781
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,110
I also believe that your relationship

782
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,440
is genuine.

784
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,830
Some time ago,

785
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,640
Yu obtained her Letter of Release.

786
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,550
She dedicated herself entirely

787
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,350
to revitalize your family,

788
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,790
which delayed her until now.

789
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,920
Please allow me

790
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,790
to take her home,

791
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,720
so we can discuss your marriage.

792
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,670
Yu,

793
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,200
let's go home.

794
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,950
I'll wait for you.

795
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,080
I expect their wedding.

796
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,000
I never thought the two of them

797
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,830
would end up together.

798
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,740
Come on.

799
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,110
I think those two

800
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,030
make a perfect couple.

801
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,780
They're very well-matched.

802
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,550
What about Mr. Gu?

803
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,200
Too bad for him.

804
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,110
My Lady,

805
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
are you still thinking

806
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,520
about what happened?

807
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,830
Look at you.

808
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,070
My effort there

809
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,350
isn't wasted.

810
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,390
Mother, I have to ask.

811
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,350
Did you bring me there

812
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,550
because that matchmaker

813
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,480
came to you

814
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,320
and persuaded you to?

815
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,550
I wanted

816
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,640
to let you meet more gentlemen

817
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,750
and urge Young Marquis Wei.

818
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,070
Isn't that killing two birds

819
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,910
with one stone?

820
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,760
So...

821
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,200
As expected, Young Marquis Wei

822
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,240
is a man of his word.

823
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,480
From this day on,

824
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,200
he's the man

825
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,040
I've admired most.

826
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,080
Of course.

827
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,550
Wei Yun is certainly the best.

828
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,480
But Gu Chusheng

829
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,790
is rather snobbish.

830
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,160
He likes me,

831
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,480
but he never

832
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,320
puts me first.

833
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,350
Today, he made a big scene.

834
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,350
It seems that he was targeting me.

835
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,720
But actually, I was a mere bait.

836
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,400
He wanted to anger Wei Yun.

837
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,040
Chusheng,

838
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,750
what you did today

839
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,950
was deliberate, huh?

840
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,590
But...

841
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,960
You and Young Marquis

842
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,720
were on better terms.

843
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,480
Why did you provoke him

844
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,510
to confess his love?

845
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,920
His Majesty ordered me.

846
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,720
His Majesty doesn't want him

847
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,870
to be stuck in love.

848
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,550
He needs a pretext.

849
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,240
And I am

850
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,720
the blade in his hand.

851
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,440
I didn't want to,

852
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,750
but I had no choice.

853
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,240
Young Marquis Wei is clever.

854
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,550
He realized it was a trap,

855
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,830
but he jumped in it resolutely.

856
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,030
He didn't even hesitate.

857
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,030
He knew His Majesty

858
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,960
was wary of it.

859
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,440
But he still confessed his love.

860
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,510
I helped His Majesty to set him up.

861
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,440
But in my heart,

862
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,070
I don't feel good.

863
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,630
But a man's heart is

864
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,480
the hardest to see through.

865
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
I'm totally confused.

866
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,400
Why must some people

867
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
get stuck

868
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,000
in this romance thing?

869
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,070
Guys,

870
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,190
what are you talking about?

871
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,880
I don't understand a word.

872
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,670
Come on, Zhang.

873
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,510
Let's drink.

874
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,950
Your Lordship,

875
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,190
you confessed your love

876
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,030
in public.

877
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,760
What if it spreads

878
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,000
throughout the city again?

879
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,150
I was trying to make a big scene,

880
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,070
so I wouldn't be controlled.

881
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,160
Why don't I

882
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
understand that?

883
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,400
Did Mr. Gu not confess his love

884
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,360
for personal reasons?

885
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,320
Is there anything else behind it?

886
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,510
He did that for personal reasons.

887
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,800
But I just would not

888
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,640
let him have his way.

889
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,920
What Gu Chusheng did today

890
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,360
made me see clearly one thing.

891
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,400
His Majesty is using him

892
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
and the people

893
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,840
to make me the God of Great Sui.

894
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,960
But isn't that your ambition

895
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,760
to be the hero of Great Sui

896
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,800
and guardian of its people?

897
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,440
I want to be a true hero

898
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,320
for our people,

899
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,320
not the only God of Great Sui

900
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,190
appointed by His Majesty.

901
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,710
If I accept this favor,

902
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,070
I will be second

903
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,910
only to His Majesty.

904
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,280
But meanwhile, I will be

905
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
a target for other officials.

906
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
My family

907
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,400
will also be too prominent.

908
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,330
If the favor remained,

909
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,190
that would be fine.

910
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,320
But if one day, I make a mistake

911
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,440
and loses favor,

912
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,280
I will instantly

913
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,400
become a target of blame.

914
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,480
In this game,

915
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,400
I need to think far ahead before I act.

916
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,080
If one day, I take one wrong step,

917
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,110
I will totally lose.

(Biography of The General in White)
What does it have to do

919
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,720
with your confession?

920
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,030
(Record of Fengling)

921
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,750
(Marquis of Zhenguo)
Because in their eyes,

922
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,030
Chu Yu is a stain

923
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,200
in my life.

924
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,670
So, they're trying

925
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,510
every possible means

926
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,840
to remove this stain.

927
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,670
But they miscalculated

928
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,030
how much I care for Chu Yu

929
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,450
and underestimated

930
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,920
how much I hated to be controlled.

931
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,990
I thought

932
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,030
everything would go smoothly

933
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,230
after we returned in triumph.

934
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,470
Unexpectedly,

935
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
there are simmering conflicts in town.

936
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,510
When Father and Brothers

937
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,350
were alive,

938
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,960
I could be General Wei

939
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,880
living a carefree life.

940
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,070
I thought the noble title

941
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,070
was an honor.

942
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,760
But when I became

943
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,920
the Marquis of Zhenguo,

944
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,590
I finally realized

945
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,400
how difficult it was for my father

946
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,720
to guide our family.

947
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,150
I'm afraid this battle of wits

948
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,000
will be even harder
than defending the cities.

00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,580
That's good.

960
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,280
Wei Yun,

961
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,230
recently,

962
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,000
I've received many memorials.

963
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,000
You're mentioned in many of them.

964
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,150
Now, you have truly become

965
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,150
a pillar of the state.

966
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,800
So many people are concerned about you.

967
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,240
And it happened

968
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,710
that you told me
about Chu Yu's contributions

969
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,110
on the battlefield.

970
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,960
I've been thinking

971
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,960
how I should reward her.

972
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:07,910
Now,

973
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,400
I've made a decision.

974
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,800
I will bestow upon Chu Yu a title.

975
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,070
Lady Zhaohua.

976
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,510
What do you think?

977
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,710
