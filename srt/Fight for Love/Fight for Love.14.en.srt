Chu Yu.

Protect the Eldest Princess!

24
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,270
Young Master!

25
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,750
Chu Yu!

26
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,340
Gu!

27
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,560
- My Lady!
- Stop!

28
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,590
My Lady.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,120
Be careful, Yu!

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
Hold my hand!

31
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,470
Hold on tight!

32
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,800
- My Lady!
- My Lady!

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,360
Thank you, Yun.

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,920
Are you alright?

35
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,990
I'm fine.

36
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,710
Greetings, Your Highness.

37
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,260
No need to stand on ceremony.

38
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,270
Chu Yu,

39
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,430
how are you?

40
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,750
Your Highness,

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,590
I'm fine.

42
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,590
Impressive, Yun.

43
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,880
Catching someone with bare hands

44
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,950
is as easy as pie for you.

45
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,360
It seems that Mr. Gu

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,730
still can't let go of Chu Yu.

47
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,710
Indeed.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,810
He instinctively tried to save her.

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,470
But Mrs. Gu...

50
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,140
Your Highness,

51
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,340
we've caught the assassin.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
However,

53
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,520
he's poisoned himself to death.

54
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,420
Has his identity been discovered?

55
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,180
Not yet.

56
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,860
The body has been sent
to the Court of Judicial Review.

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,960
I will definitely find out.

58
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,820
How dare the people of North Qi

59
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,980
cause trouble on my territory!

60
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Your Highness,

61
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,300
it happened so suddenly.

62
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,500
There must be other clues
in Qinxi Valley.

63
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,700
Please allow us

64
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
to seal off Qinxi Valley

65
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,180
for investigation.

66
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,900
Then I leave it to you.

67
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,740
You must get

68
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,220
to the bottom of this.

69
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,820
Yes.

70
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,100
Mr. Gu,

71
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,920
how is your injury?

72
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,780
It's not serious.

73
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,980
Miss Song has bandaged me.

74
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,420
I'm tired.

75
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,740
Hanmei,

76
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,940
let them all leave.

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,940
The auction banquet

78
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,060
is over.

79
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,300
Goodbye, Your Highness.

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,220
Chu Yu,

81
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,340
follow me.

82
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,580
I'll wait for you outside the door.

83
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,620
Seeing me here,

84
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,980
you seem quite surprised.

85
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,940
I was just worried

86
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,100
that Ms. Chu would fall.

87
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,460
Then it seems

88
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,380
that you must try harder

89
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,220
to hide your secret and expressions.

90
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,740
Anything good happened to you?

91
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,580
You look so happy.

92
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,180
I've only heard that General Wei Jun

93
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,100
was valiant

94
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,860
and rare in the world.

95
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,340
But just now,

96
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,540
Young Marquis Wei's moves

97
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,500
were also good.

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,420
I don't think he'd be inferior

99
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,460
to General Wei Jun.

100
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,780
Young Marquis Wei

101
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,420
is indeed a fine young man.

102
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,180
The only drawback is

103
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,820
that he has to go to the battlefield.

104
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,700
Otherwise, he'd be a good choice.

105
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,780
Naturally.

106
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,200
Chu Jin,

107
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,340
when you choose a husband,

108
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,380
you must be careful.

109
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,220
A man like Young Master Sun

110
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,000
is definitely not someone to rely on.

111
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,140
The eyes of Ms. Chu Jin

112
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,260
look very bright to me.

113
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,300
Why does she need your reminder?

114
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,860
You're not even worthy

115
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,420
to marry into the Wei family.

116
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,660
Ms. Chu Jin,

117
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,060
with so many things happening

118
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,200
at the auction banquet today,

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,080
were you scared?

120
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,380
Thank you for your concern.

121
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,020
(Qinxi Valley)

122
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
You promised me something

123
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,980
at the banquet just now.

124
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,340
Is it still valid?

125
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,540
I don't know if you like

126
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,780
to play pitch-pot.

127
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,900
I learned it with my brother
when I was young,

128
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,700
but I haven't played for a long time,

129
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,760
and I'm quite rusty now.

130
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,660
I can teach you.

131
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,100
I'm very good at this.

132
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,180
One day,

133
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,660
I can invite some friends,

134
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,040
and we can go to the suburbs

135
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,640
to play pitch-pot and enjoy the spring.

136
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,500
What do you think?

137
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,260
Thank you for your kind invitation.

138
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,060
If I have time,

139
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,380
I'd like to see

140
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,220
your skills.

141
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,980
In a few days,

142
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,420
I'll send an invitation to your home.

143
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,660
Then it's settled.

144
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,140
When I choose a good day,

145
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,460
I'll come to pick you up.

146
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,900
Sure.

147
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,380
Then I'll take my leave now.

148
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,060
Goodbye.

149
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,360
Your Highness, please forgive me.

150
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,340
I didn't tell you

151
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,420
my plan for today in advance

152
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,420
because I didn't have solid evidence.

153
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,180
When you came to me that day,

154
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,020
I knew you had something on your mind.

155
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,340
Though I didn't know what it was,

156
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,820
I was willing

157
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,940
to trust you.

158
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,460
Today, I helped you again.

159
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,620
Will you trust me

160
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,420
in the future?

161
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,860
If there is a next time,

162
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,040
there is no need
to go through so much trouble.

163
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,260
As the Eldest Princess of Great Sui,

164
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
I may be domineering,

165
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,820
but I'm also magnanimous.

166
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,060
I won't lose the big picture
over small things.

167
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,820
So, you can directly tell me

168
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,980
in the future.

169
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,540
(Qinxi Valley)

170
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,620
Your Lordship,

171
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,720
get into the carriage.

172
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,090
I'll wait here.

173
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,020
I'm worried

174
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,140
that you'll catch a cold

175
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,700
waiting here for Ms. Chu.

176
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,140
What if you got a headache or fever?

177
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,020
If you keep talking,

178
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,300
I'll have a headache right now.

179
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,700
Your Lordship,

180
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,940
have you truly thought it through

181
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,300
about your feelings for Ms. Chu?

182
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,980
I have.

183
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,460
Ms. Chu is here.

184
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,860
I can see her.

185
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,460
Does the wound still hurt?

186
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,660
It's fine.

187
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,880
You must've been tired.

188
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,160
I've come to take you home.

189
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,820
Thank you, Young Marquis Wei.

190
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,020
(Yao Mansion)

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,460
How useless.

192
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,940
We had a perfect trap.

193
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,740
How could he escape?

194
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,700
Young Marquis Wei

195
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,860
has never been here before,

196
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,080
nor does he know the layout.

197
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,300
Yet he escaped so quickly.

198
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,060
Does he have

199
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,780
some supernatural ability?

200
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,020
Nonsense.

201
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,580
Someone must've helped him.

202
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,210
Go.

203
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,100
Bring everyone

204
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,040
who was on duty today.

205
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,260
I want to ask them in detail.

206
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,860
Yes.

207
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,700
Hurry up.

208
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,300
Also,

209
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,460
about that assassin
in Qinxi Valley today,

210
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,020
I had him take the opportunity

211
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,960
to gather intelligence.

212
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,620
Instead, he directly attacked Chu Yu.

213
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,020
Has he gone mad?

214
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,300
But he's already dead.

215
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,500
Presumably, he didn't reveal

216
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,440
any other information.

217
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,300
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

218
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,220
Father.

219
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,300
I'm back.

220
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,940
Where is Gu Chusheng?

221
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,140
Why didn't he come back with you?

222
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,460
He's gone to handle a case.

223
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,120
Do you need him for something?

224
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,620
I'll tell him when he returns.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,900
You should rest early.

226
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,060
I heard he was injured today.

227
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,540
What exactly happened?

228
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,060
He was injured today

229
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,340
while saving me.

230
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,740
At this point,

231
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,980
you're still defending him?

232
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,820
Do you really think I don't know

233
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,700
what happened today?

234
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,180
Nowadays,

235
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,900
he still has an ambiguous relationship

236
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
with Ms. Chu.

237
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,820
What does he

238
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,060
take our family for?

239
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,980
Father,

240
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
Chu Yu is a strange woman

241
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,620
who will stop at nothing

242
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,300
to achieve her goals.

243
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,700
I can't compete with her,

244
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,180
nor can I outwit her.

245
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,180
How could Gu, who is so upright,

246
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,180
be a match for her?

247
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,220
I've seen

248
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,440
what kind of woman she is.

249
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,140
You're my daughter.

250
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,620
We won't be pushed around

251
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,980
by a woman.

252
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,860
Don't worry.

253
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,740
Since she bullied you

254
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,620
like this today,

255
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,860
I will definitely not

256
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,340
let her go.

257
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,800
Your Highness, you must've been tired.

258
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,930
I'll take my leave now.

259
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,060
Why the rush?

260
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,460
Grant Hanmei

261
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,220
a seat.

262
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,060
Since such a thing happened

263
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,380
in my place today,

264
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,180
I naturally need

265
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,700
to search thoroughly.

266
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,460
Indeed,

267
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,260
there are two culprits.

268
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,180
You secretly colluded

269
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,820
with the North Qi people.

270
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,240
You passed intelligence

271
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,780
to the North Qi people.

272
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,420
Also...

273
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,540
Hanmei,

274
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
what do you think I should do with them?

275
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm innocent.

276
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,900
I did meet the North Qi people

277
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,760
during my travels,

278
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,500
but I certainly didn't commit treason.

279
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,100
Of course, I know.

280
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

281
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

282
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,700
Kill them.

283
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,020
Kill them right here.

284
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,700
I'm innocent.

285
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,540
I'm innocent!

286
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,980
What fun is there in just killing them?

287
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
Watching the expressions

288
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,260
on the faces of the dying

289
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,740
is the most entertaining.

290
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,380
Hanmei,

291
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,660
do you understand?

292
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,660
The people of Great Sui and North Qi

293
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,360
have suffered from the chaos of war.

294
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,390
You gave me

295
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,580
a new name and a new life.

296
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,080
How could I have any ulterior motives?

297
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,060
Keep running.

298
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,580
Why do you stop now?

299
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,820
Take out your money pouch.

300
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,300
We won't make it hard for you.

301
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,740
Take it out.

302
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,900
Let's go.

303
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,470
Come with me.

304
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,100
From now on,

305
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,040
no one will dare to bully you like this.

306
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,000
If you don't believe me,

307
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,500
then kill me

308
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,000
to prove my innocence.

309
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,900
I don't want to accuse you of anything.

310
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,420
I just don't like being deceived.

311
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Otherwise, your end

312
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,260
will be the same as these two.

313
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,660
Do you understand?

314
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,420
If I really want to win your favor,

315
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,980
wouldn't it be better to say

316
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,920
that I'm from Great Sui?

317
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,180
Although I'm from North Qi,

318
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,980
I've never deceived you.

319
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,700
Your Highness,

320
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,660
you have always known

321
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,540
my heart.

322
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,340
I have never known

323
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,180
your heart.

324
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,060
How could I know?

325
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,620
But Hanmei,

326
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,620
everyone in the world can betray me,

327
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,380
but you must not.

328
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,860
Do you understand?

329
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,980
I won't.

330
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,020
Never.

331
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,020
(Joy)

332
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,180
This is our wedding night.

333
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,100
Where are you going?

334
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,940
We are both tired today.

335
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,660
Let's rest early.

336
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,500
Gu,

337
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,380
I know

338
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,540
today's events have exhausted you.

339
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,620
But we are already married.

340
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,440
In the future,

341
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,540
we still have plenty of time

342
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,580
to get to know each other.

343
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,740
I have waited

344
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,500
for a devoted husband,

345
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,620
so I won't give up easily.

346
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,020
Gu,

347
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,300
since you

348
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,060
have chosen to be my husband,

349
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,500
can we forget

350
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,100
about the past?

351
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,700
If you could forget,

352
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,260
you wouldn't have been so determined
to marry me,

353
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,060
would you?

354
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,220
Give me some time.

355
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,940
Gu Chusheng.

356
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,220
Answer me.

357
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,100
Have you ever considered me

358
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,420
as your wife?

359
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,220
What have I done wrong

360
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,140
to let you treat me like this?

361
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,100
You still love Chu Yu, right?

362
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,380
Answer me.

363
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,260
Answer me!

364
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,220
Gu Chusheng, answer me!

365
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,340
Tell me. Do you still love her?

366
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,940
Do you still love her?

367
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,810
Answer me!

368
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,780
So what if I love her?

369
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,380
What do you take me for?

370
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
I can endure

371
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,700
the loneliness of not sharing a bed.

372
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
I can also help you

373
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,300
cover up in front of my father.

374
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,180
I've done so much for you,

375
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,020
and you just can't see it, can you?

376
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,020
Do you know how sinister

377
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,940
she is?

378
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,250
She is so ruthless,

379
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,220
and you still love her?

380
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,180
You have never let go of her.

381
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,500
So, why did you marry me?

382
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,340
Why do you have to torture me like this?

383
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,500
Don't you know

384
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,420
why I married you?

385
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,080
Take a look.

386
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,470
The Four Treasures of the Study.

387
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,540
Has Miss Song bandaged you?

388
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,940
Should we go to the clinic?

389
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,260
It's all bandaged up.

390
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,100
Let me show you.

391
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,940
I...

392
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,040
No matter what happens in the future,

393
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,460
don't hurt yourself.

394
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,520
It really doesn't hurt.

395
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,660
I'm afraid you're in pain.

396
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,540
Today...

397
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,920
What happened today

398
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,060
is indeed a bit strange.

399
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,820
I originally planned

400
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,940
to use the excuse of an assassin

401
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,020
to stall Yao Yong,

402
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,860
but unexpectedly,

403
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,260
there really was an assassin.

404
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,580
We put on a show,

405
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,300
and they took it seriously.

406
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,940
None of them is easy to deal with.

407
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,100
Yao Yong

408
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,460
is indeed very cunning.

409
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,540
Yes.

410
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,260
You came late today,

411
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,300
and I was worried

412
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,420
that you might be trapped.

413
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,540
I ran into Jue at Yao Mansion.

414
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,460
Jue?

415
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,780
It's me.

416
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,820
Chase!

417
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,060
Get inside.

418
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,840
Yun, why are you here?

419
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,300
Yao Yong might've committed treason.

420
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,780
I came to investigate this.

421
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,580
Jue,

422
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,680
I need a favor from you.

423
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,840
This is the map of Yao Yong's study.

424
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,980
The secret room marked here

425
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
may contain evidence

426
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,080
of Yao Yong's collusion with North Qi.

427
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,540
Feng's death

428
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,160
is also related to him.

429
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,540
Are you willing

430
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,580
to avenge Feng personally?

431
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,300
There is a window
behind the four-poster bed,

432
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
leading to the parapet of the backyard.

433
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,040
You can leave through there.

434
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,340
As for what you want,

435
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,340
I will do my best.

436
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,340
Hurry up and leave.

437
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,780
Yao Yong is not a good person.

438
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,020
If he finds out

439
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,900
that it was Jue who helped you escape,

440
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,460
he won't let her go.

441
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,320
We need to come up with a plan asap

442
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,160
to save Jue.

443
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,950
I was thinking the same thing.

444
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,220
Today, I discovered

445
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,470
that he was hiding weapons at home.

446
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,580
He's planning a rebellion?

447
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,220
These weapons will definitely be moved.

448
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,980
But this trip today

449
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,700
was not entirely in vain.

450
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,240
As a high-ranking official

451
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,540
in the court,

452
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,980
how can Yao Yong do

453
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,340
such outrageous things?

454
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,660
How greedy

455
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,580
can a person be

456
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,220
to never be satisfied?

457
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,120
Great Sui and North Qi
have been at war for years,

458
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,700
and the commoners are suffering.

459
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,020
As for us who are fighting in the war,

460
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,960
we only hope for peace in the world.

461
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,860
How can there be people like him

462
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,260
who don't care about others' lives?

463
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,620
Why should he be able to live well?

464
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,740
Why should he

465
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,940
keep getting promoted?

466
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,340
It's so unfair.

467
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,380
Your Lordship, My Lady,

468
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,420
we're home.

469
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,180
It's been quite a tiring day.

470
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,560
You should rest early.

471
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,940
What's wrong with Ms. Chu?

472
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,700
She looks so dispirited.

473
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,800
Did you confess to her?

474
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,900
Stop your nonsense.

475
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:23,620
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

476
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,300
Among thousands of flowers,

477
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,380
the one I want

478
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,860
is just this one.

479
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,940
I know I can't,

480
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,140
but if it's you,

481
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,020
I want to try once.

482
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,900
Linyang.

483
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,940
Jin has told me everything that happened

484
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,840
at the auction banquet.

485
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
If I had known,

486
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,560
I should have been there.

487
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,420
Linyang,

488
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,340
why are you blaming yourself?

489
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,950
Since you had a plan,

490
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,540
why didn't you tell me?

491
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,860
It's confidential.

492
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,540
To avoid alarming anyone,

493
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,800
I even

494
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,730
kept the Eldest Princess

495
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,700
in the dark.

496
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,420
Besides,

497
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,960
if I had gone back for no reason,

498
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,230
Yao Yong

499
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,680
would've become suspicious.

500
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,300
If you had told me even a little,

501
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,210
I would definitely have been there.

502
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,260
Perhaps,

503
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,160
you wouldn't have been hurt.

504
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,900
I kept it from you

505
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,240
to avoid implicating you

506
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,220
if the plan failed.

507
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,020
Yu,

508
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,220
I had no choice but to agree

509
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,020
to you marrying Wei Jun.

510
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,440
Now, I really don't want you

511
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,700
to risk your life

512
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,310
for the investigation.

513
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,380
Linyang,

514
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,620
it's about Father.

515
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,320
I can't think about anything else.

516
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,140
Nothing is more important to me

517
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,780
than finding out the truth

518
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,180
about Father's death.

519
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,660
I know you hate the taste
of the medicine,

520
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,160
so I brought this topical medicine.

521
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,220
(As your eldest brother,)

522
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,620
(I'm not strong enough,)

523
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,100
(so you have to risk your life.)

524
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,580
Don't you know

525
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,000
what kind of person your father is?

526
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,180
He gave me two choices:

527
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,460
One was the path to success,

528
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,340
which was to marry you;

529
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,780
the other

530
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,220
was the path to death.

531
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,860
If it were you, what would you choose?

532
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,300
I thought

533
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,980
about death,

534
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,260
but what about the grievances

535
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,300
of my parents

536
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,820
and the dozens of lives in my family?

537
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,580
I have to clear their names;

538
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,860
I have to overturn the case.

539
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,140
Clear their names?

540
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,860
Overturn the case?

541
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,780
I don't know anything

542
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,140
about what you're saying.

543
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,180
All I know is that I love you.

544
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,180
What do you see in me,

545
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,500
such an unworthy man?

546
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,480
Chu Yu waited for me for five years,

547
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,380
and I could just marry you.

548
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm following every step

549
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,880
that your father instructed me to take.

550
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,180
What more do you want from me?

551
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
To be good to you?

552
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,000
To fall in love with you?

553
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,020
Gu,

554
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,220
I can learn

555
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,700
those poems and songs

556
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,140
that I don't like for you.

557
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,620
I can even learn from Chu Yu

558
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,840
to be an eccentric

559
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,220
and free-spirited woman for you.

560
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,220
Don't leave me, okay?

561
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,440
We can't go back to the beginning,

562
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,460
nor can we fulfill our own wishes.

563
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,300
We have to swallow the bitter fruit

564
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,540
that we ourselves have sown.

565
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,420
You are like this,

566
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,620
and so am I.

567
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,300
But I am your wife.

568
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,500
Rest early.

569
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,060
Wei Yun,

570
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,060
why are you here?

571
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,580
Just passing by.

572
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,300
The Spring Breeze House is nearby.

573
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,940
Why come here to drink?

574
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,080
What's so good
about the Spring Breeze House?

575
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
It's compartmentalized.

576
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,860
Even for a simple meal

577
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,700
or drink,

578
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,380
one has to put on airs
to seem dignified.

579
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,660
Look.

580
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,900
How nice it is here.

581
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,460
People coming and going,

582
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,940
with hearts close to hearts.

583
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,740
I like it

584
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,900
here.

585
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,820
Ever since we came back
from Qinxi Valley,

586
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,000
you've been in a bad mood.

587
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,240
Is it because of Yao Yong?

588
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,740
Guess

589
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,900
why I'm unhappy

590
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,340
because of Yao Yong.

591
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,300
Is it because of your father?

592
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,100
General Chu spent his whole life
in the military,

593
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,500
devoting everything to Great Sui

594
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,060
and its people,

595
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,740
yet in the end,

596
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,940
he died on the battlefield.

597
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,180
Yet a rat like Yao Yong,

598
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,040
who betrays Great Sui
and sells out his country,

599
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,660
can still live a good life.

600
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,140
You feel wronged,

601
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,020
don't you?

602
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,700
Why should my father

603
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,980
and those soldiers,

604
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,620
who fought so hard for Great Sui,

605
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,620
end up dead?

606
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,980
Why should a traitor

607
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,460
like Yao Yong

608
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,180
enjoy high positions

609
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,460
and rich rewards?

610
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,520
You and I will remember

611
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,380
their sacrifices,

612
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,380
and so will the people of Great Sui.

613
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,540
Our descendants will never forget.

614
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,380
Their sacrifices

615
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,140
will not be in vain.

616
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,080
We've been investigating all the way

617
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,460
from the Arsenal Bureau to Wei Tongfeng,

618
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,060
and now to Yao Yong.

619
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,980
How hard it's been.

620
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,580
We encountered dangers time and again.

621
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,540
Now, we've discovered

622
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,020
that he's suspicious,

623
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,260
but we can't just kill him

624
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,580
with our own hands.

625
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,460
What a pity.

626
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,500
Do you regret it?

627
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,900
Regret?

628
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,820
No.

629
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,840
I've never regretted it.

630
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,540
I will continue the investigation.

631
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,260
No matter how many of them there are,

632
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,860
or how powerful

633
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,420
the forces behind them are,

634
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,500
I will capture them with my own hands.

635
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,300
I will make them kneel before the graves

636
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,700
of our fathers and brothers

637
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,240
and those soldiers who died in battle,

638
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,900
and let them repent.

639
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,020
I will make them kneel forever.

640
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,700
I will do

641
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,340
what I say.

642
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,070
No matter how hard this matter is,

643
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,080
I am willing to do it with you.

644
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,660
Good.

645
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,140
- It's raining.
- It's pouring.

646
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,180
Hurry up.

647
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,620
Wei Yun, come and see.

648
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,660
It's raining.

649
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,580
Landlady.

650
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,960
Two more jugs of Rose Dew.

651
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,060
Coming.

652
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,620
More wine?

653
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,460
I'm not drinking by myself.

654
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,140
I'm drinking with my father.

655
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,020
Wait a moment, here.

656
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,220
This jug

657
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,340
is for my father

658
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,260
and those brave soldiers.

659
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,500
I'll also toast to my parents,

660
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,180
my brothers,

661
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,740
and the soldiers

662
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,180
who died in Baidi Valley.

663
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,220
Also,

664
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,420
to those who sacrificed
their lives for justice

665
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,380
and their families.

666
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,500
To what they did for the war...

667
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,860
No.

668
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,860
To everything they did

669
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,700
for peace.

670
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,140
Stop drinking.

671
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,200
Or you won't be able to go home.

672
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,140
Don't look down on me.

673
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,340
I can never get drunk.

674
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,460
You can never get drunk,

675
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,740
