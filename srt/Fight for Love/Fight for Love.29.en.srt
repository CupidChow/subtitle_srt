00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,620
Stop!

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,340
Deputy Shen,

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,060
what does he mean?

24
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,570
Could it be

25
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,590
a trick?

26
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,570
Never mind.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,060
He's an old acquaintance.

28
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,620
Let's wait; no need to make a move.

29
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,460
Supervisor Gu, what do you mean?

30
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,730
If you don't explain,

31
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,590
I won't know

32
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,900
what you're going to do.

33
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,500
I am willing

34
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,780
to surrender to North Qi.

35
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,410
What did you say?

36
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,850
I can't hear you.

37
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,410
I am willing

38
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,140
to surrender to North Qi.

39
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,170
I'll open the city gates

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,290
and let your soldiers in.

41
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,700
As expected of Supervisor Gu.

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,290
You always know when to yield

43
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,860
and how to adapt.

44
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,170
In that case,

45
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,580
my mounting block is missing.

46
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,120
May I borrow

47
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,930
your shoulders?

48
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,450
Stop!

49
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,500
Stop!

50
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,740
Shen You,

51
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,780
I beg you not to kill anymore.

52
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,170
I'll do anything you ask.

53
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,980
Commander Gao,

54
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,060
after you.

55
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,060
(Sui)

56
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,700
(Dingjun Gate)

57
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Urgent report.

58
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Qingzhou has surrendered.

59
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,400
Fengling is in critical danger.

60
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,970
Greetings, Young Marquis.

61
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,180
No need for formalities.

62
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,100
It was hard to find you.

63
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,570
Please.

64
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,260
I've been lying low in North Qi
for over 20 years,

65
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,170
but I never got inside the royal court.

66
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,460
When your father passed away,

67
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,410
I was heartbroken,

68
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,100
but I dared not act rashly

69
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,930
until recently,

70
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,730
when Yunyang recruited troops

71
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,370
to welcome her son

72
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,270
back to North Qi to claim the throne.

73
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,830
This perfect opportunity

74
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,930
was right at my doorstep.

75
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,650
I couldn't let it slip away

76
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,770
and pledged allegiance to Yunyang.

77
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,200
Then I won her trust

78
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,460
bit by bit.

79
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,770
So, now is indeed

80
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,710
the best time to drive

81
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,600
a wedge between them

82
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,100
and break North Qi apart.

83
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
You chose to take the risk

84
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,850
and send me a letter now.

85
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,920
You must've assessed the situation

86
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,030
and prepared a plan.

87
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,180
You flatter me.

88
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,820
Young Marquis, rest assured,

89
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,460
I have a few tricks

90
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,660
up my sleeve.

91
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,450
In that case,

92
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,330
I'll get straight to the point.

93
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,000
I need an identity

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,180
to infiltrate the royal court

95
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,480
and assassinate Su Can,

96
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,420
forcing them to retreat.

97
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,540
Young Marquis,

98
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,300
we just met,

99
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,080
and you've given me

100
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,540
such a difficult task.

101
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,850
Urgent report!

102
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,320
Urgent report.

103
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,100
Supervisor Gu has surrendered
to the enemy.

104
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,000
Qingzhou City

105
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,940
has fallen.

106
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,020
Gu Chusheng

107
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,850
has surrendered?

108
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,380
(Sui, Qi)

109
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,770
We can't wait any longer.

110
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,540
Now,

111
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,420
there's only one way out.

112
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,780
Young Marquis,

113
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,470
what are your chances of success?

114
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,920
Before death,
I don't ask about the future.

115
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,180
On the battlefield,

116
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,580
I don't weigh pros and cons.

117
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,010
Since this is my choice,

118
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,550
I have to bear

119
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,490
all the consequences.

120
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,300
Chu Yu,

121
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,180
if I can come back alive this time,

122
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,420
I'll take you to a place

123
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,490
with mountains and waters,

124
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,970
away from the world,

125
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,060
and live a peaceful life together.

126
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,260
(Hot Spring Villa)

127
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,950
Are you willing to talk to me today?

128
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,820
You really want to kill me.

129
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,180
I once told you:

130
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,670
The thing I hate the most

131
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,890
is being deceived.

132
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,260
Zhao Yue,

133
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,770
I ask you once more:

134
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,820
Who are you really?

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,220
Do you still remember

136
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,150
the Lord of Qin
who colluded with your enemy?

137
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,460
The woman who had an affair

138
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,770
with him was my mother,

139
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,250
Princess Yunyang of North Qi.

140
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,180
I'm that child born after his death.

141
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,940
I see.

142
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,700
Since you approached me,

143
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,130
you've been deceiving me.

144
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,180
You became my subject

145
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,480
just to covet

146
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,130
the realm of Great Sui.

147
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,550
I actually thought

148
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,770
you were different from others,

149
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,970
and you truly understood me.

150
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,970
Even if I can't kill you,

151
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,940
I won't submit to you.

152
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,820
I'm almost done healing you,

153
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,460
so I won't let you get hurt again.

154
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,030
I'll take you to a place

155
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,270
where you'll never be sad again.

156
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,870
Everyone will bless us there.

157
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,810
But

158
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,180
before that,

159
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,180
I will hold a sacrificial ceremony

160
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,300
in this villa

161
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,710
to seek the blessings of the deer god

162
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,610
for the North Qi soldiers to win.

163
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,780
At that time,

164
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,890
you must attend with me.

165
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,700
Do you know what you're saying?

166
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,790
I am the Princess of Great Sui.

167
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,340
You will marry me sooner or later.

168
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,720
As the future Queen of North Qi,

169
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,220
you surely have to worship with me.

170
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,490
I will never marry you,

171
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,300
nor will I go to worship with you.

172
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,970
Zhao Yue,

173
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,060
you are humiliating me.

174
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,730
Humiliating you?

175
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,600
I want you to worship with me.

176
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,820
That's a unique honor.

177
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,970
You should cherish it.

178
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,580
You're a liar full of deceit.

179
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,330
Yes.

180
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,220
I have lied a thousand times,

181
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,130
but I've never lied

182
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,700
about my love for you.

183
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,330
You love me?

184
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,890
Is that why you deceive me,

185
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,780
imprison me,

186
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,450
humiliate me,

187
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,730
and bring me here?

188
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,080
You might as well just kill me!

189
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,540
Wouldn't it be good to be with me?

190
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,060
In this vast world,

191
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,180
it's just the two of us.

192
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,690
I can give you everything you want.

193
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,370
No one will ever bully you

194
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,970
or humiliate you again.

195
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,840
Look.

196
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,890
I lit all these red candles

197
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,810
in the room for you.

198
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,460
I want you to shine forever.

199
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,660
Marry me,

200
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,910
and be my queen.

201
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,440
You'll be the only queen in the world.

202
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,820
In your dreams!

203
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,610
The Xue Hanmei

204
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,130
I once loved

205
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,820
has died today.

206
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,940
(Gu Chusheng surrendered;
Wei Yun is missing. Shen You)

207
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,780
Good.

208
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,080
Qingzhou is now

209
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,060
within our grasp;

210
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,390
Fengling will soon belong

211
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,460
to North Qi.

212
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,590
It must be the blessing of the deer god.

213
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,620
Therefore, the grand ceremony

214
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,220
must be ensured to be flawless.

215
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,090
I understand.

216
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,780
(Hot Spring Villa)

217
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,570
Commander,

218
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,630
Ms. Chu hasn't come out

219
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,470
since she went in.

220
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,760
What if something has happened?

221
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,900
Don't talk nonsense.

222
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,460
She is Chu Yu.

223
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,340
Nothing will happen to her.

224
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,800
This villa is in a remote location,

225
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,940
guarded by lots of troops.

226
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,230
I sneaked in and probed around.

227
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,370
I found a workshop

228
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,850
underneath the villa.

229
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,020
Good.

230
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,650
You will be the commander this time;

231
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,730
I will follow your lead.

232
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,310
Lately,

233
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,370
they've been busy preparing

234
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,210
for the ceremony
to celebrate their victory.

235
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,560
I will disguise myself as a maid

236
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
and sneak in

237
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,540
to create chaos.

238
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,490
Then everyone can also sneak in

239
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,060
and blow up the workshop.

240
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,690
Lu Qiba,

241
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
this mission is essential.

242
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,460
Everyone must be very careful.

243
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,790
Have you prepared

244
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,790
everything I asked for?

245
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,820
Everything is ready.

246
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,490
Seize the assassin!

247
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,780
Yes.

248
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,980
(If I leave now,)

249
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,710
(Xue Hanmei
will search the entire villa)

250
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,260
(for the assassin,)

251
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,740
(and our squad might be exposed.)

252
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,340
(So,)

253
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,580
(I have to stay.)

254
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,900
Long time no see,

255
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,250
Ms. Chu.

256
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,060
To celebrate our reunion,

257
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,680
I should offer you a cup of wine,

258
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,420
but you seem

259
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,260
rather inconvenient.

260
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,420
Xue Hanmei,

261
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,640
you are the son
of Princess Yunyang, right?

262
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,890
You've been plotting for so long

263
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,480
to scheme against Great Sui.

264
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,670
I am not only

265
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,820
the son of Princess Yunyang,

266
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,510
but also the only descendant

267
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,750
of the Lord of Qin in Great Sui.

268
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,900
I'm Zhao Yue.

269
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,500
Ms. Chu,

270
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,780
you may treat me as your king.

271
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,940
So,

272
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,170
you instigated Yao Yong,

273
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,070
caused 70,000 Wei troops

274
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,030
to die in Baidi Valley,

275
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,200
stole the octagonal crossbow,

276
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,340
and harmed my family.

277
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,300
You did all those things.

278
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,490
Not just these.

279
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,420
Guess again.

280
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,640
I've been hiding in Great Sui for years,

281
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,170
with the Eldest Princess as my cover.

282
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,060
If I only did this much,

283
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,500
wouldn't it be a pity?

284
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,350
Let me tell you the truth.

285
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,620
I also killed

286
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,060
Chancellor Gu.

287
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,510
What a pity.

288
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,500
I intended to proceed slowly,

289
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,500
but I didn't expect

290
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,850
you and Wei Yun to start investigating.

291
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,240
From the moment you deceived

292
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,180
the Eldest Princess,

293
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,450
you should've known

294
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,790
that you'd be exposed one day.

295
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,820
If you hadn't traced to Qinxi Valley

296
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,410
and fabricated the assassination
by North Qi assassins,

297
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,580
she'd never have suspected me.

298
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,610
You forced me

299
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,100
to start the war sooner.

300
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,470
You and Wei Yun have always wanted

301
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,020
to avenge the Chu and Wei families.

302
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,300
Now, you know

303
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,580
that it was me

304
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,000
who killed your father,

305
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,160
wiped out the Wei family,

306
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,820
and killed 70,000 Wei troops.

307
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,940
Chu Yu,

308
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,530
you must hate me.

309
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,790
You harmed my country and family.

310
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,410
We are mortal enemies once we meet.

311
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,860
But, Zhao Yue,

312
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,640
do you deserve the Eldest Princess?

313
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,850
Of course, I do.

314
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,820
How did Emperor Chunde treat her?

315
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,130
He left her full of wounds.

316
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,620
It was I

317
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,690
who healed her bit by bit.

318
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,060
How could you know

319
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,100
how well I've treated her?

320
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,540
I'll try to make her

321
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,960
the Queen of both Great Sui

322
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,900
and North Qi.

323
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,140
What a pity.

324
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,060
You don't understand her at all.

325
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,510
No wonder

326
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,650
she doesn't love you at all.

327
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,410
Since you mentioned Changming...

328
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,820
Lock her up first.

329
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,820
When Changming wakes up,

330
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,070
let her see clearly

331
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,340
the person she misses.

332
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,900
Take her away.

333
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,540
(Wei)

334
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,170
Is the man who came indeed Wei Yun?

335
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,310
Your Majesty,

336
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,160
I have brought

337
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,370
Wei Yun's head

338
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,930
and the Wei token as proof.

339
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,270
How dare you present

340
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,500
such a bloody and filthy thing?

341
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,440
What if it disturbs the Emperor

342
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,380
and the Eldest Princess?

343
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,650
Take it away.

344
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,210
Wait.

345
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,220
(Wei)

346
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,120
(Wei)
It seems that Wei Yun

347
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,820
was really at his wits' end

348
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
and had to take a desperate measure.

349
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,930
He did have some courage,

350
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,240
but unfortunately,

351
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,610
his opponent was me.

352
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,130
How about Qingzhou?

353
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,550
Your Highness,

354
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,540
we've occupied Qingzhou.

355
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,370
There are still some men in the city,

356
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,060
but they are all cowards

357
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,650
and have all surrendered.

358
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Now,

359
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,990
it is the time for our army

360
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,650
to reap the fruits of victory.

361
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,250
Servants,

362
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,370
prepare the armor for me.

363
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,230
I will lead the troops personally

364
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,020
and subdue Qingzhou myself.

365
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:43,860
(Fengling City)

366
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,580
(General's Mansion)

367
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,640
North Qi is attacking again?

368
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,860
Yes.

369
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,970
Report from the scout:

370
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,850
North Qi is going all out

371
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,710
with a determination
to fight to the death.

372
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,250
How many people

373
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,170
do we have left now?

374
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,710
Including the old, weak,
sick, and disabled,

375
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,890
we have just 3,000.

376
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,540
3,000...

377
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,420
That's enough.

378
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,550
Chu Shan, gather everyone

379
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,750
and assemble at the city gate.

380
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,860
The only way

381
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,850
to resolve the crisis in Fengling

382
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,130
is to destroy North Qi's war chariots.

383
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,030
To destroy the war chariots,

384
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,500
we have to get close.

385
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,920
General Chu,

386
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,610
this is going to certain death.

387
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,340
Can't we wait for Ms. Chu?

388
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,480
The enemy won't give us

389
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,420
the time to wait.

390
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,860
Moreover,

391
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,890
how can we pin our hopes

392
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,020
on Yu alone?

393
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,930
Whatever happens on her side,

394
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,580
we must hold on to Fengling

395
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,130
to the death.

396
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,780
If we hold on,

397
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,610
we might also resolve Yu's crisis.

398
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,050
General Chu,

399
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,620
let me go.

400
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,020
If I can die meaningfully,

401
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,100
why not go?

402
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,060
Why cherish life

403
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,580
and fear death?

404
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,300
I'm willing to risk my life

405
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,100
for the country.

406
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,610
To protect my homeland,

407
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,780
even if it means death,

408
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,930
I have no regrets.

409
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,650
But your leg injury hasn't healed.

410
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,610
How can you go to the battlefield?

411
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,130
We have Physician Song, right?

412
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,740
(Peace and Prosperity)

413
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,060
Even if I can't lift a sword

414
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,140
or ride a horse,

415
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,130
you will surely have a way,

416
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,780
right?

417
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,370
You're our military physician.

418
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,740
The octagonal crossbow chariot

419
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,340
is extremely powerful.

420
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,020
We must destroy it.

421
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,450
I want to take a chance.

422
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,930
If I help you return to the battlefield,

423
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,020
it'd be like sending you
to certain death.

424
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,170
That'd be too cruel for me.

425
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,740
If my death

426
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,740
can protect this city,

427
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,260
the people you save

428
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,370
will not just be me.

429
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,980
Do you think I want to stop you?

430
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,260
You're underestimating me.

431
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,930
I've always known

432
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,200
that the man I like

433
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,640
is a brave

434
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,580
great hero,

435
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,650
who has long put life aside

436
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,130
to protect the people of the city,

437
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,170
and is not afraid of death.

438
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,410
Linyang,

439
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,610
since I understand you,

440
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,540
how could I not support you?

441
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,720
I will use silver needles

442
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,300
to seal your five acupoints,

443
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,140
including Yongquan,

444
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,210
Xuehai,

445
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,690
Chengshan,

446
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,930
Futu, and Jiexi.

447
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,790
Then I'll use Chuan Xiong,

448
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,680
Ru Xiang,

449
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,620
Wu Ling Zhi,

450
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,010
and Yu Jin

451
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,020
to make a medicine.

452
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,790
In this way,

453
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,340
you will not feel pain

454
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,070
and can walk and ride

455
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,170
like a normal person.

456
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,540
But the effect only lasts for two hours.

457
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,400
After two hours...

458
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,500
That's enough.

459
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,940
Thank you,

460
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,500
Miss Song.

461
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,820
Linyang,

462
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,200
can you call me

463
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,260
Tuantuan one more time?

464
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,110
The one who treated you before
was Tuantuan,

465
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,050
and the one who sends you
to the battlefield now

466
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,790
is also Tuantuan.

467
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,970
Thank you,

468
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,140
Tuantuan.

469
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:06,260
(Fengling City)

470
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,300
Everyone knows

471
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,480
that if we lose Fengling,

472
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,130
North Qi can drive straight to Huajing,

473
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,230
and Great Sui will be in danger.

474
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,010
We cannot

475
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,900
lose

476
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,490
this battle.

477
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,890
The key to winning this battle

478
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,750
lies in the octagonal crossbow chariot.

479
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,890
The war chariot seems to be powerful,

480
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,650
but it has

481
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,580
a fatal weakness.

482
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,530
-Weakness?
-What is it?

483
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,620
I don't know.

484
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,540
The mechanism on the North Qi chariot

485
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,620
is very fragile.

486
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,820
If it is hit by brute force

487
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,170
during the firing process,

488
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,050
the war chariot
will not be able to operate.

489
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,960
It's like the vital spot of a snake.

490
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,340
- Understood.
- That's true.

491
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,510
Now, it's easier.

492
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,720
Just hit this spot.

493
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,740
Yes, yes.

494
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,090
General Chu,

495
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,710
the war chariot is in the enemy's camp.

496
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,260
If we want to smash the mechanism,

497
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,380
wouldn't that mean...

498
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,860
Kid,

499
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,620
isn't that

500
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,260
just nonsense?

501
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
It's so far away.

502
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,590
Even a deity

503
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,730
wouldn't be able to shoot it.

504
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,730
We have

505
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,610
to face them

506
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,730
head-on.

507
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Some of us

508
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,060
have to charge there

509
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,580
and engage in close combat.

510
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,740
Naturally, those who go

511
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,540
will surely not return.

512
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,900
This...

513
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,140
This...

514
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,610
Am I right,

515
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,260
General Chu?

516
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,450
How dare you!

517
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,650
You are right.

518
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,060
This is indeed

519
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,340
a one-way trip.

520
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,410
Even so,

521
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,380
is there anyone

522
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,250
willing to follow me?

523
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,980
I'm willing to follow you

524
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,050
and fight for Great Sui.

525
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,100
Kid,

526
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,650
how can you be so blind?

527
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,900
With grandfathers like us here,

528
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,940
when is it your turn to show off?

529
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,580
Get back.

530
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,380
General Chu,

531
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,650
have you forgotten

532
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,170
that we joined the army

533
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,460
because

534
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,810
we were bored?

535
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Brothers,

536
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,820
step forward.

537
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,100
General Chu,

538
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,220
I'm Zhang Huan.

539
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,820
I'm Wang Chang.

540
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,780
I'm Shi Lüguang.

541
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,900
I'm Yang An.

542
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,260
I'm Zhao Shitou.

543
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,780
I'm Wang Huan.

544
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,060
Six former generals

545
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,540
who once served

546
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,780
General Chu Jianchang

547
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,540
request to go into battle.

548
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,900
You used to serve my father?

549
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,810
Like father, like son.

550
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,210
We are determined

551
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,380
to destroy the war chariot

552
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,020
and defend Fengling with our lives.

553
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,020
With your help,

554
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,730
we can surely do this.

555
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,380
Chu Shan,

556
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,690
you'll be in charge

557
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,260
of the city defense

558
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,770
this time.

559
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,980
Can you do that?

560
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,460
I won't fail!

561
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,220
- Slowly.
- Give me a hand.

562
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,360
- Coming.
- Anyone there?

563
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,220
- Help!
- Thanks.

564
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,240
Give me a hand.

565
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,070
Help over there.

566
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,360
- Let me.
- I can do it myself.

567
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,300
It's okay.

568
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,450
Let me.

569
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

570
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,000
I'll take care of this for you.

571
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,940
Thank you.

572
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,130
Come on.

573
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,050
Wenchang.

574
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,710
Are you okay?

575
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,880
- I'm fine.
- Thanks.

576
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,800
We have to settle

577
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,640
everyone down first.

578
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,550
Report!

579
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,550
Qingzhou has fallen.

580
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,740
Supervisor Gu has surrendered.

581
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,860
Wenchang,

582
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,030
where are you going?

583
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,960
To rescue.

584
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,740
Going there now is
like walking into a trap.

585
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,840
I've noticed that your mood has been off

586
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,900
since we left Qingzhou.

587
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Song Wenchang,

588
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,300
calm down.

589
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,540
I can't calm down at all.

590
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,970
Let go.

591
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,050
Let go!

592
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,260
Get lost!

593
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,970
Jin.

594
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,380
Why are you here?

595
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,490
Jin, you slapped me.

596
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,510
You punched your brother,

597
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,450
so I slapped you.

598
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,050
What?

599
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,320
Are you going to slap me?

600
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,980
If Shen You hadn't found out

601
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,130
that I was not Yun,

602
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,830
Qingzhou wouldn't have fallen.

603
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,730
I've failed Yun

604
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,290
and everyone's trust.

605
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,710
I want to make up for it.

606
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,260
Am I wrong?

607
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,770
None of these is wrong.

608
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,930
If you don't even dare to
make up for it,

609
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,230
I wouldn't have come,

610
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,610
let alone slap you.

611
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,360
I slapped you

612
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,770
to make you calm down

613
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,500
and think clearly

614
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,420
about what you can do

615
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,690
and what you should do.

616
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,250
I know you're very confused now.

617
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,100
You take on all those things

618
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,770
and rush back to Qingzhou

619
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,900
because you feel guilty inside.

620
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,330
You keep working to help them,

621
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,690
not because you're not tired,

622
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,330
but because

623
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,210
you're afraid to see

624
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,850
everyone's disappointed faces

625
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,980
in your dreams.

626
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,100
I'm not good enough.

627
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,670
Yun gave me

628
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,710
such an important task,

629
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,650
and I promised him

630
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,610
I could do it.

631
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,100
I thought I was

632
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,060
a very brave man,

633
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,450
but I didn't expect

634
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,250
that Shen You's arrow

635
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,100
would expose my flaw.

636
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,580
Stop belittling yourself.

637
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,940
If you were really a coward,

638
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,730
I wouldn't bother to talk to you.

639
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,230
Whether it's living a life

640
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,330
or finding a husband,

641
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,550
my standards

642
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,610
are top-notch.

643
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,090
Song Wenchang,

644
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,940
don't ever let me down.

645
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,250
Though you meant well,

646
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,740
that slap

647
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,290
was indeed too harsh.

648
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,480
He promised me he wouldn't go to war,

649
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,350
and he broke his word.

650
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,110
I haven't settled the account
with him yet.

651
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,710
He's just too much trouble,

652
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,590
making me travel

653
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,530
all the way to Qingzhou.

654
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,290
This slap is actually nothing.

655
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,540
So, you came

656
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,460
because you were worried about me.

657
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,670
What are you talking about?

658
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,540
I was just passing by.

659
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,980
You don't mean it,

660
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,380
but it doesn't matter.

661
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,520
I know it when you're telling the truth.

662
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,360
Alright.

663
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,000
This is not the time to talk about that.

664
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,630
Let's discuss how

665
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,060
to resolve the situation in Qingzhou.

666
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,900
I believe Chusheng
didn't really surrender.

667
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
There must be a reason

668
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,290
behind his actions.

669
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,540
But the North Qi people
are born brutal.

670
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,740
I'm worried

671
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,450
that Chusheng

672
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,020
is now in extreme danger.

673
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,630
When we captured Xu Lingzhang,

674
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,280
we used the secret passage in Qingzhou.

675
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,160
This time, we can also take
the secret passage

676
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,100
to find Supervisor Gu.

677
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,040
Once we find Chusheng,

678
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,010
maybe we can find

679
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,820
a breakthrough from him.

680
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,280
There's no time to waste.

681
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,180
Let's count our numbers

682
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,140
and set off immediately.

683
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,010
Shilan,

684
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,300
sorry about that punch.

685
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,550
Consider it a debt.

686
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,710
Once we retake Qingzhou,

687
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,810
I'll settle it with you.

688
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,060
Go at ease.

689
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,980
Leave it to me and Wanyue.

690
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,640
We'll take care of everyone here.

691
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,500
Thank you, Ms. Chu Jin.

692
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,530
Let's go.

693
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,780
Song Wenchang,

694
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,650
although I said

695
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,150
I would never marry

696
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,610
a man who goes to war,

697
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,010
it's not

698
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,510
impossible to make

699
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,940
a small exception.

700
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,490
So,

701
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,250
come back safely.

702
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,190
What's wrong?

703
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,580
Did I touch your wound?

704
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,970
No, no.

705
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,130
I'm okay.

706
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,650
I'm totally fine.

707
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,340
I'm off then.

708
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,420
