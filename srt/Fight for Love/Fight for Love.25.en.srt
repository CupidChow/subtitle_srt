(Chu Mansion)

22
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,150
It's all my fault.

23
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,270
Today,

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,710
they got accused

25
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,190
and insulted.

26
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,950
It's all because of me.

27
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,520
I never thought

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
it would turn out like this.

29
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,360
I owe them an apology.

30
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,710
My Lady,

31
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,750
tomorrow, I will

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,960
have a new plaque made

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,190
for this family

34
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,520
and have the gate

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,540
repainted entirely.

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
What do you say?

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
How about

38
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,310
we track down the people

39
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,150
who spread rumors

40
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,990
and beat them up?

41
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,430
Don't worry.

42
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,840
I'm a member of this family.

43
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,030
Gossip like that

44
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,870
won't break me.

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
I'll deal with this.

46
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,910
I won't cause any more trouble.

47
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,710
There's...

48
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,270
My Lady,

49
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,240
there's one more thing.

50
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,750
Young Marquis Wei was whipped

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,590
as punishment.

52
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,430
My Lady.

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
I always saw myself

54
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,960
as someone who'd follow her heart,

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,520
no matter the cost,

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,680
and no matter the dangers.

57
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,750
But I never imagined

58
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,470
what I chose

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,910
would get so many people in trouble.

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,240
All I know is that

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,470
you must be doing what's right.

62
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,470
My Lady.

63
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,480
I need some time alone.

64
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:52,220
(Chu Mansion)

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
I know you blame me.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
Give me some time.

67
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
What's your plan?

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
To marry someone again,

69
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
like last time?

70
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,160
Linyang told you everything?

71
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,590
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,360
Jin.

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,430
I still can't forgive you

74
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,040
for our family business.

75
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,160
But before,

76
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,430
I was wrong to blame you.

77
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
A mistake is a mistake.

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,270
I'm brave enough to apologize.

79
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,270
Yu,

80
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,520
I'm sorry.

(Chu Mansion)

82
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,270
Don't worry.

83
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,120
Wei Yun and I care for each other.

84
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,430
But I would never

85
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,600
harm either his family

86
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,720
or our own.

89
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,390
(Chu Mansion)
what you'll have to face?

90
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,360
Do you know

91
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,120
how people will slander her?

92
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
Well done!

93
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,950
What's the point of your doing this?

94
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,360
What good is it to you?

95
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,270
Don't you understand?

96
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,870
No matter how pure your love is,

97
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,560
it will be considered dirty.

98
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
(What can I do)

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,360
(to clear Chu Yu's name?)

(Song Wenchang, Chu Jin)

103
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Why are you all here?

104
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,750
We heard what happened to your family.

105
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,600
Last night, Wenchang

106
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,030
guarded your gate all night.

107
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,510
He didn't come back home

108
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,360
until all trouble was gone.

109
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
It's not just us.

110
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,630
Everyone is worried about Mrs. Wei.

111
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
Look over there.

112
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,360
Madams of the Wei family have come.

113
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,320
And Young Marquis Wei.

114
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,030
We're here today

115
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
for our family.

116
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,150
I don't approve of your relationship.

117
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,600
But I'll never allow any gossip

118
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,240
to tarnish the Wei's reputation.

119
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,240
So many people are here for Ms. Chu Yu.

120
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,240
You may rest assured.

121
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,270
My sister is fabulous.

122
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,270
I have nothing to worry about.

123
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
Thank you.

All our plates are up there together.

(Wang Lan)
No matter what happens,

132
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
we will face it together.

133
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
Looks like the world

134
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,910
isn't as despicable

135
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,960
as we imagined.

136
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
How is Yu doing?

137
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
It's family business.

138
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
Not to worry.

139
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,630
If you had handled it properly,

140
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,030
that wouldn't have happened yesterday.

141
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,270
Young Master Sun met a hooded woman

142
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,790
in the restaurant.

143
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,480
So, someone instigated him.

144
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,670
Our guess isn't groundless.

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
Ordinary people

146
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,270
couldn't easily make up

147
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,200
what was in that script.

148
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,600
And it spread so fast

149
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,870
in Huajing City.

150
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
They must have had a plan.

151
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
Mr. Gu, I'll ask you one thing.

152
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,360
Do you know

153
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,160
that woman?

154
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,920
You suspect me?

155
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,000
If I were behind all this,

156
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,360
I would have killed you.

157
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,510
Why would I make her sad?

158
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,510
Instead of making wild accusations,

159
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,750
why don't you find out

160
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,360
who the mastermind is?

161
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,910
If you can't handle this,

162
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,720
then let go of her.

163
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,510
Hope you aren't involved.

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,080
What are you going to do?

165
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,150
To find out the mastermind.

166
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,600
No need for you to bother.

167
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,000
My men are working on it.

168
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,550
If you can't protect her,

169
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,120
I will get her

170
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
back to me.

171
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,280
Don't forget.

172
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,510
She's Mrs. Wei.

173
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,510
You stand no chance.

174
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,870
Are you sure

175
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,240
Guo Liu comes here

176
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,080
around this time?

177
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,440
Rest assured.

178
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,800
I monitored for days.

179
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,840
He will come.

180
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,990
Good luck.

181
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
Thank you for that.

182
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,840
There he is.

183
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,870
That's him.

184
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,360
Alright.

185
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,320
Pack this up for me.

186
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,570
No problem.

187
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,960
Take it, please.

188
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,250
Welcome back.

189
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,450
Here's the money.

190
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,290
Alright.

191
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,870
Who are you?

192
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,920
Someone to catch you.

193
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,240
Oh, it hurts.

194
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Be gentle, please.

195
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
Let go.

196
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,080
Chu Yu.

197
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,560
My Lady?

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,910
Why are you here?

199
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,030
To find the origin of the rumors.

200
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,600
Or would he come to me?

201
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,790
What do you want?

202
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,120
To take you to court.

203
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,630
Move.

204
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,670
How dare you kidnap me

205
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,670
in broad daylight?

206
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,230
It hurts so much.

207
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,240
That's Her Ladyship.

208
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,750
Just like a warrior.

209
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,960
Right?

210
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,200
She's Chu Yu, after all.

211
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,820
(Court of Judicial Review)

212
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,700
What's that noise?

213
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,000
What's going on here?

214
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,920
What...

215
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,510
What is Mrs. Wei doing?

216
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,670
So, the rumors

217
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,630
are true.

218
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,750
She's indeed a shrew.

219
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,030
Chu Yu, Wei Yun.

220
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,510
What do you think you're doing?

221
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,360
(Court of Judicial Review)
Why am I here?

222
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,510
It's no use going

223
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,350
to court.

224
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,030
Everyone knows the two of you

225
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,870
are intimate.

226
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,240
You're taking revenge,

227
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,080
trying to accuse me

228
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,960
and do me injustice!

229
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,480
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Spare me.

230
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,840
I don't know anything.

231
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,360
This case involves a lot.

232
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,720
Your simple explanations

233
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,910
can't write it off.

234
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,600
We've brought you here

235
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,000
just for justice.

236
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,560
Get them in.

237
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,990
Move.

238
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,360
Move.

239
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,630
I'm innocent.

240
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,560
I always knew

241
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,840
Mrs. Wei would

242
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,270
cause trouble sooner or later.

243
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,960
See? Before we knew it,

244
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,510
she caused such big trouble.

245
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,030
No wonder when I visited

246
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,600
Young Marquis Wei for a blind date,

247
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,840
Mrs. Wei

248
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
wasn't nice to me.

249
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,720
And she faked it there.

250
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,040
Such a "good" woman

251
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,910
from the Chu family.

252
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,750
Don't talk nonsense!

253
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,000
Chu Jin, you're such a fence-sitter.

254
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,960
Usually, you complained a lot to us

255
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,840
about your sister.

256
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,790
But now, you pretend you care about her.

257
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,120
Shut up. That's my business.

258
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,150
You can't slander her.

259
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,080
Alright. Stop pulling her.

260
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,600
I can't beat Chu Yu,

261
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,480
but I can beat you.

262
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,960
- Let go.
- You let go.

263
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,870
I won't!

264
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,030
- Let go.
- You let go.

265
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,630
Let go.

266
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,970
- Let go of them.
- You let go!

267
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,600
You let go.

268
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,590
Ji...

269
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,800
Jin?

270
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,960
Mr. Song, come help us.

271
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,960
(Oh no. Why is he around again?)

272
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,390
Jin, Jin.

273
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,120
Are they bullying you?

274
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,390
Mr. Song, can't you see

275
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,630
she's actually hitting us?

276
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
They started it

277
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,360
by insulting my sister.

278
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,920
I...

279
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,000
I've always been delicate.

280
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,150
But they're weaker.

281
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,720
Wait.

282
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,030
We aren't in a relationship.

283
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,960
Why am I explaining

284
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,800
this much?

285
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,630
Jin, this is your true color

286
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,510
when you defend her.

287
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I like you even more.

288
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,350
Easy for you to say.

289
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,750
If you're with me now,

290
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,680
you'll be slandered, too.

291
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,520
I don't care.

292
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,680
I got to know you

293
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,520
before those rumors.

294
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,270
Let's go see the fun.

295
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,310
I heard His Lordship

296
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,270
took Young Master Sun

297
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,230
and the storyteller

298
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,510
to the court for a trial.

299
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,510
- Come with me.
- Hurry.

300
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,880
Jin, let's go take a look.

301
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,270
Come on. Let's go there.

302
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,170
Let's take a look.

303
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,310
She's indeed the woman I like.

304
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,750
Jin, Jin.

305
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,620
(Plaint, Plaintiff: Chu Yu)

306
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,260
(Chu Yu)

307
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,640
Make way, please.

308
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,920
Excuse me.

309
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,070
Come on. Make way, please.

310
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,750
Jin, why is your sister here?

311
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,160
Mr. Gu, I hereby accuse Guo Liu

312
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,000
of selling and storytelling

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,750
the Romance of the Marquis.

314
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,000
He spread rumors

315
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,920
to slander the Marquis of Zhenguo

316
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
as well as me.

317
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,000
Young Master Sun instigated some people

318
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,830
to splash ink at the gate of my mansion

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,480
to insult the martyrs of our country

320
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
as well as my family.

321
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,080
Mr. Gu,

322
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,520
please do me justice.

323
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,000
Was she telling the truth?

324
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,350
My Lord,

325
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
I'm innocent.

326
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,240
You must answer properly.

327
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,830
Mr. Gua asked

328
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,830
whether you did those things.

329
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,590
What if I did?

330
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,310
I didn't do anything wrong.

331
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,110
My Lord,

332
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
you can't defend Mrs. Wei

333
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,200
just because

334
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,510
she was your sweetheart.

335
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,640
The affair between the two of them

336
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,680
is obvious.

337
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,550
Isn't it?

338
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,350
- Yeah.
- That's right.

339
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,030
We all know about that.

340
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,790
Young Master Sun is right.

341
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,880
Mrs. Wei and Mr. Gu

342
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,070
had a relationship.

343
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,960
That's right.

344
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
In that case,

345
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,200
Mr. Gu will certainly defend her.

346
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,350
This is ridiculous.

347
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,440
My sister has nothing

348
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,550
to do with Mr. Gu.

349
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,920
- I'll rip his lips
- Calm.

350
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,030
and smash them.

351
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,030
Jin, calm down.

352
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,030
Why does she defend her?

353
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,000
Since I've dared to come,

354
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
I'm not afraid of being judged.

355
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,000
Right here

356
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,960
in plain sight,

357
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,070
if Mr. Gu

358
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,400
shows favoritism,

359
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,800
I will

360
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,200
accept my punishment.

361
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,400
Why did Mr. Gu take off his hat?

362
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,780
(Fair and Incorruptible)

363
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,720
Please rest assured.

364
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,640
If I neglect my duty

365
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,920
and do something unfair,

366
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,480
I'll take the blame upon myself

367
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,110
and step aside.

368
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,280
Based on the plaint

369
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,790
from Mrs. Wei,

370
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,420
the Romance of the Marquis

371
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,160
constitutes defamation and rumor.

372
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,750
In that case,

373
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,350
the two of you

374
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,830
violated our law

375
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,870
of false accusation.

376
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,790
50 flogging for each.

377
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,040
The fine is 20 taels.

378
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,830
20 floggings can kill a man.

379
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,070
Not to mention 50.

380
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,880
Mrs. Wei

381
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,720
and Your Lordship,

382
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,350
the stories may be exaggerated.

383
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,510
But do you dare to admit

384
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,160
that they aren't groundless?

385
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,680
If the two of you

386
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,520
are really innocent,

387
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,000
why are your plates

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,920
up there together

389
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,270
in Tugu Temple?

390
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,960
Tugu Temple has been

391
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,830
a place for prayers.

392
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,550
Anyone can hang

393
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,390
his plate there.

394
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,110
I had it investigated.

395
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,150
Up there,

396
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,920
more plates have been hung,

397
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,510
besides theirs.

398
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,200
What if

399
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,510
only our plates are up there?

400
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,680
Does that give you the right

401
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,550
to spread rumors

402
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,510
or tarnish my family's reputation?

403
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,310
What if I truly have feelings

404
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,520
for Wei Yun?

405
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,960
Is a woman only chaste

406
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,960
if she remains a widow her entire life

407
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,400
and stays loyal?

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,200
If this is what makes a good woman,

409
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I want nothing to do with it.

410
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,510
I'm not a woman who relies on a man

411
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,440
or hides behind one.

412
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Even if you all criticize me,

413
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,200
I won't be scared.

414
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,270
I'm responsible for what I do.

415
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,240
But...

416
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,440
You took advantage of my family.

417
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,880
A man like you

418
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,510
isn't even as courageous

419
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,350
as a woman like me.

420
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,200
Jin,

421
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,510
your sister is truly

422
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,560
one of a kind.

423
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,760
Of course.

424
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,240
Ms. Chu Yu has a point.

425
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,150
Young Master Sun,

426
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,200
seeing is believing.

427
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,240
Show us some evidence.

428
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,080
That's right.

429
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,070
You can't slander her
by making up stories.

430
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,070
Mr. Gu,

431
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,510
the world shouldn't be like this.

432
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

433
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,880
Someone instigated me

434
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,200
to do such absurd things.

435
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,240
That day, I only meant

436
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,790
to see some fun, My Lord.

437
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,480
Just now, you sounded so confident.

438
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,830
But now,

439
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,030
Young Master Sun admitted

440
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,200
that he was instigated.

441
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,390
Guo Liu,

442
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,560
what about you?

443
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,590
If you don't have evidence,

444
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,310
the two of you

445
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,830
will be guilty of making trouble

446
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,270
and spreading rumors.

447
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,870
Guards.

448
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,110
Bring the rods.

449
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Wait, wait.

450
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,440
My Lord,

451
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,920
I... I will confess.

452
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,960
I indeed compiled

453
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,960
the Romance of the Marquis.

454
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,510
But someone asked me to do that.

455
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,590
Who?

456
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,160
A few days ago,
after I finished working,

457
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,790
a hooded woman

458
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,800
came to me.

459
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,350
She said if I made up a story

460
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,720
about the two of them,

461
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,720
she would give me 50 taels.

462
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,440
My Lord,

463
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,400
if you don't believe me,

464
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,830
send someone to search my house.

465
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,070
I didn't dare to spend the money.

466
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,510
It's still under my bed.

467
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,960
That woman was generous.

468
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,270
Did you hear?

469
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,510
My sister is innocent.

470
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,000
If you keep gossiping again,

471
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,920
I'll even tear out

472
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,760
your tongues.

473
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,750
- Exactly.
- Right.

474
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,590
You just do it

475
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,540
and I'll back you up.

476
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,430
Guo Liu.

477
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,720
Did you see clearly

478
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,560
that woman's looks?

479
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,240
I did.

480
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,000
I remember the clothes she wore.

481
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,310
The jade bracelet on her wrist

482
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,270
is of good quality.

483
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,790
She's either rich or noble.

484
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,960
Maybe

485
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,440
she's the concubine of some official.

486
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,030
Or maybe

487
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,830
she's the maid of a noble lady.

488
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,150
Guo Liu,

489
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,790
you draw that storybook.

490
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,310
Now, you must draw

491
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,630
whatever you remember

492
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,310
about that woman

493
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,110
to help with our investigation.

494
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,030
Yes, yes. No problem, My Lord.

495
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:00,020
(Court of Judicial Review)

496
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,200
The woman who urged me

497
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,160
was similarly dressed.

498
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,590
Yes, yes. The same woman.

499
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,270
My Lord, I've confessed everything.

500
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,920
Please don't flog me.

501
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,030
My Lord,

502
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,590
can I leave now?

503
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,640
Can I leave too?

504
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,840
Leave?

505
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,510
Mr. Guo, do you think

506
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,790
you simply spread some rumors

507
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,440
which didn't harm any people

508
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,440
and that means you were kind enough?

509
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,000
Young Master Sun,

510
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,440
do you feel aggrieved

511
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,480
because you think

512
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,440
you just did something

513
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,680
someone else instigated you to do?

514
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,520
Do you have any idea?

515
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,640
Rumors have thorns

516
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,510
even sharper than blades

517
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,350
on the battlefield.

518
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,550
They kill people

519
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,310
as quickly, too.

520
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,270
You're cowards, anyway.

521
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,550
You only dared to hurt a woman.

522
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,270
You called her "shameless".

523
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,520
Do you think

524
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,640
this can make terrible people

525
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,920
like you feel very proud?

526
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,590
Do you dare

527
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,880
to insult me, the Marquis?

528
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,000
No, no, no.

529
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,040
Guards.

530
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,350
Put the two of them

531
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,680
into prison,

532
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
awaiting their flogging.

533
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,160
- Spare me.
- Spare me.

534
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,350
Mercy, My Lord.

535
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,830
I beg for mercy, My Lord.

536
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,960
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

537
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,630
Court is adjourned.

538
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
(Fair Execution)

539
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,040
Come on.

540
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,750
Let's leave.

541
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,590
We should go.

542
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,630
Thank you for today.

543
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,950
Don't say that.

544
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,510
Regardless of the reason,

545
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,920
I don't want to see or hear people

546
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,680
gossip about the two of you.

547
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,590
You can think of it

548
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,650
as I'm benefiting myself.

549
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,950
Let's go talk to her.

550
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,960
It's Xiang who serves Her Highness.

551
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,940
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

552
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,540
(Court of Judicial Review)
I'm Gu.

553
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,640
We're working on a case.

554
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,700
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

555
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,790
Greetings, Your Lordship,

556
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,750
My Lady,

557
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,590
and My Lord.

558
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,550
Where's Her Highness?

559
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,740
I didn't see her all the way.

560
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,560
All the followers are gone, too.

561
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,720
For your information,

562
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,400
they all went to the villa

563
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,240
out of town to see the blooms.

564
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,920
Wherever she went,

565
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,760
she usually took you.

566
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,800
This time,

567
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,750
why did she leave you behind?

568
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,350
Her Highness ordered me

569
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,310
to do the cleaning here.

570
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,720
I simply follow orders.

571
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,870
I dare not doubt.

572
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,950
Are you saying

573
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,510
you've been doing everything

574
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,720
under Her Highness's order?

575
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,160
I work for Her Highness.

576
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,720
I certainly take her orders.

577
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,920
Do you mean

578
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,590
it's also Her Highness who told you

579
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,750
to make up the stories

580
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,510
and spread rumors?

581
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,550
Your Lordship, I don't know

582
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,790
what you mean.

583
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,760
This is the evidence.

584
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,240
Do you still deny it?

585
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,680
Guo Liu sketched this woman.

586
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,920
Dare you deny it?

587
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,200
Why did you spread rumors in town?

588
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,960
This bracelet is popular in town.

589
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,240
This portrait is somewhat similar.

590
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,720
How can you be sure it's me?

591
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,240
Why are you sure

592
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,440
that no one set this trap

593
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,700
- for me?
- My Lord.

594
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,310
I found it under a bench.

595
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,420
(Xiang is behind the assassination
and Yao Yong's rebellion.)

596
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,240
Take her away.

597
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

598
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,280
Stop.

599
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,310
Who is in the carriage?

600
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,560
The city is locked.

601
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,680
No one can go out.

602
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,720
Her Highness is feeling upset.

603
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
So, she asked His Majesty

604
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,070
for an edict to leave the city.

605
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,640
Let us pass now.

606
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,180
(The Eldest Princess
has the privilege to leave the city.)

607
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,920
What?

608
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,840
Will you even

609
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,240
trap Her Highness in town?

610
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,110
How dare you?

611
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,150
Let them pass.

612
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:58,900
(Huajing City)

613
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,350
(The end is left uncertain.)

614
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,680
(I, Zhao Yue, will not give up.)

615
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:35,540
(Court of Judicial Review)

616
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,240
When Xiang was taken back,

617
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,270
she confessed it

618
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,400
even before she was tortured.

619
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,550
She's a spy from North Qi

620
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,750
and Princess Yunyang's adopted daughter.

621
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,790
The pattern

622
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,720
we found in the letters

623
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,910
is the code she used

624
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,950
for Yao Yong.

625
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,200
She confessed to all those cases

626
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,440
where Yao Yong rebelled

627
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
and Shen assassinated.

628
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,920
But I don't think

629
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,680
she is the real mastermind.

630
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,440
Indeed.

631
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,040
It happened too suddenly,

632
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,920
as if someone had exposed her

633
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,550
just to divert attention.

634
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,430
Indeed.

635
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,390
However,

636
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,440
the clue obtained from Yao Yong,

637
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,960
the evidence at Qinxi Valley,

638
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,400
and Her Highness's letter...

639
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,440
All these things

640
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,440
point to Xiang.

641
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,550
She will be interrogated.

642
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,240
Then, we will know

643
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,440
the truth.

644
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,840
Chu Yu,

645
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,590
will you agree if I want

646
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,240
a private talk now?

647
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,240
Yun, you can go ahead.

648
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,420
(Court of Judicial Review)

649
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,620
(Spring Breeze House)

650
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,640
Thank you

651
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,830
for helping me today.

652
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,440
You were brave enough.

653
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,750
I heard you had the divorce paper.

654
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,240
Now, the rumors are gone.

655
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,560
But they still hurt.

656
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,430
Yu,

657
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,830
I have something to tell you.

658
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
Wang Linlang and I are divorced.

659
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,950
Now, I can finally

660
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,960
do what I want.

661
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,430
Will you

662
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,520
marry me?

663
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,480
I carved this for you.

664
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,070
I'm surprised to see it.

665
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,750
But I thought

666
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,880
I made myself very clear to you.

667
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,440
I just want to show you

668
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,200
how much you liked me.

669
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,560
What if you forget?

670
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,480
But now,

671
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,400
I won't like anyone.

672
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,350
I can offer you a deal.

673
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,750
You're working on North Qi spies.

674
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,070
I believe you can see.

675
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,750
In this matter,

676
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,200
I do as well as Wei Yun.

677
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,510
I have enough faith and evidence

678
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,960
for further investigation.

679
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,560
Yu,

680
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,590
I will soon become

681
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,750
a third-grade minister.

682
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,400
After some time,

683
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,600
I'll be head of civil officials.

684
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
In the court

685
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,110
or out of it,

686
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,550
I won't lose to Wen Yun.

687
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,880
If he can't do something,

688
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,070
I can do it.

689
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,480
If he can't find something,

690
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,710
I can find it for you.

691
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,070
Now, the Crown Prince

692
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,550
relies a lot on me, too.

693
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,670
You want to trade your marriage again?

694
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,510
Yes.

695
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,550
You can think of it as a deal.

696
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,150
But my feelings are true.

697
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
You and Wei Yun

698
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,400
aren't a rightful couple.

699
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,640
But now,

700
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,920
I can protect you

701
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,760
in the rightful way.

702
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,280
Even if you don't like me

703
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,590
as much as you did before,

704
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,480
you should at least be good to yourself.

705
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,120
Gu Chusheng,

706
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,190
you really haven't changed a bit.

707
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,200
Yu,

708
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,550
you can try to like me one more time.

709
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,840
I've changed.

710
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,590
Before, I did the wrong thing

711
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
and broke your heart.

712
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,960
But I'll make it up to you

713
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,030
for the rest of my life.

714
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,960
I admitted my fault.

715
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,630
I didn't have a choice then.

716
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,190
But things are different now.

717
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,510
You know better than me

718
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,150
if I'm your best choice.

719
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,990
Can a woman

720
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,800
not live a happy life

721
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,360
unless she's married?

722
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,920
Must I

723
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,510
make a choice between you

724
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,360
and Wei Yun?

725
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,710
So, you still like him.

726
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,280
Liking and choosing someone
are different things.

727
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,960
And what happened today tells me

728
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,710
that I can choose neither.

You're back home.

747

00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
what I just said,

749
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,030
I won't repeat it.

Have a good rest.

752
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,990
Tell me.

753
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,360
What you just said to him

754
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,030
was not true, was it?

755
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,550
Not entirely.

756
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,510
You said you wouldn't go back to him.

757
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,910
But just now,

758
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
you seriously considered

759
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,960
his proposal, right?

760
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,440
And what did you mean

761
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,440
"I can choose neither?"

762
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,280
Wei Yun,

763
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,740
let me explain.

764
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,800
Then, tell me the truth.

765
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,110
The truth is...

766
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,760
You're very important to me.

767
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,590
In my life,

768
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,440
you're the most important man,

769
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,030
apart from my family.

770
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,280
So, I don't allow any dirt on you

771
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,510
that comes from me.

772
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,490
I don't care

773
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,550
how people insult me.

774
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,880
But they're insulting

775
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,440
the military spirit of our families.

776
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,960
That hurts me more

777
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,070
than abusing my body.

778
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,510
I told you.

779
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
When you're with me,

780
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,400
I'll handle the gossip thing

781
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,360
and solve all the problems.

782
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,510
I mean every word I say.

783
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,630
That's no lie.

784
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,640
In that case,

785
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,400
you stand where you are.

786
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,280
I will finish

787
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,510
the distance left.

788
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,800
Alright?

789
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,760
Our great undertaking
isn't accomplished yet.

790
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,710
How can we consider

791
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,920
this marriage thing?

792
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,030
Besides,

793
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,840
so many people

794
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,800
are trying to make a big issue

795
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,360
with our relationship.

796
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,440
I don't want you to get hurt,

797
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,880
my family to get insulted,

798
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,880
or your family to get criticized.

799
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,070
There are many people I want to protect.

800
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,990
So,

801
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,230
I have to be selfish
when it comes to you.

802
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,880
I don't need you to finish

803
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,190
the distance left.

804
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,960
I just want you to be safe.

805
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,440
Just stay where you are, safe and sound.

806
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,760
Actually, it's not that

807
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,880
people love each other

808
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,880
only when they're together.

809
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,360
And marriage isn't the only thing

810
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,280
to prove love.

811
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,030
Our country is fragile now.

812
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,150
If we insist on having a relationship,

813
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,150
there will only be more trouble.

814
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:17,910
I believe.

815
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
You also want

816
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
to defeat North Qi armies

817
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,150
and expel them from Great Sui.

818
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,120
Am I right?

819
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,510
I know.

820
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,590
Before North Qi is defeated,

821
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,360
we won't have national security.

822
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,510
Our country is in distress.

823
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,110
How can we be in the mood

824
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,150
of the love thing?

825
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,630
In case of a national emergency,

826
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,440
we're totally insignificant.

827
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:00,910
So...

828
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,030
Wei Yun.

829
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,430
You and I

830
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,590
will go back

831
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,280
where we used to be.

832
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,390
Alright.

833
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,430
I'll do what you say.

834
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,120
Chu Yu.

835
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,780
(Chu Mansion)

836
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:51,980
(Map of Fengling City)

837
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,060
(Fengling City)

838
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,880
General, why are you reading

839
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,920
the map of Fengling City?

840
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
It's the garrison of my family.

841
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,670
I will request an order

842
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,630
to go and guard that city.

843
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,510
Besides, the crossbow case happened

844
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,480
in Fengling City.

845
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,280
There must be more clues there.

846
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,670
But that city is desolate.

847
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,550
It's far worse than the capital.

848
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
If Ms. Chu Yu knows

849
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,070
you're going back there,

850
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,960
she will follow you.

851
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,160
I've made up my mind.

852
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,680
Don't try to stop me.

853
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,760
As for Yu,

854
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,960
don't let her know.

855
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,630
Now, rumors are everywhere in town.

856
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,640
I don't think

857
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,510
she has time for this.

858
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,880
General, with all due respect,

859
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:14,360
are you going back to Fengling City

860
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,280
simply for the crossbow case?

861
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,760
Do you also want to avoid Miss Song?

862
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,550
I see very clearly

863
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,630
that you have feelings for Miss Song.

864
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,440
What I don't get is

865
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,110
why you're avoiding her.

866
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,590
If one day,

867
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,960
I end up dead in battle like my father,

868
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,880
I couldn't bear to see Yu

869
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,150
take on so much

870
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,150
just to seek some truth.

871
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,360
She can't even love

872
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,760
who she wants to love.

873
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,240
Miss Song...

874
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,200
She's the rising sun.

875
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,150
I have my own way to go.

876
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,790
She and I shouldn't have even met.

877
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,360
Only when I leave this city

878
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,400
will she forget me.

879
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,350
Or...

880
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,800
I will forget her.

881
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,800
Chu Shan,

882
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,510
start packing my things today.

883
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,430
