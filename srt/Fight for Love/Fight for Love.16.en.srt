21
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,270
Mother.

22
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,350
Mother.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,960
Jue,

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,510
Young Marquis Wei and Ms. Chu

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,980
have brought Lingmo here to see you.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,070
Lingmo misses you so much.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Open the door

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,070
and talk with them.

29
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,990
Mother,

30
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,590
are you inside?

31
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,550
Mother.

32
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,750
Mother.

33
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,750
Lingmo,

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm here.

35
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,430
Yun,

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
Yu,

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,750
thank you

38
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,240
for bringing Lingmo to see me.

39
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,870
But my cold hasn't recovered,

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,590
so I can't see you now.

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,120
Please take Lingmo

42
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,960
back home today.

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,190
Once I'm better,

44
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,910
Yong will escort me back

45
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,470
to reunite with you all.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
Jue,

47
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,470
Lingmo misses you so much.

48
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,680
Are you really not going

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
to see him?

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,430
Mother.

51
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,990
Mother.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,430
Yong, you're so thoughtful.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,080
But if Lingmo

54
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,590
catches a cold because of me,

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,400
I'll be even more heartbroken.

56
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,870
It's better not to see him.

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,150
Mother,

58
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,710
I'm not afraid of getting sick.

59
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,470
I just want you to hold me.

60
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,870
You haven't seen me

61
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,120
for many days.

62
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,910
Don't you miss me?

63
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,150
Of course, I miss you.

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,310
Lingmo, be good.

65
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,710
How about I recite

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,470
a nursery rhyme

67
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,310
for you?

68
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,680
After listening,

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,150
you should go back home

70
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,750
with Auntie and Uncle,

71
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,990
okay?

72
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I know

73
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,750
that you're the most well-behaved child,

74
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,870
right?

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,240
The flowers are fragrant;

76
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,310
the wind is clear.

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
The bees fly to gather honey.

78
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,680
As the sky turns dark

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
and the rain blows,

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,190
the bees are in a hurry
with nowhere to hide.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,750
They fly under the tree
to play hide-and-seek.

82
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,120
Bees,

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,950
don't run away.

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,360
Wait under the leaf for dawn.

85
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
Mother,

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,750
don't worry.

87
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,240
I'll be very obedient.

88
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,950
He's also a little man.

89
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,220
Let him cry for a while by himself.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,410
After all, they'll part ways

91
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,680
when he grows up.

92
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,020
Please stay for some tea

93
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,830
and snacks before you leave.

94
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,240
Thank you, General Yao, for today.

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,160
Jue, take care of yourself.

96
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,110
By the way,

97
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,120
the Eldest Princess said

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,000
that in a few days,

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
she'd like me to bring my sisters-in-law

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,040
to see her.

101
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,360
Jue, take care of yourself.

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
Well,

103
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,750
Yu, Yun,

104
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
please look after Lingmo for me.

105
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,270
Sure.

106
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
This way.

107
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,410
You need to talk
with General Yao, right?

108
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,100
I'll take Lingmo and leave now.

109
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,240
Please wait for me.

110
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,670
Let's go.

111
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,920
You were severely injured

112
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,760
in Baidi Valley.

113
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
Now, it seems

114
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,860
that you've recovered.

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,950
The Battle of Baidi Valley

116
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,630
is a pain

117
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,470
in all our hearts.

118
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,430
That arrow at the time

119
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,040
struck right at my heart.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,510
I was truly fortunate

121
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,920
to have survived.

122
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,830
If I remember correctly,

123
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,260
when Yingzhou fell

124
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,540
and Qingzhou was in great danger,

125
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,950
it was you who spared no effort

126
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,790
to defend Qingzhou,

127
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,830
preventing Great Sui

128
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,240
from losing a fourth city.

129
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,310
One must fulfill one's duty.

130
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,430
As a general,

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
I'm responsible

132
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
for serving the court.

133
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,790
Indeed,

134
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,020
nowadays, there are few generals left,

135
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,830
and even fewer who can actually go

136
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,570
to the battlefield.

137
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,950
For Great Sui to achieve true peace,

138
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,830
the road is still long.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
You must be very careful.

140
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,390
If you make a wrong move,

141
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,480
it will be hard to turn back.

142
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,240
Your words

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,360
have truly pierced

144
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,480
my heart.

145
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,170
Your family has a century
of meritorious service

146
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,630
and is deeply trusted by His Majesty.

147
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,390
Even after losing Baidi Valley

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,510
and 70,000 soldiers,

149
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,560
you could still inherit

150
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
the title

151
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,160
and become the Marquis of Zhenguo.

152
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,670
What about me?

153
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,950
Even if I had great ambitions

154
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,430
and risked my life to protect Qingzhou,

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,750
I can only reach my current position,

156
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,360
with no further possibilities.

157
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,750
It hasn't been easy

158
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,360
for me.

159
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,430
Are you feeling wronged?

160
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,270
Of course not.

161
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,870
I have a sincere heart for His Majesty

162
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
and am loyal

163
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,430
to Great Sui.

164
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,270
I look forward

165
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,430
to fighting

166
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,240
side by side with you again.

167
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,830
I also look forward to that day.

168
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,870
He harbors dissatisfaction
with His Majesty.

169
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,120
He once served the Lord of Qin.

170
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,760
Now, he's not trusted and feels wronged.

171
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,870
He was not executed

172
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,440
for treason

173
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,840
but allowed to serve in the army

174
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,720
and earn his merits

175
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,510
thanks to His Majesty's benevolence.

176
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,200
Instead of being grateful,

177
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,270
he dares to do

178
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,240
such unforgivable things.

179
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,960
I understand how you feel now.

180
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,600
We've traced it to this point.

181
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,780
There's bound to be a tragic end
between us and him.

182
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,200
Fortunately,

183
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,720
Great Sui hasn't perished,

184
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
right?

185
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,870
Auntie,

186
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
Uncle,

187
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,960
the nursery rhyme Mother just recited

188
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,730
is the one she used to say

189
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,060
only when we played hide-and-seek.

190
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,010
We used to play it
when we visited Yao Mansion.

191
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,840
But what Mother just said

192
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,120
wasn't about the bee in a hurry
to find its mother,

193
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,030
but about hiding under the tree.

194
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,120
I think Mother must be trying

195
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
to tell me something.

196
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
This is what I found

197
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
under the big tree in the courtyard.

198
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,820
(Seven Kun rises westward,)

199
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,420
(locking wood aura in the Xu direction.)

200
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,900
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,840
My Lady.

202
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,120
There's no one.

203
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
No one's here.

204
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,600
Wait for me here.

205
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,840
Your Lordship,

206
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,270
where are we going?

207
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,480
Is there some urgent mission

208
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,510
to execute?

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,750
Back to the study.

210
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,150
Back to the study?

211
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,510
Why are you acting

212
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,030
so sneaky?

213
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm not acting sneaky.

214
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,030
I'm being cautious.

215
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,870
Go.

216
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,910
Fine.

217
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,080
Let's be cautious.

218
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,240
Why do you look like a burglar

219
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,750
breaking into a house?

220
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Chun's been keeping
a close eye on me lately,

221
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,260
as if I have to report to her

222
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,300
everywhere I go.

223
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,390
Why are you being so secretive?

224
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,590
I...

225
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
If someone sees me

226
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,720
in your study

227
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,600
in the middle of the night,

228
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
wouldn't they start to gossip?

229
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,360
These two

230
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,480
don't look

231
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,510
like they are

232
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,600
discussing something,

233
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,030
but rather...

234
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,510
Having an affair.

235
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,960
Why are you here?

236
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,360
I? You...

237
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Mind your own business.

238
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,590
What did you just say?

239
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,510
- Good.
- I...

240
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,350
Since you've said it,

241
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,420
I'm going to tell Ms. Chu

242
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,070
and His Lordship

243
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,910
right now.

244
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,160
- Wanyue.
- Why?

245
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,970
I remember you asked me
for something before.

246
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,300
Why would I ask you for anything?

247
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,640
You have to take responsibility

248
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,720
for your words.

249
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,560
My Lady!

250
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,940
(The Xu hour on the 7th,
Dingfeng Valley)

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
The Xu hour on the 7th,
Dingfeng Valley.

252
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,390
At the Xu hour on the 7th,

253
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,710
a rebellion in Dingfeng Valley?

254
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,870
He really intends to rebel.

255
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,380
Yao Yong's been hiding weapons
in his mansion.

256
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,320
Rebellion is clearly premeditated,

257
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,590
but we don't know

258
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,480
how many people he has.

259
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,600
No matter how many he has,

260
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,550
we must first rescue Jue.

261
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,170
If Yao Yong is going to act,

262
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,170
he won't have time to worry
about anything else.

263
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
We should take this chance.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,550
I'll go to the Arsenal Bureau

265
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,030
to deploy troops in Dingfeng Valley

266
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,840
and have them pick up Jue.

267
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,820
We alone might not be enough

268
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,750
for this operation.

269
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,390
Yes.

270
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,440
Besides the Arsenal Bureau,

271
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,720
we need more forces.

272
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,580
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

273
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,080
Ms. Chu always has so many tricks.

274
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
What are you

275
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
up to this time?

276
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Are you trying to get me

277
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,060
to whip you with willow twigs?

278
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,350
Exactly.

279
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,380
I'm here to atone for my sins.

280
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,840
But I couldn't find

281
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,750
any thorny branches,

282
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,480
so I brought willow twigs instead.

283
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,750
If Mr. Xue can find

284
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,200
a stick or something,

285
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,040
that would be great.

286
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,990
Get up.

287
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,240
Tell me:

288
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,540
What sin are you apologizing for?

289
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,720
I acted before telling you.

290
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,870
But this is of great importance.

291
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,080
Hanmei, go and see

292
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,510
if my medicinal soup is ready.

293
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,550
Your Highness, Ms. Chu and you

294
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,870
probably have a lot to talk about.

295
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,960
Let me stay here to serve you.

296
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,660
Xiang is watching the medicinal soup.

297
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,240
I'll feel at ease

298
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,640
if you're with the medicinal soup.

299
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Now, you can speak.

300
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,590
Your Highness,

301
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,510
the Battle of Baidi Valley
is suspicious.

302
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,840
After Wei Yun and my investigation,

303
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,280
we suspect

304
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,040
that the person behind it is Yao Yong.

305
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
Yao Yong?

306
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,270
How could it be him?

307
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
We've received word

308
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,080
that Yao Yong will take action

309
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,020
in Dingfeng Valley soon.

310
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
We'll prepare in advance

311
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,930
to get to the bottom of it.

312
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,270
Aren't you worried

313
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,360
about your own safety?

314
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,850
Your Highness, rest assured.

315
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,840
Though I am a woman,

316
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,270
I will not back down

317
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,390
in the face of danger.

318
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,870
A woman as valiant as a man.

319
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,510
I like that.

320
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,270
Before we go,

321
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,150
I need a favor from you.

322
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,600
My fourth sister-in-law

323
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,150
is trapped in Yao Mansion.

324
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,460
The last time I went to visit her,

325
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,960
I used your name

326
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,080
to intimidate Yao Yong,

327
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,150
saying that you wanted

328
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,000
to see her.

329
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,750
But this is not a long-term solution.

330
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,250
I hope you can take action

331
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,460
to rescue her.

332
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,200
I've decided to save

333
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,950
your fourth sister-in-law.

334
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,440
I can even send a team to assist you.

335
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,110
Young Marquis Wei and you

336
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,000
should go and do what you need to do.

337
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

338
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,350
I knew it.

339
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,510
You're the kindest person

340
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,590
in this world.

341
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Your Highness,

342
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,550
can you give me an invitation?

343
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,480
Since I've promised

344
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,320
to help you,

345
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,310
you can write the invitation yourself.

346
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,840
Your Highness,

347
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,480
you know how awful

348
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,750
my handwriting is.

349
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,400
Never mind.

350
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,070
If you want me to write it, I will.

351
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,300
It won't be harder
than fighting a battle.

352
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,460
(Arsenal Bureau)

353
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,830
Everyone is here.

354
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,670
Do whatever you need.

355
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,550
Yao Yong

356
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,920
leaked my blueprints.

357
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,200
We will make sure

358
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,040
he pays the price.

359
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,430
Also,

360
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,240
this is the invitation Chu Yu got

361
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,280
from the Eldest Princess.

362
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,020
(Invitation)

363
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,750
(To Yao Jue)
Go to Yao Mansion on my behalf

364
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,720
and bring Jue home.

365
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,940
(Awaiting your presence)

366
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,630
Wait.

367
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,950
Come on.

368
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,720
This handwriting is so terrible.

369
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,110
Who cares?

370
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,950
It works anyway.

371
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,160
That's true.

372
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,030
Ms. Chu is

373
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,750
so amazing.

374
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,270
She got the invitation

375
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,440
from the Eldest Princess so easily.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,030
It seems the Eldest Princess

377
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,350
favors her quite a lot.

378
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,200
She's always been likable.

379
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,140
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

380
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,740
(True Might)

381
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,610
Mother!

382
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,450
Lingmo!

383
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,900
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)

384
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,270
I miss you so much.

385
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,510
Let me look at you.

386
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,630
Lingmo,

387
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,590
I will never leave you again,

388
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,430
okay?

389
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,800
Chun,

390
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,590
find a physician for Jue.

391
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,660
This wound on her face

392
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,080
will leave a scar if not treated.

393
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,830
Lisheng, go get a physician.

394
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,070
- Okay.
- Go back to the room.

395
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,110
I'll be there in a moment.

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,920
Jue,

397
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,760
let's go.

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,270
So, that is

399
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,510
what you've been doing.

400
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,000
It was urgent,

401
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,550
so Yun and I

402
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,590
didn't explain beforehand.

403
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,270
Do you have any concerns?

404
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,240
I was just overthinking.

405
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,110
So much has happened in this period,

406
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,270
and you did this without anyone knowing.

407
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,750
Yu,

408
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,590
Yun,

409
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,160
you were wrong this time.

410
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,350
I'm sorry.

411
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,720
We were wrong this time.

412
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,550
It's a matter of great importance.

413
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,160
We were afraid that if it failed,

414
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,160
it'd only add to your worries.

415
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,070
Luckily, everything was on time.

416
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,440
I'll go see them first.

417
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,060
But in the future,

418
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,710
no matter how important the matter is,

419
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,920
you can discuss it with us.

420
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,480
Yun,

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,240
we are all part of the family.

422
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,870
I understand.

423
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,080
Chun, rest assured.

424
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,840
Commander Lu,

425
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,620
nice to see you again.

426
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,440
Thank you this time

427
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,880
for bringing back Jue for us.

428
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,590
It's nothing.

429
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,480
You're truly

430
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,200
a heroine among women.

431
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,510
You don't even mind me

432
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,680
plotting against your family.

433
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,350
I'm truly impressed.

434
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,150
Let's forget

435
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,590
the past and start anew.

436
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,030
Let bygones

437
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,510
be bygones.

438
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,770
It seems

439
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,780
there will be a tough battle ahead.

440
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,620
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

441
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,200
Wenchang, what are you doing?

442
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,650
I'm going to the Wei Mansion

443
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,510
to ask Ms. Chu

444
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,680
to help me with matchmaking.

445
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,960
But I heard

446
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,270
that Ms. Chu and Ms. Chu Jin

447
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,110
don't get along.

448
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,880
Aren't you going in the wrong direction?

449
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,510
What does it matter?

450
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,440
She'll be my eldest sister-in-law.

451
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,200
It's always right to build

452
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,140
a good relationship now.

453
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,670
Wenchang,

454
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,920
this is the fish soup

455
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,160
specially prepared for Qingping.

456
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,110
You took it all.

457
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,160
Father will scold you.

458
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,590
What do you understand?

459
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,160
Love is priceless.

460
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,520
For Jin,

461
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,270
even if I'm condemned by everyone,

462
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,830
I have no regrets.

463
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,300
Come on.

464
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,400
Let's go to the Wei Mansion.

465
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,640
Why should I go?

466
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,240
If Yun is going to take action,

467
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,920
you and I can gang up on him.

468
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,760
Let's go.

469
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:53,660
(Dragon Leaps, Clouds Fly)

470
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,190
How is Jue?

471
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,400
Lingmo has been with her.

472
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,550
She looks much better.

473
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,870
Look at this map.

474
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,960
I went to Dingfeng Valley today.

475
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,340
These locations are suitable

476
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,220
(Map of Dingfeng Valley)
for deploying troops.

477
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,200
Deploying troops?

478
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,590
What do you mean?

479
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,430
Here, take it.

480
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Let me see.

481
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,240
Isn't this the map of Dingfeng Valley?

482
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,270
You'll deploy troops in Dingfeng Valley?

483
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,200
Stop shouting.

484
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,350
Shut your mouth.

485
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,790
Yun, are you planning a rebellion?

486
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,640
Are you asking for a beating?

487
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,590
If you shout again,

488
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,930
I'll throw you out right now.

489
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,550
So, what are you

490
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,960
deploying troops for?

491
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,040
Tell them.

492
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,450
We received intelligence

493
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,600
that Yao Yong is going to rebel
in Dingfeng Valley.

494
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,440
We're planning to ambush him there.

495
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,760
I want to go, too.

496
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,400
What kind of expression is that,
Ms. Chu?

497
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,270
I'm from a military family.

498
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,070
Since I was young, I've mastered

499
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,920
all martial arts.

500
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,830
On the battlefield,

501
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,850
I can take on 100 enemies.

502
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,640
I'm just low-key

503
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,960
and usually don't show off.

504
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,080
Indeed,

505
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,070
the Duke

506
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,110
is very strict

507
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,790
with his martial arts training.

508
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,760
Wenchang,

509
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,030
Ms. Chu Jin doesn't want you

510
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,080
to go to the battlefield.

511
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,270
I...

512
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,110
Since you love archery and riding,

513
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,840
will you go

514
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,270
to the battlefield?

515
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,920
(Is she worrying about me?)

516
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,870
So,

517
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,790
do you want me to go

518
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,270
or not?

519
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,510
You must be joking.

520
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,000
How could I influence

521
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
your decision?

522
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,550
My family suffered

523
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,270
because of the war.

524
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,240
So, I got a bit emotional.

525
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,040
Don't worry.

526
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,410
I won't go to the battlefield.

527
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,920
My old man

528
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,400
has been retired for many years.

529
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,030
He won't let me go, either.

530
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,510
But I've said it.

531
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,960
It'd be embarrassing to take it back.

532
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,160
If Yao Yong is going to rebel,

533
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,510
he will bring many people.

534
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,750
I would definitely be

535
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,680
a help.

536
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,590
Yun, as you know,

537
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,510
I'm just unreliable.

538
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,000
I can fight,

539
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,160
but I'm not very smart.

540
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,240
Shilan is different.

541
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,790
He's been smart since he was young,

542
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,860
and he can fight, too.

543
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,870
I don't care. We must take Shilan.

544
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,320
- This...
- Sure.

545
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,510
Then let them go.

546
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,400
Go back and prepare today.

547
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,160
Tomorrow, follow me to Dingfeng Valley.

548
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,350
Follow you?

549
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,590
Are you also going?

550
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,280
Can't I go?

551
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,560
I don't mean that.

552
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,000
Yet you're a woman.

553
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,510
When it comes to fighting,

554
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
men are more capable, right?

555
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,550
That makes sense.

556
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,110
How about this?

557
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,310
Let's have a match.

558
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,070
If I really can't do it,

559
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,750
I'll follow your command
in Dingfeng Valley.

560
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,590
How about that?

561
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,590
Alright.

562
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,430
Let's compete.

563
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,320
Come on, move aside.

564
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,110
Song Wenchang,

565
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,590
why did you have

566
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,920
to provoke her?

567
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,180
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

568
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,030
Mr. Song,

569
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,870
let's start.

570
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,440
You're so formidable.

571
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,440
If you're not used to the spear,

572
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,920
you can choose another weapon.

573
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,110
We can have another round.

574
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,590
There's no need.

575
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,680
I've lost.

576
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,000
Sometimes, admitting others' excellence

577
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,160
is also a kind of magnanimity.

578
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,410
Or are you afraid of losing more rounds

579
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,550
and being more embarrassed?

580
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,400
I...

581
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,310
How about it, Mr. Song?

582
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,520
Can I go

583
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,520
to Dingfeng Valley?

584
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,910
Of course, you can.

585
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,780
You must go.

586
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,390
Wenchang, don't be discouraged.

587
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,780
It's a virtue to admit a mistake

588
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,420
and correct it.

589
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,650
That's one of your strengths.

590
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,350
Chu...

591
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Yu had been

592
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,790
practicing martial arts with General Chu
since she was young.

593
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,590
When you were playing with crickets,

594
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,750
she could already kill

595
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,590
the North Qi enemies.

596
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,320
Even I

597
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,710
might not be able to beat her,

598
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,680
let alone you.

599
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,510
You should've said that earlier.

600
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,790
I suffered such a great loss.

601
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,200
I underestimated you.

602
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,350
I admit defeat.

603
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,270
Ms. Chu, I'll just assume

604
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,400
you've accepted my food box.

605
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,000
Please speak well of me

606
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,000
in front of Ms. Chu Jin.

607
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,830
That

608
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,960
depends on how you behave.

609
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,240
A Chu lady

610
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,400
isn't that easy to court.

611
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,430
Understood.

612
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,630
Wenchang,

613
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,950
let's go.

614
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,520
Yun,

615
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,150
goodbye.

616
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,790
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

617
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,780
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

618
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,190
Chu Yu,

619
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,830
could you dance with the sword for me

620
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,990
like you did at the Spring Breeze House?

621
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,080
Can you do that?

622
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,480
What sword dance?

623
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,070
A big battle is imminent.

624
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,080
Let's practice.

625
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,560
Chu Yu,

626
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I've been thinking

627
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,980
that if that day on
the Spring Breeze House,

628
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,440
the man you were looking for wasn't Jun

629
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,440
- but...
- It's been a long time.

630
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,910
I didn't expect you

631
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,310
to still remember.

632
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes.

633
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,870
I was overthinking.

634
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,720
Don't forget

635
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,410
that we'll soon fight
the decisive battle

636
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,280
with Yao Yong.

637
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,070
(What should I do?)

638
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,490
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao
have entered North Qi.)

639
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,900
(20 spies have been sent
into Great Sui to serve General Yao.)

640
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,200
You came out so quickly.

641
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,040
Guard this place.

642
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,040
Yes.

643
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,060
(Qinxi Valley)

644
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,430
Kill him.

645
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,000
Ms. Chu!

646
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,720
Ms. Chu!

647
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,560
Let him in.

648
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,440
Ms. Chu,

649
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,750
Mr. Gu might be in danger.

650
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,640
Please, save him!

651
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,790
What happened?

652
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,960
After the auction banquet,

653
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,030
Mr. Gu seemed to be

654
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,030
investigating something.

655
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,720
Yesterday, he said he was going to check

656
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,680
at Qinxi Valley.

657
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Before he left, he told me

658
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,850
that if he hadn't returned
by the Yi hour,

659
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,510
I should come to you.

660
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,150
He went there alone?

661
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,430
Yes.

662
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,320
He said

663
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,070
that if he could find some clues,

664
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,480
it would help you.

665
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,830
But he hasn't returned for a night.

666
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,200
He probably

667
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,110
has encountered some misfortune.

668
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,310
If an official is killed,

669
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,310
the capital should get

670
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,150
the news immediately.

671
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,340
There hasn't been any such news so far.

672
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,590
It seems Gu Chusheng

673
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,670
is still safe.

674
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,030
But he cannot fight at all.

675
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,400
If something really happened,

676
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,360
even if his life is not in danger,

677
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,850
he probably won't last long.

678
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Ms. Chu,

679
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,310
please save Mr. Gu.

680
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,240
Please save him.

681
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,790
Alright, don't worry.

682
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,920
I'll go find him right now.

683
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,680
The timing is too coincidental.

684
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,750
It's probably to distract our attention

685
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,430
and deliberately make us split up

686
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,400
at this critical moment.

687
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,310
So, we just ignore him?

688
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,390
No, what I mean is

689
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,160
that if we have to split up,

690
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,350
I'll go to rescue

691
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,430
Gu Chusheng.

692
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
But Mr. Gu said

693
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,830
that Ms. Chu understands him best.

694
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,400
She is now

695
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,510
part of my family

696
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,440
and should keep a distance from Mr. Gu.

697
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,510
Besides, he doesn't know

698
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,920
that our next move

699
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,470
concerns the fate of Great Sui.

700
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,280
The fact that we're willing to save him

701
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,400
is already out of consideration
for past kindness.

702
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,240
What if you

703
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,640
take revenge now?

704
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,480
I...

705
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,870
He won't.

706
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,880
Yun is not that kind of man.

707
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,590
How about this?

708
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,610
When I was at the border,

709
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,880
I once deployed in a similar terrain
with my father.

710
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,990
I'll go to Dingfeng Valley.

711
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,110
As for Gu Chusheng,

712
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,050
I'll leave him to you.

713
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,180
Take care of yourself.

714
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,550
If someone really wants to kill him,

715
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,200
he won't be able to escape.

716
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,030
He's still alive,

717
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,880
so he must be hiding somewhere.

718
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,320
You know him so well.

719
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,590
I'm worried about you.

720
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,240
Go.

721
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,350
Stop.

722
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,840
I saw you two acting suspiciously

723
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,680
early this morning.

724
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,990
Where are you going?

725
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,880
We...

726
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,720
Don't lie to me.

727
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,550
I'm going to fight

728
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,880
with Yun.

729
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,430
Wenchang,

730
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,400
you're finally useful.

731
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,800
What do you mean?

732
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,400
When have I not been useful?

733
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,840
Stop wasting time. Let's go.

734
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,920
By the way, if Father asks,

735
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,760
cover for us.

736
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,630
Let's go. Hurry.

737
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,630
How am I supposed to hide this?

738
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,080
Wei Yun,

739
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,320
Gu Chusheng is good at swimming.

740
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Follow the water source.

741
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,140
You'll have a better chance
of finding him.

742
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,350
The Song brothers will go with me
to Dingfeng Valley.

743
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,610
We'll intercept Yao Yong there.

744
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,120
You must be careful.

745
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,800
You, too.

746
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,660
There's only this one water source
near Qinxi Valley.

747
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,510
Perhaps we can find some clues here.

748
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,220
It seems like someone else
has been here.

749
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,840
This is an official's uniform.

750
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,330
It must belong to Gu Chusheng.

751
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,670
But where

752
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,760
could he have gone?

753
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,670
The footprints disappear here.

754
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,280
He must've been chased here.

755
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
To evade his pursuers,

756
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,220
he jumped into the water
to hide his trail.

757
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,770
It seems they haven't found him.

758
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,920
When did you know

759
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,840
Mr. Gu so well?

760
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,190
What did I say wrong this time?

761
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,190
Everything.

762
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,030
Shut your mouth.

763
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,740
(Wood)

764
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,560
The seal script character for "wood".

765
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,160
What does this mean?

766
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,180
Gu Chusheng may leave a secret mark.

767
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,590
- But that mark...
- Don't worry.

768
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,380
I've been familiar

769
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,930
with all the secret codes of Great Sui.

770
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,820
I will recognize it.

771
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,510
It's probably

772
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,920
only understandable by him and me.

773
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,000
A secret code between you two?

774
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,360
Sort of.

775
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,600
When we were in the southwest,

776
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,280
he often drew

777
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,300
local maps.

778
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,340
Since they were private,

779
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,800
he used wood, fire, metal, and water

780
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,400
to replace east, south, west, and north.

781
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:22,940
Also,

782
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,360
he'd use seal script.

783
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,400
Wood means the east.

784
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,510
He's telling me to look to the east.

785
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,910
Wei Qiu,

786
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,800
do you still remember the direction

787
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,170
of the Gu family's old residence?

788
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,760
It's in the east.

789
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,940
(Gu Residence)

790
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,110
If I really die here,

791
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,440
it'd be like returning to my roots.

792
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,480
You're really scared out of his wits,

793
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,490
not being able to tell friend from foe.

794
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,190
Are you about to kill

795
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,030
your savior?

796
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,320
Wei Yun,

797
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,870
why is it you?

798
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,990
You look

799
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,400
very disappointed to see me.

800
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,000
Even you found me.

801
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,760
The people tracking me

802
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,280
should be here soon.

803
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,840
I'll give you the evidence

804
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,880
I found in Qinxi Valley.

805
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,110
Take it

806
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,950
and leave now.

807
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,120
Young Marquis Wei,

808
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,000
this is not the time to be angry.

809
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,420
Take off your clothes.

810
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,110
If your wound is not re-bandaged,

811
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,550
you'll bleed

812
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,590
to death soon.

813
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,070
This place hasn't been lived in

814
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,710
for a long time.

815
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,480
Do you think this medicine
will be useful?

816
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,320
You...

817
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,420
What did you give me to eat?

818
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,390
A coptis pill.

819
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,800
To stop bleeding.

820
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,210
The right medicine for you.

821
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,550
You may not want to live,

822
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,360
but I can't let you die.

823
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,510
Please cooperate.

824
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,070
Don't force me to get rough.

825
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,910
Ms. Chu,

826
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,210
you said that this gesture

827
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,200
means to rush down,

828
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,070
right?

829
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,910
Is it right?

830
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,030
With me here,

831
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,280
why panic?

832
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,110
It's not that.

833
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,600
I...

834
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,380
(Gu Residence)

835
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,000
If the coptis pill is effective,

836
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,630
why am I still bleeding?

837
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,030
Naturally, I lied to you

838
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,320
to avoid your endless chatter.

839
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,670
Naive young man.

840
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,390
How childish.

841
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,190
It's not me

842
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,230
who took the coptis pill.

843
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,270
Whoever took it knows the bitterness.

844
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:36,950
Does it hurt?

845
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,400
If so, just shout it out.

846
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,070
A real man

847
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,190
can handle a little pain.

848
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,360
Your strength is beyond that

849
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,110
of ordinary people.

850
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,030
Where are you going?

851
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,510
I don't like to wait for death.

852
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,390
Your pursuers are about to be here.

853
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,210
You can't ride a horse now,

854
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,250
so I can't take you out.

855
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,840
For now,

856
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,030
I can only use the place you know best

857
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
as a stronghold.
