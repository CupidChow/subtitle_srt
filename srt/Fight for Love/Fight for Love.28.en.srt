21
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,710
(Peace and Prosperity)
Come on.

22
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,580
A hot spring villa?

23
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,300
Yes, it's near Fengling City.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,760
I've compared the portrait

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
you gave me.

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,780
The follower...

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,220
Xue Hanmei.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,420
He's right there.

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,550
There's no time to waste.

30
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,860
Stop drinking; let's go.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,140
General Chu,

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,770
the scout just reported

33
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,560
that the North Qi army
had suddenly gathered,

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,890
heading towards the North Qi camp

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,630
near Fengling City.

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,660
(Sui)

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,060
(Fengling City)

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,070
The North Qi army is here.

39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,630
Don't worry.

40
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,060
The more they are, the better.

41
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,470
My new octagonal crossbow

42
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,340
will surely wipe them out.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,380
I'm just afraid
they won't dare to fight.

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,180
Pass the order down:

45
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,160
The crossbowmen are on standby.

46
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,690
All soldiers,

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,290
prepare for battle.

48
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,810
Yes.

49
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,850
Shoot!

50
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,010
- Retreat!
- Retreat!

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,460
Retreat!

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,730
What a pity.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,620
The manufacturing process

54
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,190
of the crossbow is too complicated,

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,170
so it can only be equipped
for the crossbowmen.

56
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,760
If every soldier defending the city

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,300
had one,

58
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,500
we could easily flatten North Qi.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,120
North Qi's troops are on par with ours.

60
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,900
Since they're already here,

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,140
why are they avoiding battle?

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,160
Yun, what happened after you sent

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,100
the vanguard today?

64
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,750
After a short fight,

65
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,690
they didn't chase us.

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,310
They surround

67
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,340
but do not attack.

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,430
What is North Qi

69
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,820
really planning?

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,630
Chusheng,

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,920
anything from the interrogation

72
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,100
of Xu Lingzhang last night?

73
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,210
He claimed that North Qi

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,290
would send another 20,000 troops

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,850
to take Qingzhou.

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,490
Another 20,000 troops?

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,580
That's too absurd.

78
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,610
Xu Lingzhang is cunning.

79
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,370
We can't easily believe

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,660
what he says.

81
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,120
Though we don't know North Qi's

82
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,060
true intentions,

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
(Sui)
but their current actions

84
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,470
have shown that their real goal

85
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,820
is not to attack Qingzhou.

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,930
What is this thing?

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,930
Report!

88
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,950
Report from the front line:

89
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,220
More North Qi troops are coming,

90
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,070
and there are even

91
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,340
octagonal crossbow chariots.

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
They have actually made

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,410
octagonal crossbow chariots?

94
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,590
It's not certain whether they were made

95
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,780
according to your mechanism.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,930
If North Qi has also produced

97
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,220
a genius of the ages...

98
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,370
Yu!

99
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,140
There's gunpowder, too.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,340
Chariots combined with gunpowder

101
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,620
are even more powerful.

102
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,770
Chu Shan, pass the order:

103
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,890
Strengthen the defense.

104
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,980
Yes.

105
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,180
Linyang,

106
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,370
I'll guard here for you.

107
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,860
Go and arrange the defense.

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,180
Yu,

109
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,420
be very careful.

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,020
Crossbowmen, get ready.

111
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,130
Yes.

112
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,800
Be careful.

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Careful, careful.

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Slow down.

115
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,540
Carry him back.

116
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,240
Didn't I tell Chu Shan

117
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,440
to prepare a carriage for you

118
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,800
to send you back to Huajing City?

119
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,160
Why are you still here?

120
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,190
I won't go.

121
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,130
I want to stay here.

122
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,020
Haven't you seen
that the war has started?

123
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,700
As the general of Fengling,

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,580
I won't have time to look after you.

125
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,720
If you get hurt because of the war,

126
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,340
how can I explain to your father?

127
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,120
Look at these soldiers here.

128
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,170
I'm a physician.

129
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,360
As long as I stay,

130
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,390
they have a better chance of survival.

131
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,600
Do you want me to ignore them?

132
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
I can't do that.

133
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,460
Even if you send me
back to Huajing today,

134
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,870
I will come again tomorrow.

135
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,810
Qingping.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,940
I do like you,

137
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,610
but I'm staying today

138
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,040
for these soldiers

139
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,980
and the people.

140
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,490
Everyone has been caring for me,

141
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,730
hoping that I could live
a peaceful life.

142
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,510
But now that Fengling is in danger,

143
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,100
how can I stand by and do nothing?

144
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,900
The woman standing in front of you

145
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,610
is not the daughter of the Duke of Hu,

146
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,100
nor is she the Tuantuan
who needs protection.

147
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,660
I am just a military physician.

148
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,690
General Chu,

149
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,340
please respect my choice.

150
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,490
Lend a hand.

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,780
Come on.

152
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,300
- Be careful.
- Hurry.

153
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Come on, this way.

154
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,660
Coming.

155
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,370
Protect yourself.

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,170
No matter when,

157
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,020
make sure you survive first.

158
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,070
Gently, gently.

159
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,010
Alright.

160
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,660
I understand.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,140
Stop his bleeding.

162
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,000
Stop his bleeding!

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,940
Coming.

164
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,980
Charge!

165
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,320
Even if we create

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,340
more powerful weapons,

167
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,120
we can't withstand this endless war.

168
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,890
They just want to exhaust us.

169
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,380
Then we'll hold on to the death.

170
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,490
My father died for the country.

171
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,010
I will carry on

172
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,610
my father's will,

173
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,300
guard the border

174
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,890
of Great Sui,

175
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,610
and die if I have to.

176
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,100
I'm willing to guard the city

177
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,520
with Linyang with my life.

178
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,830
If the city stands, we live.

179
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,060
If the city falls, we die.

180
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,740
(Sui)

181
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,970
Listen up, Chu Army.

182
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,770
We will never retreat!

183
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,610
Never retreat!

184
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,220
Never retreat!

185
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,770
Never retreat!

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,340
Never retreat!

187
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,770
Never retreat!

188
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,340
(Qingzhou Yamen)

189
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,490
The Yunyang Princess of North Qi

190
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,370
once plotted against the Lord of Qin

191
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,240
and caused us

192
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,540
to lose three cities.

193
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,630
Now, she holds

194
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,080
considerable influence in North Qi.

195
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,510
Even Su Can, King of North Qi,

196
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,610
is wary of her.

197
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,180
It's hard to say

198
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,490
who planned all this

199
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,730
in North Qi.

200
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,670
Yun,

201
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,790
how come you know so much

202
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,070
about the North Qi royal family?

203
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,360
Since they can plant spies

204
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,300
in Great Sui,

205
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,480
we naturally need

206
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,490
a source of intelligence.

207
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,160
When the former marquis was alive,

208
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,550
he had already planted

209
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,490
insiders in North Qi.

210
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,220
What a far-reaching

211
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,450
vision.

212
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,120
After we lost three cities,

213
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,060
Qingzhou and Fengling

214
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,540
became our border.

215
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,580
(Qi)
Fengling is the hard target.

216
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,130
Once it is breached,

217
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,250
Huajing will be exposed.

218
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,670
North Qi has gathered

219
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,610
a large army in Qingzhou

220
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,890
without attacking.

221
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,700
What is their real purpose?

222
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,970
Their target

223
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,850
might not be us.

224
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,460
You mean

225
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,970
they are stationed in Qingzhou

226
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,440
and actually targeting Fengling?

227
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,210
Report.

228
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,340
Fengling was raided by North Qi.

229
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,450
It's in great danger.

230
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
North Qi has sent a large army

231
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,220
to Qingzhou

232
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,240
to prevent us

233
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,300
from supporting Fengling.

234
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,150
We can send part of our troops

235
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,270
- to Fengling.
- No.

236
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,460
If we reduce our forces,

237
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,360
the North Qi army outside

238
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,460
will attack us,

239
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,840
leaving both cities

240
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,720
unable to cope.

241
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,660
Ultimately,

242
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,300
we'll suffer a total defeat.

243
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,940
What a vicious plan.

244
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,330
(Yu.)

245
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,970
Send an urgent war report

246
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,270
to the court immediately,

247
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,820
informing them of the situation,

248
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,850
and requesting reinforcements
for Fengling.

249
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,420
Yes.

250
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,600
When General Chu

251
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
was guarding the city,

252
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,840
the court was

253
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,730
too complicated,

254
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,970
and no reinforcements were sent.

255
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,300
Wei Yun,

256
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,940
there are too many voices in the court.

257
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,390
It'll affect the Emperor's judgment.

258
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,330
But we have to do this.

259
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,550
The Emperor must know

260
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,800
the situation of the two cities.

261
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,380
Even if the message reaches the Palace,

262
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,360
the reinforcements

263
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,700
may not be able to arrive in time.

264
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,340
Will it be too late?

265
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,060
Fengling can't wait.

266
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Come on.

267
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,030
Is there anything we can do?

268
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,910
We can't just stand by

269
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,100
and watch Fengling fall.

270
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,540
Come on.

271
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
With the North Qi's main force outside,

272
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,340
there must be an opportunity within.

273
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,940
They're using a diversionary tactic;

274
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,820
I will attack their weak spot.

275
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,900
Everyone,

276
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,750
I need you to help me hold on

277
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,700
for four days.

278
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,580
I'm going to fight

279
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,490
for a glimmer of hope for Great Sui.

280
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,660
Wenchang,

281
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,250
you look the most like me.

282
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,060
Pretend to be me and patrol daily.

283
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,850
Do not let North Qi find out.

284
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,460
The weather is dry.

285
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,180
Be careful with fire.

286
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,610
Since you've made this risky decision,

287
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,180
you must've had

288
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,060
an infallible plan,

289
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,300
right?

290
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,440
The one who understands you the most

291
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,380
is your opponent.

292
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,370
You're indeed meticulous.

293
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,600
General Wei,

294
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,930
in matters concerning Great Sui,

295
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,390
you would not make

296
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,700
any hasty decisions.

297
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,360
So,

298
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,200
apart from having us

299
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,340
delay for you,

300
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,370
what is your plan?

301
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,300
Assassinate Su Can, King of North Qi.

302
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,300
Kill Su Can in four days?

303
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,340
Why are you so confident?

304
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,940
That insider

305
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,060
is my last resort.

306
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,300
Even if I fail,

307
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,720
there is still one last person

308
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,820
to complete this mission.

309
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,830
Even if it means mutual destruction,

310
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,610
I will kill Su Can.

311
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,060
Then I will do everything I can

312
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,220
to delay for you.

313
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,060
To you.

314
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,580
(Yu,)

315
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,020
(please hold on.)

316
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,780
Ms. Chu Jin, please enjoy.

317
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
My Lady,

318
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,750
you haven't had a proper meal

319
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,890
for several days in a row.

320
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,980
Please eat something.

321
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,020
Quan,

322
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,350
how are Linyang and Yu doing

323
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,060
in Fengling?

324
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,100
What's happening in Qingzhou?

325
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,540
If you're so worried about Mr. Song,

326
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,440
why not write a letter

327
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,380
to Qingzhou?

328
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,260
I have my principles.

329
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,160
I will not change

330
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,100
for anyone.

331
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,690
But I'll also face my feelings.

332
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,280
Three times is the limit.

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,030
If I think of him

334
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,340
for the third time,

335
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,060
I will definitely go to him.

336
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,700
(Chu Mansion)

337
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,660
My Lady,

338
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,170
you can't climb up.

339
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,270
Why don't we

340
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,640
just sneak out

341
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,820
through the main gate?

342
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,670
If we go out through the main gate,

343
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,580
Mother will find out.

344
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,740
Chu Yu can climb over the wall

345
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,620
so easily every time.

346
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,680
Why can't I?

347
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,790
I am also a Chu.

348
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,000
I can do it, too.

349
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,060
My Lady,

350
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,610
are you really going?

351
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,300
If Madam Chu finds out,

352
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,110
we will never be able

353
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,200
to enter this house again.

354
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,440
Stop talking nonsense.

355
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,540
Hurry up and give me a hand.

356
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,160
My Lady,

357
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,100
I can't hold on any longer.

358
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,140
My Lady.

359
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,180
You scared me.

360
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,380
Wanyue,

361
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,620
what are you doing here?

362
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,890
I knew it.

363
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,830
The one who can't climb over the wall

364
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,410
is indeed you.

365
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,510
What are you doing here,

366
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,890
sneaking around

367
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,120
in the middle of the night?

368
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,780
Don't wake my mother up.

369
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,340
Wanyue,

370
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,830
don't you want to go to Fengling

371
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,930
to see my sister?

372
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
But Ms. Chu asked me to stay

373
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
and protect you and Madam Chu.

374
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,240
What?

375
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,780
Are you also going to Fengling?

376
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,070
Why am I going to Fengling?

377
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,060
I'm going to Qingzhou.

378
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I don't have

379
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,610
to prove myself under their nose.

380
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,450
My Lady,

381
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,170
do you want to prove yourself,

382
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,170
or do you want to see Mr. Song?

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,030
Listen.

384
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,260
I overheard it today.

385
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,550
Qingzhou is now surrounded

386
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,120
by tens of thousands of North Qi troops.

387
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,930
It's very dangerous.

388
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,120
I just can't sit still.

389
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,500
No matter what,

390
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,370
I have to see it with my own eyes.

391
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,300
I'll help in any way I can.

392
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,780
I don't want to be useless

393
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,060
and always protected by everyone.

394
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
- Let's go.
- I won't go back.

395
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,020
I'll take you there.

396
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,120
You can't even climb over the wall.

397
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,470
Do you really think you can get

398
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,460
to Qingzhou by yourself?

399
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,820
(Qingzhou)

400
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,370
(Qi)
General Wei must've arrived

401
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,890
(Qizhou)
in North Qi.

402
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,490
The mission is arduous,

403
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,890
and there are only four days.

404
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,510
Chusheng,

405
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,450
in your opinion,

406
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,550
what are the chances of success?

407
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,130
Wei Yun told me before he left

408
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,170
that he'd guard Qingzhou.

409
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,270
Since he is willing to risk his life

410
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,850
to assassinate Su Can,

411
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,000
I must

412
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,940
buy him some time

413
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,240
and hold Qingzhou for him.

414
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,690
You're right.

415
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,740
We should trust General Wei.

416
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,050
I'm so thirsty.

417
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,450
Get me a glass of water.

418
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
Only when I'm pretending to be Yun

419
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,820
have I realized

420
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,830
that military affairs

421
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,820
are so complicated.

422
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,260
There are so many tricks in patrolling.

423
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,650
I've oversimplified

424
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,020
the battlefield.

425
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,880
Wenchang,

426
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,160
your imitation of General Wei

427
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,300
is so lifelike.

428
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,030
Shen You was once a spy.

429
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,640
He's so good at observing details,

430
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,680
yet he hasn't found out.

431
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,780
Yun has gone to North Qi

432
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,580
on such a dangerous mission.

433
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,720
He entrusted me

434
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,860
with such an important task.

435
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,060
I must not let him down.

436
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,890
We must be careful these days.

437
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,610
If Shen You finds out

438
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,260
that Wei Yun is not in the city,

439
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,060
it might reveal his whereabouts.

440
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,530
Then,

441
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,130
Qingzhou will be in danger;

442
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,550
Wei Yun will also be obstructed
in North Qi.

443
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,140
Don't worry.

444
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,510
I know.

445
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,510
My task this time

446
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,880
is to hold on until Yun comes back.

447
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,610
I won't be careless.

448
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,010
I'm off

449
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,340
to continue the patrol.

450
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,380
Wenchang used

451
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,690
to be idle all the time.

452
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,300
Now that he's found something
he wants to do,

453
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,820
he's changed quite a bit.

454
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,660
(Sui, Qingzhou)

455
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,500
(Qizhou, North Qi)

456
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,940
(Qi)

457
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,300
(Qi)

458
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,350
Your Majesty.

459
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,290
Your Highness.

460
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,030
Someone from Great Sui

461
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,910
has the audacity

462
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,790
(City Lord of Yun, Gongsun Lan)
to lead a troop

463
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,820
deep into the heart of North Qi.

464
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,060
Did you see clearly?

465
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,690
Are they really from Great Sui?

466
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,450
Why would they come here?

467
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,980
I'm absolutely certain.

468
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,500
My intelligence is never wrong.

469
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,630
Is he really going

470
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,880
(Su Can, King of North Qi)
to attack our royal court?

471
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,900
Pass the order down.

472
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,140
Wait.

473
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,340
Your Majesty, don't rush.

474
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,890
(Yunyang, Eldest Princess of North Qi)

475
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,270
We only know

476
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,740
that they are from Great Sui,

477
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,790
but we don't know

478
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,170
who is leading the troops.

479
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,890
Even if someone has come secretly,

480
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,130
they are just minor soldiers,

481
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,980
nothing to be afraid of.

482
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,620
Aunt,

483
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,120
you started the war at Fengling;

484
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,780
I'm pinning Qingzhou down.

485
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,310
There are no spare soldiers

486
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,440
left in the royal court now.

487
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,780
Isn't that dangerous?

488
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,160
The diversionary tactic

489
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,540
we conspired

490
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,240
is to take Great Sui

491
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,450
in one fell swoop.

492
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,060
If Qingzhou withdraws its troops

493
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,820
and Wei Yun rushes to Fengling,

494
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,890
wouldn't our plan be ruined

495
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,070
at the last moment?

496
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,540
We might be taken by Great Sui

497
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,930
before we succeed.

498
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,690
I want to recall half of the troops
from Qingzhou.

499
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,650
(With me here,)

500
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,410
(no one can step into Fengling.)

501
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,140
General Chu,

502
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,780
North Qi keeps sending

503
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,030
soldiers and war chariots

504
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,400
in return.

505
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,440
If this continues,

506
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,690
we will be exhausted.

507
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,620
Hold our ground!

508
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,620
Be careful!

509
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,010
General Chu!

510
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,490
Linyang.

511
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,890
Chu Shan, retreat the army.

512
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,140
- Yes.
- Let's go.

513
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,020
Everyone, retreat!

514
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,900
(General's Mansion)

515
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,820
Don't worry. I'm fine.

516
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,690
Chu Shan,

517
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,780
no need to feel guilty.

518
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,780
You've followed me for years.

519
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,690
You're like my brother.

520
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,450
If losing a leg could save your life,

521
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,370
it'd be worth it.

522
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,820
Go and guard the city gates.

523
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,780
Don't mope around here.

524
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,940
Yes, General.

525
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,860
(Peace and Prosperity)

526
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,180
It's okay.

527
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,620
I've seen it clearly.

528
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,610
Their mechanism
is still the original one,

529
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,110
so it will break down

530
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,060
in a few days.

531
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,500
But the power of that war chariot

532
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,980
is just too strong.

533
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,260
If we can't deal with them,

534
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,690
we have no chance

535
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,300
of winning this battle.

536
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,240
Here's what I'm thinking.

537
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,690
Such a large war chariot

538
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,690
is not easy to move around,

539
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,580
and it breaks down so frequently,

540
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,310
but there are always new war chariots

541
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,850
being sent to the front line.

542
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,240
What does this mean?

543
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,640
The place to make the war chariots

544
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,020
must be near Fengling.

545
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,100
That makes sense.

546
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,400
I smelled a strong sulfur odor

547
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,020
on that war chariot.

548
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,510
The same smell

549
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,060
is also on the arrows.

550
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,130
The hot spring water contains sulfur.

551
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,690
The hot spring villa.

552
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,300
You mentioned it before.

553
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,300
There must be a problem there.

554
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,200
Linyang,

555
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,260
I'll take care of this.

556
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,730
Yu,

557
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,020
it's too dangerous for you

558
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,300
to go there rashly.

559
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,690
Don't worry.

560
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,210
I'm going there

561
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,850
to find a way out for everyone.

562
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,020
Mother gave me this talisman

563
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,500
before I left.

564
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,850
Keep it safe for me

565
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,610
before I come back.

566
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,300
Guard Fengling as well.

567
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,250
I'm off.

568
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,850
Chu Yu,

569
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,550
don't forget

570
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,500
the Eldest Princess.

571
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,250
Don't worry.

572
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,440
I will bring

573
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,700
the Eldest Princess back safely.

574
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,180
Let's go.

575
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,180
(Safe)

576
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:19,860
(Qingzhou City)

577
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,540
Why did the North Qi army

578
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,440
suddenly get so close?

579
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,540
Why are they suddenly here?

580
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,640
Is it a night raid?

581
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,740
(Qingzhou City)

582
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,370
Why did they suddenly get so close?

583
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,930
General Wei is truly remarkable.

584
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,480
Fengling is in a state of emergency,

585
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,740
yet you remain so calm.

586
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,350
I've heard

587
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,820
that the Chu siblings

588
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,820
are currently in Fengling.

589
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,640
Why is Shen You

590
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,980
suddenly making a fuss?

591
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,450
Does he want to provoke me?

592
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,140
No way.

593
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,450
Song Wenchang,

594
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,370
you must remain calm.

595
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,820
I can't show any flaw.

596
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,780
Deputy Shen,

597
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,350
they don't take you seriously

598
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,340
at all.

599
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,680
There have been rumors

600
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,850
about Chu Yu and Wei Yun

601
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,540
in Huajing City.

602
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,540
With Fengling in a critical situation,

603
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,340
he remains so calm and composed.

604
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,060
In just a few days,

605
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,110
Wei Yun,

606
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,930
your skills have become worse.

607
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,850
What do you mean?

608
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,340
I've fought with Wei Yun multiple times.

609
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,410
This man's abilities

610
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,740
are definitely not his.

611
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,210
It's not Wei Yun?

612
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,440
As the main general,

613
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,540
Wei Yun is not in the city.

614
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,450
Qingzhou is now leaderless.

615
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,500
If we launch an attack now,

616
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,850
taking Qingzhou will be as easy as pie.

617
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,210
Regardless of where Wei Yun is,

618
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,270
once the battle starts in Qingzhou,

619
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,740
he will be pinned down.

620
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,490
Commander Gao,

621
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,720
this is a once-in-a-lifetime

622
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,660
opportunity.

623
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,820
Very well.

624
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,170
Pass my order.

625
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,580
Everyone, get ready.

626
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,370
Prepare to attack the city.

627
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,450
Yes.

628
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,940
Wenchang,

629
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,010
are you hurt?

630
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,140
Shilan,

631
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,690
did I mess up?

632
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,580
It's okay.

633
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,690
It was sudden.

634
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,970
No one expected Shen You

635
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,110
to suddenly shoot an arrow.

636
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,400
I must have messed up.

637
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,410
Put yourself together.

638
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,500
No one will blame you.

639
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,740
(Sui)

640
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,970
Shilan,

641
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,610
North Qi is attacking.

642
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,690
Respond.

643
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,900
Hurry.

644
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,180
Run!

645
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,660
Run!

646
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,770
Sweetie.

647
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,200
I've finally found you.

648
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,140
Let's go.

649
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,730
Honey,

650
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,020
come in!

651
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,210
Hurry.

652
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,580
(Qingzhou City)

653
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,260
Wenchang,

654
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,090
come with me to fight.

655
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,360
There's no time to comfort you now.

656
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,800
If you want others to respect you,

657
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,210
come with me to the battlefield.

658
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,260
(Qingzhou City)

659
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,030
A bunch of inexperienced kids,

660
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,170
overestimating themselves.

661
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,090
Everyone,

662
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,500
there are no generals in the city,

663
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,380
just nobodies giving orders.

664
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,150
Let's take Qingzhou.

665
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,100
Charge!

666
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,500
(Qingzhou City)

667
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,280
Escort the elderly, women,

668
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,490
and children out of the city.

669
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,440
Leave some soldiers

670
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,380
to fight with me.

671
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,280
But you're a civil official.

672
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,380
I'm still an official.

673
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Escort as many

674
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,060
as you can.

675
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,300
Go!

676
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,700
Let's go.

677
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,610
Even with one breath left,

678
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,500
we'll guard Qingzhou.

679
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,500
(Sui)

680
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,700
(Sui)

681
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,580
(As a civil official,)

682
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,690
(I regret I don't know how to fight.)

683
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,700
(Wei Yun,)

684
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,840
(you once said you never thought)

685
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,020
(I was a good person,)

686
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,650
(but you protected me)

687
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,650
(for Great Sui.)

688
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,380
(Today, I will also pin down)

689
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,100
(the North Qi army)

690
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,250
(and buy time for you for Great Sui.)
