=Episode 34=

21
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,590
The Queen Mother is here.

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,560
Leave this to the servants.

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,560
When you were born,

24
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,120
your paranoid uncle

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,150
didn't want you here.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,030
So I had to leave you in Great Sui.

27
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,400
I know you've harbored resentment

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
all these years.

29
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,240
But Yue,

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,280
you should understand.

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,710
I didn't have a choice, then.

32
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,280
But what's gone is gone.

33
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,520
It's your coronation today.

34
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,630
The throne of North Qi

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,240
is finally in our hands.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,280
Our years of planning

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,840
finally paid off.

38
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,680
Without your mediation, this day

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,590
wouldn't have come so soon.

40
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,120
Thank you, Mother.

41
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,190
When I was subject to Su Can,

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,630
I only endured

43
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,800
by clinging to the thought

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
that this day would come.

45
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,030
Today,

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,280
why do you keep talking about the past?

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,680
Yesterday, I got a message.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,960
Great Sui agreed to discuss peace.

49
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,710
I've had someone

50
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,120
draft a letter to Emperor Chunde,

51
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,120
asking him to send a delegation

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,120
for peace talks.

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,470
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

54
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,240
You haven't ascended the throne.

55
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,520
So, I have the duty

56
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,190
to handle these things for now.

57
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,640
What?

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,120
Yue,

59
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,560
are you dissatisfied

60
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,750
with my decision?

61
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,400
It is settled.

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
Yue,

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,430
during the peace talks,

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
you should exchange that woman

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,430
for tangible benefits from Great Sui.

66
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Never.

67
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,120
She isn't the Eldest Princess here.

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,080
She is my woman, and that is all.

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,590
You can make almost any decision.

70
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,470
But regarding Changming,

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,870
please let me have my way.

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
Your Majesty,

73
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,950
it is time.

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,190
Since you want her,

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,950
I'll let you have your way.

76
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,750
You have to remember.

77
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,800
Li Changming can stay.

78
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,600
But if you lose people's support

79
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,070
or disobey me

80
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,190
because of this woman,

81
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,800
I wouldn't mind

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,390
killing one more person.

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Mother,

84
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,560
I should go see the officials.

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,300
(Qi)

86
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,310
In Year 6 of Yuanle,

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,830
Zhao Yue became the King of North Qi.

88
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,190
Queen Mother Yunyang jointly governed.

89
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,040
By the grace of heaven,

90
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
I now ascend the throne.

91
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,120
This year will be Year 1 of Qingming.

92
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,390
I'll grant a general amnesty
to celebrate this.

93
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,800
Lords of our sixteen cities

94
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,870
will maintain peace within your cities

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,390
and prevent disorder.

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,560
I will handle state affairs carefully

97
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,270
to protect our land.

98
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,000
I make a promise to all my subjects.

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,480
One day,

100
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,560
I will conquer states

101
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,750
including Great Sui,

102
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,360
South Yue, and West Jing

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,070
to unite the whole world.

104
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,950
I've been too busy with the coronation

105
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,600
to give you much attention.

106
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,270
Ping told me

107
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,800
you ate very little

108
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,950
what the King offered.

109
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,480
Does it not taste good?

110
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,710
King?

111
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,120
This word

112
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,720
sounds really fresh

113
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,600
when it comes from your mouth.

114
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,390
Why don't you repeat it,

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,190
so I can get used to that?

116
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
What?

117
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,870
Do you not think

118
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,430
I can be a good king?

119
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,160
I heard

120
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,680
during the coronation,

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,310
Queen Mother Yunyang

122
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,430
was sitting right next to your throne.

123
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,720
Whether you can be

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,870
a good king of North Qi...

125
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,720
Is it really up to you?

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,680
So what?

127
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm the only son

128
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,800
of my mother.

129
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,320
Now, I'm sitting on the throne.

130
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,440
It's what she has been pursuing.

131
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,720
She handles state affairs

132
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,000
just to help me.

133
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,630
You wouldn't

134
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,890
have gotten the throne

135
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,960
without her schemes.

136
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
So, she can take back what she gave you.

137
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,480
You're mother and son,

138
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
but so what?

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,240
A royal family has no affection.

140
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,840
So do the two of you.

141
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm on the throne, anyway.

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,750
I want everyone to know

143
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,000
that I'm destined to be

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
the King of North Qi,

145
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,270
and no one can change that.

146
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,720
As for you, Changming...

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,440
All you need to do is stay by my side.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,270
When the court stabilizes,

149
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,910
I will make you

150
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,750
my queen.

151
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,270
You will share with me

152
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,910
the most honorable glory.

153
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,080
Hope so.

154
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,900
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

155
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
Governess,

156
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,390
don't bring me any food. I'm not hungry.

157
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,870
What are you doing here?

158
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,870
And the governess?

159
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,530
Father sent her

160
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,510
to watch over me.

161
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,110
Hurry.

162
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,320
Don't worry, Tuantuan.

163
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,790
We hit her gently.

164
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,990
She's fine.

165
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,360
Tuantuan, come with me.

166
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
A surprise for you.

167
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,510
Shilan, stop dawdling.

168
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,590
Take off your robe.

169
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,510
I'll take Tuantuan out alone.

170
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,080
I took you here, so you could

171
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,510
pretend to be Tuantuan.

172
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,510
No wonder you said you couldn't

173
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,790
have done this without me.

174
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,560
Min,

175
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,690
get us one outfit of hers.

176
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,040
Turn around.

177
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,240
Come on, move.

178
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,440
Why didn't you tell me before we came?

179
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,320
You...

180
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,250
If I had told you,

181
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,480
you wouldn't have come.

182
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,270
Come on, Wenchang.

183
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,110
Hand.

184
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,320
I'll do it myself.

185
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,870
Oh, My Lady.

186
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,080
My Lady.

187
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,800
My Lady?

188
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,360
My Lady,

189
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
you have 80 pages to copy

190
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
as your punishment.

191
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,300
(Chu Mansion)

192
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
Come on.

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,840
Try harder.

194
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,990
Come on.

195
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,040
Be patient.

196
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,200
Take your time.

197
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,360
It's alright.

198
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
Even if you remain like this,

199
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,600
Mother can still carry you

200
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,390
and always take care of you.

201
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,910
When you were a little boy,

202
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,240
I always held you, didn't I?

203
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,270
Now, even Chu Shan can hardly carry me.

204
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,840
Not to mention you.

205
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,240
Don't underestimate me.

206
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,000
Tomorrow, I'll ask Yu

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,030
to teach me martial arts.

208
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,110
You're back.

209
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,200
Slow down. Don't choke.

210
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,150
Mother. Linyang.

211
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,030
It's so hard

212
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,150
to rent a shop out there.

213
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,440
I've looked almost everywhere.

214
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,360
They're either too expensive

215
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,000
or too remote.

216
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,570
Why is it so hard

217
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,720
to start a business?

218
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,550
We aren't short of money now.

219
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,120
You can just choose a shop you like.

220
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,840
The herbal medicine business

221
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,120
requires a lot of capital.

222
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,840
And you will get married someday.

223
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,710
We do need money

224
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,640
in many cases.

225
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,110
Mother,

226
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,630
I know

227
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,390
you think for Miss Song.

228
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,160
But if she

229
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,360
truly loves Linyang...

230
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,200
Jin.

231
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,000
You must be hungry now.

232
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,960
I'll go make you something to eat.

233
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,680
Jin.

234
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,510
Stop pressing.

235
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,630
It doesn't work.

236
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,440
Don't try to lie to me, Linyang.

237
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,030
You want so badly to stand up.

238
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,000
Miss Song must be one of the reasons.

239
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,150
You've been telling me

240
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,150
to make sure

241
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,080
what I really want.

242
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,510
Linyang, you aren't leading by example.

243
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,320
I certainly know

244
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,200
what I really want.

245
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,120
But look at me now.

246
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,870
It's a nice day today.

247
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,720
Let me take you out for a walk.

248
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,000
Where will he come from?

249
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,750
Wenchang.

250
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,080
Why did you bring me here?

251
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,480
Is there a surprise?

252
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,200
Tuantuan.

253
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
- How are you?
- How are you?

254
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,470
I...

255
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,230
I'm fine.

256
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,440
Why are you here?

257
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
I guess some of our friends

258
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,360
wanted us to meet each other.

259
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,510
That's good.

260
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Linyang.

261
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,910
I thought it would get better
as time passed.

262
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,870
But since we see each other here,

263
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,960
I won't escape anymore

264
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,870
or deceive myself.

265
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,870
So,

266
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,750
please don't avoid me, will you?

267
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,390
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,350
I never made things clear to you,

269
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,400
so you were bothered.

270
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,000
Since I was little, my father taught me

271
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,510
to take responsibilities.

272
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,000
As a son,

273
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,680
I failed to save my father

274
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,590
when he died in a battle,

275
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,310
which broke my mother's heart.

276
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,240
As an elder brother,

277
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,920
I failed to balance

278
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,400
the relationship between my sisters,

279
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,440
so they were estranged for a long time.

280
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,880
I always strove for perfection

281
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,590
while nothing ended up perfect.

282
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,950
Now,

283
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,070
if I accept you rashly

284
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,960
with such a body,

285
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,070
how could I get your parents' approval?

286
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,960
Even if they approve,

287
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,590
how would I not feel sorry?

288
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,030
But Tuantuan,

289
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
I want to make this bet with you.

290
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
One day,

291
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,550
I will stand up

292
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,680
and go get you back.

293
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,310

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,640
Let me tell you.

311
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,750
My mother

312
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,790
doesn't accept Tuantuan

313
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,510
for her own good.

314
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,510
Don't hold any prejudice against her.

315
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,560
I won't.

316
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,270
On the surface, my mother

317
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,030
doesn't worry about Linyang's legs.

318
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,750
But in secret, she has cried many times.

319
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,160
Linyang and I

320
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,480
pretend we didn't know,

321
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,030
so she wouldn't feel worse.

322
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,400
My family...

323
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,590
Jin,

324
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,920
I just appear to be careless.

325
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,270
But I totally understand

326
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,110
all these things.

327
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,190
Really?

328
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,790
So, why did you get Tuantuan out?

329
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,720
What if your father punishes you?

330
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,160
That's why I'm taking you here

331
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,000
to buy some cushions.

332
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
I'll put them on me

333
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,240
before he canes me.

334
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,270
Is your father so harsh?

335
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,480
Don't worry. He won't be harsh to you.

336
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,680
I don't care if he doesn't like me.

337
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,030
Think about who I am.

338
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,310
Listen,

339
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,240
within three days,

340
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,440
I will make him acknowledge me.

341
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,920
I'll choose an auspicious day

342
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,790
for betrothal gifts.

343
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,880
I swear I'll marry you

344
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,720
with a grand wedding.

345
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,070
We're still in public.

346
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,400
Don't say that.

347
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,390
Jin.

348
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,520
Jin.

349
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,110
Jin.

350
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,110
I, Song Wenchang,

351
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,880
will marry Chu Jin!

352
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,830
Many officials

353
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,880
accused you of having fun
at Fragrance House

354
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,200
and lacking personal virtue.

355
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,790
(Xuanzheng Hall)
Some even

356
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,350
advised me to strip you

357
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,590
of your noble title.

358
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,030
What do you think?

359
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,920
Your Majesty will decide.

360
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,240
I'll just obey.

361
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,590
Wen Yun,

362
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,720
do you really not want

363
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,440
a better title?

364
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,720
Your Majesty,

365
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,510
my lifelong wish

366
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,350
is to protect our country,

367
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,480
have a proper house,

368
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,440
eat regular meals,

369
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,680
and always live with the one I love.

370
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,550
That's all I want.

371
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,540
Don't forget.

372
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,750
You're first my subject

373
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,160
before you're Wei Yun.

374
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,720
Your Majesty,

375
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,200
in the court,

376
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,270
I can be the general who fights enemies

377
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,510
and recovers lost land.

378
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,590
I'll protect our nation
and its emperor at all costs.

379
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,550
But outside the court,

380
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,240
I'm a mere man.

381
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,880
I want to live my life

382
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,150
the way I want it.

383
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,200
Will you truly defy me

384
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,790
again and again

385
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,750
for a mere woman?

386
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,680
Chu Yu has risked her life
for this country.

387
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,420
And now, she's trying

388
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,230
to get back the Eldest Princess.

389
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,240
A woman like her

390
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,920
isn't the mere woman

391
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,030
you think she is.

392
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,040
How dare you!

393
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,750
I am just

394
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,790
telling the truth.

395
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,150
Wei Yun,

396
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,870
if I really

397
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,880
strip you of your noble title,

398
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,160
would you not care at all?

399
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,480
My...

400
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,830
My conscience is clear.

401
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,560
Wei Zhong,

402
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,770
how could you have

403
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,030
this kind of son?

404
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,420
(Huang's Noodle Shop)

405
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,720
A runaway horse!

406
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,110
Move. Move now.

407
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,830
The horse is spooked!

408
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,670
Run!

409
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,160
Mother.

410
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,250
- Mother!
- Runaway horse!

411
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,110
Mother!

412
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,480
Little girl,

413
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
are you alright?

414
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,590
Babe.

415
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,550
Babe, are you alright?

416
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,030
Face.

417
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,550
Your face.

418
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,030
Miss, your face.

419
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,870
It's bleeding.

420
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,320
Mother.

421
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,400
Yu, be gentle.

422
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,680
Are you taking revenge on me?

423
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,040
Right.

424
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm taking revenge.

425
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,480
Will it leave a scar?

426
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,070
You're always a lover of beauty.

427
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,590
It is

428
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,760
so unlike you.

429
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,070
Or what should I do?

430
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,790
Cry my eyes out?

431
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,070
Yu,

432
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,830
a scar for a little girl.

433
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,800
It's worth it.

434
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,920
In the next few days,

435
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,590
Quan'er and I will live here.

436
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,400
Don't tell

437
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,310
Mother or Linyang.

438
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,160
Will Linyang praise me?

439
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,510
Of course, he will.

440
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,000
What about you?

441
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,310
What do you think of me?

442
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,240
Before,

443
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,790
I always wanted you

444
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,920
to be considerate

445
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,400
and generous.

446
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,680
Now, seeing this,

447
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,750
I know you've grown up.

448
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,400
You're my good sister.

449
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,440
Of course, I am.

450
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,880
Come on.

451
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,070
You go back and rest.

452
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,550
Don't get the wound wet tonight.

453
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,310
Tomorrow, I'll apply ointment

454
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,150
after breakfast.

455
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,720
Alright. You go back now.

456
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,080
Go to bed early.

457
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,390
Jin.

458
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,110
Jin.

459
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,080
Jin, are you alright?

460
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,350
Jin.

461
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,870
Jin.

462
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,190
I'm fine.

463
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,590
Don't worry.

464
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,960
But I can tell

465
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,110
you're crying.

466
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
Jin.

467
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,840
Don't worry.

468
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,830
You won't be hurt for nothing.

469
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,590
One must pay a price.

470
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,270
I'm going right away

471
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,330
to find out who hurt you.

472
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,480
Jin.

473
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,350
That guy hurt my girl.

474
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,310
I will skin him!

475
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,000
I'll scratch his face now.

476
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,430
And I'll get him here

477
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,960
to apologize to you.

478
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,240
Wait for me, Jin.

479
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Come back.

480
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,950
I know.

481
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,790
You aren't crying because you regret

482
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,630
saving that girl.

483
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,480
Instead,

484
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,640
you must be very proud

485
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,630
of saving her.

486
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
But you must be sad

487
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,830
for a scratched face.

488
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,000
I understand.

489
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,280
How about this?

490
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,040
Lean on my shoulder.

491
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,880
Cry out as loud you want.

492
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,150
It's no big deal.

493
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,240
Come on.

494
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,960
I've already stopped crying.

495
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,790
Why are you suddenly

496
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,030
staring at me like that?

497
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,080
Jin,

498
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,840
I like you.

499
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
It's not about your looks.

500
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,240
You don't need to hide anything from me.

501
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,440
Do you remember

502
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,350
when we first met

503
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,830
at Yun's banquet?

504
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,640
Back then, I saw

505
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,920
a flame in your eyes.

506
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,480
You were dazzling in the crowd.

507
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,400
For the first time in my life,

508
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,280
I got to know

509
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,550
what it felt like to fall in love.

510
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,310
Why are you saying this?

511
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,960
I just want you to know.

512
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,350
In my heart, you're indispensable.

513
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,920
In Qingzhou,

514
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,590
your slap woke me up.

515
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,520
After that,

516
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,880
you accompanied me when I rose.

517
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,950
It was you

518
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,440
who gave me a real second life.

519
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,870
I once said

520
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,880
I wanted to make you proud.

521
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
But now,

522
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,590
you're making me proud.

523
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,550
I don't care

524
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,750
if it leaves a scar.

525
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,480
However many wrinkles

526
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,070
you have on your face in the future,

527
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,760
I'll always love you.

528
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,200
In my heart,

529
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,880
you are the best

530
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,910
and the prettiest

531
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,680
in this world.

532
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,080
In the future,

533
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,350
will you not have

534
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,190
many wrinkles?

535
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,760
I will.

536
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,840
I will have more.

537
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,560
Yu.

538
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,000
How is your sister?

539
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,310
I'm afraid it'll leave a scar.

540
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,600
She must be very sad.

541
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,440
She just pretended she didn't care.

542
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,200
She has really been mature.

543
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,200
And why did you come back so late?

544
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,880
Did His Majesty rebuke you?

545
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,680
No, he didn't.

546
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,000
He asked me what I really thought.

547
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,480
I said I wanted a peaceful life

548
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,520
with a proper house

549
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,840
and regular meals.

550
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,270
Why does it sound

551
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,350
so familiar?

552
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,480
Are you copying off me?

553
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,920
That makes no difference.

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
What makes you so hesitant?

555
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,000
Yu,

556
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,000
even if the whole world hinders us,

557
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,160
I will not give in.

558
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,870
It's late.

559
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,280
Why are you here?

560
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,200
I want to give you a dress.

561
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,920
See if it fits you.

562
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,070
You know my size

563
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,830
very well.

564
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,590
I want you to try it on.

565
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,960
I have never liked red.

566
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,160
I don't want this gift.

567
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,510
It's the King's gift.

568
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,310
Even if you don't like it,

569
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,640
you have to accept it.

570
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,760
Zhao Yue,

571
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,640
you're angry about court affairs.

572
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,160
Punish your officials if you dare.

573
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,000
Don't vent your anger on me.

574
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,400
Are you determined

575
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,830
to defy me?

576
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,830
I'm not the only one defying you.

577
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,430
Alright.

578
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,160
Since you don't put it on,

579
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,030
you won't see me anymore.

580
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,030
Don't bring her to me

581
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,830
until she puts the dress on.

582
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,430
Before that,

583
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,720
she must not go out.

584
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,720
Yes.

585
00:33:52,620 --> 00:34:00,300
(Yifen Hall)

586
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,040
(Changming,)

587
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,510
(I'm giving you this red dress)

588
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,200
(to let you know.)

589
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,440
(In my heart,)

590
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,070
(only you're worthy of the red color.)

591
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,840
(Even if I marry someone else,)

592
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,920
(that's just for national stability)

593
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,320
(and our future.)

594
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,280
(Can you understand?)

595
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,700
(Chengqing Gate)

596
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,500
(Different Hours)

597
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,340
(Early You hour)

598
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,960
You have been serving me for years.

599
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,550
You should be aware
of the difficulties I face.

600
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,150
Back then, we lost three cities.

601
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,480
Even Huajing City
almost became a border town.

602
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,190
If I didn't prioritize the military

603
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,480
and win a few important battles,

604
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,550
I would lose the people's support.

605
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,760
As long as North Qi exists,

606
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,710
battles are unavoidable.

607
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,160
I know.

608
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,670
Besides the war,

609
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,880
foreign and domestic affairs

610
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,360
need money as well.

611
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,000
But what can I do?

612
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,030
I gave Gu Chusheng

613
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,840
two consecutive promotions.

614
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,030
And I made Wei Yun

615
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,920
the God of War of Great Sui.

616
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,760
These...

617
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,150
I'm not doing

618
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,110
all these things

619
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,320
just to pave the way for Huan.

620
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,880
I'm also trying to build two pillars

621
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
for our country.

622
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,070
It's no longer about politics.

623
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,510
Your Majesty, I'm sorry

624
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,040
I can't share your burden.

625
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,800
Please forgive me.

626
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,760
Over all these years,

627
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,840
you have done

628
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,000
a lot of things for me.

629
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,070
So, I often

630
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,480
turn a blind eye

631
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,760
to your mistakes.

632
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,800
You shielded Yao Yong

633
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,630
and tried to exterminate the Wei family.

634
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,800
You even colluded with North Qi spies

635
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,960
and almost killed my officials.

636
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,630
You shouldn't have done it.

637
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,670
I know I was wrong.

638
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,230
Grand Tutor Xie

639
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,710
once warned me

640
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,880
not to be bewitched by power.

641
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,070
But I...

642
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,400
I failed to stop in time.

643
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,880
But Your Majesty,

644
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,510
I have made many mistakes.

645
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,710
I've also made contributions.

646
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,280
I won't ask for mercy.

647
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,070
But Your Majesty, I beg you

648
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,590
to spare my daughter Linlang.

649
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,590
I grant you permission
to return to your hometown.

650
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,960
This is the end of all these things.

651
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,100
(Zi hour and Chou hour)

652
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,380
(Xuanzheng Hall)

653
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,030
"As the emperor, I hereby confer.

654
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,150
Gu Chusheng, Minister of Personnel,

655
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,000
is intelligent enough

656
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,320
to have made great contributions.

657
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,760
I'm quite relieved.

658
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,550
Now, I make him the Chancellor."

659
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,220
(Chancellor)

660
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

661
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,110
He came back from Qingzhou

662
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,960
and had two consecutive promotions.

663
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,760
Now, he's the head of all officials.

664
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,070
This is unfair.

665
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,550
Why is it unfair?

666
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,630
Young Marquis Wei
killed the King of North Qi.

667
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,030
But he was so arrogant

668
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,000
that he defied His Majesty in court.

669
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,320
So, it's natural

670
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,480
that His Majesty dislikes him.

671
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,600
Yun,

672
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,840
I really hate it

673
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,000
when he's so successful.

674
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,960
I will ask His Majesty

675
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,190
for an explanation on this.

676
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,030
I...

677
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,840
I have something to report.

678
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,590
The Eldest Princess is a noble princess.

679
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,760
But now, she's trapped in North Qi.

680
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,320
I suggest sending a delegation

681
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,150
to negotiate with its new king Zhao Yue

682
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,840
and bring back Her Highness.

683
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,070
It can break the situation

684
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,880
where North Qi restrains us
with Her Highness.

685
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,190
Meanwhile,

686
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,150
it'll show our strength.

687
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,720
Your Majesty,

688
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,190
Zhao Yue lurked in here for years.

689
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,400
Her Highness failed to detect that

690
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,110
and even favored him.

691
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,710
Zhao Yue killed

692
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,070
many of our loyal officials.

693
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,070
Her Highness kept a crocodile as a pet.

694
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,670
Besides, this journey will be dangerous.

695
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,070
Your Majesty,

696
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,190
I don't think

697
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,320
it's worth it to send a delegation

698
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,000
to rescue Her Highness.

699
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,920
Now,

700
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,190
North Qi and our country

701
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,280
both need time to recuperate.

702
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,030
So, peace talks are a wider trend.

703
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,760
But we need to seriously consider

704
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,150
who will be sent

705
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,710
and how they'll negotiate.

706
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,840
We'll discuss it later.

707
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

708
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,710
After you, Mr. Li.

709
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,680
Alright.

710
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,150
Wait, Your Lordship.

711
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,280
A new broom sweeps clean.

712
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,000
We haven't rested yet.

713
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,440
Chancellor, are you sweeping already?

714
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,710
You have a successful career

715
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,550
and keeps rising.

716
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,760
But if you want me

717
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,810
to congratulate you

718
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,710
on every promotion,

719
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,120
do you think

720
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,110
you get promoted for me?

721
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
You're wise, Your Lordship.

722
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,230
You must know

723
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,030
why I was promoted this time.

724
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,990
I even

725
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,480
need to thank you.

726
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,630
You took advantage of us.

727
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,760
Instead of keeping a low profile,

728
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,320
you're showing off.

729
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,390
Wenchang,

730
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,550
His Majesty decides

731
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,390
whether an official

732
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,590
is promoted or demoted.

733
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,440
Don't be unreasonable.

734
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,960
We'd better not get involved.

735
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,390
Let's go.

736
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,950
- Shilan.
- Come on.

737
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,320
Chancellor Gu,

738
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,280
get to the point.

739
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,070
You have made

740
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,590
unparalleled contributions.

741
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,400
You deserved a place in history.

742
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,480
But you defied His Majesty.

743
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,190
What if all your hard work

744
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,400
goes down the drain?

745
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,840
I don't fight battles

746
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,630
for noble titles

747
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,670
or a place in history.

748
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,630
Now, I only want to protect

749
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,400
our people,

750
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,840
Chu Yu,

751
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,440
and my family.

752
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,360
But one can't do whatever he wants

753
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,670
unless he enjoys the highest status.

754
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,670
A wise man foresees risks.

755
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,550
Your Lordship,

756
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,910
I believe

757
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,680
you're a wise man.

758
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,110
Chancellor Gu,

759
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,510
this is none of your concern.
