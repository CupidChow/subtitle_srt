(Be Loyal and Courageous)

22
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,150
Your Highness.

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,680
Do you have any idea

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,070
where I was earlier?

25
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,590
You had 18 cases

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
of betrothal gifts

27
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,240
delivered to Miss Song.

28
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,680
It was a spectacle.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,680
It's now the talk of the town.

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,630
Are you saying this

31
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,840
to mock me?

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,800
Qingping and I have been engaged.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,680
But when I arrived,

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
she broke it off

35
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,360
in public.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,630
It must have spread

37
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,280
all over the city.

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
You're the Crown Prince.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,910
Every move you make

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,910
catches attention.

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
What you actually do

42
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,430
does not matter.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,680
Besides,

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,750
compared to you,

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
this breakup case

46
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,310
would have a much greater impact

47
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,910
on Miss Song.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,870
Chu Linyang.

49
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,680
You really know how to keep your cool.

50
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,470
For a man like you,

51
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,470
Qingping refused to be

52
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,310
the Crown Princess.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,960
You must be

54
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,000
feeling very proud now.

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
With all due respect,

56
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,280
I'd like to be frank, Your Highness.

57
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,240
What Miss Song did

58
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,800
surprised me as well.

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,470
But regardless of whether

60
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,800
she truly meant to break it off,

61
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,240
she and I

62
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,120
weren't meant to be.

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,310
Are you saying this

64
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,520
to calm me down,

65
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,590
because of who my father is?

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,120
Your Highness,

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
instead of guessing

68
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,310
whether I'm the reason

69
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,240
Miss Song broke it off,

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,470
you should think more

71
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
about whether you can give her

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,080
the life she wants.

73
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,590
If you can't,

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
she would still make

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,560
the same choice

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
even without me.

77
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,980
(Sui)

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
General.

79
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,750
Every time you're upset,

80
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,630
you do this.

81
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,120
Is it because you just said something

82
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,920
that you didn't mean?

83
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,040
Which part of that

84
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,000
wasn't the truth?

85
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,710
The truth

86
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,720
may not be true feelings.

87
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,790
Huajing City

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,870
isn't where I belong.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,870
I belong

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
on the battlefield.

91
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,910
One day,

92
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,070
I will return to Fengling City.

93
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,040
I must get back

94
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,800
what I lost there.

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
Miss Song

96
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,040
isn't a caged bird.

97
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,680
But she's a noble lady, after all.

98
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,870
If we're destined to part forever,

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,070
why do we even start?

this is for you.

Jin,

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,840
I broke my promise.

105
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,110
It was my fault.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Hit me.

107
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,270
No, no, no.

108
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,510
She's a gentle lady.

109
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,310
She won't hit me.

110
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,310

with His Highness.

113
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,560

about apologizing to Jin?

115
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,830

116

it must be a gift

142
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,250
from Mr. Song.

143
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,640
He must have realized

144
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,120
he was wrong.

145
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,360

00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,390

151
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,560
But I won't accept anything

152
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,750
just for money.

153
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,430
Since he has his ambitions,

154
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,040

My Lady,

157
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,000
this is just your grief talking.

158
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,120
Look, you came here.

159
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,200
What does that mean?

160
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,630
It means

161
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,190
you still care about Mr. Song

162
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000

163
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,270
No.

164
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,520

173
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,870
It means I'm not that important

to him.

175
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,270
He broke his promise first.

176
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,200
I can't trust him with my life.

00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,230
I promised Jin

194
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,990
I would never go to the battlefield.

195
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,800
But if I make contributions

196
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,700
on the battlefield,

197
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,120
won't she benefit too?

198
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,060
I'm a skilled fighter anyway.

199
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
I won't get hurt easily.

200
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,380
Wenchang,

201
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,860
it might seem trivial

202
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,500
in your eyes.

203
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,740
But to Ms. Chu Jin,

204
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,180
you even failed to keep

205
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,060
such a small promise.

206
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,380
How can she ever trust you again?

207
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,900
822.

208
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,860
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

209
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,020
823.

210
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,340
- You weren't at work.
- 824.

211
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,380
- So, you're tired of writing.
- 825.

212
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,700
Now, you use a sword.

213
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,220
826.

214
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
Chusheng.

215
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,100
Why are you here?

216
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,900
Zhang An told me

217
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,220
you quit your job

218
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,900
and will join the army.

219
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,220
I will be Minister of Personnel.

220
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,380
There'll be a vacancy

221
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
for my old position.

222
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,740
Are you sure you will

223
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,020
leave at this time?

224
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,700
This sword

225
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,980
is heavier than I imagined.

226
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,860
But swinging this sword

227
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,500
is easier for me

228
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,340
than writing at work.

229
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,940
Now, generals are in high demand.

230
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,700
There, I'll have more chances

231
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,020
to stand out.

232
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,860
After all,

233
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,380
I'm from a military family.

234
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,700
Father lifted the ban

235
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,980
that prevented his sons

236
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,820
from going to war.

237
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,100
I should try.

238
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,140
Besides, Chusheng,

239
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,940
your path and mine

240
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,540
are destined to vary.

241
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,820
What if Wenchang

242
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,180
steals your thunder?

243
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,980
He doesn't have what it takes.

244
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm sparkling in the family.

245
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,820
My other brothers

246
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,420
complain a lot about me.

247
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,300
My eldest brother

248
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,380
has been hearing

249
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,620
a lot of rumors.

250
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,340
He doesn't bother.

251
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,980
But he has stood up for me.

252
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,940
On the battlefield,

253
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,980
weapons have no eyes.

254
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,100
People get hurt.

255
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,420
It's time

256
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,900
I protected him.

257
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,940
I hope you'll get what you want.

258
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,300
What about you?

259
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,500
Have you thought

260
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,660
about using the Crown Prince

261
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,780
to break away from the Duke of Ning?

262
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,940
That's the plan.

263
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,660
But I need to be patient.

264
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,140
Master,

265
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,700
Ms. Chu Yu sent a message, asking

266
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,180
to meet you at Spring Breeze House.

267
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,900
I didn't dare to tell Madam.

268
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,700
So, I brought it to you.

269
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,380
(To Gu Chusheng)

270
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,060
(I'll see you at the Shen hour
at Spring Breeze House.)

271
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,500
(Bring what you found
at Qinxi Valley. By Chu Yu)

272
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,780
Since Mrs. Wei saved you

273
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,860
from the Gu family,

274
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,020
the two of you have reconciled.

275
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,340
But Chusheng,

276
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,540
I've heard

277
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,900
since she returned to her own family,

278
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
she hasn't got along

279
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,660
with Wei Yun.

280
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,580
She wants to see you at this time.

281
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
You must think carefully.

282
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,020
At last, she has to come to me.

283
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,780
You're right.

284
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,580
I should think carefully.

285
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,220
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

286
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,060
Did he really go out?

287
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,460
Not only did he go out,

288
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,940
what's even stranger,

289
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,180
he was wearing a new outfit.

290
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,980
He must be meeting someone

291
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,580
very important.

292
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,980
No one but Chu Yu

293
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,780
can make him

294
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
care about his looks.

295
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,600
- It's a good place.
- Really?

296
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,530
I told you about it.

297
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,620
- Welcome.
- Is it fine?

298
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,890
- This way, please.
- Alright.

299
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,140
Let's sit over there.

300
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,710
What would you like to eat? My treat.

301
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,670
- Anything.
- Sit.

302
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,140
Mr. Gu, you seem surprised

303
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,180
to see me here.

304
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,700
Yu is married,

305
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,020
and so are you.

306
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,540
You shouldn't meet alone.

307
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,180
These days, in Huajing City,

308
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,300
people gossip a lot.

309
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
As her brother,

310
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,020
I have to be here.

311
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,900
Mr. Gu,

312
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,260
take a seat.

313
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,900
Mrs. Wei, what is it you want

314
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,380
to see me about?

315
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,380
I think you know why.

316
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
What on earth

317
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,260
did you find

318
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,420
at Qinxi Valley?

319
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,900
Is this the only reason

320
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,780
you wanted to see me?

321
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,300
Or what?

322
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,540
Thank you for your fair judgment

323
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,260
that brought Yao Yong to justice.

324
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,860
After we parted,

325
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
you were gone for days.

326
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,820
I meant to see you,

327
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,140
but I was held back

328
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,980
in Yao Yong's case.

329
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,180
Compared to that,

330
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,180
I would rather hear you say,

331
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,820
"Be safe."

332
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,580
Where is that stuff?

333
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,380
Yao Yong is dead.

334
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,620
Everything is settled.

335
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,580
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao
have entered North Qi.)

336
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,900
(20 spies to serve General Yao.)
Is this clue

337
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,300
still that important?

338
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,460
Of course.

339
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,740
This secret letter

340
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,740
indeed can prove Yao Yong's sin.

341
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,380
I also thought that

342
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,860
by sending killers after you,

343
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,140
Yao Yong aims to
divide me and Wei Yu,

344
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,780
so he can crush us individually.

345
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,100
But Yao Yong did not know

346
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,120
anything about it.

347
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,210
He even believes

348
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,140
Wei Yun and I

349
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,620
would appear at Dingfeng Valley.

350
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,180
So it was someone else

351
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,660
who wanted to kill me.

352
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,980
But the paper of this letter

353
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,540
is ordinary.

354
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,660
And you read it.

355
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,860
Nothing is special.

356
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,000
In that case,

357
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,540
why don't you give it to me?

358
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,980
I'll keep pursuing it.

359
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,340
Maybe I can find

360
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,220
some new clues.

361
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,060
Yu,

362
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,540
it's very hard

363
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,660
to investigate alone.

364
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,660
Let me

365
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,780
do it with you.

366
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,060
You're Minister of Justice.

367
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,860
It's indeed your duty

368
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,380
to clean up North Qi remnants.

369
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,660
But after holding it

370
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,580
for some days,

371
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,980
you made no progress.

372
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,740
Why don't you let Yu do it?

373
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,500
She may achieve something.

374
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,660
And I will accompany her.

375
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,260
She won't be alone.

376
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,700
Am I

377
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,900
interrupting?

378
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,260
Gu, you're so well dressed.

379
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,540
I thought you would
meet an honored guest.

380
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,220
So, you were meeting Mrs. Wei

381
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,700
and General Chu.

382
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,540
I don't think we should get involved

383
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,620
in your conversation.

384
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,420
So, we'll take our leave.

385
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,260
Chu Yu.

386
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,460
Now that I'm here,

387
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,700
let's make everything clear.

388
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,900
I'm always a decent woman.

389
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,340
But today,

390
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,300
I will lay everything out

391
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,060
and make it clear

392
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,700
between you and Gu

393
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,460
regardless of my dignity.

394
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,140
He never dared

395
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,020
to ask you something.

396
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,930
I'll ask for him, too.

397
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,790
Linlang.

398
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,100
General Chu is also here.

399
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,260
You tell me in his face.

400
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,940
Will you and Gu

401
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,860
get back together?

402
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,460
Haven't you figured it out yet?

403
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,860
It's not Chu Yu who stands between us.

404
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,660
It's you and your father

405
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,060
who stand between Chu Yu and me.

406
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,940
Indeed.

407
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,380
My father forced you to marry me.

408
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,140
But your career

409
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,980
also took off

410
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
with my family's power.

411
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,140
Gu Chusheng,

412
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,420
you can't be so ungrateful.

413
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,940
You can't pursue power

414
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,140
and Chu Yu at the same time.

415
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,340
You're right.

416
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,900
I was forced.

417
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
But I did get

418
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,700
what I wanted.

419
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,540
But I, Gu Chusheng,

420
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,140
will never be a puppet

421
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,700
of you and your father.

422
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,820
Linlang,

423
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,380
you think I'm greedy.

424
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,780
Then tell me.

425
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,060
When your father held a dagger

426
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,580
to my neck,

427
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,540
what would you choose if you were me?

428
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,580
Chu Yu,

429
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,140
did you hear that?

430
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,540
Wang Linlang,

431
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,940
it's never me who stands

432
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
between the two of you.

433
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,300
And it's not you who stands

434
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,700
between the two of us.

435
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,460
Your problem

436
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,940
doesn't concern me.

437
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
Linyang, let's go.

438
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,660
(Spring Breeze House)

439
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,580
Linlang,

440
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,020
you're a good woman,

441
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,340
but I only love her.

442
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,700
I was telling the truth.

443
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
It's not Chu Yu

444
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,940
but your father

445
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,580
who stands between us.

446
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,540
If I hadn't been made

447
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,180
to marry you like that,

448
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,940
you and I might not be so miserable.

449
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,260
I know you hate him.

450
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,140
But after all,

451
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,700
I am the reason

452
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,100
he's been forcing you.

453
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,260
I know you want me

454
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,100
to back down.

455
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,220
Back down?

456
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,580
Your father colluded with outsiders,

457
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,980
trying to kill me.

458
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,420
Did he also do that

459
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
to make me back down?

460
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,900
What are you saying?

461
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,580
That's impossible.

462
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,540
My father wouldn't do that.

463
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,220
Gu,

464
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,420
my father arranged everything

465
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,260
to get you back from the southwest.

466
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,140
He cleared your record,

467
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,340
got you in the exam,

468
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,620
and even made you Minister of Justice.

469
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,940
Everyone at court knows

470
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,580
you're his most trusted man.

471
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,700
Why would he kill you?

472
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,940
No one but your father

473
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,460
knew where I was that day.

474
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,020
This is all I need to say.

475
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,220
What Gu Chusheng just said

476
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,540
was intended for you, perhaps.

477
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,180
I know.

478
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,660
He even used Ms. Wang

479
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,900
to make sure I would know.

480
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,820
He's trying to make me relent.

481
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,460
It seems that he knows me better

482
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,420
than I think he does.

483
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,100
Then, Yu.

484
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,740
He didn't have a choice then.

485
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,340
The two of you...

486
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,540
We won't be back together.

487
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,500
Nothing will help.

488
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,140
After all,

489
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,100
he had a third option.

490
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,780
To explain everything to me

491
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,740
and face it with me.

492
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,140
But he didn't.

493
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,340
A woman like me

494
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,620
will only look forward.

495
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,420
What's so funny?

496
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,700
Well, it's...

497
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,020
There was a time

498
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,780
when I said the same

499
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,940
to Wei Yun.

500
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,580
Come on. One more.

501
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,980
Congratulations, Yun.

502
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,020
You've had revenge.

503
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,540
Cheers.

504
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
What's wrong?

505
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,060
What's bothering him?

506
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,860
Can't you see?

507
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,180
He's trapped in love.

508
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,980
I know.

509
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,460
Then, who does he like?

510
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,380
Do you really not know that?

511
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,580
Just tell me.

512
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,660
Ms. Chu Yu.

513
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,940
I knew it.

514
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,940
Tragic, huh?

515
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,100
But in that case,

516
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,740
our seniority will get messed up.

517
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,700
He and Ms. Chu Yu...

518
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,460
Ms. Chu Yu is his sister-in-law.

519
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,140
What shall I call her, then?

520
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
What are you doing?

521
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,940
I'm the one who sees
a lot of pretty women

522
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,020
but cares for none of them.

523
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,420
In Huajing City,

524
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,980
I'm known to all,

525
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,140
loved by all,

526
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,980
and supported by all.

527
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,260
Do you need our help?

528
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,700
(Always Fortunate, Always Propitious)

529
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,060
(Chu Mansion)
Take a look.

530
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,500
Make the lanterns align.

531
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,500
- Sure.
- Be careful.

532
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,340
Alright.

533
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
Leave this to me.

534
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,820
Alright.

535
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,300
The two of you, hang it properly.

536
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,430
- Sure.
- Alright.

537
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,220
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao
have entered North Qi.)

538
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,800
(20 spies have been sent
into Great Sui to serve General Yao.)

539
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,860
My Lady!

540
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,260
Master! Madam!

541
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,860
Come out and see!

542
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,340
Mother,

543
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,980
so many treasures.

544
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,940
Jin.

545
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,300
(Wei)
Wei?

546
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,700
So, I'm sure

547
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,180
these things are for Chu Yu.

548
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,060
Why did they deliver

549
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,220
so many gifts?

550
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,300
Wei.

551
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,500
Marquis of Zhenguo is here.

552
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,140
Why are you here?

553
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,220
Don't be so disrespectful.

554
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,180
Yeah.

555
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,500
Don't scare him away.

556
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,860
I'm here for Ms. Chu Yu.

557
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,100
Young Marquis,

558
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,420
what do you mean?

559
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,460
Greetings, Madam Chu.

560
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,780
And General Chu.

561
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,340
Ms. Chu Yu got married

562
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,220
in such haste.

563
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,580
It took us

564
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,740
a very long time

565
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,580
to regain our status.

566
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,740
So, her wedding

567
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,580
was delayed.

568
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,100
These are

569
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,060
some thank-you gifts for her.

570
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,580
Please check.

571
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,180
Mother, let me do it.

572
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,300
I'm good at that.

573
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,340
(Catalog)

574
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,380
It's so generous of His Lordship.

575
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,020
Thank-you gift?

576
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,820
Why do I think

577
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,740
they're like betrothal gifts?

578
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,900
Speaking of which,

579
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,420
Yu married into your family

580
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,780
without traditional marriage rituals.

581
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,060
It seems that

582
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,460
you're making it up

583
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,500
for General Wei.

584
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,540
That's not true.

585
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,420
I'm not doing this for him.

586
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,340
So, on whose behalf

587
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,660
are you doing this?

588
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,780
On his own behalf, of course.

589
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,180
We have regained our status

590
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,780
with Ms. Chu's great help.

591
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,980
If my parents were alive,

592
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,740
they would also prepare...

593
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,700
The thank-you gifts.

594
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,100
I'm just doing this

595
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,940
for my parents.

596
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,980
What if I ask you

597
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,940
for a divorce paper?

598
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,740
Then, as the former Mrs. Wei,

599
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,220
she still deserves

600
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,060
all these things.

601
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,460
Thank you, Young Marquis

602
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,300
for your generosity.

603
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,100
But I don't think

604
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,340
she wants the paper now.

605
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,340
What are they talking about?

606
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,260
Are you sure?

607
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,900
My brother is right.

608
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,660
I need to think it over.

609
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,100
Stop talking in riddles.

610
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,940
I don't understand.

611
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,580
It's getting late.

612
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Your Lordship,

613
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,340
why don't you stay for a meal?

614
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,660
- No need.
- Alright.

615
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,620
Young Marquis is here

616
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,020
with so many gifts,

617
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,940
but you don't keep him for a meal.

618
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,100
If it gets out,

619
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,340
people will laugh at us

620
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,020
for being impolite.

621
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,860
That's right.

622
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,020
Your Lordship,

623
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,980
come in, please.

624
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,940
Thank you, Madam Chu.

625
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,820
But without Ms. Chu's permission,

626
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
I wouldn't have it.

627
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,460
Come in, please.

628
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,900
Make yourself at home.

629
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,460
Eat more.

630
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,940
Thank you, Madam Chu.

631
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,500
Here. Have some more.

632
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,580
- It's enough.
- It's fine.

633
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,100
- Really.
- Help yourself.

634
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,940
Yu,

635
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,580
I had our cook make this.

636
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,580
Taste it.

637
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,220
Does it taste the same as before?

638
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,060
It's delicious.

639
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,060
Linyang,

640
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,820
why do you only

641
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,260
serve her food again?

642
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,740
Here.

643
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,220
This is for you, Jin.

644
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,740
Alright?

645
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,100
But I don't like fried fish.

646
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,620
When Linyang serves you food,

647
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,100
just say thank you.

648
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,100
Don't be so obstinate.

649
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,380
Or what will you do

650
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,940
when you get married?

651
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,260
Your Lordship,

652
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,620
sorry for that.

653
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,460
Please excuse her.

654
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,540
It's nothing.

655
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,420
Don't worry, Madam Chu.

656
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,180
I knew

657
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,220
you would be

658
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,420
a most polite man.

659
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,940
Now your family

660
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,980
has restored its vitality.

661
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,740
Many matchmakers

662
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,860
are scrambling
to arrange a marriage for you.

663
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,300
I was wondering,

664
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,420
have you decided
whom to marry?

665
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,620
Not yet.

666
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,180
Your Lordship,

667
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,620
you're impressive.

668
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,100
At such a young age,
you've done much in war.

669
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,140
And you're from a noble family.

670
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,380
You certainly have high standards.

671
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,380
It's too soon to think of that.

672
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,900
Currently,

673
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,420
you're a leading general.

674
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,580
It's time you considered

675
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,340
your marriage thing.

676
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
I have someone in mind

677
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,940
who would be a good fit.

678
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,620
I wonder if you will

679
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,740
think about it.

680
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,620
You don't need
to get Chu Yu's consent.

681
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,780
Do you yourself want to?

682
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,500
What do you think of our Chu Jin?

683
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,620
- No.
- No.

684
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,460
Why?

685
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,380
You're both single.

686
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,580
Besides,

687
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,490
military families
have made repeated merits.

688
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,420
Now,

689
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,500
His Majesty has permitted

690
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,460
marriages between military families.

691
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,140
I can tell that you don't

692
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,420
reject our family.

693
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,180
Chu Yu is a good woman.

694
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,140
Chu Jin is

695
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,660
even better.

696
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,380
Mother has a point.

697
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,100
However,

698
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,780
the three of you said no.

699
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,980
There should be reasons.

700
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,620
Tell Mother the reasons.

701
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,500
- Jin, you go first.
- I...

702
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,460
But I want Ms. Chu Yu

703
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,940
to say it first.

704
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,620
Anyone who lives

705
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,700
in the Wei family

706
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,580
needs martial arts.

707
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,940
Jin has no martial arts at all.

708
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,220
She can learn.

709
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,260
I can teach her.

710
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,620
Why don't you tell me

711
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,060
what kind of woman

712
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,900
would fit me?

713
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,060
A woman whom you like

714
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,620
and who likes you back.

715
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,540
Mother,

716
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,300
I'll never marry a man

717
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,660
who goes to war.

718
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,220
This is my rule.

719
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,300
- You...
- Yeah.

720
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,140
I agree.

721
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,500
Warriors may die in the war.

722
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,980
It's risky to marry me.

723
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,660
You guys talk.

724
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,220
I have things to do.

725
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,300
I'll take my leave.

726
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,740
Young Marquis,

727
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,620
let's play chess.

728
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,020
Shall we?

729
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,260
Let's go.

730
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,220
Why are you taking me

731
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,060
to Chu Mansion?

732
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,420
Jin doesn't want to see me.

733
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,500
Didn't you say

734
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,900
Young Marquis Wei

735
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,860
took Mr. Lu's advice

736
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,060
and delivered betrothal gifts?

737
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,020
Don't you want

738
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,860
to take a look?

739
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,860
Besides,

740
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,580
since when have you been so timid?

741
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,500
Ms. Chu Jin doesn't come to you.

742
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,900
But you can go see her.

743
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,260
Right.

744
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,940
You're right.

745
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,140
Let's go.

746
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,740
Catch up.

747
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,420
You little fool.

748
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,700
Young Marquis Wei is perfect.

749
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,060
Even your brother helps you

750
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,220
to find out his thoughts.

751
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,900
You must seize the opportunity.

752
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,300
Oh, Mother.

753
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,920
My heart belongs to someone else.

754
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,780
I just haven't made up my mind.

755
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,350
Don't make a mismatch.

756
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,940
I'm doing this for your good.

757
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,060
You silly girl.

758
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,140
So many dishes aren't finished.

759
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,620
Do you think this game

760
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,700
can be won?

761
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,500
It's not the end yet.

762
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,980
No one can predict.

763
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,780
You're playing

764
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,420
in quite an unusual way.

765
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,940
Special, indeed.

766
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,820
Before, I didn't like

767
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,660
to play like this.

768
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,780
In that case,

769
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,260
you're behaving

770
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,460
quite like Yu.

771
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,490
There's nothing wrong
with being unusual.

772
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,540
Conforming isn't wrong, either.

773
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,900
But when making a decision,

774
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,580
one should ask himself

775
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,340
what he really wants.

776
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,620
Sounds like you have

777
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,700
thought very clearly.

778
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,580
It won't be

779
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,100
an easy road.

780
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
But if I do nothing,

781
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,140
I will regret it.

782
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,580
You can regret in a game.

783
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,460
But human life

784
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,780
is always limited.

785
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,060
Young Marquis,

786
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,260
I have to remind you.

787
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,380
You're accustomed to battles.

788
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,300
But it doesn't mean

789
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,140
you can do

790
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,580
something else without scruple

791
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,420
just like that.

792
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,500
I know you're impatient.

793
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,020
But you have to wait

794
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,260
and see if the other person has decided

795
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,980
and whether she wants

796
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,260
to fight a way out with you.

797
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,220
By then,

798
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,940
will you help me

799
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,980
remove the obstacles?

800
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,380
Or will you stand in my way?

801
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,260
Yu is my sister

802
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,500
and the pearl of this family.

803
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,580
What I choose

804
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,380
doesn't matter.
