I'll teach you how to massage

23

When you have free time,

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,310
you can press and lift, like this.

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,520
As for the timing...

27
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,190
You can count like this:

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,150
Tuantuan, press.

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,240
Linyang, lift.

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,150
Tuantuan, press.

31
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,590
Linyang, lift.

32
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,270
How do you feel?

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,840
So, Tuantuan...

34
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,430
Is it your nickname?

35
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,030
I...

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,080
Miss Song.

37
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,150
Get up.

38
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,750
Miss Song,

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
are you alright?

40
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,910
Just now, did I

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,630
make a fool of myself?

42
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,870
Not at all.

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,710
The way you slipped

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
reminded me of Yu

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,750
when she was a child.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,030
She often got into trouble.

47
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,470
But just like you,

48
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,310
she was adorable.

49
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,630
General Chu,

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,150
you look great when you're smiling.

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,710
You should smile more.

52
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,120
Staying in good spirits

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,310
will help you recover faster.

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
I will.

55
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,310
Miss Song...

56
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,470
General Chu,

57
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,960
can you please

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,000
call me Tuantuan?

59
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,710
Tuantuan?

60
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,750
Then from now on,

61
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,120
I'll call you Linyang.

62
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,870
Linyang, I should go.

63
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,030
I'll escort you.

64
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,870
No need.

65
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,590
Shilan will come to get me.

66
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,520
We had a deal.

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
Linyang,

68
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,430
goodbye.

69
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,910
Since you inherited

70
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,710
and took over the Bureau,

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,150
you must have been busy.

72
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,800
Why do you have the time

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,600
to invite me over for fishing?

74
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,230
However busy I am,

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,560
I need to meet someone important.

76
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,350
Sit, please.

77
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,190
You flatter me.

78
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,440
Anyway, I don't

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,680
see your point.

80
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
Without Yu,

81
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,270
you and I

82
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,430
would never have even met.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
I attended your banquet

84
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,270
also for her sake.

85
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,590
What a coincidence.

86
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,430
Today, I invited you over

87
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,680
for something

88
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,600
about Ms. Chu Yu.

89
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,120
What will you do to her again?

90
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,310
Please pay her no mind.

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,750
I've spoiled her too much.

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,390
Did she make trouble again

93
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
in your mansion?

94
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,560
Well, Ms. Chu Yu

95
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,870
has indeed caused

96
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,000
some terrible trouble.

97
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,430
She's reaching

98
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,600
for what's beyond her.

99
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,680
But luckily, we share the same goal

100
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,680
for the same thing.

101
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,680
What do you mean?

102
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,430
Ms. Chu Yu and I

103
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,430
had a frank conversation.

104
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,800
I also know she married my brother

105
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,720
to investigate the crossbow case.

106
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,830
So, before Wei Jun died,

107
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,920
he had told you

108
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,760
about that case.

109
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
He trusted you.

110
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,480
Before he died,

111
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
he had promised you.

112
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll do that for him.

113
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,160
Just now, you looked

114
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,630
really like him.

115
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,790
Take this back.

116
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,110
The crossbow

117
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,720
came from the Arsenal Bureau.

118
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,480
They may have

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,830
some improvement methods,

120
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,720
but no practical experience.

121
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,560
I hope you will help them

122
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
to find a solution soon.

123
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,790
If you stay silent,

124
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,720
I'll take it as a yes.

125
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Young Marquis,

126
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,510
that's a big fish, indeed.

127
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,460
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

128
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Shilan.

129
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,360
Why do you think

130
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,430
Linyang is such a nice man?

131
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,680
He didn't blame me
when I did wrong acupuncture.

132
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,540
He even offered

133
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,000
his arms for me

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,840
to practice on.

135
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,520
Tuantuan.

136
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,000
Since you left his mansion,

137
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,680
you've been talking about him

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
all this time.

139
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,510
Why don't you think about it?

140
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,560
Do you want to treat him,

141
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
or do you just want to see him?

142
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,030
Have a good rest.

143
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,520
My Lady,

144
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,310
we've been out here for a while.

145
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,190
How about we go back early?

146
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,240
Your brother just punished you.

147
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
If he knows about it,

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
he'll be angry again.

149
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,430
I'm just taking a walk out here.

150
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,310
Why would he be angry?

151
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,870
Chu Yu and I don't get along.

152
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,600
But my brother wants us

153
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
to become close.

154
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,630
It's not that easy.

155
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,590
In the worst case,

156
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,270
I'll just stop myself

157
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,600
from messing with her,

158
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
alright?

159
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,960
But My Lady,

160
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,870
my legs are sore from walking.

161
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,270
If we don't go home,

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,630
can we find somewhere

163
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,470
to take a break?

164
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,000
Spring Breeze House, then.

165
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,080
I can buy some cold noodles there.

166
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,560
That's the food

167
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,410
your brother loves.

168
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,360
Are you buying them for him?

169
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,630
Who said that?

170
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,470
They're for me.

171
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,600
Sorry, I was inconsiderate.

172
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,510
It was thoughtless of me to give you

173
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,150
those ordinary willow chopsticks.

174
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,150
These chopsticks are made of phoebe.

175
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
Try them.

176
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,390
Didn't you say Ms. Chu Jin

177
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,480
would often come here?

178
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,510
Why haven't I even seen her once?

179
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,050
Sir, look over there.

180
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,600
Come on.

181
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,270
Go invite her over.

182
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,150
Hurry.

183
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,990
Alright.

184
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Come in, please.

185
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,750
Hi, Ms. Chu Jin.

186
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
Mr. Song is there.

187
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,110
This way, please.

188
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,510
Miss,

189
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
it'll be my treat.

190
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,530
Come on, let's go.

191
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
Ms. Chu Jin,

192
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
we meet again.

193
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
Sit, please.

194
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,390
Ms. Chu Jin,

195
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,230
are you unhappy?

196
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,680
Yun,

197
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,030
Madam Chu is here to see Yu.

198
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,150
I know that, Chun.

199
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,840
But Chu Yu is sick.

200
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,480
I don't want her

201
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,360
to infect her mother.

202
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,870
General Chu has only just recovered.

203
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,840
If he catches something else,

204
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
it would be terrible.

205
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
Wanyue,

206
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,750
send those pastries

207
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,590
to Chu Yu.

208
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,510
She loved them when she was little.

209
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,870
Yes, Madam.

210
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,440
Madam Chu, is there

211
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,280
anything else?

212
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,350
Yun.

213
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,200
Madam Chu,

214
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
His Lordship

215
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
is straightforward.

216
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
And he seldom receives female guests.

217
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,910
Please don't mind him.

218
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,390
It doesn't matter.

219
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,320
I just want to ask.

220
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,480
Some ladies here

221
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
got the Letter of Release

222
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,790
and went back home.

223
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,750
I wonder what you plan

224
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,150
to do about my daughter?

225
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,870
What is your opinion, Madam?

226
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
I've heard

227
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,270
you often come here.

228
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,320
So, these days,

229
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
I came every day for you.

230
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,590
For me?

231
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,750
Why?

232
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,670
Because I like you.

233
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,080
Like me?

234
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,440
Yeah. I like you.

235
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,150
Mr. Song,

236
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
don't you think I am mean?

237
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,630
I said harsh things

238
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,630
at that banquet.

239
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,200
Not at all.

240
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,200
At the banquet,

241
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,360
a lot of people thought

242
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,200
Yun would fail.

243
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,990
It happens. I understand.

244
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,590
Mr. Song.

245
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,230
Do you really often visit
the Fragrance House?

246
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,160
I...

247
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,960
I...

248
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,870
I was immature before.

249
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
But I've totally changed.

250
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,080
I won't go there anymore.

251
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,910
Don't trust the Crown Prince.

252
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,750
He lied about...

253
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,800
Anyway...

254
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,350
I mean, I swear

255
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,440
I won't go there again.

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,270
Have I said something wrong?

257
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,030
Let me be frank.

258
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,600
After that banquet,

259
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,600
Young Master Sun set my sister up.

260
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,550
Then my brother Linyang

261
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,750
blamed it all on me.

262
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,480
In their eyes,

263
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,120
I'm a lady

264
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
who is spoiled and unruly.

265
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,990
But that day,

266
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
I cut it off with him

267
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,240
right away.

268
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,120
Whenever it's about my sister,

269
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,360
Linyang becomes irrational.

270
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,360
They never understand me.

271
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't undervalue yourself.

272
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,440
In my eyes,

273
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,840
you're the most lovely lady

274
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,000
in this world.

275
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,710
Then tell me.

276
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,960
What's good about me?

277
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,440
You...

278
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,080
You are...

279
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,960
Well, you...

280
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,960
I understand.

281
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,840
You and I only met once.

282
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,000
It's normal if you stammer.

283
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,390
No, no, no.

284
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
That's not true.

285
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,320
Think about it.

286
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,360
You made a timely break

287
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,320
with Young Master Sun.

288
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,160
What does that mean?

289
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,670
It means you're sensible.

290
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,960
Besides,

291
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,960
you can face your true feelings.

292
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,390
So, you're brave.

293
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,910
A clever, brave,

294
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,720
and pretty woman like you

295
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,800
is wonderful.

296
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,870
Look, look.

297
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,150
You have a nice smile.

298
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,000
Everything about you is wonderful.

299
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,720
Why would General Chu not like you?

300
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,360
Mr. Song,

301
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,150
you make me feel better.

302
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,200
Mr. Song,

303
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,200
this is today's bill. Please check.

304
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,040
Alright.

305
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,040
Wait.

306
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,710
Waiter,

307
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,090
it must be a wrong bill.

308
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,840
The dishes should be worth four taels.

309
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,670
Why is it five here?

310
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,480
Mr. Song,

311
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,960
don't come here anymore.

312
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,840
Every time you're here,

313
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,510
I guess you pay more than you deserve.

314
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,200
Oh, come on.

315
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,630
Luckily, Ms. Chu Jin saw through it.

316
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,000
How dare you overcharge me?

317
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,150
I'm rich.

318
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,160
But you can't rob me.

319
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,600
Mr... Mr. Song...

320
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
Don't say that.

321
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,360
It must be the accountant's fault.

322
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,960
I'll go back there

323
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
for a recalculation.

324
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,350
Sorry, sorry.

325
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,270
Thank you, Ms. Chu Jin.

326
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,870
I've heard you do well

327
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,000
in accounting.

328
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
If someone

329
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,480
can marry you,

330
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,630
I'm sure you will

331
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,080
arrange everything perfectly.

332
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,200
Come on.

333
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,440
Have some food.

334
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,230
Here.

335
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,600
Your mother has come.

336
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,200
What's your decision?

337
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,600
What is your plan?

338
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,840
Before, you offered me

339
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,870
the Letter of Release.

340
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,150
What's gone is gone.

341
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,070
Now, it's different.

342
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,080
Rationally speaking,

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,840
I want you to leave.

344
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,760
If you suspect anyone,

345
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,870
I can cooperate.

346
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,630
But...

347
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,240
But I think

348
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,510
you should decide

349
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,400
what you want to do.

350
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,750
Rationally speaking,

351
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,480
it's true.

352
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,920
Staying here is

353
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,070
more convenient for me to take action.

354
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,200
And you saw my mother.

355
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,200
If I'm back home,

356
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,310
there will be much inconvenience.

357
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,510
So, I want to stay here.

358
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,680
I can help to rebuild this family.

359
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,200
You're going to be a general

360
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,680
whose name will go down in history.

361
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,560
What do you say,

362
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,910
Your Lordship?

363
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,680
Will you let me stay

364
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,790
and work with you?

365
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,750
From what I just heard,

366
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
you and your mother aren't close.

367
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,920
But she seemed to be trying hard

368
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,110
to bridge the gap.

369
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,000
My mother and I...

370
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,240
When my father mediated,

371
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,680
things weren't too bad.

372
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,280
But now...

373
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,720
You have me.

374
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
You need to rest

375
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,390
for your injuries.

376
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,070
Will you stop moving around?

377
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,390
And you.

378
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,310
Will you stop getting in

379
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,280
as you please?

380
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,920
What?

381
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,200
Now, you don't care

382
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
about our relationship?

383
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,790
You're not my real sister-in-law.

384
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,110
We can pretend in public.

385
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,920
But in private, don't tease me.

386
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,960
It's so late.

387
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,440
I wonder if Yu is asleep.

388
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,680
I don't think so.

389
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,190
Be careful.

390
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,000
Yu.

391
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,670
Are you asleep?

392
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,400
Lan and I

393
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,680
have come with some herbs.

394
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,950
Why?

395
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,440
What do you think?

396
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
If they see

397
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,520
a man like me

398
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,480
staying in your room so late,

399
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,480
it will be terrible.

400
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,190
I...

401
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,790
You go tell them

402
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,830
that you're asleep.

403
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,910
What?

404
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,150
You're scared?

405
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,310
Don't give that kind of look.

406
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,280
What do you want?

407
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,030
I wonder

408
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,920
if she's getting better.

409
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,920
The physician said

410
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,200
the herbs were very effective.

411
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,750
Why is there no reply?

412
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,590
Where did Wanyue go?

413
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,280
Let's go take a look.

414
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,070
So it's you, ladies.

415
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,350
I thought I was dreaming.

416
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,110
Are you feeling any better?

417
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,440
Here are some herbs for you.

418
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,510
Let me bring them in.

419
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,350
No need.

420
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,440
I think I've caught a cold.

421
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,280
Don't get in, or I may infect you.

422
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,590
If the children are sick,

423
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,430
that will be bad.

424
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,520
That's right.

425
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,880
Then, tomorrow,

426
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,070
we'll come and see you.

427
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,630
Alright.

428
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,560
Go to bed early.

429
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,510
- Rest early.
- Go.

430
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,350
Let's go.

431
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,240
Tell me.

432
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,440
What else do you need to say?

433
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,350
Today,

434
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,240
I told your big brother everything

435
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,720
and returned the mechanism.

436
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,520
You no longer need

437
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,070
to worry about him.

438
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,920
The point is...

439
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,760
Look at this.

440
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,830
A clue about the man

441
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,670
behind Wei Tongfeng.

442
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,590
Lu Qiba helped us figure it out.

443
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,510
He's quite helpful.

444
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,140
(Yao Yong may have bribed Wei Tongfeng.)

445
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,040
Yao Yong?

446
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,160
I remember that General Yao Yong

447
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,400
was just like my father.

448
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,880
They both advanced

449
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,160
by fighting in battles.

450
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,960
He followed Lord of Qin.

451
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,920
That year, we lost three towns.

452
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,440
Without his defense,

453
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,030
Qingzhou would have fallen

454
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,870
into the North Qi's hands.

455
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,960
Lord of Qin?

456
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,660
(Details of Wei Tongfeng's Case)

457
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,390
What's wrong?

458
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,030
I remember Gu Chusheng told me

459
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,480
there were hidden details

460
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,880
of Lord of Qin's treason.

461
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,240
If that's true,

462
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,920
is Yao Yong getting revenge?

463
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,830
Why is Gu Chusheng involved again?

464
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,240
His family was sentenced to execution

465
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,550
due to that case.

466
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,030
My father went into the palace overnight

467
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,920
to meet His Majesty

468
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,270
and kept Gu Chusheng alive.

469
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,840
Never mind.

470
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,400
He does not have to help

471
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,310
investigate Yao Yong.

472
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,670
Right.

473
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,720
We don't rely on him.

474
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,640
The Yao family.

475
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,000
Someone in that family

476
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,400
may be able to help us.

477
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,100
(Yao Mansion)

478
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,030
General,

479
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,070
Wei Tongfeng was exposed.

480
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,310
The other day, Wei Yun

481
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,510
killed him in the Bureau.

482
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,620
(Impatience will ruin big plans.)

483
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,480
He's dead?

484
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,680
Good.

485
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,270
Wei Tongfeng

486
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,790
sold the secrets of the Arsenal Bureau

487
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,350
and committed treason.

488
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,350
He deserves to be killed.

489
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,680
But what if they trace it back

490
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,160
to you?

491
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,790
When we do something,

492
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,590
we're ready for possible exposure.

493
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,440
But sadly,

494
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,920
why was his cover

495
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,440
blown so soon?

496
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,200
Our preparations

497
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,510
aren't sufficient yet.

498
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,070
I will go

499
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,590
and deal with all the people

500
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,430
related to him.

501
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,160
You're the one most closely involved.

502
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,870
General.

503
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,510
I'll clean up.

504
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,350
And General,

505
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,550
a letter was for Lady Jue

506
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,310
from the Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion.

507
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,790
These days, I've been so busy

508
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,200
that I have neglected

509
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,440
my cousin Yao Jue.

510
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,310
It's getting cold.

511
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,960
Don't forget

512
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,590
to give her some clothes.

513
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,040
Yes.

514
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,380
(Yao Yong is colluding
with the North Qi.)

515
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,620
(Please come back and help us.)

516
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,270
My cousin

517
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,510
is colluding with the North Qi.

518
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,800
Lady Jue,

519
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,800
General summoned you.

520
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,000
Cousin.

521
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,440
How dare you?

522
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,840
Kneel.

523
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,680
Jue is my cousin.

524
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,310
After she was divorced,

525
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,750
she moved in here.

526
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,790
But what did you do?

527
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,680
You didn't take care of her properly.

528
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,920
Look at her clothes

529
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,760
and her jewels.

530
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,000
She isn't as decent

531
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,840
as she should be.

532
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,310
Ignorant people

533
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,440
may think

534
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,790
I've been mistreating her.

535
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,400
Don't be angry, General.

536
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,590
Sorry for the improper care.

537
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,680
Calm down, cousin.

538
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,310
He offered me

539
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,590
a lot of things.

540
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I don't like to dress up,

541
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,240
so I'm not wearing any.

542
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,800
Come on.

543
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,310
With very low desire,

544
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,560
you've been kind.

545
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,000
Since she pleaded for you,

546
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,840
I'll let you go.

547
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,980
- Get out.
- Yes.

548
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,830
Just a misunderstanding.

549
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,910
Come on.

550
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,920
These days,

551
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,960
I've been too busy

552
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,830
to care about you.

553
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,110
Sorry for that.

554
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,630
Sit.

555
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,510
Earlier, I had my cook

556
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,550
make this tonic soup.

557
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,920
And I'm here to apologize.

558
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,790
I'm immensely grateful

559
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,400
when you take me in, cousin.

560
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,270
We're bonded in blood.

561
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,000
No need for formalities.

562
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,720
Here. Taste it.

563
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,000
Thank you, cousin.

564
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,800
How is it?

565
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,000
Pretty delicious, huh?

566
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,000
This soup is called

567
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,510
"Mother-child Soup".

568
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,830
A hen and her chick were killed

569
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,590
and stewed for two hours.

570
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,040
So,

571
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
it's delicious.

572
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,920
Luckily, chickens don't have feelings.

573
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,830
They don't know

574
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,510
a mother will usually die

575
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,750
together with her child.

576
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,760
For example,

577
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
you're living here.

578
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,550
If this family falls,

579
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,030
you won't be able to get away.

580
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,480
If I'm in trouble,

581
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,240
I will certainly kill your kid

582
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,000
who stays in the Wei family.

583
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,350
Jue,

584
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,070
think carefully about it.

585
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,110
No.

586
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,590
A clever woman

587
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,000
knows what to choose.

588
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,920
But what if she loses her mind?

589
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,030
Jue, you've been very clever.

590
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,440
I don't think you'll let me down.

591
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,070
Xiaoxiao.

592
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,910
My Lady.

593
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,770
Xiaoxiao.

594
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,980
- Hurry.
- My Lady.

595
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,510
Write a letter to Chu Yu.

596
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,400
Tell her with the divorce paper,

597
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,920
I'm no longer a Mrs. Wei

598
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,680
and I have nothing to do with them.

599
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,560
Tell her not to contact me anymore.

600
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,880
Yes, My Lady.

601
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,580
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

602
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,220
(Youban Pavilion)

603
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,920
Your Highness, what's bothering you?

604
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,280
Tell us about it

605
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,000
and we can share your burden.

606
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,200
I took a fancy

607
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,350
to my brother's bucket of pearls.

608
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,590
Usually, he gave me

609
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,920
whatever I wanted.

610
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,200
But today, he demanded
an exorbitant price.

611
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,200
He asked me for 100,000 taels.

612
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,280
A hundred thousand?

613
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,280
A hundred thousand?

614
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,960
That's too much.

615
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,270
And I actually know

616
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,960
the pearls aren't worth this much.

617
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,510
But they're really dazzling.

618
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,680
They're one of a kind.

619
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,070
So, I gather you here,

620
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,240
expecting you to think

621
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
how I can get the pearls

622
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,030
with the least money

623
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,070
or even with no money.

624
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,550
Your Highness, you can tell me

625
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,000
where the pearls are.

626
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,240
I will get them

627
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
for you,

628
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,590
unnoticed.

629
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,750
One of my followers

630
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,960
could steal something

631
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,030
from His Majesty.

632
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,160
Are you trying to get me killed?

633
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,270
I didn't mean that.

634
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,390
Your Highness,

635
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,480
as far as I know,

636
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,240
the tax revenue for this city

637
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,110
last year

638
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,350
was 100,000 taels.

639
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,400
So, I think

640
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,840
His Majesty wants

641
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,310
a good plan to enrich

642
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,150
our treasury.

643
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,910
In my opinion,

644
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,030
even if you gave away all your money

645
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,750
for the treasury,

646
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,720
it was only a temporary solution.

647
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,440
The permanent solution

648
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,830
is to increase taxes

649
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,510
or add surtaxes.

650
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,750
Our nation has been at war.

651
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Since the Baidi Valley battle,

652
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,680
people haven't restored their lives.

653
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,190
Increased taxes

654
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,680
will only make them wail.

655
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,680
Why would they complain

656
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,800
about doing their part?

657
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,920
Even you know

658
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,680
our treasury is strained.

659
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,750
How much money do commoners have?

660
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,830
Don't spend their money.

661
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,750
That's a lame idea.

662
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,550
Mr. Xue,

663
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,550
you sound so righteous.

664
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,350
Do you have any good ideas?

665
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,520
We use the much

666
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,920
to make up for the little.

667
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,350
Commoners are poor.

668
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,750
But in Huajing City,

669
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,550
many people live an extravagant life.

670
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,240
We can't force them,

671
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,350
but they can donate.

672
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,440
If we can get the nobles

673
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,310
in Huajing City

674
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,920
to donate to the treasury,

675
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,390
the problem

676
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,680
will be readily solved.

677
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,680
You're clever, Hanmei.

678
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,160
That's really hit

679
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,310
a chord with me.

680
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,920
You go back and think

681
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,830
of a logical way for me

682
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,240
get enough money

683
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,400
from the nobles.

684
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,560
Yes.

685
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
I'm thinking.

686
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,160
Jue cares so much about Lingmo.

687
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,680
How could she

688
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,790
say something so cruel?

689
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,720
Let's ignore if she's like that.

690
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,790
I'm worried...

691
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,270
I know your point.

692
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,280
Yao Yong must have

693
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,030
set his sights on Jue.

694
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,240
In that case,

695
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,070
we'll try another way

696
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,080
to search his house.

697
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,440
Lingmo,

698
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,400
wait for me.

699
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,790
You eat too slowly, Lingchun.

700
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,000
I won't wait for you.

701
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,850
I'm going to school.

702
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,720
- Lingmo.
- Slowly.

703
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,680
Don't run so fast again.

704
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,520
Understand?

705
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,550
It's you, Uncle and Auntie.

706
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,440
Auntie, are you getting better?

707
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,680
I wanted to see you,

708
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,200
but Auntie Chun stopped me.

709
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,750
What did you

710
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,590
want me for?

711
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,070
Can you give this painting

712
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,000
to my mother?

713
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,440
I miss her.

714
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,590
Lingmo,

715
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,830
if you miss your mother,

716
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,350
you can see her.

717
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,720
All you need to do...

718
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,870
What is it?

719
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,310
Tell me, Auntie.

720
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,270
All you need to do

721
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,880
is go to school

722
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,750
and get As in all subjects.

723
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,440
Then, I'll take you to see your mother.

724
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,040
That's easy. It's a deal, then.

725
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,160
Lingchun,

726
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,680
let's go to school.

727
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,510
Uncle, Auntie,

728
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,530
we're going to school.

729
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,410
- Alright.
- Go.

730
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,800
Be careful.

731
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,590
Oh, I see.

732
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,310
She must be concerned

733
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,150
about Lingmo.

734
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,350
So, she can't help us.

735
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,280
In that case,

736
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,920
we have to leave it at that.

737
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,560
That makes sense.

738
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,070
I'll ask Wei Qiu to watch on Yao Mansion

739
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,720
and protect Jue.

740
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,760
What's so funny?

741
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,880
You're tough but sweet.

742
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,740
Your Lordship, My Lady,

743
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,160
Mr. Gu is here.

744
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
Who's he asking for?

745
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,760
Me?

746
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,870
She won't see him.

747
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,950
That's right.

748
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,030
I won't see him.

749
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,360
Mr. Gu said

750
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,550
he knew you would say so.

751
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,190
So, he asked to see the two of you.

752
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,220
(True Might)

753
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,510
Mr. Gu, what do you want?

754
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,030
It's impolite of you

755
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,150
to come here alone

756
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,760
and see my sister-in-law.

757
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,710
And now you don't say anything.

758
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,440
What are you up to?

759
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,320
Your residence is so deserted.

760
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
So, wouldn't you even

761
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,150
serve some tea for your colleague?

762
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,950
Wanyue.

763
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,710
Some tea for our guest.

764
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,240
Yes.

765
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,440
Don't be reserved

766
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,760
in front of Wen Yun.

767
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,320
We keep no secrets.

768
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,510
Tell me

769
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,960
what you want.

770
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,440
So, he also knows

771
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,150
why you married his brother.

772
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,390
Like she said,

773
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,150
we keep no secrets.

774
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,880
What else concerns you now?

775
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,670
If you keep us guessing,

776
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,840
I don't think you need the tea.

777
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,510
Chu Yu,

778
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,280
may I speak in private?

779
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,400
What must you keep

780
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,240
from His Lordship?

781
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,030
The Lord of Qin's treason

782
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,670
is closely connected

783
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,670
to your investigation.

784
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,800
Now, may we speak in private?

785
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,840
The North Qi has a long plan.

786
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,360
During the Lord of Qin's treason,

787
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,670
they planned

788
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,360
to annex our nation.

789
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,760
The decline of our national power

790
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,840
is an indisputable fact.

791
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,920
For such a big plan,

792
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,760
there must be places

793
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,880
in Huajing City,

794
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,670
even the whole nation

795
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,510
where they meet.

796
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,400
In the Court of Judicial Review,

797
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,110
I've reviewed all the records

798
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,000
and found out these places.

799
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,510
Hope they'll be helpful.

800
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,910
Chu Yu,

801
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,510
I know you don't trust me.

802
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,320
If I hadn't retaken the exam,

803
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,960
I couldn't have joined

804
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,900
the Court of Judicial Review.

805
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,440
Nor could I

806
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,150
vindicate my family someday.

807
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,360
I know you hate

808
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,200
and detest me.

809
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,590
I shouldn't have come to you.

810
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
But I didn't expect this.

811
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,880
The Wei family, your family,

812
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,230
and even my family

813
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,480
are messed up together.

814
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,880
I got these files for you.

815
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,710
I can also help you figure out

816
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,960
how your father died.

817
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,440
Can you trust me once more?

818
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,440
Does an experienced scholar

819
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,550
always think a prodigal is precious?

820
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,160
But why do I feel

821
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,550
such a prodigal
should be kicked to the curb?

822
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,360
His repentance

823
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,760
is worthless.

824
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,640
Yu,

825
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,190
what I told you the other day

826
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,280
was true.

827
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,030
When I was exiled,

828
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,230
my mind was in turmoil.

829
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
So, I failed you.

830
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,030
Your hatred

831
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,800
is what I deserve.

832
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,760
If I could start over, I would...

833
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,230
Start over?

834
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,550
I've shown enough respect,

835
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,590
haven't I?

836
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,710
She's my sister-in-law.

837
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,420
What nonsense is that?

838
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,440
You managed to come in and see her

839
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,000
only because you're an official.

840
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,840
If you were just a commoner,

841
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,400
you would be lucky

842
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,710
if I didn't kick you out.

843
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,950
Enough.

844
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,120
Gu Chusheng,

845
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,800
I told you it was too late.

846
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,200
I did mean that.

847
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,640
And...

848
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,280
Wen Yun and I

849
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,120
have got some clues

850
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,510
about our case.

851
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,360
You have a point.

852
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
But I believe

853
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,440
I will regain

854
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,110
your trust.

855
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,150
Your master is right.

856
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,630
Someone like Gu Chusheng

857
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,550
should have been kicked out.

858
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,430
What?

859
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,000
You're finally admitting

860
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,840
he has a point.

861
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,030
You never played nice to him,

862
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,400
did you?

863
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,360
Today, your master

864
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,280
did reasonably well.

865
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,550
He sided with Her Ladyship.

866
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,670
So, I endorsed him.

867
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,840
My Lord,

868
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,000
did they give you a hard time?

869
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,550
He clearly has a motive towards her.

870
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,800
Just now,

871
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,480
weren't you being too impulsive?

872
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,070
I've always hated him.

873
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,070
Even if you're strangers now,

874
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,390
what he did you

875
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,400
will never be forgotten.

876
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,510
Just now, I should

877
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,400
have punched him.

878
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,840
If you did,

879
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,960
you'd lose your cool.

880
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,510
If I wanted revenge,

881
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,000
I can do a million things

882
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,000
to set him up.

883
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,110
But we don't have time for that.

884
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,620
(Qinxi Valley,
Bitao Villa, Wangyu Manor)

885
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,670
Qinxi Valley?

886
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,600
Exactly.

887
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,190
It's owned by the Eldest Princess.

888
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,000
Maybe we can start from there.

889
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,920
I trust you, Chu Yu.

890
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
You will find a way out.

891
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,710
Her Highness cares about this nation.

892
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,230
How would she allow anyone

893
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,230
to use her own place?

894
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,400
Can there be something fishy

895
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,760
about her followers?

896
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,030
What do you want?

897
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,030
What do I want?

898
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,550
You made a showy display

899
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,960
and none of us had a chance

900
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,550
to speak up.

901
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,550
I'll teach you a lesson.

902
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,800
A newcomer like you might not know.

903
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,440
These are not

904
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,800
ordinary plants.

905
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,510
They're different poisons.

906
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,110
Some can even kill you.

907
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,670
Don't try to scare me.

908
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,330
These are just

909
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
common weeds.

910
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,070
How can that be?

911
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,510
Don't worry too much.

912
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,440
You won't be tortured too long.

913
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,910
Within three days,

914
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,000
you'll fester and die.

915
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,510
It won't itch anymore.

916
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,640
I'm sorry.

917
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,720
I'm so sorry.

918
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,760
I'm new here

919
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,600
and I'm naughty.

920
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,920
I won't mess with you anymore.

921
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,200
Can I have the antidote?

922
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,200
I don't want to die.

923
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,400
Apology accepted.

924
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,110
You were right.

925
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,760
These are just ordinary plants.

926
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,110
Take a bath with some bath cream.

927
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,680
You won't die.

928
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,390
You...

929
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,840
How could he be

930
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,880
so malicious?

931
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,000
It itches. It really does.

932
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,200
Ms. Chu,

933
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,590
aren't you coming out

934
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,910
after seeing the fun?

935
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,320
How did you know I was here?

936
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,510
I thought I was hidden perfectly.

937
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,440
Not everyone could have found me.

938
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,710
I didn't know

939
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,760
you were so perceptive.

940
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,110
Oh, I see.

941
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,280
I was thoughtless.

942
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,150
But Mr. Xue,

943
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,710
how did you know it was me?

944
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,550
Few people in town

945
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,280
would dare to break

946
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,320
in here like this.

947
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,800
The intruder

948
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,510
sat there and watched for a while.

949
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,600
I thought about it.

950
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,000
No one but you

951
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,920
would do something

952
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,000
so sneaky.

953
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,030
I'll take that as a compliment.

954
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,760
You came here so late at night.

955
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,000
Is there an emergency?

956
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,880
Do I have to inform Her Highness?

957
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,840
I wouldn't have climbed the wall

958
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,880
to see Her Highness.

959
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,320
Isn't it inappropriate?

960
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,800
Why is it inappropriate?
