Now say it.

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,220
What "misunderstanding" is it?

24
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,920
Duke,

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,710
there's no need to rush.

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,750

27
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,910

28
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,360
The Wei clan has been nobles for a century,

29
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,710
quiet on the surface,

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
but they may

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,750
still have a lifeline.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
Now

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
only Wei Yun remains.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,000
If we want the Wei family gone,

35
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,400
we can't strike too hastily.

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,590
Otherwise, why would

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,590
His Majesty defend the Wei family,

38
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,630
yet keep you back alone afterward?

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Makes sense.

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Haven't you always wanted

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
to be Minister of Justice?

42
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,430
Now that the position is vacant,

43
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
I'll speak

44
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,710
to His Majesty in a few days

45
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,710
so you can get some "experience" there.

46
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,030
Thank you, Duke.

47
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,310
Chusheng,

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
is your throat alright?

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Your hand

50
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
burned?

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
It's nothing.

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
But since I'll soon

53
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,120
be reassigned elsewhere,

54
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,310
I need to finish

55
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,190
the Hanlin Academy drafts.

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,030
Rest early.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,160

(A woman's knees hold gold.)

59
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,390
(You must not kneel lightly.)

60
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,720
(You knelt once for your father and brother.)

61
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,360
(Yet today you knelt outside the palace)

63
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,950
(unrelated to you.)

64
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,030
No.

65
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
The Wei family isn't safe.

66
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,600
It's a thorn in Duke of Ning's

67
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,480
eye.

68
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,630
I can't let her stay there.

69
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,110
Father,

70
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,230
look at my painting! How is it?

73
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,910
How is it, Father?

74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
No, no.

75
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Yun's grown now.

76
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,840
- You rascal!
- Father!

77
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,040

Jun,

79
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,480
you're the Young General Wei,

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,830
so you should be both warrior and scholar.

81
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,750
But should I be that too?

82
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,700

break the block in his heart.

Yun.

194
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,350
Yun. Yun.

195
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,040
Yun.

196
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,870
Jut is only twenty-four.

197
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,000
She has to think about her future.

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,240
Living her whole life

199
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,700
in the Wei Mansion is frightening.

200
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,870
She isn't heartless.

201
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,000
Women have it hard

202
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,390
in this world.

203
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,510
Give her the divorce paper for me.

204
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,390
Let her go.

205
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
Jiu had it hard enough in the Xie family.

206
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,840
After marrying me,

207
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,790
she lived in worries.

208
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,340
I don't want her to spend her life as a widow.

209
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,910
Uncle Yun!

210
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,750
Uncle Yun!

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,870
Uncle Yun!

212
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,150
When will you come out?

213
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,030
Mother and aunts

214
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,790
are waiting for you outside.

215
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,390
Uncle Yun,

216
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,630
please come out,

217
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,390
everyone's worried.

218
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,120
I got it.

219
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,590
Wei Yun,

220
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,600
your life used to be calm

221
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,360
because your father and brothers

222
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,200
shielded you.

223
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,560
Now you are

224
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,390
the Wei family's only backbone.

225
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,320
You must hold up

226
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,240
the sky for them

227
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,910
and protect everyone under this roof.

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,870
The Wei house

229
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,240
needs you to restore its honor.

230
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,790
Besides, you must investigate

231
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,910
what really happened

232
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,750
at Baidi Valley

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,870
and root out the truth.

234
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,390
If we can't slay

235
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,230
those North Qi soldiers,

236
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,030
how can we answer

237
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,960
the seventy thousand fallen?

238
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,750
Don't let them rest in vain.

239
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
I dreamed my brothers told me

240
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,360
not to trap you

241
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,150
in the Wei household.

242
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,000
I agree as well.

243
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,380
(Divorce Paper)

244
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,260
(Defend the nation and the throne)
Today,

245
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,270
I gave you divorce papers

246
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200
on my brothers' behalf,

247
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,030
but you will always be my family.

248
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,360
Although you have the papers now,

249
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,550
packing

250
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,390
takes time.

251
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,360
Don't rush.

252
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
If you do not wish to leave,

253
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,080
the Wei family won't drive you away.

254
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,960
If you ever want to return,

255
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,480
our gates

256
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
remain open.

257
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,590
Yun,

258
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,870
Yu,

259
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,080
thank you.

260
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,960
I planned

261
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,240
to wait until things were certain,

262
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,910
but seeing the situation now,

263
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,870
I decided to tell you now.

264
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,070
My brother works in the Ministry of Personnel,

265
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,390
he sent word yesterday

266
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,080
that the court is preparing to confer

267
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,480
the Marquis of Zhenguo title on Yun.

268
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,110
After all we suffered,

269
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,680
at least there's good news.

270
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,110
Yes, from

271
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,370
extreme hardship comes relief.

272
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,480
Congratulations to you, Yun.

273
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,350
Congrats.

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,840
This is

275
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,400
a major event for the Wei household.

276
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,640
Why not

277
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,310
stay until

278
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,310
the enfeoffment banquet?

279
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,750
We can

280
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,790
stay with the children

281
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,630
a few more days

282
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,910
and

283
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,000
help make a showing

284
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,880
for Yun's new rank.

285
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,950
What do you say?

286
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,310
This is a good idea.

287
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,480
The Wei family

288
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,480
is not what it used to be.

289
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
The banquet

290
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,590
will show

291
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,790
who truly

292
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,880
stands with us

293
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
and give you a proper send-off.

294
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,430
It's good.

295
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,590
Our Wei family

296
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,000
needs such an occasion.

297
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,790
Yes, let's go.

298
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,000
Let's go get ready.

299
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,540
(Divorce Paper)

300
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,930
(Divorce Paper)

301
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,800
What is this?

302
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,720
You're still young,

303
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,110
remarrying

304
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,950
wouldn't be hard.

305
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,070
You and my brother

306
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,910
barely knew each other.

307
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,240
You were not deep in love.

308
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,070
If you take this divorce paper today,

309
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,310
I'll assume you stayed

310
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,200
only out of righteousness.

311
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,720
I won't

312
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
probe further.

313
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,070
When I inherit the title,

314
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,310
I'll speak well of Young General Chu.

315
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,510
The Wei family will remember your kindness.

316
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,880
Have you forgotten

317
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,720
our agreement?

318
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,790
If I rescue you,

319
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,240
you can't drive me away.

320
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,320
Otherwise

321
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,270
if I can save you,

322
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,160
I can send you back too.

323
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,830
I didn't know

324
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,960
you had such skills.

325
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,980
(Divorce Paper)

326
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,750
I've always been unruly

327
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
and unorthodox.

328
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,070
If you don't believe that,

329
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,390
test me.

330
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,340
(Defend the nation and the throne)

331
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,560
My Lord,

332
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,240
you still don't trust Lady Chu?

333
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,070
She's done so much for the Wei family.

334
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,790
I feel indebted to her.

335
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,110
I once urged her

336
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,270
not to bind herself here.

337
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,070
But which sister

338
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,640
does not love

339
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,000
this family?

340
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,000
They too might leave.

341
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,110
I tried to bribe her,

342
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,510
but she insisted on staying.

343
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,720
How can I trust her?

344
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,350
She tries so hard

345
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,350
to stay in the Wei family.

346
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,400
She must have her motives.

347
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,350
If so,

348
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,350
just

349
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,510
throw her out.

350
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,830
Even without proof,

351
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,000
what can she do?

352
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,910
Wei Qiu,

353
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,480
if a tiger always

354
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,510
covets your flesh,

355
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,880
do you keep it nearby

356
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,960
and lock it up,

357
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,750
or do you

358
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,030
drive it away,

359
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,790
constantly scared?

360
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,030
You mean it's safer

361
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,310
to keep Lady Chu

362
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,640
in the open

363
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,440
and watch her.

364
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,550
So your promise

365
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,480
in jail

366
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
was also for this?

367
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,350
If she's treacherous,

368
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,070
if we do nothing,

369
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,240
she'll show her hand.

370
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,160
You'll have people watch her

371
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,440
and report whom she meets

372
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,350
and what she does

373
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,480
every day.

374
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:36,020
(Wei)

375
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,660
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

376
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
Chu Yu! get out here at once!

377
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,950
Chu Yu!

378
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,530
You're making a scene at the Wei gate.

379
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,490
What sort of behavior is this?

380
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,310
Chu Yu,

381
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,260
marrying into the Wei family

382
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,110
is one thing,

383
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,550
but why must you drag our brother

384
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,540
and the entire Chu family down?

385
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,640
Drag him down?

386
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,840
Speak clearly.

387
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,960
Don't play dumb.

388
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,400
Do you not know that today

389
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,160
Gu Chusheng impeached him in court

390
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,590
for "overly close ties" with the Wei family,

391
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,960
asking for his removal?

392
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,830
Gu Chusheng impeached Linyang

393
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,030
asking for his removal?

394
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,790
Has he gone mad?

395
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,640
If you hadn't married into the Wei family

396
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,750
and made that petty man jealous,

397
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,110
why would he kick us

398
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,110
when the Chu family

399
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,030
is already struggling?

400
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,880
He's always been petty.

401
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,920
But how did you hear of this?

402
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,840
Speak up.

403
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,590
Why did you ask me here?

404
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,790
We're hardly friends.

405
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,400
The whole capital says

406
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,880
Chu Yu is fickle

407
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,270
and faithless.

408
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,030
I only want to know

409
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,640
whether she truly

410
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,590
loves Wei Jun.

411
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,640
With her nature,

412
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,070
it's not strange for her

413
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,240
to suddenly fancy someone.

414
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
You care this much,

415
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,550
don't tell me

416
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,880
you still have feelings for her.

417
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,880
Do you really think you're a phoenix

418
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,270
just because you climbed high?

419
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,270
You think our Chu family

420
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,400
needs your trifling gifts?

421
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,160
Lady Jin,

422
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,720
think nothing of it,

423
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,680
just a token.

424
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,440
But His Majesty

425
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,920
already dislikes the power

426
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,270
of military families.

427
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,200
Chu Yu insisted on marrying the Wei clan,

428
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,040
such alliances

429
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,310
will only make His Majesty wary.

430
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,960
The title of "First Madam" seems grand,

431
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,010
but it will make

432
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,440
life difficult for the Chu family.

433
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,800
Lady Jin,

434
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,640
persuade your brother to ally

435
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,480
with the Duke of Ning's family.

436
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,820
Civil and military united,

437
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,640
only then can great things be achieved.

438
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,110
Don't you dare use my brother

439
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,950
to threaten me.

440
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,400
Since you're so desperate to pry

441
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,590
information out of me,

442
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
I'll tell you:

443
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,310
Chu Yu and Wei Jun

444
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,270
met only a few times.

445
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,440
Talk of true love is nonsense.

446
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,350
Chasing you to the southwest

447
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,960
showed more devotion.

448
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,160
Since I've spoken

449
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,000
this much,

450
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,310
I'll accept

451
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,240
your little gift.

452
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,400
He must think

453
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,350
the Chu family is weak

454
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,030
and wants to stir trouble,

455
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,680
tricking you into speaking.

456
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,240
I...

457
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,920
So what even if I said it?

458
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,550
I didn't expect him

459
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,790
to target our brother.

460
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,270
If not for you,

461
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,200
he wouldn't be scheming

462
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,040
like this,

463
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,270
our brother wouldn't be facing this.

464
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,880
You caused the trouble.

465
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,110
Why blame me?

466
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
You truly hate me this much?

467
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,350
The Chu family suffers,

468
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,200
yet you live comfortably.

469
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,590
If you don't fix this,

470
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,510
I'll expose your intentions

471
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,590
to the entire

472
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,510
Huajing City.

473
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,750
I'll make Wei Yun

474
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,750
drive you out

475
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,200
and leave you

476
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,070
homeless.

477
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,830
What, you'll hit me here too?

478
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,880
I won't hit you now

479
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,200
or ever.

480
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,240
Go back.

481
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,640
I'll handle this.

482
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,960
I promise you,

483
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,350
this

484
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,590
won't harm you in the slightest.

485
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,880
You'd better keep your word.

486
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,240
She made a mistake,

487
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,310
but why does she put

488
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,270
all the blame on you?

489
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,560
My Lady,

490
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,160
why don't you teach her a lesson?

491
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,880
What did she do wrong?

492
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,590
Whatever.

493
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,640
Linyang's trouble matters most.

494
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,200
Gu Chusheng,

495
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,960
if you act without mercy,

496
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,720
don't blame me for answering in kind.

497
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,640
If he hates peace so much,

498
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,640
I'll give him

499
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,960
chaos.

500
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,080
Yu.

501
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,510
It's just family matters.

502
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,830
Don't worry.

503
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,240
I can deal with it.

504
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,440
If there's anything we can help with,

505
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,960
just tell us.

506
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
Family matters?

507
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,480
I doubt it.

508
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,720
Your marriage to the Wei clan

509
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,160
already counts

510
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,000
as an alliance.

511
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,440
My investiture is soon.

512
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,050
How could the officials

513
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,590
miss such a chance?

514
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,880
It may seem aimed at your brother,

515
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,440
but its true target is the Chu

516
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,110
and Wei families together.

517
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,060
So you were eavesdropping.

518
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,390
(Divorce Paper)
If you want a clean solution,

519
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,180
take the divorce paper.

520
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,300
If you return to the Chu family,

521
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,700
Gu Chusheng will naturally

522
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,620
drop the impeachment.

523
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,020
Yes, Yu.

524
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,500
Yun's right.

525
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,380
Even if you take the paper,

526
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,940
you're still family to us.

527
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,060
Yu,

528
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,060
if you've dragged the Chu family down,

529
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,540
how

530
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,500
will you face your mother?

531
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,620
Yes, Yu.

532
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,780
You've done so much for both Jun

533
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,620
and the Wei family.

534
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,020
Think for yourself this time.

535
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,780
Yun,

536
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,260
help think

537
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,860
of another way.

538
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,620
I appreciate your goodwill.

539
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,140
I'll thank you

540
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,580
after it's settled.

541
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,220
As you wish.

542
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,990
(Divorce Paper)
I'll take it.

543
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,020
Wei Qiu,

544
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,100
follow her these days.

545
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,180
Who knows what trouble she'll stir up next.

546
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,380
Yes.

547
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,460
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

548
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,300
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)
Absurd!

549
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,780
Only in the Duke of Ning's Mansion

550
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,460
can one taste such good tea.

551
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,020
Truly excellent.

552
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,620
Guards!

553
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,020
Drag her out!

554
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,780
Lady Wang, calm down.

555
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,820
Perhaps you two

556
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,260
don't know yet: Gu Chusheng

557
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,660
impeached my brother.

558
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,340
You know my history

559
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,500
with him.

560
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,860
He impeached my brother

561
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,060
to force me out of the Wei family

562
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,340
so he could reconcile with me.

563
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,060
Now that I've taken the divorce paper,

564
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,340
if my brother loses his post,

565
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,740
I'll have no choice

566
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,660
but to be with Gu Chusheng.

567
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,620
Delusion!

568
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,900
I am his lawful wife.

569
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,740
So what?

570
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,980
If you

571
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,940
don't help my brother,

572
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,860
then even as a concubine,

573
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,020
I'll marry into your manor.

574
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,340
Even being his mistress, why not?

575
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,180
As they say,

576
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,730
wildflowers smell sweeter than home ones.

577
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,220
How shameless

578
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,740
can a woman be!

579
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,180
Chusheng.

580
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,380
Chusheng.

581
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,860
Chusheng.

582
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,060
You're finally back.

583
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,300
I know you still care for me.

584
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
Those years

585
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,780
under the moon, our vows

586
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,700
to be true forever,

587
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,060
never part.

588
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,460
Do you remember?

589
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,780
Yu.

590
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,260
What did you call her?

591
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,580
Chusheng,

592
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,060
I know

593
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,340
our love isn't

594
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,540
accepted by the world.

595
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,340
For you,

596
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,700
I will never yield.

597
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,340
Even heaven and earth may end,

598
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,340
this love never will.

599
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,220
Chu Yu,

600
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,460
he's my husband.

601
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,380
I already have the divorce paper.

602
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,500
What about you?

603
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,860
When will you divorce?

604
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,140
Why didn't you reject her?

605
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,660
Chusheng,

606
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,740
did you impeach Chu Linyang

607
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,820
because you wanted

608
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,860
to be with her?

609
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,540
Say something.

610
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,740
Speak!

611
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,060
Let me explain.

612
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,220
Chusheng.

613
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,060
Enough!

614
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,860
My Duke of Ning's manor

615
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,740
has never produced

616
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,140
such disgraceful conduct!

617
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,540
You...

618
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,540
Father!

619
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,840
- Gu Chusheng!
- My Lord.

620
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,460
Throw that wretch out!

621
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,900
Have some tea, calm yourself.

622
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,340
(Divorce Paper)

623
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,780
Chusheng,

624
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,980
I've fulfilled your wish.

625
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,620
I'll

626
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,180
wait for your good news.

627
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,540
Are you feeling better?

628
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,380
Lady Yu.

629
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,340
How coincidental.

630
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,180
Indeed.

631
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,500
Did Wei Yun send you?

632
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,860
No.

633
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,100
It's Lord Yun.

634
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,540
No, no,

635
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,380
not him.

636
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,380
I...

637
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,540
I thought Lord Yun

638
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,780
might worry about you.

639
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,420
So I came.

640
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,860
Yes.

641
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,780
Do you even know what you're saying?

642
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,500
I don't know

643
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,340
what I'm saying.

644
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,100
You're not good at lying.

645
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,260
He just doesn't believe

646
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,060
I'll leave after taking the divorce paper,

647
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,540
so he sent you to watch me.

648
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,140
Where is he?

649
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,020
This concerns the Wei family.

650
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,420
I'm fighting on the front lines.

651
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,780
Where has he slipped off to?

652
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,460
Lord Yun went

653
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,660
to meet with Lu Qiba today.

654
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,620
He's hard to arrange.

655
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,940
Lu Qiba?

656
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,020
The one at the Arsenal Bureau

657
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,140
who made the octagonal crossbow?

658
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,460
Yes.

659
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,100
Look what you've done!

660
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,420
You'd better tell the truth.

661
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,660
Why did you impeach Chu Linyang?

662
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,060
Duke, don't believe

663
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,300
Chu Yu's nonsense.

664
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,180
I impeached him

665
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,060
to keep Wei Yun from

666
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,900
inheriting too easily,

667
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,860
to check the military's growing power.

668
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,020
Chu Yu caused a scene

669
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,420
only to protect

670
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,780
her brother's post.

671
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,980
Whatever your motive,

672
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,460
tomorrow you will report

673
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,860
to His Majesty

674
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,020
and withdraw the impeachment.

675
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,180
Chu Yu must

676
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,020
remain

677
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,460
the Wei family's First Madam.

678
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,380
Today's scandal must never repeat.

679
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,940
My Duke of Ning's Mansion

680
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,980
cannot afford such shame.

681
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,900
Yes.

682
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,540
I understand.

683
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,540
Good move,

684
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,460
Chu Yu.

685
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,940
(Fragrance House)

686
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,900
So it's agreed.

687
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,020
Don't forget.

688
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,860
Remember.

689
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,380
Isn't that Wei Yun?

690
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,060
The Wei family is in chaos,

691
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,300
yet he still comes to a place like this.

692
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,220
Seems

693
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,620
the rumors are true.

694
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,980
He's just a naive boy who respects

695
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,900
father and brothers.

696
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,140
The glory of the Marquis's manor

697
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,620
ends here.

698
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,980
Sir, I haven't seen you before.

699
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,740
Which girl are you

700
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,580
looking for?

701
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,500
A man.

702
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,340
A man?

703
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,180
Lu Qiba.

704
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,540
Do you know him?

705
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,180
Oh! You're looking for Master Lu.

706
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,500
No problem.

707
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,260
Let go of that lady!

708
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,140
(Lu Qiba,
Deputy Commander of the Arsenal Bureau)

709
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,100
Didn't mean to scare you.

710
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,060
What's in that thing?

711
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,180
Aphrodisiacs.

712
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,140
What?

713
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,940
Kidding.

714
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,660
This is a secret tool

715
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,620
for dealing with brutes like you.

716
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,900
After all,

717
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,020
protecting every young lady

718
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,860
is my sacred duty.

719
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,620
Ladies,

720
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,580
shout my name!

721
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,060
Lu Qiba!

722
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,540
Lu Qiba!

723
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,260
Lu Qiba!

724
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,060
I am the man

725
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,980
everyone adores,

726
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,260
handsome, clever,

727
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,300
the best weapons master of Great Sui:

728
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,340
Lu Qiba.

729
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
Young people are

730
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,980
so impatient nowadays.

731
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,420
I don't have time to fool around with you.

732
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
Find a quiet place.

733
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,620
We have serious business.

734
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,460
Of course.

735
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,460
Madam Zhang,

736
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,780
open my private room.

737
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,780
Got it.

738
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Put it on his tab.

739
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,820
So you and Lu Qiba

740
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,820
are old acquaintances?

741
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,980
What's he like?

742
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,460
Does he come here often?

743
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,060
He's a regular.

744
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,820
But we won't casually

745
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,780
sell others' information.

746
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,740
You'll

747
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,980
have to check yourself.

748
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,900
Surely you've heard

749
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,660
of my charm.

750
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,900
Being too handsome

751
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,020
is a burden.

752
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,100
Of course, Wei,

753
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,540
this is something

754
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,420
you wouldn't understand.

755
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,740
You must be General Wei, right?

756
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,500
Truly a young general,

757
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,420
upright,

758
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,820
imposing.

759
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,100
I thought General Wei Jun

760
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,180
was unmatched,

761
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,740
but it seems

762
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,820
you

763
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,900
surpasses him.

764
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,140
Why are your eyes

765
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,300
so red?

766
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,900
Shall I blow

767
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,260
on them for you?

768
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,140
You must be blind.

769
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,780
I'm sure of it.

770
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,820
I have important business with Master Lu.

771
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,620
Please leave us for now.

772
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,820
If I offended you,

773
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,860
forgive me.

774
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,500
What a gentleman.

775
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,980
When you're done,

776
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,420
we sisters

777
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,460
will be waiting for you.

778
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,300
We'll be waiting.

779
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,500
- Let's go.
- Go.

780
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,460
So shy.

781
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,980
Haven't seen someone

782
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,500
this serious in a long time.

783
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,380
Fine.

784
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,620
You're just like Wei Jun,

785
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,380
boring.

786
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,140
You actually use your weapons

787
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,100
in a place like this?

788
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,940
Why not?

789
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,060
Is the Bureau

790
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,300
only for war?

791
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,480
- But...
- Fighting

792
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,420
is for peace and protecting

793
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,380
the people.

794
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,060
The tools I develop now

795
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,820
also protect them.

796
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
What's the difference?

797
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,500
Didn't Wei Jun

798
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,780
tell you that?

799
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,460
Seems you're far

800
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,820
behind your brother.

801
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,220
He may be rigid,

802
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,660
but not as tense as you.

803
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,660
Also,

804
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,340
he's much more generous.

805
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,820
Whenever he came here,

806
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,740
he paid first.

807
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,820
You should be grateful

808
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,940
I let you pay today.

809
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,660
Stop putting on that sour face.

810
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,180
Since you're close

811
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,020
with my brother,

812
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,020
and you understand Great Sui weapons best,

813
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,380
I'll be direct.

814
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,460
The core trigger technique

815
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,620
of the octagonal crossbow

816
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,700
may have leaked to North Qi.

817
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,940
They've built some

818
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,020
identical to ours.

819
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,620
Impossible.

820
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,780
Only Wei Jun

821
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,620
and I know

822
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,460
the core.

823
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,060
The crossbow appeared only once

824
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,180
in a military drill.

825
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Only a few

826
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,940
top officers

827
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,220
knew.

828
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,220
And the blueprint

829
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,540
never left the Arsenal Bureau.

830
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,020
How could it leak?

831
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,260
Ask yourself, Master Lu.

832
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,540
The recoil is too strong.

833
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,820
Ordinary soldiers can't use it.

834
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,980
Ten parts of force and

835
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,060
you take three parts injury.

836
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,260
That is the octagonal crossbow.

837
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,780
I saw it on the battlefield myself.

838
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,140
This is my design.

839
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,220
And yes,

840
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,060
it wasn't adopted

841
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,060
because of that recoil.

842
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,700
Wait, you...

843
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,340
You're not

844
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,340
suspecting me, are you?

845
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,860
Until it's investigated,

846
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,740
everyone in the Arsenal Bureau

847
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,580
is a suspect.

848
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,620
I'll take this back and examine it.

849
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,860
Prove to me

850
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,820
you're clean.

851
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,340
If you didn't trust me,

852
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,100
why walk into my trap today?

853
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,020
When will you have results?

854
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,700
That depends on you.

855
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,380
When you can catch up to your brother.

856
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,900
Sir.

857
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,140
- Sit down.
- Lord Yun.

858
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,780
- Enjoy.
- That's right.

859
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,940
- Sit down.
- Yes.

860
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,340
Master Lu,

861
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,820
why so rushed?

862
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,260
I prepared fine wine

863
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,100
to treat you.

864
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,300
Stay and taste it.

865
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,980
Come on, try it.

866
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,820
There's actually

867
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,060
such a beauty in Fragrance House.

868
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,460
No need, no need.

869
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,300
Master Lu, sit.

870
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,660
Drink.

871
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:33,850
No. No.

872
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,980
Comfortable?

873
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,460
Is my strength just right?

874
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,620
Come, let me wipe that.

875
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,460
No need.

876
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,540
Ladies,

877
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,460
forgive me today,

878
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,460
this young man is mine now.

879
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,820
Goodbye. Goodbye.

880
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,660
Thanks.

881
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,020
Thank you.

882
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,740
