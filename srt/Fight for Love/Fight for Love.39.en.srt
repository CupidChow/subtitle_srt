Wei Yun,

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,110
how dare you

23
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,320
enter Qizhou alone!

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
I've said it.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,240
You're just like Su Can.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,620
Killing you would be easy as well.

27
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,520
I came

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,560
to take your head.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,040
Imperial guards, listen:

30
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,630
tonight,

31
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
anyone who kills Wei Yun

32
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,820
will be rewarded 10,000 taels of gold.

33
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,070
Yes!

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680

(Queen Mother's Order)

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,140
By the Queen Mother's order,

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,790
with this token, Gongsun Lan,

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,150
City Lord of Yun,

39
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,150
may enter the Palace at any time
to protect her.

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,750
Open the gates.

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,750
This token represents

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,440
the Queen Mother.

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
Open the gates now.

44
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,040
Open the palace gates.

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,880
Yes.

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,880
Once I lure Zhao Yue away,

47
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,790
you can enter the Palace.

48
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,070
Stop.

49
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,070
Stop fighting.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Stop.

51
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,190
With the token here,

52
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,520
don't you dare act rashly.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,100
The Queen Mother orders

54
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,440
that the Yun troops escort
the Great Sui delegation

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,380
out of the Palace.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,500
Anyone who dares to stop us

57
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,190
(Queen Mother's Order)
will be executed.

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,630
Any objections?

59
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,840
The Yun troops will escort you

60
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,780
back to the posthouse.

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,280
Go now.

62
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,910
Where is Wei Yun?

63
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,190
Young Marquis Wei

64
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,540
lured Zhao Yue out of the Palace.

65
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,320
He'll manage to escape.

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
He's instructed

67
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,880
that you wait for him at the posthouse.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,880
What about you?

69
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,640
Yes.

70
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,480
Breaking into the Palace
with so many people

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,260
is no small crime.

72
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,880
You're worried about me?

73
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,910
Rest assured.

74
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,880
I'll petition the Queen Mother tomorrow.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,790
After today, the Queen Mother

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,280
and the King are on the brink of battle.

77
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,550
She will trust me.

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,110
Yun troops, listen:

79
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,210
Escort the Great Sui delegation

80
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,500
back to the posthouse.

81
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Yes.

82
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,940
(Qiyang Silk and Satin)

83
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,390
Close the gates.

84
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,840
All the Yun troops are waiting here.

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,570
At your command,

86
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,860
they will clear the way for you.

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,240
You're hiding?

88
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,110
In Qizhou,

89
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,430
where can you hide from me?

90
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,680
Everyone,

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,990
surround the entire street.

92
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,230
Not a single rat may escape.

93
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,270
Yes.

94
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,830
Open the gates!

95
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
Wei Yun,

96
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,210
if you do not show yourself,

97
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,720
I will burn

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
the entire street.

99
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,790
I want to see

100
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,670
if you can escape

101
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,400
a sea of fire.

102
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,980
Come out.

103
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,640
My people

104
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,600
should willingly make sacrifices for me.

105
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,960
You should be grateful

106
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,020
that the God of War from Great Sui
will die with you.

107
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,150
Light the fire.

108
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,510
Your Majesty!

109
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,630
Your Majesty!

110
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,760
Instead of staying with Changming,

111
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,640
why are you here?

112
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,520
Your Majesty,

113
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,200
she suddenly has severe abdominal pain.

114
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,380
The situation is critical.

115
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
I'm afraid...

116
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,510
I'm afraid...

117
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,040
Return immediately.

118
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,820
(Yifen Hall)

119
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,230
What should we do?

120
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,040
What to do?

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,040
If blame falls on us,

122
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,110
what will happen to us?

123
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,350
If the King blames us...

124
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,780
- Your Majesty.
- What happened?

125
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,910
Your Majesty,

126
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,230
the Consort of Mei took a tonic

127
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,720
that contained oleander,

128
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,870
so she

129
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,080
lost the child.

130
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,430
Why would there be oleander?

131
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,790
She took the tonic

132
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,470
sent by Noble Consort Chen.

133
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,040
Fortunately,

134
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,350
her life is not in danger.

135
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,830
Everyone, get out.

136
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

137
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
Changming,

138
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,720
it's my fault.

139
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,470
I failed to protect our child.

140
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,600
Rest assured.

141
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,870
We will have another child.

142
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,760
You know my health the best.

143
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,910
It was hard for me

144
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,280
to conceive.

145
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,670
I'll never have

146
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,720
a second child in my life.

147
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,070
No.

148
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,600
I'll find the best physicians
in North Qi

149
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,910
and ensure you have a second child.

150
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,550
Noble Consort Chen told me this morning

151
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,960
that she has long received your favor.

152
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,520
She will have

153
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,710
your child sooner or later.

154
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,550
Why care about mine?

155
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,160
You lied to me.

156
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,000
Zhao Yue,

157
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
how many things are you hiding

158
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,240
from me?

159
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,200
Changming,

160
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,310
I had no choice.

161
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,150
No choice?

162
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,880
You had no choice but to marry her

163
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,590
and sleep with her.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,190
Now, she killed my child,

165
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,790
but you can do nothing,

166
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,190
because you have no choice.

167
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,630
Zhao Yue,

168
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,830
you are a coward.

169
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,640
You keep saying

170
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,550
you'll make me the Queen

171
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,550
and my child the Crown Prince,

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,640
yet you have achieved none of it.

173
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,910
You've been under Yunyang's control.

174
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,240
Without her,

175
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,160
you are nothing.

176
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,480
With a father like you,

177
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,830
even if this child were born,

178
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,880
he would not live long,

179
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,950
because you cannot protect him at all.

180
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,590
The moment he was born,

181
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,950
he would face the Queen Mother

182
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,120
and every threat

183
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,240
in the Palace.

184
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,880
He would be surrounded by enemies.

185
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,270
Zhao Yue,

186
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,040
he'd become another you.

187
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,910
The Queen Mother was right.

188
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,550
He was baseborn.

189
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,760
Someone has killed your child.

190
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,550
You cannot protect me.

191
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,240
You cannot protect us.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,280
Our child

193
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
has died for no reason.

194
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,120
No.

195
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,790
I said I would protect you,

196
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,550
so I will.

197
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,430
Guards,

198
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,400
deliver my decree.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,710
The daughter of the City Lord of Xuan

200
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,190
killed a royal child.

201
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,290
The crime is unforgivable.

202
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,890
Her entire clan shall be exterminated.

203
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,960
Yes.

204
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,690
I will go and kill Noble Consort Chen

205
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,430
to avenge our child.

206
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,670
I said it before.

207
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,000
In any battle I fight,

208
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,550
I have never lost.

209
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,000
The weather is dry.

210
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,820
(Qizhou Posthouse)
Be careful with fire.

211
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,360
Hurry and help me with this.

212
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,510
Come on.

213
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,270
Gently, gently.

214
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,200
What is this?

215
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,240
Yu,

216
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,670
stop worrying.

217
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,950
Yun is amazing.

218
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,790
He will be fine.

219
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,910
Exactly.

220
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,790
Wei Yun is the God of War.

221
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,670
Zhao Yue can do nothing

222
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,760
to him.

223
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,910
Right.

224
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,200
No, I need to find him.

225
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,310
- Yu.
- Wait.

226
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,310
- Yu.
- Wait.

227
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,670
Yu, wait.

228
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,760
Why stop me?

229
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,640
Don't stop me.

230
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,670
Yun instructed us.

231
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,400
We can't let you leave now.

232
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,240
- If he returns...
- And you're not here...

233
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
What should we do?

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,840
Then...

235
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,150
Yu.

236
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,120
I'm back.

237
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,160
- You're back.
- You're back.

238
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,030
What's wrong?

239
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,240
Are you alright?

240
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,510
Don't worry.

241
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,790
With Gongsun Lan supporting me,

242
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,080
nothing will happen.

243
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,710
Who could be so cruel

244
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,560
as to kill the Eldest Princess's child?

245
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,950
I fear a change is coming

246
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,070
to the North Qi royals.

247
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,040
It already has.

248
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,710
I just returned from the Palace.

249
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,310
Zhao Yue has executed
Noble Consort Chen.

250
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,750
Soon,

251
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,430
her entire clan

252
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,280
will be put to death.

253
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,760
The Eldest Princess said
she wouldn't leave

254
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,950
and would find a way to help us.

255
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,360
I never expected this

256
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,880
to be her method.

257
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,600
What she has done

258
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,200
is for the delegation

259
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
and Great Sui.

260
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,520
We will never let her efforts
go to waste.

261
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,400
Zhao Yue intends to bring chaos

262
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,310
to the world.

263
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,910
Only by killing him

264
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,210
can we save the Eldest Princess.

265
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,480
To overthrow Zhao Yue,

266
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,120
we need other City Lords' support.

267
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,580
Gongsun Lan and I will rescue

268
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,040
the City Lord of Xuan.

269
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,750
The one who hates Zhao Yue most

270
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,520
should be him now.

271
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,120
Spread what happened tonight.

272
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,340
We can use

273
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,710
Mr. Gongsun's intelligence network

274
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,830
to tell other City Lords

275
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,190
that Zhao Yue intends to start a war
with Great Sui.

276
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,200
With the people's resentment
against him,

277
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,400
we can gather all forces

278
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,860
and make the City Lords rebel.

279
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,790
This is the game changer.

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,480
This may be our last chance.

281
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,360
The Sixteen Cities lie north of Qizhou.

282
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,240
If the City Lords march toward Qizhou,

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,670
Zhao Yue will surely flee south.

284
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,560
Shilan and I have arranged

285
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,200
for him to station troops at the border

286
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,360
as reinforcements.

287
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,840
Tonight, Zhao Yue decided

288
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,530
to exterminate
Noble Consort Chen's clan.

289
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,530
It will only strengthen

290
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,380
our cause

291
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,280
and accelerate his loss of support.

292
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,520
I'm good

293
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,510
at spreading news.

294
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,760
Leave it to me.

295
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,270
Good.

296
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,130
Where is the Fragrance House in Qizhou?

297
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,710
I'm also good

298
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,550
at spreading news.

299
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,590
What's wrong?

300
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,070
I'm serious.

301
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,340
Are you worrying
about the Eldest Princess?

302
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,590
She's so proud.

303
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,400
For Great Sui,

304
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,520
she has given so much.

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,350
With both nations in turmoil,

306
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,140
someone must shoulder these things,

307
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,830
or our descendants

308
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,070
will shed even more blood.

309
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,550
If we do not want them to bear this,

310
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,720
then we

311
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,680
must pave the path

312
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
to peace first.

313
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,360
Yes.

314
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,150
As long as the path is lit,

315
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,830
we can still follow the light

316
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,520
amid misleading affairs.

317
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,790
The path to peace

318
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,280
is also for ourselves.

319
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,790
We'll return to Huajing safely together.

320
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,280
Though you're young,

321
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
you can bear national burdens.

322
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,480
Since I can bear the burden

323
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,400
for Great Sui,

324
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,520
I can also bear the burden for us.

325
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,520
After tomorrow,

326
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,070
we'll get the outcome.

327
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,420
(Sui)

328
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,480
Commander Lu asked me

329
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,320
to send these.

330
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,040
He said

331
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,200
they could help you recover.

332
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,110
Do not stop.

333
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,950
Keep training.

334
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,960
Commander Lu said

335
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,170
this is used to stabilize

336
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,540
the bones in your leg.

337
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
He said sitting for too long

338
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,110
may cause the bones to shift.

339
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,480
What are these?

340
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,240
Well.

341
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
I do not know, either.

342
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,310
Commander Lu said

343
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,520
it's used to stimulate
the acupoints on the sole

344
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,480
to clear the meridians in the leg.

345
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,630
General Chu,

346
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,480
shall I help you up to try it?

347
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,000
These things he sent

348
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,390
are truly novel.

349
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,760
Keep them for now.

350
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,760
Thank him for me.

351
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,520
Greetings, General Chu.

352
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,760
This medicine was bestowed

353
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
by the Crown Prince.

354
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,760
It will help your leg heal.

355
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,350
The Crown Princess

356
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,390
asked me to deliver it without delay.

357
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,120
The Crown Princess?

358
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,390
You don't know?

359
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,630
Miss Song has agreed

360
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,150
to marry the Crown Prince.

361
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
The wedding will be held soon.

362
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,600
The Crown Prince sent someone

363
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,220
to bring her into the Palace
this morning

364
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,390
to choose her wedding attire.

365
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,070
She should be arriving at the Palace.

366
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,550
I must report back,

367
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,110
so I will not stay longer.

368
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,880
Tuantuan is going to become
the Crown Princess.

369
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,760
I want you to help me test him.

370
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,800
In the past,

371
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,040
you were always chasing after him.

372
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,260
You even went to Fengling alone

373
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,920
because of him,

374
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,070
but I still don't know

375
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,000
about his thoughts.

376
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,680
Test him?

377
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,440
How will you test him?

378
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,590
Linyang once said

379
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,960
that when he stands up,

380
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,920
he will come to see me.

381
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,550
I can see he has feelings for me.

382
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,000
What if he never

383
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,970
stands up in this life?

384
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,880
Qingping,

385
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,630
I just want to know

386
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,040
if he truly likes you

387
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,720
enough to give up

388
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,630
everything for you.

389
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,120
Otherwise,

390
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,920
how could I entrust the one I cherish

391
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,110
to someone else?

392
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,090
- Your Highness.
- Enough.

393
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,040
I've made up my mind.

394
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,620
I am the Crown Prince.

395
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,230
This time,

396
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,110
you must listen to me.

397
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,200
(Linyang,)

398
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,760
(you will come, right?)

399
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,430
Tuantuan,

400
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,150
didn't we have an agreement?

401
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,310
When I can stand up,

402
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll go to see you myself.

403
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Why did you

404
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,550
break your word

405
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,070
and give up first?

406
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,000
I can accept that you love someone else,

407
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,580
but I do not understand

408
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,590
why you would abandon

409
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,590
your aspirations and freedom.

410
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,430
You once said

411
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,030
you refused to be confined
within palace walls.

412
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,790
I hope you achieve

413
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,140
what you desire more than anyone.

414
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
If you walk

415
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,510
through these palace gates today,

416
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,830
you'll be breaking

417
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,000
your wings.

418
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,280
Tuantuan,

419
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,520
why are you doing this?

420
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,430
Tuantuan...

421
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,630
Linyang,

422
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,680
I am sorry.

423
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,630
I did not mean to deceive you.

424
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,310
Your Highness,

425
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,830
did you hear

426
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,830
Linyang's answer?

427
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,040
Did he pass the test?

428
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,030
General Chu, please do not blame her.

429
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,000
It was my idea
to have Qingping cooperate.

430
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,840
Qingping

431
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,960
was the first girl I ever truly liked.

432
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,360
So,

433
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,630
I cannot easily

434
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,960
entrust her to another man.

435
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,720
I know she likes you,

436
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,910
and she

437
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,630
has given so much for it.

438
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,070
Everyone in Huajing

439
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,790
knows what kind of man you are,

440
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,390
but only you know

441
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,830
whether you truly

442
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,470
like Qingping

443
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,550
and how far

444
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,960
you would go for her.

445
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,470
Tuantuan,

446
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,190
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,390
Before, I was not steadfast enough.

448
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,480
Sorry about that.

449
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,280
The old me

450
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,350
was like a dead tree, clinging to life,

451
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,040
preferring to stay in the shadows,

452
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,240
watching everything in silence.

453
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,110
Tuantuan's appearance

454
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,240
gave me hope again.

455
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,240
She made me realize

456
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,630
that everything can be pacified.

457
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,010
What is hard to pacify

458
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
is the human heart.

459
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,150
In the future,

460
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,480
whatever happens,

461
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,150
however hard it may be,

462
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,310
I shall never fail you.

463
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,320
Now,

464
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,550
I can finally be at ease.

465
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,000
General Chu,

466
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,630
the situation of the peace talks
is unclear.

467
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,680
If disputes arise again,

468
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,440
Great Sui will still need you to fight.

469
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,080
So,

470
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,310
even if Qingping hadn't come to me,

471
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,110
I'd still send the medicine to you.

472
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,480
May you recover soon.

473
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,150
Thank you, Your Highness.

474
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,390
Tuantuan,

475
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,950
the goldfinch

476
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,070
you once set free

477
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,350
should now be carefree.

478
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,870
From that day, I already knew

479
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,440
that the future you hoped for

480
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,280
would not include me.

481
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,760
Since I truly like you,

482
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,960
I hope you achieve what you desire.

483
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,800
This Imperial Palace

484
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,830
was never your tree to perch on.

485
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,230
Go.

486
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,440
Live the life you want.

487
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

488
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:12,620
(Qingzhou City)

489
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,520
Please work with me

490
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,390
to accomplish another great task.

491
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,390
I have petitioned the Emperor

492
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,350
to secretly go to North Qi

493
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,000
and assist Yu.

494
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,720
I should have known.

495
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,590
How could you let Ms. Chu

496
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,000
go to North Qi alone?

497
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,470
Yun,

498
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,110
what is the great task

499
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,720
you just mentioned?

500
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,520
As the General of the West,

501
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,880
you're in charge of Qingzhou
and Fengling.

502
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,150
Station troops in Qingzhou.

503
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,960
Qingzhou is closer to Qizhou.

504
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,630
If anything goes wrong,

505
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,040
support me in time.

506
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,460
(Qizhou Posthouse)

507
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,180
(Zhao Yue is not virtuous.)

508
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,040
Here.

509
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,070
Zhao Yue is immoral.

510
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,440
He must be punished by all.

511
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,020
(Zhao Yue is immoral, unfit to rule.)

512
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,830
Finally! That's satisfying.

513
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,670
Exactly.

514
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Well written.

515
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,650
He must be punished by all.

516
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,940
(Yingzhou)

517
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,790
Here you go.

518
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,630
Thank you.

519
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,710
It's nothing.

520
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,620
(The City Lord of Yingzhou
has left for Qizhou.)

521
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,540
(Yingzhou)

522
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,520
- Here.
- I think

523
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,360
this color is good.

524
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,560
How nice.

525
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,820
(The City Lord of Yan is ready.)

526
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,780
(Yan City)

527
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,620
(Qizhou)

528
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,480
- Your kebabs.
- Thanks.

529
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,320
Goodbye.

530
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,400
(The City Lord of Huqiu
will attack Qizhou.)

531
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,260
(Huqiu)

532
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,860
(Grilled meat)

533
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,140
(The City Lord of Wuzhou)

534
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,660
(Baoxin, Bai City)

535
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,900
(Xuan City)

536
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,910
Yes.

537
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,460
(City Lord of Xuan)

538
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,080
Gongsun Lan.

539
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,390
Sit.

540
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,830
You came by royal order
to kill me, right?

541
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,830
Act now.

542
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,830
As long as I live,

543
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,960
I will find every way

544
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,200
to avenge my clan.

545
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,550
Lord Chen, you want revenge?

546
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,880
Then that's fitting.

547
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,150
You know me.

548
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,150
I do not act

549
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,920
without personal gain,

550
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,350
but when it comes to serious matters,

551
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,040
I am clear-headed.

552
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,630
The former king

553
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,720
achieved nothing

554
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,310
and made no mistakes.

555
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,980
But in less than a month
after he ascended the throne,

556
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,730
you know best how many reckless things

557
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,040
Zhao Yue has done.

558
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,480
If not for you and the Queen Mother,

559
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,950
could Zhao Yue

560
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,680
sit firmly on this throne?

561
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,200
Now, for a new consort,

562
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,960
he has killed your daughter

563
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
and your family

564
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,310
and imprisoned the Queen Mother.

565
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,280
As a man, he is treacherous.

566
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,680
As a king, he is licentious and lawless.

567
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,910
Can such a man

568
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,680
still continue as the King of North Qi?

569
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,320
Among the Sixteen Cities,

570
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,590
half of the City Lords

571
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,910
have reached a consensus with me.

572
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,000
As long as you rise in rebellion,

573
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,070
they will surely support you in turn.

574
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,760
Lord Chen,

575
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,800
it is up to you now.

576
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,230
I'm willing to cooperate

577
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,840
with Mr. Gongsun

578
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,520
to defeat Zhao Yue

579
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,920
and avenge

580
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,550
my entire clan.

581
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,020
(Xuan City)

582
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,060
(Qizhou)

583
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,900
(Xuan City)

584
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,660
(Qizhou)

585
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,020
(The King is licentious; Kill him)

586
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,910
Your Majesty,

587
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,960
inside Qizhou City,

588
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,360
it is suddenly being widely spread

589
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,040
that you're not our legitimate ruler,

590
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,550
that you favor a foreign consort,

591
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,070
and that you are

592
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,360
immoral

593
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,070
and unfit to rule.

594
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,420
(Kill)

595
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,670
How ridiculous.

596
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,150
The people have known your attempt

597
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,440
to exterminate the Great Sui delegation.

598
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,800
The Great Sui troops are at the border,

599
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,670
ready to attack at any time.

600
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,190
Your Majesty.

601
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,130
Bad news, Your Majesty.

602
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,880
Your Majesty, bad news.

603
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,240
What's wrong?

604
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,460
The City Lord of Xuan,

605
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,100
who should have been executed,

606
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,620
has suddenly returned to Xuan City

607
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,320
and organized a force,

608
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,550
apparently intending

609
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,750
to counterattack Qizhou.

610
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,960
On what grounds?

611
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,590
On what grounds?

612
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,480
Your Majesty, spare me.

613
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,630
I dare not tell you.

614
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,750
You shall dare now, right?

615
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,360
They said

616
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,480
that you're unfit as a ruler

617
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,880
and must be punished by all.

618
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,630
They want to overthrow you

619
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,070
for the sake of North Qi.

620
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,630
Your Majesty, have mercy.

621
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,590
You dared not tell me

622
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,710
because you agreed

623
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,150
with them, right?

624
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,670
From an abandoned illegitimate child,

625
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,360
I have risen to this day.

626
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,110
Every step has been risky.

627
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,440
To sit on the throne

628
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,920
is destiny's favor.

629
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,270
Even destiny aids me.

630
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,630
You're just nothing!

631
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,620
(Chengtian Hall, Qi)

632
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,990
Your Majesty.

633
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,760
Ping,

634
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,800
he will not harm me.

635
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,360
Leave us.

636
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,540
(Bright and Virtuous)

637
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,670
Changming,

638
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,150
you're the only one I have now.

639
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,670
(If I were to kill you now,)

640
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,040
(I'd have my revenge,)

641
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,320
(but who'd pay for the pain)

642
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,590
(of the people of Great Sui?)

643
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,520
(I will make you watch)

644
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,000
(your throne collapse.)

645
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,880
(I will make North Qi)

646
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,270
(bow completely to Great Sui.)

647
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,320
What happened?

648
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,880
The main gates were destroyed.

649
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,260
The City Lord of Xuan is attacking.

650
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:21,920
Your Majesty,

651
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,670
chaos has broken out in the Palace.

652
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,470
Give me it.

653
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,350
Who is leading the troops?

654
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,440
Your Majesty,

655
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,560
it's the City Lord of Xuan.

656
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,140
They claim you were bewitched

657
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,910
to kill your wife
and imprison your mother,

658
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
so they've led troops

659
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,100
to rid you of the bad influence.

660
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,240
We're losing

661
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
the Palace.

662
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,550
I've arranged carriages

663
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,230
with 500 elite soldiers

664
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,230
to escort you out.

665
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,910
Zhao Yue,

666
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,750
they want to kill me.

667
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,920
If you hand me over,

668
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,000
your throne will remain secure.

669
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,840
I have sat

670
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,550
on that throne once.

671
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,230
I can sit on it again.

672
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,800
But you are

673
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,360
the only one in this world.

674
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,630
It won't be easy

675
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,320
to rise again.

676
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,670
Are you truly so confident?

677
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,840
No one in this world

678
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,840
can take you away

679
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,520
from me.

680
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,550
Your Majesty, the Queen Mother...

681
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,000
I was merciful and spared

682
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,000
her life last time.

683
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,840
My bond with her is broken.

684
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,590
Her fate

685
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
is for others to decide.

686
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,320
If Yue returns

687
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,960
Li Changming

688
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,320
to Great Sui now,

689
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,750
there may yet be a chance.

690
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,670
But Yue

691
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,000
can no longer

692
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,480
listen to me.

693
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,230
Since he's decided to leave,

694
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,440
let him leave.

695
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,670
I have defeated my brother

696
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,880
and Su Can.

697
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,840
After three kings,

698
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,190
the Palace is my foundation.

699
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,040
I must survive

700
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,520
to see

701
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,480
how it ends for him.

702
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,880
Where are we going?

703
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,760
To Dongliang.

704
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,590
With rebels from 11 cities in the north

705
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,480
and the Great Sui's army in the south,

706
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,580
only by passing through Baidi Valley

707
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,920
to Dongliang

708
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,320
can I create a chance to survive.

709
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,920
Last time, when you brought me

710
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,880
to escape from Huajing,

711
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,750
did you feel the same way?

712
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,160
Changming,

713
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,920
from now on,

714
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,110
you and I will only have each other

715
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,440
in this world.

716
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,440
I do love your temperament,

717
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,270
but now,

718
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,550
you'd better not provoke me.

719
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,070
What is it?

720
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,300
Bad news, Your Majesty.

721
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,480
