1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,125
<b>Hey, get off!</b>

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,458
<b>Call me Big Bro.</b>

3
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:17,916
<b>Stop messing around.</b>

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:18,750
<b>Quick, call me.</b>

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,041
<b>Hey, get off!</b>

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,541
<b>Does this scent feel familiar?</b>

7
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:26,958
<b>What?</b>

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,166
<b>The laundry detergent you brought.</b>

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,000
<b>Why were you abandoned?</b>

10
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,583
<b>Was it because you were too lame?</b>

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,125
<b>Come, I'll teach you.</b>

12
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,291
<b>Hey, hey, you're so boring.</b>

13
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,333
<b>What about you then?</b>

14
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,250
<b>Why were you abandoned?</b>

15
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,375
<b>All these debts you carry...</b>

16
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,458
<b>...were they for him?</b>

17
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,541
<b>What else?</b>

18
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,541
<b>It doesn't matter.</b>

19
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,583
<b>Let's not talk about unhappy things today.</b>

20
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,750
<b>Why not talk about it?</b>

21
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,458
<b>He looks like...</b>

22
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,833
<b>...he didn't abandon you either.</b>

23
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:53,500
<b>Yes.</b>

24
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,250
<b>He didn't abandon me.</b>

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,541
<b>One day...</b>

26
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,791
<b>...he disappeared.</b>

27
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,916
<b>We were supposed to leave together.</b>

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,291
<b>Didn't we agree to leave together?</b>

29
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,875
<b>Why did you leave me alone?</b>

30
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,375
<b>Why?</b>

31
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,708
<b>Was it because you didn't want me to see you at your worst?</b>

32
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,416
<b>Why?</b>

33
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,375
<b>Can you hear me or not?</b>

34
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,916
<b>Speak!</b>

35
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,541
<b>Speak up!</b>

36
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,875
<b>Why?</b>

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,458
<b>Why?</b>

38
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,333
<b>He can hear you.</b>

39
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,583
<b>Are you trying to comfort me?</b>

40
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,250
<b>I don't know how to comfort you.</b>

41
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,208
<b>Damn it!</b>

42
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,416
<b>What are you doing?</b>

43
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,625
<b>Use your body.</b>

44
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,416
<b>Get off!</b>

45
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,208
<b>Don't move.</b>

46
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,250
<b>Get off!</b>

47
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,041
<b>Don't rush.</b>

48
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,958
<b>He loved calling me "Big Bro."</b>

49
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,583
<b>Big Bro.</b>

50
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,166
<b>It's my boss.</b>

51
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,583
<b>Answer it.</b>

52
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,625
<b>How can I answer when you're like this?</b>

53
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,833
<b>Figure it out yourself.</b>

54
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,750
<b>You're crazy!</b>

55
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
<b>Not fun.</b>

56
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,791
<b>Not fun, huh?</b>

57
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,250
<b>Where are you going?</b>

58
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,416
<b>Going to buy some food.</b>

59
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,041
<b>So I'll have energy. Passion!</b>

60
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:41,583
<b>Hey.</b>

61
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,291
<b>Passion...</b>

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,916
<b>...is a brand of lubricant.</b>

63
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,458
<b>Boss!</b>

64
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,458
<b>I'm back!</b>

65
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,500
<b>Tonight, I'll let you experience the charm of Passion!</b>

66
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,250
<b>Why are you coughing so much?</b>

67
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,916
<b>You didn't even come out to greet me.</b>

68
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:26,875
<b>What the heck!</b>

69
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,000
<b>How did you get hurt so badly?</b>

70
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,416
<b>Chenxi!</b>

71
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,583
<b>Who hit you?</b>

72
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,041
<b>Did your boss come?</b>

73
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,791
<b>I'll go find him.</b>

74
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,208
<b>It's okay.</b>

75
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,083
<b>He already left.</b>

76
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,583
<b>Are you stupid?</b>

77
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,833
<b>If you had just let him find me, it would've been fine!</b>

78
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,791
<b>Idiot.</b>

79
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,750
<b>How could I bear to let you get hurt?</b>

80
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,458
<b>But I can't let you get hurt for me either!</b>

81
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,166
<b>That makes me even sadder.</b>

82
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,000
<b>Sorry, did I hurt you?</b>

83
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,666
<b>Does it still hurt?</b>

84
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,000
<b>With this yakuza friend around...</b>

85
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,333
<b>...I decided to move on from the past.</b>

86
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,666
<b>And start a new life together.</b>

87
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,333
<b>But this yakuza is a bit weak.</b>

88
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,000
<b>He might need my protection anytime.</b>

89
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,125
<b>Don't run!</b>

90
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,458
<b>Hahahahaha!</b>

91
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,833
<b>Hahahahaha!</b>

92
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,291
<b>Hahahaha!</b>
