1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Chenxi.

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,500
A year ago, I borrowed a lot of money from loan sharks to pay for his treatment.

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,500
But the treatment didn’t work.

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,500
He still left me.

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,000
The debt collectors keep coming.

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,416
Each one meaner than the last.

7
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,000
But this guy who showed up—

8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,500
I never expected him to be like this.

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,416
I told you,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,250
your organs

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,291
can all be turned into cash.

12
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,208
I just want to leave this world with some dignity.

13
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,208
Once I’m gone,

14
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,541
you can take this body, do whatever you want with it.

15
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,291
Dying is too easy.

16
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,708
If you don’t agree,

17
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,958
this place looks pretty nice to me.

18
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,416
Do whatever you want.

19
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,958
Hmph, do whatever I want, huh?

20
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,083
Do whatever I want.

21
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:44,041
Hey, only dogs pee on the floor like that!

22
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,708
Damn you!

23
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,333
Shut up!

24
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,291
Hey, boss!

25
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

26
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,916
I’m about to get the money, I swear!

27
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,416
No, boss, don’t cut out my kidney!

28
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,958
I’m still useful, I promise!

29
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,000
Don’t worry, boss.

30
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,291
Alright, bye, boss!

31
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,791
Hey, can you get the money or not?

32
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,625
Don’t mess with me!

33
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,958
What, you mute now?

34
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,333
I’m asking if you can get the money!

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,583
What about your friends?

36
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,750
Your relatives?

37
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,375
Your parents?

38
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,791
Say something!

39
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,416
Can you keep it down?

40
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,750
Do I have to pull a knife to get you to talk?

41
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,166
What’s that?

42
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,166
Wanna fight?

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,041
What are you doing?

44
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,083
You’re bleeding!

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,791
Hey!

46
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,041
Hey, hey!

47
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,583
Damn it!

48
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,375
What did you do to me?

49
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,000
What could I do?

50
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,500
What’s so funny?

51
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,583
Didn’t want you dying in my house.

52
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,208
You faint at the sight of blood?

53
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,125
Fainting at blood and still playing gangster?

54
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,625
None of your business!

55
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,291
There’s sugar in the water.

56
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,958
Make sure you drink it.

57
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,333
Hey!

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just a heads-up,

59
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,791
the bank cut off my electricity to force me out.

60
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,375
No power at night here.

61
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,000
Wow!

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,083
Hahahahahahaha!

63
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,375
So dumb!

64
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,458
Still laughing? Come help me!

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,958
Hurry up!

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Not bad, huh?

67
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,416
Pretty good, right?

68
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,166
Who asked you?

69
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,541
Hahaha!

70
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,750
Damn drunk!

71
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,625
Is this place for rats?

72
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,000
So messy and dark!

73
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,833
Haven’t cleaned in a while.

74
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,791
It’s a bit messy.

75
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,833
Get some light in here!

76
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,041
I need to use the bathroom!

77
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,125
Alright.

78
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,750
Where is it?

79
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,208
This light is way too dim!

80
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,958
Probably hasn’t been charged in a while.

81
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,041
Fine, come closer.

82
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,791
Hey, you’re standing too close!

83
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,666
Hey!

84
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,458
Why’d you take the light away? It’s dark again!

85
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,625
You’re so annoying!

86
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,166
Do you want me to stay or leave?

87
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,541
Fine, fine, fine!

88
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,666
Just stay here.

89
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,083
You said it.

90
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,166
You told me to stay!

91
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,125
Is your kidney failing or what?

92
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,791
You’re staring at me while I pee!

93
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,375
How am I not supposed to be nervous?

94
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,291
Who wants to watch you?

95
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,875
Stop saying “damn” all the time!

96
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,708
How many times have you actually done it?

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,708
Think that makes you cool?

98
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,458
You can barely pee, are you even capable?

99
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,833
Come on, I’ll help you!

100
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,583
Alright, alright, get lost!

101
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,791
Hey!

102
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,166
Let me tell you,

103
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,833
I’m plenty tough!

104
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,958
Don’t need your help!

105
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:39,833
And,

106
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,083
I’m not interested in you!

107
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,041
Hey, what are you doing?

108
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,791
Turn the light back on!

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,541
Turn it on yourself!

110
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,291
Damn it, give it to me!

111
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,208
Give it!

112
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,000
Come get it!

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,333
Give it to me!

114
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,291
Give it!

115
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,833
Give it!

116
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,416
You giving it or not?

117
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:07,833
Not giving!

118
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,541
You giving it?

119
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,833
Not giving!

120
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,333
You’re way too confident!

121
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,791
I’m the one

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,166
who’s not interested!

123
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,916
Damn, you talk too much!

124
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,833
Can’t you just pay the electric bill?

125
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
No money.

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,083
You pay it!

127
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,250
Damn it!
