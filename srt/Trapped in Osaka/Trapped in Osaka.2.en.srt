1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,500
You really planning to stay here?

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,958
Even gangsters gotta pay rent

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,208
It's free here, why not stay

4
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,958
A gangster with OCD?

5
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,583
You don't look like a gangster to me

6
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,041
Why do this?

7
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,833
You talk too much

8
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,250
We're out of water, go buy some

9
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,875
No money

10
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,375
Go now

11
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,208
Wait

12
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,208
If you run, where am I gonna find you?

13
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,041
Then you go

14
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,375
You could still run away

15
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,583
So what do you suggest?

16
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,500
Let's go together

17
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,875
Are you even trying?

18
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,083
Feels like I'm carrying this alone

19
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,791
Of course I'm trying

20
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,083
Why are you so weak?

21
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,666
How can you be a gangster with no strength?

22
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:30,791
Damn

23
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:35,166
Who's weak? I'm rock solid, get lost

24
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,083
You really letting me carry this alone?

25
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,166
You're so high-maintenance

26
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:58,916
Hey

27
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,291
Why do you owe money?

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,375
I'm dying anyway

29
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,500
Why tell you all this?

30
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,083
Can't you just get a job?

31
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,666
People need ambition

32
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,833
With some effort, you can overcome any difficulty

33
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,125
It's meaningless

34
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,666
Why so pessimistic?

35
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,041
Can't you make some effort to earn money?

36
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,625
Tell me then

37
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,208
Who's not making an effort now?

38
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,250
Where's mine?

39
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,541
This wine

40
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,958
Someone left it for me

41
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,041
So what?

42
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,291
Where are they now?

43
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,541
They left anyway

44
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,500
Yes

45
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,500
Do you know that feeling?

46
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,541
That...

47
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,166
Desperate need to protect something

48
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,916
That desperate need to protect

49
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,416
If I said I understood

50
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,083
Would you believe me?

51
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,875
His scent

52
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,333
His breath

53
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,958
It's all in here

54
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,500
Whenever I hold this

55
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,833
I feel like

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,333
He's still here

57
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,125
Hey

58
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,958
Drunk too much?

59
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,958
Lost your mind?

60
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,458
Doesn't matter

61
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,291
Anyway

62
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,208
After finishing these tonight

63
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,041
I'll have nothing left to hold onto

64
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,833
Then I can say goodbye to this world

65
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,666
Hey hey hey

66
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,375
We had fun today

67
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,500
I didn't even ask you for money

68
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,833
Why put on this show?

69
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,541
I'm serious

70
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,375
Listen

71
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,666
You still owe me money

72
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,166
You're still valuable to someone

73
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,250
What value could I have?

74
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,416
With that body of yours

75
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,833
If you went into that business

76
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,541
At least 30 grand hahaha

77
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,666
Haha

78
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,250
How about tonight

79
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,416
I give you a discount
