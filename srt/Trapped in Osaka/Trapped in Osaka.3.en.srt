1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,958
You still owe me money.

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:05,708
You're still valuable to others.

3
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:08,583
What value could I have?

4
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,583
With a body like yours...

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,166
If you were to sell yourself...

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,958
At least 30,000 yen, hahaha.

7
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,541
How about tonight...

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,750
I'll give you a special price?

9
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,625
I don't like men.

10
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,458
How would you know if you don't try?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,625
I don't think that's necessary.

12
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:25,958
You don't understand.

13
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,750
Men understand men better.

14
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,500
Men and women are different.

15
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,916
I haven't tried with women either.

16
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,875
You're really something else.

17
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,458
Someone like you...

18
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,375
doesn't seem like a gangster at all.

19
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,166
Hey.

20
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,166
You always say I'm not like a gangster.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,208
In what way am I not?

22
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,333
Your heart...

23
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,833
Your heart is kind.

24
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,083
Let's drink.

25
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,708
Hey.

26
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,125
Why did you come to Japan?

27
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,625
Sigh, for someone.

28
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,958
What kind of person?

29
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,666
A con artist.

30
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,458
Con artist?

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,208
Man or woman?

32
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,208
Why all the questions?

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Anyway, they scammed all my money.

34
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,833
It doesn't matter anymore.

35
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,625
Anyway, tonight...

36
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,125
let's finish all this alcohol.

37
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,500
Let's get rid of all our pain...

38
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:42,041
and troubles.

39
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,666
Cheers!

40
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,375
Cheers! Hahaha.

41
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,416
Hey!

42
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,750
Where did you go?

43
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,583
Damn it!

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,916
Come back!

45
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,500
Come back!

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Come back! It's dangerous!

47
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,958
Hurry, come back!

48
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,000
Come back!

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Why are you here?

50
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,416
You're such an idiot!

51
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,500
You're the biggest idiot in the world!

52
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,916
Why are you cursing at me?

53
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,833
Isn't it good to be alive?

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,541
Life has infinite possibilities.

55
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,208
I've been through no less than you.

56
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,166
And I haven't been fixated on dying like you.

57
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,250
People are different.

58
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,083
I'm going to find him.

59
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,291
Fine, you want to die, right?

60
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,541
Then let's die together.

61
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,458
My boss is going to kill me anyway.

62
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,166
Fine then.

63
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,125
I'm telling you, I can't swim.

64
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,500
If you take a step forward, I'll take a step forward.

65
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,083
Aaaaaah!

66
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,625
You idiot, are you tired of living?!

67
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,458
Hahahahahahaha!

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,541
You're too easy to fool.

69
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,375
What do you mean?

70
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,500
Actually, I can swim.

71
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,583
Hahahahahahaha!

72
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,416
Hahahahahahaha!

73
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,083
Don't run!

74
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,000
Woooaahhh!

75
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,875
Hahahahahahaha!

76
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,166
Don't run!

77
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,375
Hahaha!

78
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,250
Don't run!

79
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,333
You're soaked from the seawater.

80
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,750
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?

81
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,625
Not afraid.

82
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,041
I owe you my life.

83
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,166
How do you want me to repay you?

84
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,500
No need.

85
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,166
Take your time to think.

86
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,041
I'll go wash the clothes first.

87
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,458
My name is Hao Yu.

88
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,083
What's your name?

89
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,291
Call me...

90
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,083
Big brother.
