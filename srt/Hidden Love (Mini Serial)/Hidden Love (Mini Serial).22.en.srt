1
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
In order to monopolize provisions,

2
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,920
to monopolize the provisions

3
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,250
and gain more benefits.

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
to kill over 100 people of the Shen family.

5
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,360
This is the Yan family’s fault.

6
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,560
So today

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,599
I said this

8
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,600
to bring justice to the Shen family.

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,400
I see.

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
I see.

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,360
Yan Daiyuan.

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,080
Yan.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,890
Why are you still alive?

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,520
I killed you.

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,240
Stay back!

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,240
Why did you kill me?

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,920
My mother asked me to kill you.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,520
Kill you!

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,880
Yan’s Mansion is ours.

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,000
But you killed Madam.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,370
She deserves to die.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,400
Since young,

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,539
I'll do whatever she says.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,320
She wants to give the Yan family to that brat.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,720
I will kill her.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,570
Don't come over!

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Stay away!

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,479
Stay away!

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,200
I'll kill you!

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,520
Stay back!

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,400
Useless!

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Commander Zhang.

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,140
You didn't expect me to be alive, did you?

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
You want to die?

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,370
Brother.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm here to see you off.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,280
Boss.

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,680
See if there are any survivors.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,040
Take everything back.

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,900
Zhang Wendong,

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,080
You colluded with Yan Taiyuan

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,600
you colluded with Yan Taiyuan.

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,770
Do you really think you can hide it?

44
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,560
I was in the army.

45
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,960
It's normal to get blood on my hands.

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
But this blood...

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,640
It’s the enemy’s blood.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,920
Yan Qiyuan.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,079
You didn’t die?

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,970
How dare you collude with the bandits!

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,240
How can you face the soldiers who died in battle?

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,370
Even General Zhang doesn't know I'm the head of bandits.

53
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,360
You know me very well.

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh, I forgot.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,400
When I was writing to Miss Shen,

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,400
when I wrote to Ms Shen.

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't think you can do whatever you say.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,280
Yan Daiyuan.

59
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
You still don't repent?

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,440
This is Fong's handwriting.

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,650
If you don't know it,

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,240
your seal is here.

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,290
Impossible.

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,160
No way.

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,320
This old lady clearly destroyed it.

66
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,080
In order to protect herself,

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,080
to protect herself.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,560
That’s why

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,960
Zhang Wendong

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
didn’t dare to do anything to Yan Mansion.

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,700
Now we have witness and evidence.

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,940
I'll see how you can defend yourself.

73
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,600
What a joke.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,529
A letter from Wu Chien Fong.

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,040
Yan Daiyuan stamped it.

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,160
What does that have to do with me?

77
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,520
How dare you slander me?

78
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,920
I think you think you've lived too long.

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,920
What about this?

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,380
This is solid evidence of Yan's opium trafficking.

81
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
Every year after Yan died,

82
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
the Yan family will have a huge sum of money

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
into your personal account.

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,880
real gold and silver.

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,920
Is it true?

86
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,920
Once we investigate the marshal's mansion,

87
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,450
the truth will be revealed.

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,560
I clearly...

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,400
Shen Huizhi.

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,720
You pretended to be my savior

91
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,920
and entered Yan’s Mansion.

92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,360
and deliberately

93
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
to my father.

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,159
just to

95
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,820
to conspire with such a person

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,580
with such a person.

97
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,520
What the Yans did back then

98
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
your whole family will be buried together.

99
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Back then,

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
I naively thought

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,220
Agent Yan would uphold justice for the Shen family.

102
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,770
I didn’t expect it was all his plot.

103
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,600
The Yan family emblem is the best evidence.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,130
What you see may not be true.

105
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,960
How can you say

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,000
that the family emblem belongs to Uncle Yan?

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,730
Don’t forget

108
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,140
his surname is Yan too.

109
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,600
This is our grudge.

110
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,170
Who are you to speak?

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,280
If Yan didn't do it,

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,840
why didn’t he

113
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,970
why didn’t he find out the truth for us?

114
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,730
Why did he take me to Yan’s Mansion?

115
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
Because he feels guilty.

116
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,360
Father took you in

117
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
because I didn't want you to live on the street.

118
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,600
I didn't expect you to be so ungrateful.

119
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
Ridiculous.

120
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
I'm ungrateful

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,280
because he was greedy.

122
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,240
Otherwise, my family wouldn't have been wiped out.

123
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,970
My parents wouldn't have died.

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,610
It's all because of him.

125
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
He is the culprit.

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Yan Qiyuan.

127
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,420
I gave the Yan family a chance.

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,020
but you didn't cherish it.

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,560
Shen Huizhi, you're wrong.

130
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,820
The truth back then...

131
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,120
Hurry up.

132
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,520
Kill them all.

133
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,650
Catch Yan Qi Qiu.

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,540
I’ll see who dares.

135
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,640
Miss.

136
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,720
Let's go.

137
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,440
Everyone,

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,880
kill them on the spot.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,530
Let's go.

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,720
Stay still.

141
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,360
Tao Zi.

142
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,040
My Lady, Tao Zi.

143
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,160
Hurry!

144
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,080
Let's go.

145
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,120
Tao Zi.

146
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,930
Let's go.

147
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,890
Are you okay?

148
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,960
I'm fine.

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,480
Retreat.
