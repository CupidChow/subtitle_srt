1
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,080
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,440
I was too ridiculous before.

3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,760
You won.

4
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,800
There's no winning or losing

5
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,080
between us.

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,480
I thought you were full of calculations

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,770
you wouldn't treat her sincerely.

8
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,140
But I didn't expect

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,640
I was the one who hurt her the most.

10
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,160
He did a lot of absurd things,

11
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,240
he's not

12
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,080
he's not a bad person.

13
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,200
People have to pay the price

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,610
for what they have done.

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,160
Shu Yan.

16
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,140
I'll take you to meet someone.

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
Chen.

18
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,410
Why did you lose weight?

19
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,410
Are you not eating properly again?

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,410
When you sent Chen to the ballroom,

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,240
I asked Uncle Liang to bring him here.

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,900
Have a seat.

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,360
Okay.

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,960
You don't know

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,800
I've been through a lot these days.

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,240
I thought

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,410
I would never see you again.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,840
Luckily,

29
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,920
seeing you doesn't make any difference.

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,880
You guys catch up first.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
I'll go out first.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,800
I have something

33
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,680
I don't know if I can tell you.

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,440
Go ahead.

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
That day in the ballroom,

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
I saw that Miss Shen

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,200
resembles the daughter of an old friend of mine.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,800
If

39
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,880
she did all these,

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,840
she must have colluded with

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,160
must be in collusion.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,400
Now,

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,800
Wait for her to give herself away.

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,600
I have an idea.

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,770
You're here.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,930
Looks like you've practiced well.

47
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,960
I have nothing else to teach you.

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,920
Of course.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm a martial artist.

50
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
When this is all over,

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,400
I will make it up to you.

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,360
You said that.

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,400
Of course.

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,240
We have two children.

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,120
Happy family

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,000
and happy.

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,840
What are you thinking about?

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,440
Yan Qiqiu, you cheated!

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,329
You can’t hit me.

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,500
Yan Qiqiu, I can’t.

61
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,640
Miss Shen wants to see me?

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
What is it?

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,080
Commander.

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,020
I heard that Alan died in the line of duty.

65
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,120
Really?

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
We were ambushed.

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,260
but we haven't found the body.

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,090
But don't worry, Miss Shen.

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,520
We will find out the truth.

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
Hongming died in his duty at a young age.

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,440
What should we do?

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,280
Your Yans still have Yan Daiyuan.

73
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,680
He has no official position.

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,920
Besides, he is timid and weak.

75
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,720
How can he be trusted?

76
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,820
Although the Yans are declining,

77
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,290
they have a rich family.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,160
and extraordinary.

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,680
Miss Shen, do you think

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
who covets others’ property?

81
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,170
Of course he is not that kind of person.

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,560
But the world is turbulent outside.

83
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
and all forces are cutting their assets.

84
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,760
If we have more money,

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
there will be more dogs on your feet.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,360
Then your status will be stable.

87
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,159
Don’t you want that?

88
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,200
I’m just an orphan.

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,680
If you take me in,

90
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
everything will be yours.

91
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Besides,

92
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,640
we are on the same boat.

93
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,159
right?

94
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,920
Yan Hongming, open the gate.

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,860
and let the bandits in.

96
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
Then Yan Qiyuan will die.

97
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Do you know how many people will die?

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
They should be honored

99
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,760
They should be honored.

100
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
You are just an outsider.

101
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,490
What does the Yan family belong to you?

102
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,400
How can you promise me?

103
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,159
Don’t worry.

104
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,240
A few days ago, Yan’s family came to me.

105
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,360
Tell me.

106
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,480
The Yan family is now withering.

107
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,200
They need to find another backer.

108
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,800
And they will give me half of their assets

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
as my dowry.

110
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,880
I’ve been working hard in the Yans for so many years.

111
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,200
I have the property

112
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,880
are all with me.

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
Look at my brain.

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
I just remembered

115
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,920
there happens to be

116
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,120
needs a 13th concubine.

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,000
What do you think, Miss Shen?

118
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,530
As long as you get married officially,

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,730
and give him a title,

120
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,680
Of course they don't mind.

121
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,840
Of course.

122
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,780
Give me three days.

123
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
In three days,

124
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,120
in three days.

125
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,800
The marshal is here.

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
It has to be the marshal.

127
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,120
Yes.

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,000
So cool.

129
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,200
Of course.

130
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,040
Congratulations, Marshal.

131
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,920
Congratulations!

132
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,960
Screw you!

133
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,060
Commander.

134
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,610
The ceremony is completed.

135
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,520
Okay.

136
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,320
Next,

137
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,560
the marshal invites you to watch the show.

138
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,640
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

139
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
Thank you.

140
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,360
for coming to our wedding today.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,330
With this opportunity,

142
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to say something about the past.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,640
I was the daughter of the Shen family.

144
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,500
Many years ago,

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,600
my parents died tragically.

146
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,640
The Shen family was wiped out overnight.

147
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,760
Today,

148
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,400
I will reveal the truth

149
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,300
and seek justice for the Shen family.

150
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,520
Everyone,

151
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,850
I have something to say.

152
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
The Shen Family and Yan family have been friends for generations.

153
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,330
A few years ago, the Shen family

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
was massacred.

155
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,160
but the truth was covered up.

156
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,320
Today,

157
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I'll kill my family with righteousness.

158
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,600
This

159
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,240
was made by the former chairman

160
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,720
of the former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

161
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,240
Yan?

162
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,160
Isn’t that Yan Qiyuan’s father?

163
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
In order to monopolize provisions,

164
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,140
to monopolize the provisions

165
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,680
and gain more benefits.

166
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,440
to kill over 100 people of the Shen family.

167
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,000
This is the Yan family’s fault.

168
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,160
So today

169
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,280
I said this

170
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,400
to bring justice to the Shen family.

171
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,920
I see

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,920
I see.

173
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,760
Yan Daiyuan.
