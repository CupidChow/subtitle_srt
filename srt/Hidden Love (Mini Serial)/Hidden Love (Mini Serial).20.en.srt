1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,730
I’m worried that I can’t find someone to revenge.

2
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to avenge Qi Qiu.

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,440
Shu Yan.

4
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,400
It's you.

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,479
Qi Qiu.

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,880
I’m sorry.

7
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,720
I made you worry again.

8
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,300
You only told me to leave the city.

9
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,560
but you didn't tell me why.

10
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,600
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,480
I put you in danger.

13
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,680
But...

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
how did you...

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,329
into the den of thieves?

16
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,200
Shen Huizhi wanted to kill me

17
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,960
to kill me.

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
But she never thought that

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,880
the leader is my father's assistant.

20
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,079
All of this

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,960
is my plan.

22
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,240
Boss.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,160
We found him.

24
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,200
Qi Qiu.

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,180
Why are you risking your life?

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
The acting is not realistic.

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
No fish takes the bait.

28
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,520
I...

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,079
Take him back.

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,290
We must save him.

31
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
Hurry!

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm glad you're okay.

33
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,900
I couldn't tell you the truth.

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,320
You did all this

36
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,280
for me.

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,360
I know.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll take you to Uncle Liang.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,560
Okay.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,860
Straighten the tip of the gun.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,060
Stretch your legs.

42
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,140
Straighten the tip of the gun.

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,130
Uncle Liang.

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,240
Here.

45
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,200
This is Shu Yan.

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,570
Uncle Liang.

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,130
Thank you for saving Qi Qiu.

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,760
Please accept my bow.

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,840
No.

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,280
We're a family.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,520
You brat.

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,890
You have good taste.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,800
Uncle Liang, you must be joking.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,530
If Master were still alive,

55
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,400
I would be so happy

56
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,400
I would be so happy.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,730
Uncle Liang.

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,720
What happened back then?

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,760
It's a long story.

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,500
When we escorted the provisions,

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
we were ambushed by assassins.

62
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,640
Boss.

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll hold it. Go.

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,600
No.

65
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,940
Let's go together.

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,800
Zhi Dong.

67
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,560
Brother.

68
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm here to see you off.

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,560
Boss.

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,800
My father...

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,520
was killed by Yan.

72
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
They opened the city gate

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
and wanted to use it to kill someone.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
we'll play along.

75
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,580
Only in this way

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,240
can the power behind Wu

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,720
gradually surface.

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
Only in this way

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,920
I can kill my father.

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,680
But...

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,760
Wu Fong is dead.

82
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,160
When did that happen?

83
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,700
After you left the city gate that day,

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,840
someone sent a letter to Wu Chien-fong.

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,240
I thought she was still useful to you,

86
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,360
so I went to Yan's.

87
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,640
Shen Huizhi and Yan Daiyuan

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,920
killed Wu Fong together.

89
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,760
and frame me.

90
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
for letting you face this alone.

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,770
It's not your fault.

93
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,360
They are too cruel.

94
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,040
Yan Taiyuan, that bastard.

95
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,960
He even killed his own mother.

96
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,120
I haven't avenged my father.

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,200
How could Wu Yuefang die?

98
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,890
Wu Chien-fong has committed many crimes.

99
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,040
She deserved it.

100
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,400
The rest

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,600
will pay the price

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,720
We will make them pay.

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,890
This is the little girl who saved me back then.

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,800
She is now my wife.

105
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,640
Shu Yan.

106
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,240
The two of us

107
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,700
will find the murderer who killed you

108
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,000
and avenge you.

109
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,200
Qi Qiu and I are united.

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,250
If you know it in heaven,

111
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,880
please bless us.

112
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,120
Shu Yan.

113
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,000
I didn't expect you to come this far.

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
How dare you come here when you know who I am?

115
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Who sent you here?

116
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,920
Shouldn't you be safe now?

117
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,140
I'm afraid I'll break your heart.

118
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,600
Shen Huizhi.

119
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,320
As expected from the Yan family.

120
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,250
You're so smart.

121
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,690
How did it go?

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,960
I used ginseng to keep him alive.

123
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,080
But he wants to see Ms Shu alone.

124
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Excuse me.

125
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,080
You old hag.

126
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,400
Where did she hide it?

127
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,679
Miss.

128
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,600
The man sent is back.

129
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,380
Everything goes well.

130
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,640
Adjutant of the City Defense Department who suppressed the bandits

131
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,600
Yan Hongming died in his duty.

132
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
Find someone to spread the news.

133
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,560
Tao Zi.

134
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,920
as the head of Yan’s Mansion,

135
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,080
as the head of Yan’s Mansion.

136
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,680
OK.

137
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,170
You're here.

138
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I don't have time.

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,320
This is for you.

140
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,360
This is Wu Chien Fong. This is the evidence of the murder.

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,160
who hired a murderer to kill Yan.

142
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,840
I found it in her room

143
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,040
I found it in her room.

144
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,080
This is the last thing I can do for you.

145
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,220
Do you remember

146
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,160
the first time we met?

147
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,120
I remember.

148
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,000
I was scared.

149
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,210
You were comforting me.

150
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,400
If I could,

151
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,560
I want to protect you.

152
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
But I don't have a chance.

153
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,120
What can I do for you?

154
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,480
Go.

155
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,480
I was too ridiculous before.

157
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,800
You won.

158
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,960
There's no winning or losing

159
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,480
between us.

160
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,600
I thought you were full of calculations

161
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,850
you wouldn't treat her sincerely.

162
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,280
But I didn't expect

163
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,760
I hurt her the most.
