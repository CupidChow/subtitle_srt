1
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,360
Did I remember it wrongly?

2
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,320
Shu Yan.

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,759
Shu Yan.

4
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,920
Do you know what you were doing just now?

5
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,410
Then what are you doing?

6
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,650
If it weren't for me,

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,460
you would have died, you know?

8
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,520
And then?

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
You want me to be grateful to you

10
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
and wait for your orders?

11
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
Since you want the Yans,

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,490
you should act step by step.

13
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,200
But you don't even know

14
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
with the marshal.

15
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,760
In my opinion,

16
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
you are just a mess.

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,240
Not only that,

18
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,160
you also got me into trouble.

19
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,540
I'll send someone to send you out of the city.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,920
Is Young Master too naive

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,079
or too naive?

22
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
I told you.

23
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Since you're a mess,

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
then lie down in your mud pit.

25
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,600
Leave me alone.

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,880
I'll decide my own life.

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,720
Shu Yan.

28
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,520
Let's talk.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,860
You finally stopped pretending.

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,160
Let's work together.

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Shen Huizhi has

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,680
Wu Chien-fong killed my father.

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,320
I can't touch her yet.

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,450
But she tried so hard to get your blood.

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,800
for another purpose.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Why don't we push the boat along the way?

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,120
How will you save my life?

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,079
Is this Miss Shen?

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,079
She's indeed extraordinary.

40
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,280
You look like a fairy.

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,440
Take your money

42
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,140
and leave Jiangcheng.

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,480
Otherwise, you might die.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,840
I can't spend it.

45
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,600
Wait.

46
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,160
What else?

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,280
Miss.

48
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,880
Miss.

49
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Chen has made arrangements.

50
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,650
Keep an eye on it.

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,600
You'll need it someday.

52
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,210
Grandma.

53
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,399
I heard you teased Yan Yan Yan

54
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,440
in front of Yan Qiyan.

55
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,960
Qi Qiu wanted to make me happy.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,160
Yes.

57
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
It seems that he loves you very much.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,720
Madam.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,530
I heard you wanted to see me.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,400
Qi Qiu.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,040
I haven’t seen you for a long time.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,850
Are you feeling better?

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm fine now.

64
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
The parrots I've raised are disobedient.

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm busy packing.

66
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
He's just a beast.

67
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,420
Just kill him if you disobey your master.

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,280
Thank you for your concern.

69
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,420
Grandmother is right.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,810
You disobedient beast.

71
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,520
Just kill him.

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,320
Since I'm your grandmother,

73
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
of course I have to consider everything for you.

74
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Since you're almost recovered,

75
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
let's start preparing for the wedding.

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,080
As the president,

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,720
your marriage concerns the dignity of the Yans.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,780
You must have a grand wedding.

79
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,920
Huizhi told me

80
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,320
you and that street girl were just acting.

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm relieved.

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,440
As for you,

83
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
Although you grew up in Yan’s Mansion,

84
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
I’ll show my dignity.

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,930
Thank you, Grandma.

86
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,880
Three days later is a good day.

87
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
Qi Qiu, what do you think?

88
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,120
It’s all up to you.

89
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,160
The road is clear.

90
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,040
You should go your way tonight.

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,320
But he agreed to get married.

92
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,040
Just do it.

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
It'll save us trouble.

94
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Young Master.

95
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,240
Qi Qiu.

96
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,560
I’ve been waiting for you.

97
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,240
I know your orange is fake.

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,560
You've always been pretending.

99
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
How did you find me?

100
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,240
Shu Yan's birthmark is sometimes gone.

101
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
And yours is tattooed.

102
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,600
I found it

103
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,360
I found out.

104
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
But I suffered a lot for it.

105
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,600
Since you already knew,

106
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,640
why didn't you expose me?

107
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,900
Not only will I not expose you,

108
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,120
I can even save your life.

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,640
You can still be

110
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,240
in the Yan family.

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360
But in exchange,

112
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,220
I need evidence that Oh Yeom-fong killed my father.

113
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,000
I can satisfy you.

114
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,159
But I have one request too.

115
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,520
I need you to get Shu Yan's heart blood

116
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,500
and make me the guiding medicine.

117
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,640
I'll give you

118
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
what you want.

119
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,160
Why do you have to take her blood?

120
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,960
Because I love you.

121
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,000
Let me kill my savior.

122
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,800
Do you love me

123
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
or hate me?

124
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,120
If you can't get love,

125
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
is hatred.

126
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,480
You just said

127
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,840
as long as I get the heart blood,

128
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,360
you will give me the evidence.

129
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,400
So you admitted it.

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,320
Wu Fong did this, right?

131
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,840
Yes or no.

132
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,560
You said it.

133
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,080
Because I love you,

134
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,720
because I love you.

135
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,400
As long as you do as I say.

136
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,920
Deal.

137
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,600
Alan.

138
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,920
Where are you going?

139
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,850
To meet a friend.

140
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,280
What friend?

141
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,480
Don't think I don't know.

142
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,600
Go find that bitch Shu Yan.

143
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,360
Shu Yan is a pitiful person.

144
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,120
The grudge between us and Yan Qi

145
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,450
shouldn’t involve her.

146
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,280
Those who are close to Zhu are close to the evil.

147
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,080
She has nothing to do with Yan Qi Qiu.

148
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,600
How do you know?

149
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,480
she won't stab you in the back?

150
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,600
I deserve that.

151
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,520
You should think it through.

152
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,480
A family like us

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
have no right to fall in love.

154
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,280
Young Master.

155
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,090
They want Ms Shu's heart blood.

156
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,320
Master, I beg you.

157
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,520
Please don't send Ming'er away.

158
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,080
Get up.

159
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,680
I'll kick you to death!

160
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,920
Madam.

161
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,200
Madam.

162
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,640
I beg you.

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,660
I'll be in charge of the Yan family in the future.

164
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,840
But you're checking Zhi Dong's account in secret.

165
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
You're ruining us.

166
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Shu Yan.

167
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
You know everything?

168
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,640
My life is on my own.

169
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,580
If I stay in Yan’s Mansion,

170
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,480
is just

171
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
to amuse a beauty.

172
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,500
He's going to take my heart blood.

173
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
Why would I be reluctant?

174
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,970
You're leaving?

175
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,720
Luckily, I'm free now.

176
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
I'll take you out of here.

177
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,840
Miss.

178
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Should we send someone to follow us?

179
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,280
No.

180
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
Young Master will do it.

181
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,760
After all, he promised me.
