1
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,730
What a coincidence.

2
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,600
You didn't sleep all night?

3
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,320
Good.

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,940
We've been busy all night.

5
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,880
Let's have breakfast together.

6
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,479
Alan.

7
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,160
Come on.

8
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,120
Look.

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,970
We have your favorite braised chicken today.

10
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm not going to make men happy.

11
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,800
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,840
Grandma.

13
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,960
I’m here to discuss

14
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
the next step to deal with Yan Qi Qiu.

15
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,760
Alan,

16
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,480
You're finally willing to be on my side.

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,920
Okay.

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,520
Tell me

19
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,120
what's your plan?

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,240
Grandma.

21
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,360
I think you should invest

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,960
to send Young Master to the City Defense Department.

23
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,490
Even if he takes over the Chamber of Commerce,

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,800
he’s just a businessman.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,060
If he enters the Ministry of Defense,

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
it’s easy

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,840
to suppress Yan Qiyuan.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,200
That's a good idea.

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,060
What about you?

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,600
I’ll keep an eye on Yan Qi

31
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,079
in secret.

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,920
You've got nothing to hide.

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Don't forget

34
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,040
we are on the same boat now.

35
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
I won't let you choose to watch the show.

36
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,880
Shu Yan, that bitch.

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,320
transferred the money in the warehouse without permission.

38
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,760
I only have my money now.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,520
Alan.

40
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,320
We must succeed this time.

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,460
Grandma, don't worry.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
We will succeed.

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,360
Here.

44
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,900
Have some meat.

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,720
Sir.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,860
Commander,

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,050
The Yan family’s stuff is here.

48
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,540
Why is it early this month?

49
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,220
Commander.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,960
was sent by the second son of the Yan family.

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Alan.

52
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,540
Get out.

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,080
Yes.

54
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,180
Close the door.

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
I thought

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,000
the second son of the Yan family was a tough man.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,730
I didn't expect him to be like his useless father.

58
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
But he is

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,240
than Yan Daiyuan.

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,730
He wants to join the City Defense Department.

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Commander,

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,400
Isn’t the Yans your dog?

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,159
If you hadn’t been soft-hearted,

64
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,520
the Yans and the Shen family would have ended up like this.

65
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,240
Now the Yans

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,370
doesn’t know what they are capable of.

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,970
It's been so many years.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,200
the Chamber of Commerce has gained enough weight.

69
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
It's time to move.

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,720
You're so considerate.

71
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,160
Yes.

72
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,410
When I get the property,

73
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll put you in my room.

74
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,800
and see how you feel.

75
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,160
It's all thanks to me

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,480
thanks to me.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,600
In the end, you still want to use Alan

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
with Yan Hongming.

79
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,480
You should listen to me.

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,720
Don't be angry.

81
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,800
Tell me.

82
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,440
I want to hear it.

83
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,520
When you get into my bed,

84
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,240
I'll tell you slowly.

85
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,680
Where is Er Ye?

86
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,560
Why isn't he back yet?

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,120
Er Ye.

88
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320
Er Ye...

89
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,720
Let go of me!

90
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,280
Cui!

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,000
Cui!

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,440
I asked you to drink with your mouth.

93
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,680
Are you crazy?

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,040
Crazy.

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm crazy.

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,680
If you didn't control the Yan family

97
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,560
after you became the matron,

98
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,320
and control me.

99
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,400
How can I not be crazy?

100
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,320
Er Ye is drunk.

101
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,610
Take him to rest.

102
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,720
Mr. Cheng.

103
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,250
Get lost!

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
Now, even you dislike me.

105
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
I threw me away after using it.

106
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,440
You might as well

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,200
throw me into the well.

108
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,920
Bastard!

109
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,160
My mother hit me.

110
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
My mother hit me.

111
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,480
Madam asked you to serve tea.

112
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,040
Young Madam.

113
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,560
Madam asked you to serve tea.

114
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
It turns out you can call her master.

115
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,160
Got it.

116
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,220
I'll be right back.

117
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,440
Madam.

118
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
What time is it?

119
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,560
Young Madam is newlywed.

120
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,770
She doesn’t know the rules of Yans.

121
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,560
My newly married wife has been kneeling to serve tea.

122
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,880
Fortunately, I've been practicing for years

123
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,940
I have the habit of wearing knee pads.

124
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,780
I didn't expect

125
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,320
to be useful now.

126
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,340
Young Madam didn't get up until sunrise.

127
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,320
and delayed the tea serving.

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,520
I made you wait for four hours.

129
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,930
She should be punished to kneel for four hours to apologize.

130
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
You two watch her.

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,500
Madam, let me help you.

132
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,720
You don't look well.

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,850
so I want to give you some nourishment.

134
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
One more shot.

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,120
Grandma.

136
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,179
Are you coming too?

137
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,080
You look so energetic now.

138
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,340
I feel much better.

139
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,680
I didn't expect that I'm a good student.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,280
If you don't feel well next time,

141
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,080
next time.

142
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,000
You too.

143
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,120
Madam.

144
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,440
Little trotters.

145
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,010
Grandma, calm down.

146
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,080
I'll find a way to deal with her.

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,320
Go away, loser!
