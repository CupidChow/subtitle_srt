1
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,400
How did you make the soup

2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,640
It's so salty.

3
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,450
When I was in charge,

4
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,120
when I was in charge.

5
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,600
Even the servants can't manage it well.

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
Make me another bowl.

7
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,700
Okay, Grandma.

8
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,700
Bring me a pot of hot water.

9
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,000
The combination of salty soup and hot water

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,660
can solve Grandma's problem.

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,410
But I don't know your taste.

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,200
Remember to stop at any time.

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,200
I don't know how much I should add.

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,720
Enough.

15
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,039
Since it's enough,

16
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,080
you can eat first.

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,610
Young Madam.

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,280
This is ginseng soup I made for you.

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,880
Don't mind it.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,759
Since it's for health,

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,780
I'll give it to you.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,120
You're sick every day.

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,039
You need to drink more bowls.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,160
Young Madam, don't let me down.

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,039
Drink this and you won't suffer from childbirth.

26
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,850
These two weak chickens

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,000
want to subdue me?

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,040
Do you think I'm wasting my time?

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you waiting for?

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
Catch her!

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,280
Stop!

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,170
What's going on?

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,660
What happened?

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,680
Qi Qiu.

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Elders,

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,600
I don't know what I did wrong.

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,480
Grandma wants to work with Shen Huizhi

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,520
with Shen Huizhi

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,570
so that the Yan family will have no offspring.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,840
How dare you accuse me first?

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,720
Madam!

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,160
What’s going on?

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
As the eldest son,

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,560
no matter what her wife did,

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,930
you don't have to do this to her.

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
How can you reverse the truth?

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,120
It was you.

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,760
Shut up.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
Stop acting in front of me.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,420
I advise you to let go of this little thought.

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,540
Let me tell you.

52
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,220
Whether Shu Yan can give birth or not,

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,960
I have only one wife.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,570
If you still don't know your place,

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,880
prepare for the rest of your life.

56
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,170
Let's go.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,040
Let's call it a day.

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
If it happens again,

59
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,480
I won’t forgive you.

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,760
Qi Qiu, let’s go.

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,410
Let’s go.

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,600
What's wrong?

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,620
What are you doing?

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,840
I wanted to put on a show to save her,

65
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,720
but the beauty Dok-mi got me.

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,240
But I can't let the hero go in vain.

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,480
So,

68
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,010
do you want to reward me with a kiss?

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,160
What are you talking about at this hour?

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,090
Are you tempted?

71
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,120
I can hear you here.

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,839
I...

73
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,880
That's because...

74
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,560
I ran in a hurry.

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,680
Really?

76
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Next time,

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
if anyone bullies you again,

78
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Mrs. Yan won’t be bullied.

79
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
You little bitch!

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,960
How dare you ride on my head?

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,240
How dare you!

82
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,980
Why are you standing here?

83
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,320
You can't do anything well.

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,400
Grandma.

85
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,440
You're so impatient.

86
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,240
This is not like you.

87
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,960
when dealing with Agent Eom.

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,820
Shut up.

89
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,730
What are you talking about?

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Don't mention

91
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,170
Don't mention it again.

92
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,159
To deal with Shu Yan,

93
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,000
to deal with Shu Yan.

94
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,480
We want her to be doomed

95
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,280
and never come back.

96
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
It's just that

97
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,960
to succeed,

98
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,840
we need someone to stall Yan Qiyuan.

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
He’s not easy to deal with.

100
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,960
I’ll find a way

101
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,300
I’ll figure it out.

102
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,720
Alan.

103
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,680
Let me take a good look.

104
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,400
I’m counting on you.

105
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,659
Yan’s Mansion is so prestigious.

106
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,440
He even prepared a social ball for the new wife.

107
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
You want her to show herself.

108
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,000
The Mrs. Yan is not easy to deal with.

109
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,040
It’s hard to tell

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,520
or not.

111
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,290
All right, let's go.

112
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,890
Why are you hesitating?

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,640
Listen to me.

114
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,160
Put these valuable things on.

115
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,330
Everyone thinks highly of you.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,840
Are you sure Yan Qi can’t come?

117
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,560
Young Master has been very active recently.

118
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,080
The Chamber of Commerce was shocked.

119
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,940
Yan Qiyuan dealt with it himself.

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,360
OK.

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,480
Isn't this Miss Shen

122
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,880
who pretended to be the chairman's savior?

123
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,400
Why did Madam bring her out?

124
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,320
Don't you know?

125
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,240
Madam asked her to pretend.

126
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Please calm down.

127
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Our old lady has something to say.

128
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,810
On behalf of Yan’s Mansion,

129
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,040
on behalf of Yan’s Mansion

130
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,200
to thank you for attending my grandson's wedding.

131
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,760
So tonight,

132
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,760
enjoy this wonderful moment tonight.

133
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you, Madam.

134
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,240
Hello.

135
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,560
This is the real wife of Yan family.

136
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,800
Hello.

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
You said you were a clown from the street.

138
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,920
I don’t think

139
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,400
doesn't look like him.

140
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,840
The three ladies are right.

141
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Before this,

142
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,010
I did run in the underworld.

143
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,850
But I don't steal or rob.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,330
and live an honest life.

145
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,240
If you have any questions,

146
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,400
just ask me.

147
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,210
What a coincidence.

148
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,000
A few days ago,

149
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
a few days ago.

150
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
He told me

151
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,320
you did it before.

152
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,560
A spy?

153
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,760
Bastard!

154
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,500
This concerns the reputation of the Yan family.

155
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,240
Chen.

156
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,610
Why are you here?

157
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
You should know

158
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,720
what to say and shouldn't say.

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,320
I know.

160
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
I know what to say.

161
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,640
Don't worry.

162
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,160
This is

163
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,160
Young Madam’s former leader.

164
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,400
Shu Yan.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,330
You have no conscience.

166
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,720
How could you forget your old friend

167
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,520
How could I forget my old friend?

168
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
I've been looking for you.

169
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,360
Mr. Zhao has been looking for you twice.

170
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,120
If you don't spend time with him,

171
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,400
I can't handle it.

172
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,240
Mr. Zhao.

173
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,960
Who is it?

174
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Mr. Zhao.

175
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,800
Mr. Zhao forgot.

176
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,690
Mr. Zhao.

177
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,000
Mr. Zhao who often ordered you to accompany him.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,440
You...

179
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
If you hadn't said you were short of money,

180
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,120
I

181
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
turn a blind eye to it.

182
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,000
Not only Mr. Zhao,

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,400
but also Mr. Li and Mr. Xu.

184
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,240
I couldn't find you.

185
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,000
They

186
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,560
for a long time.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,880
Really? That's amazing.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
Yeah.

189
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,280
Shu Yan.

190
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,440
Does Qi Qiu know about this?

191
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,160
This lowly spy

192
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,560
became the wife of the chairman.

193
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,920
I was wrong.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,160
When we got married,

195
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,320
Mr. Yan protected Young Madam so much.

196
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,400
is not worth it.

197
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,440
Are you crazy?

198
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,480
Shen Huizhi.

199
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,440
You're such a good actor.

200
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,160
why don't you go to Chen's theater to be the leading actor?

201
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,120
Let's see how long you can keep your mouth shut.

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,640
Grandma.

203
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
Please clean up the Yans.

204
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,880
Guards!

205
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,450
Let's see who dares to touch me.

206
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,600
Everyone,

207
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,640
what I said just now

208
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,120
was told by Miss Shen.

209
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,720
Nothing is true.

210
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
I see.
