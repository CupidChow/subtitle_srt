1
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,680
Shu Yan.

2
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,220
Young Master, what happened?

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,740
Get out.

4
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,210
Sorry, I just...

5
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,960
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,050
I thought you were an old woman.

7
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,930
I'm just here to deliver the medicine.

8
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,290
Are you okay?

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,080
It's the first time for the young master to eat meat.

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
for the first time?

11
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,320
Just give me the medicine.

12
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,720
Why are you peeping at others taking a bath?

13
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,079
You are my wife.

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,400
What's wrong with it?

15
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,079
I haven’t said yes.

16
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,800
Besides, I saw you

17
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,280
in Yan family.

18
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,160
Marrying you

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
to marry you.

20
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,090
It will be different after we get married.

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,520
According to the Yan family’s motto,

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,760
Only when we get married,

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,560
the eldest son and eldest grandson can be the real head of the family.

24
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,410
What about Shen Huizhi?

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
It's none of your business.

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
I have my own plan.

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,850
Where is your jade pendant?

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,700
Why are you looking for it?

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,960
I saved someone when I was young.

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,320
He wore

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,530
that looks exactly like yours.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,460
Dragon-shaped jade pendant.

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,920
It's all over the street.

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
You think

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,000
just because of this?

36
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,970
Aren't you too foolish?

37
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,520
Let's end our deal.

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,260
Your weakness is too obvious.

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,800
You'll be used by someone with ulterior motives.

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,260
Not to mention helping me.

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,040
Take your money and get lost.

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,120
You're the one who wanted to cooperate.

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
You're the one who broke the contract.

44
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,040
Why should I do whatever you say?

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,880
They all call you a loser.

46
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,560
But only I know

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,280
you are hiding yourself.

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,720
Yan Qiyuan.

49
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,400
I can be your sword.

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,960
If it's just because of that jade pendant,

51
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,720
I told you.

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,730
I'm not that person.

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,040
I only believe what I see.

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,779
What are you doing?

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Come on. Let's go.

56
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,000
Already?

57
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,409
You're here.

58
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,880
What kind of person is she?

59
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,570
Why must I save her with my heart blood?

60
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,320
You have to

61
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,800
Yan Qi.

62
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,480
I want to see Shen Huizhi.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,760
Sure.

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,420
I can take you to try your luck.

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,440
But don't believe what she said.

66
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,580
What about you?

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Can I trust you?

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,720
Of course.

69
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,360
Miss Shen.

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,680
Are you here to get the medicine?

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,440
Ms Shu is here too.

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,620
I thought the way to use a living person as a guide...

73
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,640
to use a living person as a ingredient.

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,760
I don't think

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,040
she doesn't look like a dying person.

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,440
How could you come up with such a dirty idea?

77
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,730
Let's talk somewhere else.

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
The fortune teller said

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,760
to use my heart blood as your guiding ingredient.

80
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,050
It's just a folk prescription.

81
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,480
Why me?

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,040
They got you all here.

83
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,010
I don't know.

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,600
We...

85
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,720
Who else?

86
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,280
Ms Shu.

87
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,680
There are many girls caught.

88
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
You're not the first one.

89
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,540
Naturally, you won't be the last one.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,159
What about the other girls who were caught?

91
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,159
Where did they go?

92
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
Who knows?

93
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,600
I heard

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,780
it took a lot of effort to get you back.

95
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
But if

96
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,600
use your life

97
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,440
for my life.

98
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,180
I believe Qi Qiu will be very willing.

99
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
Your life is noble.

100
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,000
just because your life is noble?

101
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,740
I don't think you're sick.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
Who is the mastermind?

103
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,880
It’s Yan Qi.

104
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,720
Everything was his plan.

105
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Miss Shen is amazing.

106
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,880
She's lying.

107
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,450
You didn't even kowtow.

108
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,680
I didn't expect you to use your strength.

109
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,620
After all, no one wants to be a bad guy.

110
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Then let me be the bad guy.

111
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Just because I’m Yan Qiqiu’s woman?

112
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,160
I thought

113
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
you liked Yan Qiyuan's things the most.

114
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,480
Yes.

115
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,240
I like your stuff

116
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
But I shouldn't like you.

117
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,560
Am I wrong?

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
What do you mean?

119
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,640
In order to repay you for saving my life,

120
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,040
he kept you here.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
But I know

122
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,020
you didn't save him back then.

123
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,960
It was Shu Yan.

124
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
The flower on her

125
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,980
are much more real than yours.

126
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,740
I have a few questions for you.

127
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,680
You'll let me go once you get married.

128
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,410
Is that true?

129
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,480
Of course.

130
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,840
The more Yan Qihuan said it,

131
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,450
the more she suspected.

132
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,960
Is it true that

133
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,450
for Shen Huizhi's life?

134
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,000
Of course I lied to her.

135
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,360
There's no heart blood.

136
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,160
But...

137
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,600
what I said is not entirely a lie.

138
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,280
She can’t leave Yan Mansion alive.

139
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,810
Are you that confident?

140
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,840
Yan Qiyuan won’t let her go.

141
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Even if Yan Qi will let her go,

142
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,080
I won’t let her go.

143
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,960
Is Alan your trap?

144
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,460
Does he know these?

145
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,840
Aren’t you afraid

146
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,840
if you tell me this?

147
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,000
Alan.

148
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,560
We are different.

149
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,960
But let me remind you.

150
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,160
If you want to live,

151
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
you’d better stay away from him.

152
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,600
Young Master

153
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,460
told anyone about the birthmark.

154
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,040
That means

155
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
we are on the same boat.

156
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,160
My only target is Yan Qiyuan.

157
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,280
What about me?

158
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,400
You're mine.

159
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,300
I will protect you.

160
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Shu Yan, don't move.

161
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm here.

162
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,460
I will protect her.

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,640
Yan Qi.

164
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,240
Let me go.

165
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,130
I don't want to make a deal with you.

166
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,250
Give me the conditions.

167
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
What do you think?

168
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,180
I'll give you the conditions.

169
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
But since you're so inexperienced,

170
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,180
I'm afraid you can't do it.

171
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,560
No.

172
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,080
That’s right.

173
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,280
Yan Qi.

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,240
I don’t want to play with you anymore.

175
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
Before I leave,

176
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,320
Shen Huizhi is not as obedient as you think.

177
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,280
You know?

178
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,440
She's not sick at all.

179
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,560
It's none of your business.

180
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,640
Don't forget who you are.

181
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,740
I didn't expect

182
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,520
we worked well together.

183
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,120
Now those thoughtful people

184
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,380
know we've fallen out.

185
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
We'll fight each other then.

186
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,600
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

187
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,880
and turn Yan’s Mansion upside down.

188
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Stop pretending.

189
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
The eavesdroppers are gone.

190
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,640
I told you.

191
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,600
