1
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,360
Hey, Chairman.

2
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,600
You used to be so majestic.

3
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,320
Why are you so down now?

4
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,160
Bah!

5
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,000
He ignores us.

6
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,920
how can you be so arrogant?

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
Even if the heavenly king comes today,

8
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,200
you have to call us grandpa.

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,440
Who hit me?

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,680
I...

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,600
Move!

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,360
How dare you bully my man!

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Do you want to die?

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,200
Enough.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,370
Why are you here?

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,360
Dismiss.

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,090
Dismiss.

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,280
We're going to charge you later.

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,880
Let's go.

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,520
Why are you bullied?

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,340
Why didn't you fight back?

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,140
That's enough.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
You're protecting me.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
But I like you protecting me.

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,250
Let's go.

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,840
When did you make this?

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,800
I always have it.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,380
Let's go. Stand guard.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,280
Let's go there later.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,930
Chili stir-fried chili

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,880
Fried cabbage with cabbage.

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,160
Where is he?

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Thank you, madam.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,840
All right.

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,800
Stop it.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,930
Let's eat first.

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Then let me try.

38
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,840
These

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
were made by Chen.

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
This is my first time.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,240
Try it.

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,920
Sure.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,640
This looks good.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,040
Why does it taste weird?

45
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,810
Why don't you try it?

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,520
Not bad.

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,680
It's weird. Try it again.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,600
No.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,760
It's weird.

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,530
It's delicious.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,260
I never knew you were so tacky.

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,280
Madam.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,680
I said

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,540
With you by my side,

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,280
this simple meal is also a delicacy.

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,520
Besides,

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
Besides, if we share a pair of chopsticks,

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
makes me feel sweet.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,800
Yan Qiyuan, why are you so cheesy?

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,680
Is it?

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,320
But other couples are like this.

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Life is short.

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
There's no joy without you

64
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,680
Let's go.

65
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,640
All right.

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
You can't eat if you keep talking.

67
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,410
Let's eat first.

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,730
Now I think about it.

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
when you were with me,

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,960
you're just being wary

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,520
except fighting against each other.

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,250
I've never seen you so relaxed.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,440
Eat more.

74
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,200
Shu Yan.

75
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,560
Is this the life you want?

76
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,280
Madam.

77
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,280
It's late.

78
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,610
It hurts my eyes.

79
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,610
The light is dim.

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,840
I'll embroider it tomorrow.

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,700
I've thought about it these days.

82
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,200
there's no love token between us.

83
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,080
So,

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,020
I embroidered these two rabbits for you.

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,960
Shu Yan.

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,240
I will always keep it with me.

87
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,640
Just like taking you with me.

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,440
I will do my best

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,560
to give you

90
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,770
in the world.

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,640
I trust you.

92
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,160
Let me out!

93
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Let me out!

94
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,080
Shen Huizhi!

95
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,080
You bitch! Let me out!

96
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,240
Then I'll wait to be a fisherman.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll get the door.

98
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,410
Who is it?

99
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,740
Stop knocking.

100
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,700
Coming.

101
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,720
There seems to be bandits in the city.

102
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,560
Mr. Yan ordered

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,490
Order all the guards to gather now.

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,680
Why are you up?

105
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,760
I can't sleep.

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,160
What's wrong?

107
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,170
Nothing.

108
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,780
Alan, emergency call.

109
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Let me have a look.

110
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Soon.

111
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,400
What's wrong?

112
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,560
I don't know why.

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,730
I'm a little flustered.

114
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,840
Come back early. Be careful.

115
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,080
Got it, Mrs. Yan.

116
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,210
Don’t worry.

117
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,760
I haven’t found the answer Qi Qiu wants.

118
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,730
Wu Yinfang must be safe.

119
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,880
Madam.

120
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,720
Madam.

121
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,920
Madam.

122
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,090
Catch the murderer!

123
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,720
Mother!

124
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Mother, what's wrong?

125
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,380
Uncle Erbai

126
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,880
How did you know

127
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
how do you know that Madam is dead?

128
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,400
You killed my mother.

129
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,600
Shu Yan.

130
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,640
I know you don't like Old Madam.

131
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,220
But you can't kill her.

132
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,960
I didn't.

133
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,800
Catch her!

134
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,970
I have evidence.

135
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,200
It's a letter from Madam.

136
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm here to save someone.

137
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
I thought you wrote it yourself.

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,000
Get her!

139
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,760
Don't move.

140
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I'll kill her if you come any closer.

141
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,420
Don't move.

142
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,760
I didn't expect you to use human lives as a trap.

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
to use me.

144
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,840
Shu Yan.

145
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,920
The same method doesn't work every time.

146
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,840
If you go soft at the critical moment, you'll lose the whole game.

147
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
Take him away.

148
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,480
You two!

149
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,560
Let go of me!

150
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,040
Get lost!

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,800
You unfilial son!

152
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
You want to release the murderer who killed your grandma?

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
Shu Yan won't kill anyone.

154
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,000
Grandma's death has nothing to do with her.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,720
Uncle Erbai

156
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,520
Leave this to me.

157
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,440
I can help you.

158
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,640
I have evidence that my grandma committed suicide.

159
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,300
It's Grandma's handwriting.

160
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,720
What do you want?

161
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,440
I never do a losing business.

162
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,360
I can let Shu Yan go,

163
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,680
but you have to do me a favour.

164
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,040
As long as I can save Shu Yan,

165
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
I'm willing to do anything.

166
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,880
I want you to remove the guard at North Gate.

167
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,440
and recover tomorrow morning.

168
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,720
What are you planning?

169
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,440
You asked me to gather the army overnight

170
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,320
He asked me to remove the posts.

171
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,780
If you want Shu Yan to live,

172
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,320
do as I say.

173
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,360
Wait for me.

174
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,560
I want to see Shu Yan safe.

175
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,760
Alert!

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Hide.

177
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,920
Hurry up!

178
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,090
Beat him!

179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,480
You asked me to open the city gate

180
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
to lure the bandits into the city.

181
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,400
How can the people in the city protect themselves?

182
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,200
Are you crazy?

183
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,720
Wake up!

184
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,840
We're in the same boat now.

185
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,860
No one can make a clean choice.

186
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,800
If you have time,

187
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
you should kill more bandits

188
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,970
and save more lives.

189
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
You'll get all the credit.
