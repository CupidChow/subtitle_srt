1
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,930
Uncle Erbai is getting bolder.

2
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,480
It's just dark and you came to me.

3
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Madam asked me to see you.

4
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,519
How is your face?

5
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,160
Your face is much better.

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,930
Thank you for your concern.

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,720
Well,

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,380
I have something to show Uncle Erbai.

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,200
Is there anything else

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,850
I've never seen before.

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,240
This

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,250
is Uncle Erbai's account book.

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,720
I found it from Grandma.

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,200
I took it back

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,759
so I took it back.

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,759
Madam.

17
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,640
In this house,

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,160
in this family.

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,479
I know it in my heart.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,560
You haven't

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,300
this account book, right?

22
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,960
This is a serious matter.

23
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,320
I know what to do.

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Madam said

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,520
she's not satisfied with your recent performance.

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Let me

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,720
to knock on you.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
Who does she like?

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,120
Only her

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,200
who doesn't like her grandson.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,320
People like us who are on her side

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,040
She only sees us as dogs.

33
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,720
Madam is old.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,640
She can’t do anything well.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,800
You are the only one

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,760
is you.

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,760
I can give you

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,360
I can give you.

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,680
I can give you

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,810
I can also give it to you.

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,840
Uncle Erbai wants to punish me.

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Qi Qiu.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
What’s wrong?

44
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Nothing.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,960
Go to sleep.

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
The weather is changing.

47
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,240
Sleep.

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,440
How could you...

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,240
Report!

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,040
In Chang'an,

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,800
It's you.

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,680
Commander,

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,960
I got it.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,520
Why are you playing tricks now?

55
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,340
Why are you still here?

56
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,120
Don't you need to go to the Chamber of Commerce?

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,880
I want to take you out today.

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Go out?

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,460
Are you going on a date?

60
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
This is where you saved me back then.

61
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,400
In fact, over the past decade,

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,660
I've been looking for you.

63
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
Then why were you so stubborn?

64
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,250
You didn't admit it.

65
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,440
I've been looking for you

66
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,980
I've been looking for you,

67
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,040
But I couldn't help thinking

68
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,760
if I can meet you

69
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,380
after I solve the problem,

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,460
you wouldn't have been involved.

71
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,840
Because I know

72
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,720
if I admit

73
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,680
what I've been through

74
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,640
and what I face

75
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
will become your burden.

76
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,240
Shu Yan.

77
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,800
I don't want you to suffer because of me.

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,840
From now on,

79
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
Wherever you go,

80
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,810
wherever you go.

81
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,640
I'll be responsible for you.

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,440
I'll be yours from now on.

83
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,610
All these years,

84
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,040
I've been travelling around with Chen.

85
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,080
I've been living a life without a meal.

86
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm happy

87
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm very happy.

88
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,640
Really.

89
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,520
very happy.

90
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,960
Thank you, Qi Qiu.

91
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
Actually,

92
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,440
I have a surprise for you.

93
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
You want me to teach you how to shoot?

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,490
I also want to protect someone.

95
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,080
Chen is in a safe place.

96
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:47,890
Don't worry.

97
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,920
Chen is a very kind person.

98
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,159
He has been traveling for so many years.

99
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,890
he won't put himself in danger.

100
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,890
You are the most dangerous person now.

101
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
Everyone in the Yan family

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,320
wants to kill you.

103
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,620
Shen Huizhi didn't marry him.

104
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,180
She'll definitely do it somewhere else.

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,210
Take the gun.

106
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,560
Stretch your feet with your shoulders.

107
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,440
Suck in.

108
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,580
Put your elbow inside.

109
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Pull the gun fast.

110
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,960
Aim.

111
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,600
Shoot.

112
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
You have no intention to kill.

113
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,059
you can't kill anyone.

114
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
When you're in danger,

115
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,900
run away if you're scared.

116
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,560
One day,

117
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,000
I will become a cruel woman too.

118
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,920
Shu Yan.

119
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,460
No matter what happens in the future,

120
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,130
remember to leave the city.

121
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,840
I want you to think for yourself.

122
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,610
Understand?

123
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,040
Don't worry.

124
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,540
I will protect myself.

125
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,080
In the future,

126
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,040
I have to protect you.

127
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,880
I hope that day won't come.

128
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,720
Alan, what are you doing?

129
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,360
Last night, someone fled to the marshal’s mansion

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,120
to accuse Yan Qi Qiu of selling opium.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,560
The marshal asked me to catch the murderer.

132
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,800
What opium?

133
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,800
That was Shen Huizhi.

134
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,600
We have witnesses and evidence.

135
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,320
Take him away.

136
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
Don't cuff me.

137
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
I can walk myself.

138
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,360
Alan.

139
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,170
This has nothing to do with Shu Yan.

140
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,320
Yan Qi.

141
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,240
Don’t expect anyone to save you this time.

142
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,560
Judging from your tone,

143
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,920
Do you know I was wronged?

144
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,960
You forbid me to see the marshal,

145
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,250
and tortured without permission.

146
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,520
Alan.

147
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,120
Is this your trick?

148
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,320
The marshal was very angry

149
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,640
he was very angry.

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,040
I begged the marshal

151
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
to save your life.

152
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,280
You should thank me.

153
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Do you think you're still

154
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,200
the high-ranking chairman?

155
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,120
You're an opium addict.

156
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,240
A prisoner?

157
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,840
Tell me.

158
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,880
if a person's knees break,

159
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,480
can you stand up in this life?

160
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,320
You can try.

161
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,740
But I don't think you dare.

162
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,400
We don’t have enough evidence.

163
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,530
Even the marshal can’t torture him without permission.

164
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,920
And you

165
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,980
slandered me into prison,

166
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,760
but you only dare to hurt me.

167
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,360
Alan.

168
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
I feel wronged for you.

169
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Without the position of president,

170
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,520
Yan Qiyuan, how can you compete with me?

171
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,240
I still have the Yan family.

172
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,080
I think

173
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Not necessarily.

174
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,250
How dare you!

175
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,860
Who taught you to talk to me like that?

176
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,600
Guards!

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,360
Tie this bitch up!

178
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,920
How dare you!

179
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,780
What are you doing?

180
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,610
Shen Huizhi.

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,240
It's you.

182
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,200
You want to rebel?

183
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,280
Rebel?

184
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,600
I usually call you grandma.

185
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,880
Do you really take yourself seriously?

186
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,360
Bah!

187
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,960
Look, my son is here.

188
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,000
when my son comes.

189
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,280
Mother.

190
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
The source!

191
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Let her go!

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,240
Huizhi is right.

193
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,240
You

194
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,600
You're too old.

195
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,120
You should get some rest.

196
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,960
The source.

197
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,760
Are you stupid?

198
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,640
You slandered your mother

199
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,960
You slandered your mother.

200
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,320
Aren't you afraid of being struck by lightning?

201
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
The source?

202
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
It's too noisy.

203
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,840
Lock her up in her room.

204
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,980
Just give her some leftovers.

205
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
As long as you don't starve to death.

206
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,880
Shen Huizhi.

207
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,320
Shen Huizhi, you bitch!

208
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,680
You'll die a horrible death!

209
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,010
You can't listen to her.

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,080
You can't listen to her.

211
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,080
Let go!

212
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,200
Let go!

213
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
How dare you!
