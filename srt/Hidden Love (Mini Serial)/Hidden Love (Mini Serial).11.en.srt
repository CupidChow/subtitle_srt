1
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,650
This is inappropriate.

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,440
Stop looking.

3
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
It's disgraceful.

4
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,880
Unworthy.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Here it is.

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,400
It's here.

7
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,800
The birthmark on Ms Shu's shoulder...

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,000
is obviously born.

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,840
And Miss Shen's tattoo is nothing.

10
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,800
I know

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,280
of course.

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,039
Miss.

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,940
Young Lady.

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,720
Looks like Ms Shu is really...

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,120
I almost misunderstood.

16
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,000
When the Shen family was in trouble,

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,400
Huizhi was all alone.

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,400
Besides,

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,560
so many people saw her carry you back.

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,280
She saved your life.

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,400
You can marry Shu Yan,

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,080
but don't let Huizhi suffer.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,640
From now on,

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,160
Huizhi is the eldest daughter of the Yan family.

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,560
If you disagree,

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,120
I have to die to protect the dignity of the Yans.

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Qi Qiu,

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,900
We’ve been friends for generations.

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,200
How can she

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,660
live like this?

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
That's right.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,960
I agree.

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,680
As long as you

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,610
give me the key to Yan’s warehouse,

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,480
I agree.

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,920
Today,

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,880
two happy events.

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,400
In that case,

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,160
the Yans Chamber of Commerce

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,079
of Yan’s Chamber of Commerce.

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,120
Congratulations, Young Master.

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,680
Since the ceremony is done,

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,000
please be seated.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
The Yans will treat you well.

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,650
to express our apology.

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,560
Great!

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,200
Okay.

48
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,040
Who?

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,800
Madam.

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,320
Why do I have to hit you

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,840
whenever I want to get close to you?

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,320
Why are you so late?

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,920
I thought

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
you went to comfort Shen Huizhi.

55
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,440
Don't accuse me first.

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,040
You forced me to agree.

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
Shen Huizhi.

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,240
She is also a pitiful person.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,170
We can afford

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,480
we can afford it.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,040
Besides,

62
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,760
we’ve got the key to Yan’s warehouse

63
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,140
and the real power.

64
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,300
It was a fatal blow to the old lady.

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,050
Madam, you're so generous.

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,079
You have no idea

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,280
Shen Huizhi is under our nose.

68
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,360
No matter how much trouble she makes,

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,490
I can still hold her.

70
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,400
Besides,

71
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,570
we trust each other.

72
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,120
But why did the old lady propose

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,000
to let Shen Huizhi stay at Yan's?

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
You didn't say no.

75
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,680
My Lady.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,560
Young Master went to Shu Yan's room.

77
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280
I just wanted you to taste

78
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,940
the pain of losing your lover.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,120
Now it seems

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,960
this punishment is too light.

81
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,640
Tell me.

82
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,680
Why didn't you say no?

83
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,200
Since we're married now,

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,240
I have nothing to hide.

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
My men found out that

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,160
after my father died,

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,720
I've spent a lot every year.

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,960
So I think

89
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,050
the person who killed my father

90
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,600
who killed my father.

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,080
I need her

92
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
I still need her.

93
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,840
This is the last time you hide it from me.

94
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,440
Yan Qiyuan.

95
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,480
From now on,

96
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,880
you won't be alone and helpless.

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,360
You have me.

98
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,800
Compared to me,

99
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,840
Do you feel wronged?

100
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm your man now.

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,760
I won't feel wronged.

102
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,680
But you,

103
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,840
you've been living under Old Madam.

104
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,360
I can’t use my power.

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,280
You are the most capable person in Yan’s Mansion.

106
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,480
You shouldn’t be suppressed like this.

107
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,480
The source.

108
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,610
Call me Uncle Erbai.

109
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,960
Uncle Erbai.

110
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,740
Why are you in front of my room?

111
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,800
I stayed here all night.

112
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,370
I didn't expect my good brother

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,920
likes to listen to brother and sister-in-law.

114
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,640
You just met her before I did.

115
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,320
Then pray to meet her in your next life.

116
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,010
Don't think about it for the rest of your life.

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,240
Young Master, bad news!

118
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,640
The warehouse is on fire.

119
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,480
Hurry up.

120
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Come on.

121
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,160
Give me a hand.

122
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,680
Hurry up.

123
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,240
Okay.

124
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,180
Be careful.

125
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,799
Two people from the east house.

126
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,280
Coming.

127
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,440
Luckily I slept late.

128
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,890
I found there was a fire.

129
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,090
The fire was put out.

130
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,740
Everything is burnt down.

131
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,880
All these years,

132
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
It's always been on fire.

133
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,200
Why did it have to be on fire after I married Shu Yan?

134
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
You should ask your good wife.

135
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,200
Have you forgotten?

136
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,920
She's in charge now.

137
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,920
Why is there such a big fire?

138
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,960
How dare you ask?

139
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,720
It's because you didn't manage it well.

140
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,320
We are family.

141
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,980
If something happens,

142
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,680
you must give an explanation to the Yans.

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,960
Why are there so many?

144
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
It's all burnt by this fire.

145
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,280
Shu Yan,

146
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,800
It's not that I'm giving you a hard time.

147
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,280
If you are not ready to be in charge,

148
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,600
give me the key to the warehouse.

149
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,400
You can’t afford

150
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,760
such a big loss alone.

151
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,640
Grandma is right.

152
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,440
I can’t afford such a big loss.

153
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,210
It will also implicate the Yan family.

154
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
Luckily,

155
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,370
the things in the warehouse

156
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,400
has been moved by me.

157
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,250
What did you say?

158
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,160
I saw this old house hasn't been repaired for a long time.

159
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,760
I was worried it was not safe.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
So as soon as I got the key,

161
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,240
I moved everything inside.

162
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720
This old house

163
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,760
always goes wrong.

164
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
If it wasn't an accident,

165
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,260
people would think

166
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,160
they might think someone set the fire on purpose.

167
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,880
Madam.

168
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,240
We moved the fake.

169
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,760
Why didn't you get my permission

170
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,090
without my permission?

171
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,960
Madam.

172
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,120
Now the Yans

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,000
But I’m in charge.

174
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Where is the stuff in the warehouse?

175
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,920
Madam, calm down.

176
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,400
Shu Yan will definitely

177
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,360
in a place

178
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,480
where no one will find them.

179
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,240
Yan Qiyuan.

180
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Don’t go too far.

181
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,250
Although you're in charge now,

182
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,210
before you make this decision,

183
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,000
before making this decision?

184
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,640
Okay.

185
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,100
Since there's no loss,

186
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,200
we'll get going.

187
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,560
You're old.

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,080
You must be tired after staying up all night.

189
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,160
Go back and rest.

190
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,810
Let's go.

191
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,960
Useless!
