1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,800
Bow to heaven and earth.

2
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,120
Second bow to your parents.

3
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,240
Bow to each other.

4
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,360
Wait.

5
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,289
The ceremony is completed.

6
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,240
What's going on?

7
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,360
Shu Yan.

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,080
Why are you still alive?

9
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,760
Surprised?

10
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm still alive.

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,759
Let's work together.

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,680
How will you save my life?

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,240
She's trying so hard

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,300
to take your blood.

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
Why don't we just go along with the flow?

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,560
And you

17
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,920
can use Alan

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,080
with Yan Hongming.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,820
You're saying you're faking your death?

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,400
What medicine did you give me?

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,490
You have to act in full play.

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,140
Pretend to be dead.

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,340
What should we do next?

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,079
Your mission is completed.

25
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,840
You're free.

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,280
This time,

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,680
no one will take you back.

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Yan Qiyuan.

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
Let’s get married.

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
After this,

31
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,700
I’ll take half of Yan’s property.

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,000
Half is too little.

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,540
As long as I have it,

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,980
I'll give it to you.

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,680
Tao Zi.

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,180
Be careful, Miss Shen.

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,760
The dagger is sharp.

38
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Such a beautiful face is scratched.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,200
What a pity.

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,930
Don't worry.

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,480
As long as you behave,

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,520
I won't kill you.

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,040
Shu Yan.

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,530
What do you want?

45
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,040
Yan Qiyuan.

46
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,440
Thank you for raising and cultivating me.

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,760
Now that I'm married,

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,960
I’ll take charge of the Chamber of Commerce.

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
As for the key to Yan’s mansion,

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,280
will be kept by my wife.

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,000
You can enjoy

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
in peace.

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
What?

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,930
The key to the treasury is the blood of Yan family.

55
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,480
How can you hand it over?

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,640
That's right.

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,400
Besides,

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,740
this woman's background is unknown.

59
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,440
I heard she used to be a performer.

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,640
I guess you don't know me

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,200
don't know much about me.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,770
That's why I'm saying this.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,260
I'll introduce myself

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,200
to you.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,680
Let me introduce myself again.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,640
My surname is Shu Yan.

67
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
It's from Shu Mei, Zhan Yan.

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,880
from an innocent family.

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,440
I majored in art in the first 20 years.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,120
I wasn't rich,

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
but he's a cultured man.

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,520
Why can't I take charge of the Yan family?

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Here.

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,210
I finally found you.

75
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,880
When we get to the front hall,

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,140
you will bite to death.

77
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
You are the one who saved Yan Qiyuan.

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
Alan, are you alright?

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
The birthmark on her body and my tattoo.

80
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,159
Which one would you believe?

81
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,490
I saw it with my own eyes.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
The birthmark on her body is sometimes gone.

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,360
As long as she doesn't have it now,

84
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,760
you can't deny your savior's identity.

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
What if she has it?

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,040
The birthmark is on her shoulder.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,700
If she wants to prove herself,

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,980
she has to take off her clothes in public.

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Do you think

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,480
be the wife of Yan family?

91
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,640
Shu Yan is quite pitiful.

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm actually liked by someone like you.

93
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,440
In my heart,

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,930
she's already dead.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
Let's go. It's too late.

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,640
Hurry up.

97
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,440
I'll go get changed.

98
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,960
Wait.

99
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,580
Only in this way

100
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,200
to make you look pitiful.

101
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Grandma.

102
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,840
Help me!

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,280
Isn't this Ms. Shen Huizhi?

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
Why do you look like this?

105
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,980
Yeah, what's going on?

106
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,720
What happened?

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,680
Slow down.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,520
Grandma.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,360
Grandma, please help me.

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,560
Okay.

111
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,080
Madam.

112
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,290
The ceremony is completed.

113
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,160
It’s your turn to hand over the key to Yan’s Mansion.

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,120
Qi Qiu.

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,280
Young master.

116
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,880
Sir.

117
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
I was lucky to save your life.

118
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,200
It's my blessing.

119
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,920
But you promised you would marry me.

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,640
If you told me earlier,

121
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,760
you fell in love with Ms Shu,

122
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,560
I won't force you.

123
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,000
At worst,

124
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,740
I’ll build a Buddhist hall

125
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
in Yan Mansion

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
and live the rest of my life.

127
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,960
Shen Huizhi.

128
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,880
Stop lying.

129
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
I was the one who saved him back then.

130
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,159
Ms Shu.

131
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,020
How can you reverse the truth?

132
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
Grandma has seen

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,560
Grandma has seen it, right?

134
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,240
Let's wait for the women

135
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,840
before identifying.

136
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,200
Miss.

137
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,810
Miss Shen does have a bellflower on her shoulder.

138
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,940
It's your turn.

139
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,840
But what if

140
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,000
want to see my orange flower?

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,860
I can't guarantee it will appear.

142
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
It's okay.

143
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,360
I can...

144
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,490
Ms Shu doesn't have it on her shoulder.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,679
Really?

146
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,919
Let me see.
