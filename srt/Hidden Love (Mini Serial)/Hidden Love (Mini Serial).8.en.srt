1
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,480
I have a business friend in the provincial city.

2
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,680
We can go to him first.

3
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,520
Thank you for helping me.

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
There's no need to thank me.

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,320
You're so nice.

6
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,010
Unlike Shen Huizhi,

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,320
always target me.

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,640
I haven't figured out a way

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,900
to take revenge on her.

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,570
There will be a chance sooner or later.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,690
Shen Huizhi is in collusion with the old lady.

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,039
The Yan family is under the control of the old lady.

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,610
I’m afraid there won’t be another chance.

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,050
Grandma did take good care of Shen Huizhi.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,480
Yan Qiyuan is moody.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,880
It’s normal for her to find a backer.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,440
What about your father?

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
All these years,

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,080
by the old lady for so many years.

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,210
I'm willing to be degraded all day.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:35,970
Degenerate?

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,280
Who doesn't want to be carefree every day?

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,960
I think

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,979
he is the most comfortable person in the Yan family.

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
You are right.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,920
There is only one bad guy in the Yan family.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,039
That’s Yan Qiyuan.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,360
I was worried about you.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,800
Now that I think about it,

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,000
I thought too much.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,759
I thought

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,580
you would ask me about Yan Qiyuan.

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,560
Bah!

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,560
I can't wait to kill him.

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,840
He

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,320
lost his mother since young.

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,850
My uncle passed away early.

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,330
I feel sorry for him.

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,060
But this is not the reason he hurt others.

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,800
How did his father die?

41
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,380
I heard the bandits intercepted him.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,840
I was young back then.

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
I can't remember.

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,760
Don't think about it.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,660
We're leaving.

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
The train is about to leave.

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,120
Let's go.

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,640
Come on.

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,900
Get on the train

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,380
we will have a new life.

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,900
Yan Qiyuan.

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,400
Yan Qi.

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Alan.

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,920
You hurt my people again and again.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,650
Do you think I dare not kill you?

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,560
Come on!

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,480
Kill me!

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,380
She knows everything.

59
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,050
You can’t pretend anymore.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,200
Yan Qi.

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,250
I asked Alan to take me away.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,880
It has nothing to do with him.

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,520
What a loving couple!

64
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,900
But I like beating up the mandarin ducks.

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,160
Yan Qiyuan.

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,280
Since you've chosen Shen Huizhi,

67
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,680
you should let Shu Yan go.

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,440
Here.

69
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,480
Enough.

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Take him away.

71
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,680
Yes.

72
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,080
Let go!

73
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,579
Yan Qiyuan, you...

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,200
Eldest Young Master! Eldest Young Master!

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Put me down!

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,560
Yan Qiyuan, are you crazy?

77
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,360
I promise to cooperate with you

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,690
not to let you hurt Alan.

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,800
You might as well kill me too.

80
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,080
I'm crazy.

81
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
I can be more crazy.

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,960
Yan Qiyuan.

83
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,960
I’ll take the responsibility.

84
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Let Alan go.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,400
Kill me if you want.

86
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,920
You were most afraid of death.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,040
Today, for Alan,

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,760
for Yan Hongming.

89
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,600
Alan.

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,320
is the only person

91
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
who truly loves me.

92
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Sincere?

93
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,460
Do you know what sincerity is?

94
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,240
Someone like you

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,480
who has never treated anyone sincerely.

96
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,610
Of course you don't.

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,810
I'll bet with you for the last time.

98
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,680
I'll show you what sincerity is.

99
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:34,680
Okay.

100
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,159
If I win,

101
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,880
let me and Alan go.

102
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
If I lose,

103
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,640
I'll give my life to you.

104
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,120
to show your loyalty.

105
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,320
Young Master.

106
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,240
Today, in front of our ancestors,

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,260
in front of our ancestors.

108
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,570
What’s the crime of kidnapping your brother’s wife?

109
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,100
Yan Qiyuan.

110
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
You don’t love her at all.

111
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Why are you keeping her by your side?

112
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,680
She's just a toy to you.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
But to me...

114
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,240
She's your sister-in-law.

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Even if she's my toy,

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,490
doesn't deserve your fingers.

117
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,120
She belongs to you.

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,680
As long as it's yours,

119
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,760
whatever it belongs to you.

120
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,890
including the Yans.

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,520
Did you hear that?

122
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
When did she come?

123
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,880
I was always here.

124
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,960
You set me up.

125
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
You said it yourself.

126
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,660
I didn't force you.

127
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,440
Shu Yan.

128
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,880
Shu Yan.

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,520
Liar!

130
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,680
You are all liars.

131
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,920
No, it's not like that, Shu Yan.

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,450
Shu Yan, it's not like that.

133
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,100
Did you see it clearly?

134
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,240
This is the sincerity you want.

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,000
Shu Yan.

136
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,370
Don't listen to him.

137
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,240
Shu Yan.

138
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,280
Let them be.

139
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,480
The more fierce they are,

140
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
the more interesting the play is.

141
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,280
I can't walk out anymore.

142
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,880
Take this back.

143
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,200
You lost.

144
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,880
My life is yours.

145
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
Take it.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Yan Qi.

147
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,240
Yan Qi.

148
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,900
You’ll regret if you kill her.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,960
Yan Qi.

150
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,000
Shu Yan.

151
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,920
Shu Yan.

152
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,600
You want her to die without peace?

153
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,080
Yan Qiyuan.

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,460
You’d better kill her.

155
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,440
or kill her?

156
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,880
Yes.

157
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,620
Just like your father,

158
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,440
will die in their hands sooner or later.

159
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,320
sooner or later.

160
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,960
Shu Yan.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,680
Shu Yan.

162
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,960
Shu Yan.

163
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,440
Yan Qi.

164
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,840
I’m waiting for the day you die.

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,320
Yan Qiyuan.

166
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
Mother.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,600
Ming'er.

168
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Mother!

169
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,520
My son!

170
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,400
Let go of me! Mother!

171
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Son!

172
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
Son.

173
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,180
Are you here to laugh at me too?

174
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,810
The situation is still uncertain.

175
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
Young Master, don't give up.

176
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,320
If you hadn't asked for the heart blood,

177
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,850
Shu Yan wouldn't have died.

178
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,400
What is your purpose?

179
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,660
It doesn't matter what my purpose is.

180
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
What matters is

181
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,240
we have a common enemy.
