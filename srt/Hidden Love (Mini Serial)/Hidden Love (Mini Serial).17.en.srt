1
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,640
Alan.

2
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,360
Shu Yan.

3
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,000
Shu Yan.

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,260
Shu Yan, do you love me?

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,560
I love you.

6
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,440
I love you.

7
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,280
I love you.

8
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,880
Qi Qiu.

9
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,039
Shu Yan.

10
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,120
Shu Yan.

11
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,440
He finally left.

12
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,079
Alan.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,000
Alan.

14
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,360
Alan.

15
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Luckily I took the antidote in advance.

16
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,690
I gave you three times the sleeping potion this time.

17
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,120
I won’t kill you.

18
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,220
Commander.

19
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,600
Although Yan Qi is shameless,

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,560
he has been running the Chamber of Commerce for years.

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
He has contributed a lot.

22
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,400
Please show mercy.

23
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,720
What do you want to do?

24
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Yan Qi has always been arrogant.

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Why don’t you send him to guard the city gate?

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,600
The former chairman fell into the mortal world

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,130
is more painful than death.

28
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,920
Go ahead.

29
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,520
Looks like you already guessed the result.

30
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
She really listens to me.

31
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,920
She smells good.

32
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,120
But saving you

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,480
is not worth it.

34
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
Since I promised Shu Yan to let you go,

35
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
you should cherish it.

36
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
the opportunity

37
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,400
to live.

38
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,240
Yan Qi.

39
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
You can’t leave.

40
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,740
You want to divorce your wife?

41
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,800
Who do you think you are

42
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,880
to stay by my side?

43
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Your wife suffered a lot to save you.

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,520
You love her too.

45
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,240
Why won't you tell her

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,400
your real plan?

47
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,840
I owe her too much.

48
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,000
In this battle,

49
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,370
we have a low chance of winning.

50
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,560
I don't want her to get involved.

51
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,680
But Her Ladyship is already in love.

52
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,290
Tell Uncle Liang

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,180
Let's proceed as planned.

54
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,040
Shu Yan.

55
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,520
Shu Yan.

56
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,360
Shu Yan.

57
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,320
Young Master.

58
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,170
Her Ladyship didn't come back.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,920
She has no family in the city.

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,200
Money, go find her as soon as possible.

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,800
Send her to the villa in the city.

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,320
Yes.

63
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,600
Wait.

64
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Don't say I did it.

65
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,360
What a loving couple!

66
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,760
You’re the one behind it.

67
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,840
Qi Qiu.

68
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,080
How can you think of me like that?

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,530
You know I love you the most.

70
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,000
I was the hostess of this room.

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
It's all because of that bitch Shu Yan.

72
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Stop pretending.

73
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,440
It was you who tied her into the mansion.

74
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,170
Why are you crying for help now?

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
Guess

76
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,200
who will find her first?

77
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,400
Shen Huizhi.

78
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,640
Money.

79
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,280
We must find Shu Yan

80
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,480
before Shen Huizhi does.

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,880
Yes, I'll be right there.

82
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,960
Wait.

83
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,300
This is my private residence.

84
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,180
You can live here in peace.

85
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
and drive me away.

86
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,560
You want to protect me in secret again?

87
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,490
Yan Qiqiu, are you contradictory?

88
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,410
Nothing happened between me and Alan.

89
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,440
Yan Qiyuan.

90
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,840
You are mine

91
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,920
and my whole life.

92
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,000
I trust you.

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,760
But Shu Yan,

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,690
I'm telling you.

95
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,720
I divorce my wife because I don't want you

96
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,159
get involved in this mess.

97
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,960
I don't want you to get involved.

98
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,120
That's why I said it's unfair.

99
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Why do you want to divorce me?

100
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,170
I haven't said that yet.

101
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,200
Let go of me!

102
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,960
Yan Qi.

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
I won’t let you go.

104
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,360
You are mine

105
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,720
and my whole life.

106
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,880
Shu Yan.

107
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,080
Shu Yan.

108
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,520
I love you.

109
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
I love you too.

110
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
You always look indifferent.

111
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,490
You're so annoying.

112
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,680
See?

113
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,080
You can't defeat him alone.

114
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
He's already a loser.

115
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
And I got what I wanted.

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
Are you talking about Shu Yan?

117
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,680
Don't you know you were drugged yesterday?

118
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,850
It's none of your business.

119
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
So you know.

120
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,160
Should I call you a romantic

121
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
or stupid?

122
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,560
People like you won't understand.

123
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,560
It seems

124
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,720
you really like Shu Yan.

125
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,050
Then you should cooperate with me.

126
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,160
Kill Yan Qi Qiu.

127
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
You get what you want,

128
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,440
I get what I want.

129
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,170
I want to kill Yan Qi Qiu.

130
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
But it has nothing to do with Shu Yan.

131
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,080
Shu Yan doesn't belong to anyone.

132
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,360
She only belongs to herself.

133
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,420
It doesn't matter.

134
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,620
The result is the same anyway.

135
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,300
I'll take that as a yes.

136
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,360
So many people like Shu Yan.

137
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,200
I envy you

138
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm so envious.

139
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,680
I want her to die.

140
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,360
If you want to die,

141
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
you can try.

142
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
Luckily, it was just a dream.
