1
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,080
Yan Qi, you bastard!

2
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,820
How dare you poison me!

3
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Young Master.

4
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,920
Aren't you going to tell her the truth?

5
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,650
if you don't tell her the truth?

6
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,320
The less she knows, the better.

7
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,240
Chairman Yan,

8
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,480
Someone sued you for raping a girl on the street.

9
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,760
Under the order of the marshal,

10
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,640
come with us.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,440
Go.

12
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,000
Help!

13
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,680
Chairman Yan kidnapped a woman.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,400
Help!

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,280
Chairman Yan kidnapped a woman.

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
Chairman Yan raped a woman.

17
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,020
Who told you to do that?

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,640
Yes.

19
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,960
It's Madam.

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,480
Madam.

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,720
Be gentle.

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,760
Be gentle.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,400
Chairman Yan,

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,220
What kind of woman do you want?

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
but you have to rob a woman in public.

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,760
You are so devoted to the Chamber of Commerce.

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
As the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,280
you've disappointed the marshal.

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,400
I didn’t do it.

30
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,880
Qi Qiu,

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
The news has spread.

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
Just admit it.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,960
Pass the chairman to your brother

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,220
to save face for the Chamber of Commerce.

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,480
Be gentle.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Commander, someone broke into the Security Command.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,560
Who are you?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,480
What are you doing?

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,540
Commander.

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,720
My marriage with Yan Qiyuan

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,520
is known to all at Madam’s birthday banquet.

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,240
Yan Qi Qiu didn’t kidnap a woman.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,500
Everyone can testify.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,640
Someone must have set him up.

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,400
Get him out!

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,340
Commander.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,840
Everyone saw

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,000
Everyone saw it

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,440
The people know

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,160
Yan Qiyuan didn’t kidnap me.

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,720
If you don’t let him go,

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,200
people will say you abused your power

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,930
and disregard human lives.

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,010
Are you threatening me?

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
Commander, you are a high-ranking man.

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,060
you can tell right from wrong.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,760
Let him go.

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,579
Commander.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,240
You caught him, so you should release him.

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,300
to convince the Chamber of Commerce.

61
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,160
Yan Qiyuan.

62
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Who is this?

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,720
Where did this crazy woman come from?

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,360
How dare you delay the execution?

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,490
The marshal is here!

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,300
Commander.

67
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,000
It’s my fault.

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,200
Don’t worry.

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Just spare my life.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
We don’t dare to complain.

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,160
Let him go.

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,620
Chairman Eom, sorry for the trouble.

73
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,380
It’s a misunderstanding.

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,360
Untie Chairman Eom.

75
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,400
Here.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Let’s go.

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
Qi Qiu is fine.

78
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,000
Didn’t you hear what the marshal said?

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,860
What are you looking at? Dismiss!

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,580
Let him go back to his room.

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Young Master.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,860
What are you looking at? Dismiss!

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
You can leave now.

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,480
The person who came to catch me said it was sent by Madam.

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,810
and wanted to blame you.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
But I smelled

87
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,080
on them.

88
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,080
I think

89
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,880
someone else is behind them.

90
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,960
Yan Qiyuan.

91
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,640
Do you think pushing me away is protecting me?

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,800
Even our troupe

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,360
even our theater will quit.

94
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800
I let you go

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,640
because you're useless.

96
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,980
Don't overestimate yourself, okay?

97
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,600
Get out.

98
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,880
It hurts.

99
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,240
Hang in there.

100
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,800
Miss.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
The chairman is injured.

102
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
Shu Yan is in his room.

103
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,760
They...

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
This is just a warning.

105
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,880
But they...

106
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,960
Tao Zi.

107
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,860
I suddenly feel a little uncomfortable.

108
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Please invite the chairman to my place.

109
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,490
The wound is almost healed.

110
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,960
But you have to be careful not to get wet.

111
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,520
You’ll be rewarded if you keep looking.

112
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,490
You can’t stay at Yan’s.

113
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,700
Why are you protecting me?

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,530
Am I not the guide you found?

115
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,440
Eldest Young Master.

116
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
Eldest Young Master.

117
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,600
Miss heard you were injured.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,930
She got agitated and had a relapse.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
Please go and see her.

120
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Ask her to get the physician.

121
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,320
I've already persuaded her.

122
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,680
She has to marry you.

123
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
She was almost carried to see you.

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,320
Isn't your lady

125
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,600
cares about Eldest Young Master the most?

126
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,530
He's already...

127
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,400
Yan Qi.

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,880
You need to rest now.

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
Qi Qiu.

130
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,410
You’re here.

131
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,800
What's wrong?

132
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,919
I miss you so much.

133
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
Qi Qiu, what’s wrong?

134
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,240
Let me see.

135
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:39,960
I'm fine.

136
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,690
It's just a scratch.

137
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,200
Which doctor bandaged you?

138
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,520
It's so rough.

139
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
You called me here

140
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,600
Did they bully you?

141
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,680
Madam didn't bully me.

142
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm just not feeling well.

143
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,280
What’s wrong?

144
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,080
Qi Qiu.

145
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,970
I want to watch the show.

146
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,210
I'll invite a magician to my residence tomorrow.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Don't bother.

148
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,640
Don't we have one at home?

149
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm tired of

150
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
I'm sick of it too.

151
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
Magic is childish,

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
but it's fresh and interesting.

153
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,760
Money, bring him here.

154
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,020
Yes, Young Master.

155
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,440
I heard from them that

156
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,500
you and Shu Yan pretended to act real.

157
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,800
But I know

158
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,880
you have me in your heart.

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
It's just a show.

160
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
Why do you take it seriously?

161
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,330
Young Madam.

162
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,220
Young Master wants you to go to Miss Shen's room.

163
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,480
To Shen Huizhi's room.

164
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,600
Yes.

165
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
If you're ready,

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,920
you can start.

167
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,280
Start what?

168
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,520
Start your performance.

169
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,170
I'm in a good mood today.

170
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,410
I'll play an interesting show for you.

171
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,880
Miss Shen,

172
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Your makeup looks nice today.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,920
But...

174
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,440
I don't look well.

175
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Do you want to fix my makeup?
