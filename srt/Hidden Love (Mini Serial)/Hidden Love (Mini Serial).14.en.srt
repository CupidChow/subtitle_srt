1
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,880
Everyone.

2
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,760
what I said just now

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,320
was told by Miss Shen.

4
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,959
Nothing is true.

5
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,680
Girl.

6
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,920
I didn’t expect you

7
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,280
in Yan Mansion.

8
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,730
What did you say?

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,800
I brought Shu Yan up.

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
She's a good girl.

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,080
She's brave and kind.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,760
She's definitely not a bad girl.

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,600
I said that

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,740
because you forced me to say that.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,260
You're slandering me!

16
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,080
I see.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,360
Are you also Shu Yan's guest?

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,400
That's why I'm defending her.

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,080
Sir.

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
You're my guest, right?

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
This is the money you bribed me.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,120
I’m the leader of the troupe.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,520
She just became Mrs. Yan.

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
No one would have so much money.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
Leader Chen.

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,160
As long as you do as we say,

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
I can not only let you go,

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,600
but also give you an endless luxury.

29
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,600
This is the wife

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,560
who has no real power

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,120
can’t give you.

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,560
is Yan’s private bank.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
Yes.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,000
Bastard!

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,079
You've disgraced the Yan family.

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,880
Grandma.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,730
There must be some misunderstanding.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,079
Even if I’m expelled,

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,800
It’s your fault.

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
I did all these.

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,060
It has nothing to do with Miss.

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
It's Shu Yan.

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,520
She's a bitch.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
She stole the title of our Lady.

45
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,200
I must make her pay.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,520
Tao Zi, you...

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,200
My lady.

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,840
I don't want you to be depressed all day.

49
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,740
You like Young Master so much.

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,600
Guards!

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,360
Take this bitch away and whip her 50 times.

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,720
and expel her.

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,080
Madam.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,160
Madam, let's go.

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,680
Miss.

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,520
Miss!

57
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Miss.

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,500
Are you satisfied now?

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,480
You two are really connected.

60
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,960
You taught me well.

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,090
You're welcome.

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,680
All right.

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,880
It's all the servants who are ignorant.

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,280
Don't affect your mood.

65
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,800
Go on.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,680
What's wrong?

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,410
Young Master

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,960
This is the list of the military supply of the medicine.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,690
Young Master

70
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,840
What is it?

71
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,720
Something is wrong with our transport.

72
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,080
The City Defense Department

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,640
He's been holding it back.

74
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
They're making things difficult for us, aren't they?

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,450
It's because the higher-ups replaced the second young master.

76
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,160
The water transport has changed.

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,820
Let's see who dares to stop us.

78
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
But our men...

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280
Shen Huizhi.

80
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,159
You'd better behave yourself.

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,280
Shen Huizhi, this name sounds familiar.

82
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
It sounds familiar.

83
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,680
Sir,

84
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,250
This is Yan’s family feast.

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,530
I didn’t invite you.

86
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
Please go this way.

87
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,540
I have something to do.

88
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,560
Mr. Chen is my guest.

89
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Without my order,

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,520
without my order.

91
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,340
Take Mr. Chen to the chairman.

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,160
Tell the chairman to protect him.

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,040
Yes, ma'am.

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,720
Go.

95
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,200
Please.

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,320
The lady's surname is Shen.

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,440
Shen Huizhi.

98
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,040
Yes.

99
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Miss Shen’s family and Yans have been friends for generations.

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,740
She lived in Yan’s Mansion since she was a child.

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,200
Okay.

102
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,690
Let's go.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Sit tight.

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,450
Let's go.

105
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,440
There's nothing good about my granddaughter-in-law.

106
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,840
She's just talented.

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,000
Otherwise,

108
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,040
how can you make Qi Qiu so happy?

109
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,280
Why don’t we let her sing

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,480
and cheer everyone up?

111
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,440
Great!

112
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Who humiliated the Yans?

113
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,480
Today is a banquet.

114
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,840
As the hostess,

115
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,960
to liven up the atmosphere for my friends.

116
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,290
That's what I should do.

117
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
I don't think

118
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
to dress like this.

119
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
It's okay.

120
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Go get changed.

121
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,200
We'll just wait.

122
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,400
That's great.

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,880
Please wait for a moment.

124
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,920
Okay.

125
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,760
Shu Yan sent me here

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,460
That means she trusts you.

127
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,560
You must save Shu Yan.

128
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,050
What do you mean?

129
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:11,900
Shen...

130
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Something is wrong with Miss Shen.

131
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,600
She said

132
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
Shu Yan went to Yan Mansion to live a good life.

133
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,640
I wanted to visit her a few days ago.

134
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
They tied me up

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,560
and locked me up.

136
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,880
I pretended to be afraid of death

137
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,400
so I blocked

138
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,200
the dirty water on Shu Yan today.

139
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,020
And they...

140
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,820
Who are you?

141
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
What do you want?

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
I don’t know how you feel,

143
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,840
that made Yan Qi Qiu lose his mind.

144
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
Shu Yan hasn't come back yet.

145
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,400
Is something wrong?

146
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,000
Why don't I take a look?

147
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,520
If you go alone,

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,840
if you go alone.

149
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,840
Thank you

150
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,420
come with me to see if Yan Yan has changed.

151
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,040
We have to invite him to get changed.

152
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,440
Yeah.

153
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,800
Be gentle.

154
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
You hurt me.

155
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,480
Shu Yan.

156
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,800
You are the wife of Yan family.

157
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,930
How can you have an affair with others?

158
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,580
I'll help my wife get changed.

159
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,980
Is there a problem?

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why are you here?

161
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,360
What else?

162
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
Who do you think he is?

163
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,800
It's the fun of a couple.

164
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,080
It's too inappropriate for us to be here.

165
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,760
Let's go.

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,120
Let's go.

167
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,200
It seems that you took good care of Shu Yan

168
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,160
you took good care of Shu Yan.

169
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,760
Who are you?

170
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
Why didn't you send someone

171
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,890
why didn't you send someone to find me?

172
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,180
Is this how you protect yourself?

173
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,330
I have a backup plan for myself.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,960
You just didn't give me a chance.

175
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,280
Are you still denying it?

176
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Yan Qiyuan.

177
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,240
You are really old.

178
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,840
Why are you so out of breath after two steps?

179
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,400
I can breathe more.

180
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,010
Help me get changed.

181
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,240
She can't just fool me.

182
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,820
I want to play with her too.

183
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,920
You just let her go?

184
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,810
Don't worry.

185
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,060
Someone wants to teach her a lesson more than me.

186
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,840
I'll go downstairs with you.

187
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,280
What's wrong?

188
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,080
I can't hide behind you forever.

189
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,640
I’m Mrs. Yan now.

190
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,720
I will stand by your side.

191
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,680
Okay.

192
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,040
Mrs. Yan.

193
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,010
Let’s go.

194
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,800
Wait.

195
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,250
Let's go.

196
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,720
Look.

197
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
So pretty.

198
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,580
They look great together.

199
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,800
Mrs. Yan is so beautiful.

200
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,440
Yes.

201
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
So beautiful.

202
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,370
Let's go.

203
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,800
You little bitch made the decision on your own.

204
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,530
If it weren't for me,

205
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,010
if it weren't for me.

206
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,320
Grandma arranged well.

207
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,480
Your attitude

208
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,960
I don't like it.

209
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,800
You old hag.

210
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,160
How dare you put me under house arrest?
