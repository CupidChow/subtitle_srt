1
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,420
What are you doing?

2
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,810
I said what are you doing?

3
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,480
Why are you looking at my yearbook?

4
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,450
Do you know him?

5
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,120
What's wrong?

6
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,240
Was he a friend?

7
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,500
Why do you ask?

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,370
Taejoon Han, right?

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He died a long time ago, okay?

10
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,300
Is it because of you?

11
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,130
The reason why he’s dead

12
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,890
Are you crazy?

13
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,550
What’s the relationship with you and him?

14
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,220
I’m asking

15
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,060
That's enough

16
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:56,320
Why do you have his score?

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,950
Please be honest

18
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,010
I'll never forget the first time I saw him

19
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,470
It’s not just about the skills but,

20
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,770
he seemed free

21
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,820
Like someone who exists only for the moment

22
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,820
After getting to know him a bit, I realized that

23
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,750
Except that playing a piano, he always seemed kind of depressed

24
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:54,380
I just wanted to make him smile

25
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,880
Because I liked it

26
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,180
I like it when he smiles

27
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,100
I've never felt that way before

28
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,190
It was hard to resist...

29
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,650
Like a strong attraction

30
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,700
I felt this feeling is dangerous, but

31
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,079
I was hoping that he didn't know

32
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,630
Nice, did you write that?

33
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,300
Yeah, for a gift

34
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,760
For me?

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,350
For my little brother

36
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,940
Then you have to give it a title, and a score

37
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,900
Why would i? I’m going to play it in a different ways every time

38
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,530
Play it again, I'll write it for you

39
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,540
There you go

40
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,630
Here

41
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:20,709
You name the title

42
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,070
Jazz for Two

43
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,120
For my little brother

44
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,080
And for you

45
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,710
Eventually, that moment has came

46
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:04,840
He thought of me as more than a friend

47
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,470
And I was afraid

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,730
Not only my feeling and also Taejoon’s

49
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,230
Before I can’t turn it back

50
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,730
I choose

51
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,360
Why do you ignore me?

52
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,940
Ignore you?

53
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,030
I thought you’re busy with the entrance exam

54
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,320
You don’t meet me anymore

55
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,280
Let's stop here

56
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,700
I like you

57
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,370
There are many people, what are you doing?

58
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,380
You don’t like me?

59
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,210
I'm not that kind of person

60
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,760
What is that kind of a person?

61
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,720
I’m not into guys

62
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,300
So why did you do it then?

63
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, stop it, it's creepy

64
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,480
I'll wait until you decide your mind

65
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,030
What are you waiting for? I'm so embarrassed

66
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,240
Are you embarrassed of me?

67
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,200
Stop it, please

68
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,910
You need to do your task, now

69
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,750
Sejin...

70
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,540
Don't even call my name

71
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,540
Because it's disgusting

72
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,590
I couldn’t hold his hand

73
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,300
We were on the edge of a cliff

74
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,680
I choose my future at the end

75
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,480
And he decided to stay in the past

76
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,070
Hey

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,450
Why are you so moody, Taeyi?

78
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,120
Tell me

79
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,000
That was your only option?

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Did you even think about me being left alone?

81
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,840
How did you not even give me a chance to help it

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,600
Did you really have to do it?

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,230
Sorry

84
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,650
For being such a weak brother

85
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,650
I knew it all

86
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,740
I knew that you had been sick for a long time

87
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,159
That you're not happy

88
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,740
But I was always blaming you and...

89
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,750
Taeyi

90
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,710
Huh?

91
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,000
Just let it go now

92
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,050
I can't

93
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,550
Just let me go

94
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,510
Hey

95
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,560
Now... There's someone who is more important

96
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,730
Wake up... before it's too late

97
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,380
Hello?

98
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,260
Why didn’t you pick up your phone?

99
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,799
There’s something happened

100
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,299
Why?

101
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,640
Uh? Uh! Hey, wait a minute

102
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,390
You can't through this away! I'm using it

103
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,640
What's going on?

104
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Our piano room is being demolished

105
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,730
Somebody is putting everything away right now

106
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,690
What about Seheon?

107
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,190
I don't know, he is not school yet

108
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,240
Hey, i said i’m using it!

109
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,820
You can't take it

110
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm on my way

111
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,800
Why do you come this late?

112
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,070
What's going on?

113
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,110
They took it all...

114
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,860
Is Seheon here?

115
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,160
No... He even turned off his phone

116
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,910
He's gonna be so disappointed when he finds out

117
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,880
A piano room?

118
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,420
Yes

119
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,300
The piano room in the annex building

120
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,470
Now that we're going to remodel into the choir room, why?

121
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,340
No way

122
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,810
We were using it...

123
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,560
Teacher,

124
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
Where’s Seheon?

125
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,770
Seheon Yoon?

126
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,890
Seheon Yoon?

127
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,690
Yes, can you contact him?

128
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,360
I've contacted with his family

129
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,240
They said he had something and couldn't make it today

130
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,650
Why?

131
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,490
I don’t know

132
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,280
They didn’t tell me the reason

133
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,330
Can I ask Seheon's house?

134
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,920
Are you going to visit him?

135
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,080
Yes

136
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,520
Who’s this?

137
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,690
I’m Seheon’s friend

138
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,270
Wait a minute

139
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,630
Thank you

140
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,300
Are you Seheon’s friend?

141
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,560
Yeah

142
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,350
What's up

143
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,650
Seheon didn't come to school today

144
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,150
His phone is off the whole time...

145
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,570
He went out for a minute

146
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,200
Have we met before, right?

147
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,580
Have we?

148
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,410
In front of the classroom, when I went to school for Seheon

149
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,210
Taeyi

150
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,340
You must have been a friend that he relied on a lot

151
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,220
if he even come to your house

152
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,220
Is something wrong with Seheon?

153
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,760
Is he sick?

154
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,470
No he’s not sick but,

155
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,560
I don't know

156
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,520
Thank you for the tea

157
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,270
I have to go now

158
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,230
But you’ve come this far, meet Seheon

159
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,400
I’m good

160
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,490
Tell Seheon that I was here

161
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,620
What's your name?

162
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,200
Taeyi Han

163
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,670
Taeyi Han?

164
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,080
Then you’re...

165
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,880
What are you doing here?

166
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,050
Hey

167
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,140
Why aren't you answering your phone!

168
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,480
How did you get here?

169
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,310
I ask teacher

170
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,810
Let's go outside

171
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,370
What were you talking about with my brother?

172
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,410
Are you okay?

173
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,370
Why aren't you coming to school..

174
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,160
What were you talking about with my brother?

175
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,460
I didn't say anything

176
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,790
What's wrong with you?

177
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,630
Why did you come to my place without asking?

178
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,170
Can’t I?

179
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,470
Taeyi Han

180
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,720
Let’s break up

181
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,270
What?

182
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,560
I'm going to study at home again

183
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,650
I already decided with my dad, too

184
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,230
I thought it would be good for a lot of reasons

185
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,030
What are you talking about?

186
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,990
Why are you doing this?

187
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,160
I can't do this anymore

188
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,950
Do this with you

189
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,080
Hey, Seheon

190
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,040
I can’t stand anymore

191
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,420
Look at me

192
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,960
Why can't you see me?

193
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,920
Go back

194
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,840
Give me a reason

195
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,220
I can’t

196
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,850
What did I do wrong?

197
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,760
You didn’t do anything wrong

198
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,060
Then what’s wrong with you?

199
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,150
Now you’re saying there was nothing between us?

200
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,980
You have to explain it!

201
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,440
I just don’t like you!

202
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,570
Is that all?

203
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,070
Yeah

204
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,490
That's it, so don't come back

205
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,870
Hey, Seheon

206
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,910
Goodbye

207
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,580
Hey

208
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,000
Are you kidding me? You can’t do this to me

209
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,090
Are we really breaking up?

210
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,510
I've made up my mind

211
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,510
Our relationship is nonsense anyway

212
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,080
Is Taeyi brother of Taejoon?

213
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,130
I don’t know

214
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,130
Is that why you asked me?

215
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,800
I told you I don't know!

216
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,180
Seheon

217
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,250
Yes, uncle

218
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,260
Taeyi

219
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,380
Can you come to the bar for a minute?

220
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,220
Now? What's going on?

221
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,560
Seheon’s brother is here

222
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,890
He wants to talk to you

223
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,700
After Taejoon is gone,

224
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,160
Taeyi struggled a lot, too

225
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,430
Well,

226
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,190
He has something to tell you

227
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,020
Have a conversation with him

228
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:26,040
I had no idea at all

229
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,590
That you were Taejoon's brother

230
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,670
I should have come here sooner

231
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,760
Do you know my brother?

232
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,320
It’s....

233
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,410
That's right, Taejoon wrote the song,

234
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,410
and I drew the score

235
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,750
I thought that I threw them away

236
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,920
but Seheon saw it

237
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,420
What does this have to do with Seheon?

238
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,510
I have to apologize you

239
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,380
About Taejoon...

240
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,520
That's right

241
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,320
I have someone important now

242
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,570
He must be crying alone, blaming himself

243
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,780
I want to give a hug

244
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,200
I want to be happy together

245
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,290
So...

246
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:58,840
Keep on eyes on me

247
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,520
Seheon Yoon!

248
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,740
Hey, you idiot

249
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,540
Taeyi...

250
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,670
Is that really the only reason you wanted to break up with me?

251
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,130
Huh?

252
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,210
I met your brother

253
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,880
How?

254
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,630
Then do you know everything?

255
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,260
Yes

256
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,090
No...

257
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,220
So...

258
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,150
Just stay with me

259
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,690
Never...

260
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,230
Never leave me alone again

261
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,280
Because you're all that matters to me

262
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,820
Taeyi

263
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,450
I was...

264
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,660
It’s alright

265
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,120
I just need you

266
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,700
What happened with your tie?

267
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,030
Hey, Seheon!

268
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,530
What happened?

269
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,040
I was worried!

270
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,450
Sorry

271
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,710
Is everything okay now?

272
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,750
Yes, I’m okay

273
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,090
I missed you so much

274
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,340
I won’t be your friend if you disappear without telling me again

275
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
You're gonna show on a festival with us again, right?

276
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,180
Of course

277
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,810
But I have sad news

278
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,270
What is that?

279
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,820
Let’s just think positively

280
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,530
Well it’s sad, but we have no choice

281
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,950
Yeah

282
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,870
I didn't like the spooky atmosphere here from the beginning

283
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,450
Hey!

284
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,460
I mean...

285
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,210
I mean, wouldn't it be nice to have a new piano room?

286
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,630
The air conditioning works, and you don't have to clean it

287
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,050
And it doesn't smell

288
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,640
It was precious for me...

289
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,510
Sorry

290
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,770
Let's find it

291
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,650
There must be another place

292
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,650
Yeah, man, I'll find it for you

293
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Come on in

294
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,400
Come on

295
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,400
Be careful

296
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,280
Come on in

297
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,490
Look around

298
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,420
This place is where I dedicated my musical youth in my twenties

299
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,090
What do you think?

300
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,130
It’s cool

301
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,260
How do you practice in a place like this?

302
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,140
You don't like it, aren’t you?

303
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,760
You’re picky

304
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,260
Then you'll have to do it on the street

305
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,100
Get out of here

306
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,890
It’s okay!

307
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,100
This is so good

308
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,110
You didn’t mean it

309
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,190
We're only open late at night

310
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,150
so you can do whatever you want except that time

311
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,410
Thank you so much

312
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,740
I'm going to go to my bar, so feel free to practice

313
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,200
Okay

314
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,750
Enjoy

315
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,540
Uncle

316
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,710
Huh?

317
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,300
Thanks

318
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,340
Don’t mention it

319
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,640
I’m leaving, enjoy

320
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,810
Bye

321
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,280
So, are we doing with the one that Taejoon has wrote?

322
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,070
I only have one page

323
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,530
We’ll have to create the rest

324
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,990
In fact,

325
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,330
Actually... I've been thinking about something while you were not here

326
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,910
Are you...

327
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,250
It's not that damn rap, is it?

328
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,250
A damn rap?

329
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,460
It’s not like that!

330
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,840
Tell me, Doyoon

331
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,090
I'm curious

332
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,970
Jazz is good

333
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,720
But it doesn’t have to be standard, right?

334
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,090
That's right

335
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,510
Look, instrument has changed,

336
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,850
and there’s only a single page of score we got

337
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,850
It’s better to have more people than only Taeyi is performing

338
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,520
I want to do it well

339
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,150
But who else?

340
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,770
Jungyu said he's not doing it

341
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,070
Well...

342
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,070
Wait a second

343
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,620
Wait... He is here?

344
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,620
He's a little shy

345
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,330
Wait a minute

346
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,540
Do you know him?

347
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,210
Let’s go

348
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,930
Come on

349
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,090
Just say hello

350
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,640
Not for today

351
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,930
Oh, you

352
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,230
Is that Juha?

353
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,150
What the...

354
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,730
Didn't you tell them in advance?

355
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,860
I’m leaving

356
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,610
Hold on for a second

357
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,950
Well...

358
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,660
We don't have a guitar

359
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,830
Juha is really good at playing the guitar, right?

360
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,750
I'm afraid not... I'll just go...

361
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,250
Hey

362
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,000
Help me just once

363
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,130
Just do it by yourselves

364
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,930
Bye

365
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,970
Hey

366
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,730
Let’s do it together

367
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,240
I’m alright now

368
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,070
I was sorry back then

369
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,830
Not you, though

370
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,460
So we're in this together, right?

371
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,210
Yes, let’s go

372
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,840
Come and sit

373
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,300
One, two, three, go!

374
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,600
Come with me

375
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,140
Taeyi, come on!

376
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,230
Come on

377
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,590
What do you think?

378
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,220
People are going to fall in love with you

379
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,350
Don't lie to me

380
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,560
I mean, seriously

381
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,570
You’re great

382
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,900
What should I do? I'm so nervous

383
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,570
Come here

384
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,490
Come over here

385
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,790
How do you feel, calming down?

386
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,870
Getting more nervous

387
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,960
Hey, it's our turn...

388
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,420
I'll be right there

389
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,010
Come on out...

390
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,350
Ah, Doyoon...

391
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,100
Can we make this quick?

392
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,900
How long does it take?

393
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,530
We have to leave

394
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,320
We are leaving

395
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,910
Soon

396
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,450
Come out

397
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,300
Let’s go

398
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,150
I know

399
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,949
No matter how much we surround each other

400
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,620
Everything can't be melted down

401
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,050
like snow under the sun

402
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:59,340
Maybe it requires a lot of time

403
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,430
To melt it down one or two

404
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,480
Maybe we already knew that

405
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,440
Like that, all of a sudden,

406
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,440
it comes to a strange land

407
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,780
It feels blended but at the same time it’s not

408
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:24,740
Our notes harmonized together to form a single performance

409
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,450
Like a jazz

410
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,600
Looks good, huh?

411
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,560
Don't be so nervous

412
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,850
Your classmates are all nice

413
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,890
Okay

414
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,860
Shall we?

415
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,030
Quiet

416
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,790
We have a senior who graduated from our school today

417
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,080
You all know who is he, right?

418
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,880
He is a pianist, Seheon Yoon

419
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,340
He spared his busy time, so ask him if you have any question

420
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,220
Okay

421
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,720
Would you mind playing for us?

422
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,770
Please

423
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,680
Would that be okay?

424
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,520
Yes, sure

425
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,580
I haven't played this one officially yet...

426
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,460
It's titled "Like a Jazz”

427
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,900
Did you wait for long?

428
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,770
A bit

429
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,320
You did a good job?

430
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:29,950
Yeah, I was a little nervous, but it was okay

431
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,700
It brings me back an old memories

432
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,500
An old memories?

433
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,460
When we first met
