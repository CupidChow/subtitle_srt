00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,910
Hey, Doyoon

2
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,170
When I call you, answer me

3
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,180
You said I’m dirty

4
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,430
What's wrong with your face?

5
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,259
Who did this to you? It must hurts...

6
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,680
Why are you doing this?

7
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,650
Why are you doing this to me?

8
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,030
Didn't you mean for this to happen?

9
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,490
I was thinking of you...

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,030
I know it too

11
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,700
But, why is it so...

12
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,870
You find this easy?

13
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,500
It's hard enough for me too

14
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,380
If I could rewind the time...

15
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,130
I wish I hadn't done it that day

16
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,090
I should have keep it for myself

17
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,090
I'd rather be normal...

18
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,010
What's the point of all those things?

19
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,930
Now... You can't be normal

20
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,560
It's dirty and weird...

21
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,280
But you treating me like I don't exist...

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,860
That's even more harder

23
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,710
Doyoon

24
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,829
You've always been a weirdo

25
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,250
Excuse me

26
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,750
Can I join you?

27
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,590
Always smiling...

28
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,380
A mystery

29
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,810
I cared you

30
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,810
Hey

31
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,060
since you kept hovering around me

32
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,110
I didn't know that at the time

33
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,070
What are you looking at?

34
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,120
Nothing

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,700
Everyone feels me uncomfortable, but

36
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,870
Your innocence even annoyed me

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,630
Do you want this?

38
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,590
No, help yourself

39
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,880
I've ran away from it over and over again

40
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,720
It’s good, though

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,090
Are you sure you're not being harassed or something?

42
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,930
I fall down while playing the basketball, it's okay

43
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,270
I knew it

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,400
Even when I hurt you by putting my feelings ahead of yours

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,980
You're not this kind of person

46
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,070
I am this kind of person

47
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,230
Don’t act like a bad guy

48
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,150
Huh?

49
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,190
Don’t lie to me

50
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,450
I can see though

51
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,450
For believing in me

52
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:13,870
I was the one who was screwed

53
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,010
Okay

54
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,600
I won't ignore you anymore

55
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,730
Juha

56
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,940
Don’t ask me to be in a relationship, you dude

57
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,030
I won’t ask you

58
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,110
I won’t kiss you all of a sudden

59
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,200
Just stay for a while

60
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,960
Let's stop it now, shall we?

61
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,590
Let’s just stay for a minute

62
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,800
Everything back to the beginning

63
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,480
After that day

64
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,020
Taeyi didn't accept apologies or excuses

65
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,780
Hey

66
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,160
As if nothing happened...

67
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,530
That's why music from the Romantic era

68
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,580
It's judged to be the most important period in the history of music

69
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,330
As if he doesn’t know me anymore

70
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,670
Okay, that's it for today's lesson

71
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you

72
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,610
What's wrong with him these days?

73
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,530
Hey, Doyoon

74
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,280
What happened you two? Did you fight?

75
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,530
Not really

76
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,460
I can't say it wasn't impulsive

77
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,670
But I shouldn't have done that

78
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,950
Is it too late to turn it back?

79
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,330
Seheon Yoon

80
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,159
Huh?

81
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,920
Come here

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,130
Come on

83
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,180
Fall Festival?

84
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,800
Not that one, but the one below

85
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,020
Music concert?

86
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,810
Is that like a project or something?

87
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,440
No, it's a festival, it's not about grades

88
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,150
It's just, it's a pride thing

89
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,530
And?

90
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,280
Do you want to join me?

91
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,330
Why? Wouldn't it be nice if we teamed up with Taeyi like last time?

92
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,120
He probably won’t

93
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,880
You guys still not talking?

94
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,670
Let’s go there after school

95
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,970
What? I don’t like to

96
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,720
And i’m sure Taeyi doesn't either

97
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,890
Don't you have to give your school uniform back?

98
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,429
Ah...

99
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Yes, though...

100
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,480
Make up and let’s practice together

101
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,940
Why do you want to do it so hard?

102
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,110
I want an airpad

103
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,570
An airpad?

104
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,990
This

105
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,740
What the heck

106
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,910
Let's go

107
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,790
What if he fall down again?

108
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,130
Is he not home?

109
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,680
Hey

110
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,640
You're just going in?

111
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,100
Why not? You've been went there too

112
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,190
Huh?

113
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,940
I think the password has changed

114
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:40,200
Hey, Taeyi, I know you're at home, come on!

115
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,870
That's enough

116
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,490
Let's just go

117
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,710
How can we just go? We’ve come this far

118
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,080
Taeyi, come on

119
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,130
Let's go

120
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,880
He might not want to meet anyone

121
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,760
Well... just in case, let's check one more thing

122
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,010
Where?

123
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,720
Follow me

124
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,020
Doyoon

125
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,860
It was around here

126
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,740
That's it

127
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,530
Is this it?

128
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,160
Yeah

129
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,120
He only comes here or home

130
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,540
But are we allowed to go there?

131
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,250
As long as we don't drink...

132
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,800
Let's go

133
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,010
This is all we have to offer for you

134
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,470
Thank you

135
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Milk in bar is embarrasing

136
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,060
Oh, you are embarrassed to drink milk?

137
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,150
Then you will drink tap water

138
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,400
I’ll drink milk

139
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,440
You’re too young to drink alcohol

140
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,450
After graduation, okay?

141
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,790
You must be the transferred student Taeyi was talking about

142
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,200
Did he tell you about me?

143
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,630
Yes, he said you’re so stupid so he wants to transfer to another school

144
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,210
Huh?

145
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,630
It’s a joke

146
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,090
He didn't say much

147
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,470
He's not at home, and he's not here...

148
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,970
Where did he go?

149
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,810
I don’t know either

150
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,190
You’re his uncle, aren't you worried?

151
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,940
He is a bit of a bad guy, but he does not crossing the line

152
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,400
Who is that?

153
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,690
Huh?

154
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,660
In the picture...

155
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,830
It’s Taejoon

156
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,910
Taeyi’s brother

157
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,330
Does he play music too?

158
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,830
He did

159
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,750
But he does not right now, right?

160
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,380
Yes

161
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,210
He passed away 2 years ago

162
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,630
What was so urgent for him to leave..

163
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,390
Sorry about that

164
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,930
Me too

165
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,810
You shouldn't be apologizing, I should be thanking you

166
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,360
I was worried Taeyi would be always alone without any friends

167
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,480
But it's nice to have friends who come and visit

168
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,990
You remind me of someone

169
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,040
Who?

170
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,200
Well, there is one

171
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,130
If he says something, it wouldn't be this frustrating

172
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,210
Does he talk to you guys well?

173
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,050
No, he is not

174
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,050
Is that so?

175
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,220
Hey, boss

176
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,090
A boss?

177
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,770
I disappointed, I even gave you milk

178
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,890
Just call me as an uncle

179
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,270
Okay

180
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,850
Where's the restroom here?

181
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,150
Restroom? Go through the door and go up the stairs on the left

182
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,110
Thank you

183
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,360
See you

184
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,770
Why are you here?

185
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,070
I was wondering if I could talk to you if I came here

186
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,740
Have you met my uncle?

187
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,200
Uh... somehow...

188
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,200
Are you stalking me?

189
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,830
A stalk?

190
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,870
Come on... It hurts

191
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,040
What the hell is going on with you?

192
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,000
Now you're coming to my uncle's store?

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,090
No, it's...

194
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,130
Are you looking down on me since I’m being friendly to you?

195
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,340
Why are you hang around?

196
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,720
What do you really mean it?

197
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,560
What?

198
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,140
What’s your true feeling?

199
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,150
Are you sure you don't mind?

200
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,270
Stop it

201
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,730
No I won’t

202
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:30,030
Answer me, weren’t you really feel anything?

203
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,290
Are you...

204
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,080
Are you out of your mind?

205
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,710
Is there something wrong with you?

206
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,380
Am I a girl to you?

207
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,380
Or do you consider yourself as a girl?

208
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,050
Taeyi, watch your language

209
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,050
Is this what you want?

210
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,640
Don’t...

211
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,480
Why? You wanted to do this

212
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Taeyi Han

213
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,520
So you followed my tracks?

214
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,070
You’re enjoying the situation now, aren’t you?

215
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,780
Stop it

216
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,280
Why?

217
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,120
I didn’t ask you to give me a favor

218
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,580
And what the heck are you doing?

219
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,950
If you don't like it, just say no

220
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,830
Is it that hard?

221
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,500
I thought you might be similar

222
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,760
But if that's all that I was to you

223
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,430
I don't think I need to say more

224
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,640
I know how you feel

225
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,450
And what I did to you on that day,

226
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,870
I'm sorry

227
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,060
Taeyi

228
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,440
Speak of the devil

229
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,360
Doyoon Suh

230
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,150
Why are you here?

231
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,820
I was worried because I couldn’t contact you for a while

232
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,740
Did you come with Seheon?

233
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,370
Yeah, didn't you see him on the way?

234
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,690
I heard that Seheon borrowed it from you

235
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,190
I forced him to come when he didn't want to...

236
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,270
Take it

237
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,380
Thank you for the clothes

238
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,330
I can’t stand anymore

239
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,300
Why did you come?

240
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,010
I was just passing by

241
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,430
And I can’t stand anymore

242
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,050
Your performance is worse than me

243
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,090
But you tried to teach me?

244
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,390
I'm better than you

245
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,610
Sorry

246
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,660
For what?

247
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,030
That I offended you

248
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,290
And not being honest

249
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,670
What about now?

250
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,420
You know

251
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,470
If you don't tell me, I don't know

252
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,930
Then I'll answer

253
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,600
Are you ready?

254
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,100
Yes

255
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,310
No regrets?

256
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,650
No regrets

257
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,560
What about you?

258
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,550
Can I help you to practice?

259
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,260
Oh well, yeah go ahead

260
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,980
It's short

261
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,490
Again!

262
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,990
Do your best

263
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,620
Huh?

264
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,080
Is that a pass?

265
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,210
How can you fail on everything?

266
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,210
Don’t be noisy

267
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,470
Here I go this time

268
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,940
Did you see it?

269
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,690
Hey! What will you do if anyone see?

270
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,190
Was it me that make you keep missing?

271
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,940
Let go of me

272
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,990
Without me, you’re good at it, right?

273
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,400
You are bothering me

274
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,030
Do I bothers you?

275
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,740
Just let go of me

276
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,120
Pick up the ball

277
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,840
Jeonggi Kim

278
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,710
I’m here

279
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,500
Majun

280
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,250
I’m here

281
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,880
Doyoon Suh

282
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,130
Yes

283
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,470
Seonggeun Yang

284
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,680
Yes

285
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,590
Yejin Kim

286
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,600
Yes

287
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,100
Oeul No

288
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,770
Here

289
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,780
Seheon Yoon?

290
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,280
Seheon Yoon

291
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,490
Yes... Yes?

292
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,790
You're energetic today, aren't you?

293
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,370
Sorry

294
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,040
Taeyi Han

295
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,250
Here

296
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,670
Okay, you shouldn't get too excited about upcoming festival

297
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,300
Festivals are festivals,

298
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,670
and you should always stay focused more on your studies, okay?

299
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,220
Yes

300
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,180
What's wrong with your voice?

301
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,300
Yes

302
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,390
Good luck with your studies

303
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,390
I'll see you later

304
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,600
Sure

305
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,520
Well, i don’t like to

306
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,310
Oh, come on, you saw how we play last time

307
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,520
I want to participate as an individual

308
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,150
Individually? Do you have a song that you wrote?

309
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,360
Yes, I have it

310
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,160
Then you can join us!

311
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,660
Why? I can do it myself

312
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,410
Hey, just join us

313
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,160
Or...

314
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,000
Give me an extra song that you wrote

315
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,670
You write it yourself

316
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,510
He’s so nasty

317
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,970
Doyoon! Do you want to go to convenience store?

318
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,220
I don’t have time for the snack

319
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,180
Why?

320
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,060
Jungyu won't join us

321
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,100
What are you going to do with the festival?

322
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,980
Can’t it be the three of us?

323
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,440
Okay, then members are fine, but what about the song?

324
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,070
A song?

325
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,990
Didn't you guys know?

326
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,240
What were you thinking?

327
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,080
We should write our own songs

328
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,330
Our own?

329
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,210
Have you ever made one?

330
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,460
No way

331
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,670
I've never made one either

332
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,590
My airpad...

333
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,970
Adios...

334
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,260
Does genre matter?

335
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,680
Whatever, we can’t do it now

336
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,930
Come up with a plan by tomorrow

337
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,140
It’s saturday tomorrow

338
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,060
Hey, is free time important now?

339
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,900
You're serious, aren't you?

340
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,070
Enough!

341
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,820
A short melody is fine.

342
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,030
But you're writing something, okay?

343
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,280
Answer me

344
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,740
Huh?

345
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:15,320
Ah...? Ah!! What the...?

346
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,420
Oh, and that one

347
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,460
What’s that?

348
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,170
Just a random stuff

349
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,220
The scores and composition books that I used

350
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,150
How are they all classical musics...

351
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,350
Jazz... score?

352
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,230
Why does he have this?

353
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,250
How about Doyoon?

354
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,290
Not yet

355
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,500
He meddled with us to come early

356
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,090
Is there anything on my face?

357
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,140
Are you mad?

358
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,270
Why? There’s no one here

359
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,230
What if Doyoon comes

360
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,230
I don’t care

361
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,610
No, let’s do it later

362
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,410
Later?

363
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,740
When?

364
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,990
I don’t know

365
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,580
Have you write any songs?

366
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,290
It’s too hard

367
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,840
How about you?

368
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,670
Would you like to listen?

369
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,550
Did you wrote this in a single day?

370
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,970
I didn't write it

371
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,850
My brother did

372
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:23,590
It's the same score that my brother has

373
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,640
What do you think?

374
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,640
Huh?

375
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:41,860
Did Taejoon write this?

376
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,360
I was just listening,

377
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,240
So i don’t remember the last part

378
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,660
I see

379
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,910
Why?

380
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:55,580
Nothing, i like it

381
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,420
It has come

382
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:09,970
I came up with the sense

383
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,350
Oh, that's better than I thought

384
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,100
Well, I’m clever enough

385
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,740
Why? You should pay attention from this part!

386
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,360
It can’t be like this

387
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,450
I can’t stand anymore

388
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,830
You don’t know anything, get out

389
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,250
Listen!

390
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,750
It feels like my ears are ruined

391
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,090
No it’s not!

392
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:43,920
Stop it

393
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,460
What to do now

394
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,050
I don't think I'll ever be that inspired again

395
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,260
Everything else was good

396
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,470
Except for your rap

397
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,520
Then you can rap

398
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,730
No way

399
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,190
That song that your brother has made...

400
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,440
Should we just go with that one?

401
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,280
What do you think?

402
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,780
Huh?

403
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,910
I think it’s okay

404
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,240
Anyway, let's think about it until the weekend

405
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,580
I’m leaving first

406
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,830
Sure

407
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,000
What's up?

408
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,840
Well, no, just...

409
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,100
You promised to be honest, what is it?

410
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,390
That song...

411
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,270
That Taejoon has wrote

412
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,100
What about that song?

413
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,730
When did he write it?

414
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,240
Before he committed a suicide...

415
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,450
A little while ago

416
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,160
I see

417
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Is there a... title?

418
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I don't know

419
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,580
Why? What do you care?

420
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,580
No, it's just...

421
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,580
It feels familiar

422
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,250
The song?

423
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,210
It’s not a big deal

424
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,420
I must be mistaken

425
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,130
Let’s go

426
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,070
What are you doing?
