1
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,820
What happened with your face?

2
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,789
Did someone hit you?

3
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,580
You’re going to catch a cold

4
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,800
Let's go

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,150
Come over here

6
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,110
Huh?

7
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,700
Wow

8
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,250
Sit

9
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,380
Did you make all this?

10
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,010
You're a really good cook

11
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,550
I was actually hungry

12
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,550
Can I eat?

13
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,270
This is so good

14
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,190
I've never tasted anything like this

15
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,320
Did you learn how to cook?

16
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,150
When did you make all these?

17
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,820
That doesn’t take long

18
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,700
You are so talented

19
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,910
What's that?

20
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,700
Chuncheon chicken ribs

21
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,250
Do you know how to cook that, too?

22
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,660
You want some?

23
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,170
Yeah, you’ve got more?

24
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,840
There’s a lot

25
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,760
Oh, it was an instant

26
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,890
Want some?

27
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,600
Oh, no I think these will be enough

28
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,240
Huh?

29
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,240
It's new

30
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,450
Thanks...

31
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,810
Hey! What’s...

32
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Don’t make fun of me

33
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,330
Hey

34
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,040
I bought it yesterday

35
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,040
You can do the laundry again

36
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,170
Let’s sleep

37
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,340
Where should I sleep?

38
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,800
You?

39
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,180
In bed

40
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,680
What about you?

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,810
Also in bed

42
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,930
Together?

43
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,890
Yes

44
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,690
Why?

45
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,900
I could just sleep on the couch or the floor

46
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,070
This is the only blanket that I have

47
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,900
It’s up to you

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,670
But... why do you hate jazz?

49
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,970
Why are you so obsessed?

50
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,220
I was not obsessed about it...

51
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,390
You play the jazz everyday

52
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,300
Even though you’re not good at it

53
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,220
You said it wasn’t bad

54
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,480
I said it was not bad, but not good

55
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,400
You’re so!

56
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,870
You’re right

57
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,280
I’m not good at it

58
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,460
But how could I explain,

59
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,500
I feel free, when I play the jazz

60
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,340
You feel free?

61
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,300
Classical music has a specific way to go

62
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,430
How do you know that?

63
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,390
Because it’s so true

64
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,640
When you graduate the high school, you go to an art college

65
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,850
And practice hard

66
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,860
And go to the competition or an orchestra,

67
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,230
and you will also play it like crazy

68
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:14,740
I think that's the same for jazz

69
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,410
That’s true

70
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,670
By the way, are you living alone?

71
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,380
Yes

72
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,880
What about the family?

73
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,550
Uncle... And that’s it

74
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I’m sorry

75
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,930
Let's go to bed

76
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,520
I’ll turn off the light

77
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,200
Is your face... okay?

78
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,830
Yes

79
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,020
Are you sleeping?

80
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,780
Thank you for not asking more

81
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,770
My cell phone, cell phone!

82
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,610
What happened?

83
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,660
What is it?

84
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,330
What?

85
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,450
Hey, where’s my school uniform?

86
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,250
School uniform?

87
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,580
In front of the washing machine

88
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,080
In front of the washing machine?

89
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,050
Hey, why didn't you dry it?

90
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,300
It rained yesterday

91
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,720
Of course it's not going to dry

92
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,810
What should I wear it to school?

93
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,190
Just skip a day, you even ran away from home

94
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,570
Do you think that I'm the kind of person like you?

95
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,320
Aren’t you get up?

96
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,570
Hurry up so I can put on my school uniform

97
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,990
You bothers me

98
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,780
Get up

99
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,160
All right

100
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,000
Hey, can't you speed up?

101
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,040
Shut up

102
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,580
Faster

103
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,800
A little faster

104
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Then you can ride in front!

105
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Faster, faster, faster!

106
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,390
Can't you go faster?

107
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,180
Shut up

108
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,270
Faster

109
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,730
Come on! I'm late

110
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,860
Watch out

111
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,650
More, more, more!

112
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,190
Can't you see I’m breathing abdonimally right now?

113
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,280
I’m late

114
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,610
Hello

115
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,040
Hey, he is the one

116
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,960
Really? What's going on

117
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,370
It’s him

118
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,050
A note that does not harmonize with it, or...

119
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,890
What?

120
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,400
Come in and take a seat

121
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,490
Okay, everyone, pay attention

122
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,530
Open the page 32 in your textbook

123
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,700
Nonharmonic tone and harmonic progress, right?

124
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,670
A nonharmonic note is a

125
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,840
given note in music that is not in harmonical relationship

126
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,340
Or an accent

127
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,420
That means

128
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,300
What's wrong with Seheon clothes?

129
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,430
I don't know

130
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,140
Is he into a hip-hop?

131
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,260
He is even skipping the lunch

132
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,600
He will eat if he want to

133
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,950
You go first

134
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,990
Huh?

135
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,620
Leave

136
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,080
Hey

137
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,500
Is he into a hip-hop?

138
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,580
He is even skipping his lunch

139
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,380
How am I supposed to go out with these?

140
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,550
I’m starving

141
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,540
Drink this

142
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,540
Huh?

143
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,090
Where are you going?

144
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,010
To eat lunch

145
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,930
Taeyi

146
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,100
Are you going for a lunch?

147
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,730
Seheon, your brother is here

148
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,770
Hey

149
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,480
Thank you

150
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,070
Sure, have a conversation

151
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,910
Hey, what the hell happened to you?

152
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,110
Even your phone is off

153
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,620
Sorry

154
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,040
I ran out of battery

155
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,960
What's happened with the clothes?

156
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,170
It’s all wet so I borrowed my friend's clothes

157
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,960
Did you sleep at a friend's house last night?

158
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,800
Yes

159
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,340
Well, then at least you should leave a text

160
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,630
Do you know how worried dad was?

161
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,050
Was he?

162
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,640
I'll make sure to explain him, so,

163
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,220
when you go home, apologize him that what you did is wrong

164
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,310
Okay?

165
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,060
Sure, I'm sorry

166
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,940
I’m leaving

167
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,590
Hey, follow me

168
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,010
Are you mad?

169
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,060
Why did you come to my classroom?

170
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,100
Hey

171
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,600
Hey, you

172
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,480
Did you tell the others, didn’t you?

173
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,270
About what?

174
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,230
The thing that you have done to me

175
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,530
You’ve been telling that, right?

176
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,990
It’s not, believe me!

177
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,190
Hey

178
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,570
I was just messing with you

179
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,240
To fool Taeyi

180
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,700
I think you are misunderstanding about...

181
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,750
It’s not a misunderstanding!

182
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,910
What?

183
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,290
It’s not a misunderstanding, but

184
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,050
I actually...

185
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,800
I actually like you

186
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,170
Shut up before I kill you

187
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
Go punch me

188
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,310
What?

189
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,810
I'd rather be hit and smashed

190
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:03,610
I don't regret what I did to you on that day

191
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,690
Because I meant it

192
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,650
You, dirty

193
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,200
Am I dirty?

194
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,040
Yes, I can’t stand it so stop it

195
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,510
I understand you all

196
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,090
So I'm not going to pretend that I know you anymore

197
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,680
Can you let go of me?

198
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,140
I feel dirty, too

199
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,580
He’s home, father

200
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,710
What I did is wrong

201
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,670
Did you not hurt?

202
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,050
Yes, I’m okay

203
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,510
Okay, go to your room

204
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,150
Go inside

205
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,520
Okay

206
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:51,300
So much happened in such a short time

207
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,470
It's been a whirlwind, but...

208
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,560
But what I do remember vividly is...

209
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,730
Taeyi Han

210
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,109
Drink this

211
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:19,069
Can I be more close to him tomorrow?

212
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,960
What are you listening to?

213
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,600
Chet Baker?

214
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,110
You like Chet Baker?

215
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,860
Get off

216
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,530
You're always skipping class to be here

217
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,910
How did you find out this place?

218
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,000
Doyoon told me

219
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,040
Here’s so nice

220
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,930
Why are you here?

221
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,970
The last time you played,

222
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,970
Honestly, I was shocked

223
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,640
For some reason, I just understood

224
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,400
Why you didn't like my performance

225
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,150
My pride has been hurt, but

226
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,320
Could you teach me a -

227
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,790
I can’t say it

228
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,210
Teach you?

229
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,080
No... I want you to listen to me

230
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,420
I want to know what's wrong

231
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:05,260
Is that the outdoor fan connected to the one below?

232
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,560
Outdoor fan is fine

233
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,230
I think I need to check the air conditioner

234
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,320
Why?

235
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,080
Why are we hiding?

236
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,500
Because it’s a prohibited area

237
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,960
Is it?

238
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,380
Of course

239
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,840
We might have got into trouble!

240
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,510
I didn't even realize it, I was so confident...

241
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,510
I'll see you in the piano room after school

242
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,300
Why?

243
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,220
What why?

244
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,180
You asked me to listen to your performance

245
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,150
Rock, scissor, paper!

246
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,530
Rock, scissor, paper!

247
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,530
I'll go with him

248
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,990
You guys are an amateurs, so you three can do it together

249
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,120
We’ll just do it with 2

250
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,450
Oh why not three, you can do it, try it

251
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,080
Hey, i’m leaving now

252
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,000
Why?

253
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,260
Hey, Juha Song!

254
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,970
Nice timing, huh? Come here

255
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,070
I don’t know what I should play

256
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,440
Anything

257
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Wait

258
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,760
Why?

259
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,140
Close your eyes

260
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,100
What?

261
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,140
I said close your eyes

262
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Like, right now?

263
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,370
What are you doing?

264
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,790
Don't open your eyes

265
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,420
Now play it

266
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,010
I can't see anything, how could I?

267
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,800
Just play it

268
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,330
How was it?

269
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,880
A jazz player who is scared by the jazz

270
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,300
Are you talking about me?

271
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,670
I didn’t say that I’m scared, I said it’s hard

272
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Basically the same

273
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,300
It's totally different

274
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,970
Well, that was a good one,

275
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,520
but

276
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,610
You’re missing this

277
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,950
Hey, what..

278
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,910
There's no swing

279
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,870
That's it for today

280
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,250
Already?

281
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,160
Isn't that too easy for you?

282
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,580
When you don’t know it, just play it

283
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,050
I can listen to it for you

284
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,760
You said that you don’t like it

285
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,800
You should think about the ears of the listener, too

286
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,220
I’m leaving

287
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,850
What did you do today, Taeyi?

288
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,900
I don’t know

289
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,860
See you

290
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,910
What are you doing?

291
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,240
I said I'm going alone

292
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,410
Why are you coming with him?

293
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,040
Doyoon?

294
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,250
We just met on the way

295
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,880
What were you two talking about?

296
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,090
We didn't say much, just say goodbye and..

297
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,090
Let’s go

298
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,340
Then did you apologize?

299
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,010
Which apology?

300
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,230
That you punched him

301
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,650
Why should I apologize?

302
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,730
Go first

303
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,820
I'm going to eat with my friend and come home

304
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Hey

305
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,700
Juhee Song

306
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,120
When did you start the trumpets?

307
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,870
I don't know

308
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,580
Then what do you know?

309
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,830
I don’t know

310
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,250
You really...

311
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,000
You don't want to talk to me?

312
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,510
You’ll say ‘I don’t know’ again

313
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,300
Not really

314
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,060
It’s just...

315
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,810
There's just someone you remind me of

316
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,770
Who?

317
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,610
Well, there’s someone like that

318
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,610
Like making me annoyed often

319
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,530
So you mean I'm annoying after all

320
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,160
By the way, why do you keep following me?

321
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,500
I'm not following you

322
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,790
You’re behind me

323
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,840
All the time, without knowing anything

324
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,210
What do you know?

325
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,630
Too many

326
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,970
I'm going home

327
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,680
Go

328
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,930
Welcome

329
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,980
Why did you come?

330
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,650
Just because

331
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,740
Do you need something to drink?

332
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,860
An alcohol

333
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,870
You're crazy, aren’t you

334
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,870
Are you planning to suspend my shop?

335
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,540
He’s my nephew

336
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,260
What is this?

337
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,140
It’s cherry juice

338
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,480
You look better

339
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,070
Maybe the medicines are working?

340
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,780
Uncle

341
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,860
Huh?

342
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,950
My brother...

343
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,080
Do you think he was weak?

344
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,710
No he wasn’t weak

345
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,550
I was just wondering..

346
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,050
If he made that choice because he was weak

347
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,560
You're being silly

348
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,350
I have no idea why did he do that

349
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,820
Your brother's the kind of person who don’t talk his thoughts

350
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,040
I won't pretend to know you anymore

351
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,680
Everything worked as I hoped...

352
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,470
But why do I feel like crap?

353
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,850
Hey, isn’t that Juha?

354
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,430
I think you’re right

355
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,440
Hey

356
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,150
Hey, Juha!

357
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,440
That dude from last time, his name is Juha

358
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,900
It’s you, Juha

359
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,800
Don’t meddle from now on

360
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,860
I don't regret it,

361
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,030
because I meant it

362
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,540
I remembered

363
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,420
Hey

364
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,760
Doyoon Suh

365
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:32,600
He was so nice for no reason

366
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,390
Thank you

367
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,600
He was a weird guy

368
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,700
Where are you, Taeyi

369
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,880
Taeyi!

370
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,920
What are you doing there?

371
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,130
Juha?

372
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,760
Seheon

373
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,560
It’s all because of you!

374
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,310
Juha

375
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,310
Everything is a mess since you got here

376
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,390
Taeyi and Doyoon too

377
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,060
And also for me

378
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,150
It's all got weird

379
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,400
Calm down

380
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,530
Bring it back

381
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,570
Juha

382
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,990
Bring everything back to normal!

383
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,290
Don't...

384
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,750
If you bothers him once more,

385
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,550
then I won’t even consider you as a senior

386
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,680
Why?

387
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,310
Did you hurt?

388
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,150
I think I scratched a little...

389
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,570
You should go to the classroom first

390
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,070
I'm going to look for medicine

391
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,010
Show me your wound

392
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,140
I’m alright

393
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,270
Give me your hands

394
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:46,690
Just a moment...

395
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:53,410
I wish time would stop, just as it is

396
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,580
When was it?

397
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,910
What the hell are you doing?

398
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,670
The moment my heart started beating when I saw you

399
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,050
I’m so confused

400
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,300
about those tiny little moments

401
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,550
Taeyi Han

402
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,770
This is all they had in the nurse’s office

403
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,680
Who am I to you?

404
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,730
How do you feel?

405
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,610
I want to know

406
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,770
If you feel...

407
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,440
the same as me
