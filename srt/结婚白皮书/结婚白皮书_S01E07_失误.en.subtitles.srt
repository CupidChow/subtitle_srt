1
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,292
-He's dropped the ball.
-Throws to first base!

2
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,169
-Gosh!
-He slips through again!

3
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,879
How could he not catch that?

4
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,505
Seriously!

5
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,843
I should go take the field
and you can come here and do my job.

6
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,180
Look at you.

7
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,307
Have you lost your humanity?

8
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,225
What?

9
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,062
He must feel terrible
making a mistake like that

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,522
at such an important moment.

11
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,401
As a fan, you should be supporting him,
yet you're the first to throw stones?

12
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,738
What's with you? Normally,
you'd already beaten me to it.

13
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,449
Do you think he made an error
because he wanted to?

14
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,951
He made a mistake
before he even realized it.

15
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,787
Have you never made a mistake?

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,830
You punk, do you really think my mistakes

17
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,917
and the mistakes that player makes
out on the field are the same?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,211
A mistake before he even realized it?

19
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,672
Look, he made an error because
he lost focus at such an important moment.

20
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,509
Now the whole atmosphere is ruined.

21
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,803
They could get back on track.

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,474
Hey, once the atmosphere of the game
is broken, it's hard to bring it back.

23
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,476
If they lose because of that error,

24
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,769
if I were the head coach,

25
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,773
I wouldn't even have him on the lineup
in the next game. He's out.

26
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,775
He still deserves a chance to--

27
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,527
A chance, my ass!

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,569
Hey.

29
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,365
A person who makes an error
is bound to make another.

30
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,409
That's the status quo.

31
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,426
EPISODE 7
ERROR

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,058
Hui-seon.

33
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,939
Drink this.

34
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,568
Hey, I get that
this is for a wedding gift,

35
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,697
but do you really need to
be in line at the crack of dawn?

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,908
Think of it as a chance for us
to catch up with current trends.

37
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,493
-Trends?
-Yes.

38
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,787
It's trendy to buy things
on the day of their release.

39
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,081
They do this for brands
like Chanel or Hublot.

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,459
Forget the trend,
you're going way too overboard.

41
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,378
You don't even have time
to prepare for your wedding,

42
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,922
so why are you lining up to buy a watch?

43
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:58,136
I really need this watch
and there are only four ways to get it.

44
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,807
The first is to buy it from
a second-hand luxury store like Gugus.

45
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,726
But this is for a wedding gift,
so I can't.

46
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,436
-Okay.
-The second is

47
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,771
to line up at the store
early in the morning.

48
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:14,611
The third is to buy someone's number
in line off of a second-hand site.

49
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,113
The last is to buy from resellers
at a higher price.

50
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,866
If you were me, what would you try first?

51
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,619
Lining up at the store.

52
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,246
Right, so that's what I'm starting with.

53
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,042
Of course, doing this doesn't guarantee
that I'll be able to buy it.

54
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,919
What?

55
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,462
Since there aren't enough items.

56
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,215
There's a rumor that this store
only sells air.

57
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,346
Why are you
so pointlessly dedicated to this?

58
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,889
Would you call it true love?

59
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,724
I'd call it pure labor.

60
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,645
-Hui-seon.
-Yes?

61
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,938
The shutters are opening.

62
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,402
Should I really be excited about a store
opening its shutters at this age?

63
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:07,372
WEST GATE, ORANGE WARD

64
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,417
Did you get it?

65
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,419
-They say this is all they have.
-What?

66
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,922
All we have in stock now
are these two women's watches

67
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,216
and these items are not for sale yet.

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,512
Then can you tell me when
the Big Bang Original will be in stock?

69
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,513
I'm sorry, ma'am.

70
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,100
We don't know
which models will be restocked or when.

71
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,687
Then put down a deposit on it
before you leave.

72
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,188
Call her when you get it in.

73
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,942
I'm sorry, but we don't know
when or what models will be in the store,

74
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,152
so we don't accept product reservations.

75
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,571
So, if we can't reserve one

76
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,700
and you don't have them in stock,
how can we buy it?

77
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,453
The only way would be to come every day
and check which products came in that day.

78
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,622
See?

79
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,042
Every day?

80
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,671
Thank you.

81
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,759
Everyone's out of their minds.

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,220
Everyone's out of their minds.

83
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,641
After factoring out the honeymoon,
I have eight days of paid leave…

84
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,311
It's gotten to you too.

85
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,105
Who uses their paid leave
to line up outside a store?

86
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,107
Just go on your honeymoon
and buy it overseas.

87
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,358
I can't.

88
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,281
Don't think about it too much.

89
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,617
Just get Jun-hyeong a nice watch
or something.

90
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:32,790
When I hang out with my friends,
they say their sons received watches.

91
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,753
That's what Jun-hyeong's mom said.

92
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,382
Even if she hadn't said that,
you saw the gifts I received.

93
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:46,137
His mom did all of that for me,
the least I can do is get him a watch.

94
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,390
So you're working this hard for a reason.

95
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,351
And I want to give Jun-hyeong
a special gift too.

96
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:56,022
Jun-hyeong has always wanted
a Big Bang Original,

97
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,107
but he gave up
because it's so hard to find.

98
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,943
But I'll give it to him as a wedding gift.

99
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,612
Cheers.

100
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,907
Why are you so pretty today?
Is it a special day today?

101
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,618
It's not a special day. Just…

102
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,164
Here…

103
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,208
No way.

104
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,215
Na-eun, how did you get this?

105
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,641
From now on,
I'll be by your side all the time.

106
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,810
Let's be happy forever.

107
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,103
I love you.

108
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,568
Can I try it on?

109
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,456
Awesome!

110
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,671
I can say "I just picked it up
along the way," and hand it to him.

111
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,755
You know?

112
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,508
What are you? Some character in a novel?

113
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,677
If it's for Jun-hyeong,

114
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,055
I can give him all my money,
time, and devotion.

115
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,558
I want to relay that through this watch.

116
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,477
Since he's always been the one
to surprise me,

117
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,105
I'd like to surprise him this time.

118
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,233
I want to show him
how much he means to me.

119
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,153
Gosh, what a loyal woman you are.

120
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,199
What can I get for you?

121
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,953
I'll take shrimp with avocado added.

122
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,163
How about you?

123
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,793
Hey. What are you going to have?

124
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,919
Well…

125
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,589
I'll take the BMT. The Italian BMT.

126
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,050
Hey. Where are you going?

127
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,138
Hey, you can't just tell them BMT
and be done with it.

128
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,558
What about the bread? The cheese?
And the pickles, sauce, vegetables…

129
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,978
I guess he doesn't know how fun it is
to customize your own sandwich.

130
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,813
For the bread,

131
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,983
I'll have Parmesan Oregano.
No, I'll have flatbread.

132
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,656
I calculated everything you received
and it's around 80 million won.

133
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,828
Hey.

134
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,747
Here's your sandwich.

135
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,296
This is the best sandwich place
I've been to.

136
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,969
I changed up the sauce this time.
It's good, right?

137
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,221
Yes.

138
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,388
It's good.

139
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,392
You're saying that
but what's with that frown on your face?

140
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,394
No, it's really good.

141
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,648
Hey, do you think I don't know you?
What is it? What's up?

142
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,236
By the way, have you ever received a gift

143
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,280
and looked up how much it cost to get?

144
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,198
Yes.

145
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,658
-You have?
-Yes.

146
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,118
When you get a gift,
you get curious about the price.

147
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,413
Or if the gift is weird, you wonder
how much someone paid for it

148
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,957
and end up looking it up.

149
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,168
People put money into what they love,

150
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,505
so you get curious about
what that person really thinks of you.

151
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,422
Why?

152
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,924
You're trash.

153
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,176
No, I'm not. It's instinct.

154
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,595
A primitive instinct.

155
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,641
Instinct, my ass.

156
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,476
No, you're just a snob.

157
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,477
Hey.

158
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,023
When it comes to gifts, it's sincerity
that matters, not the price.

159
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,402
Sincerity is reflected in the price.
This is the first principle of capitalism.

160
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,780
You're rotten to the core.

161
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,701
Okay, so say you looked up the price,
but it was cheaper than you thought.

162
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,329
Then will you decide that they're not
sincere enough and just cut them off?

163
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,333
Honestly, it'd be disappointing.

164
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,877
Especially, if they were
someone that I valued.

165
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,339
You're so calculative.
That's why you have no girlfriend.

166
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,509
Then why do you have yourself
a calculative woman?

167
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,221
-I wasn't talking about Na-eun.
-As if. You obviously were.

168
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,514
I wasn't.

169
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,558
Yes, it is! Gosh.

170
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,893
It was Hui-seon who did that.

171
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,732
-Why would Hui-seon calculate that?
-I don't know.

172
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,221
What?

173
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,433
You weren't looking
at wedding invitation samples.

174
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,101
It's a second-hand sales site.

175
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,479
Why all of a sudden?

176
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,024
You see, I'm going to buy someone's
place in line at the watch store.

177
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,609
Someone's place in line?

178
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,694
You're going to pay for that?

179
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,448
I went during opening hours today
and failed.

180
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,784
I can't stand in line every morning,

181
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,911
so I'll buy a place in line here
and go later.

182
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,122
-You don't have to do all of--
-Yes, I do.

183
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,542
I want to give you a nice present too.

184
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,255
If that's the case,
let's buy something else.

185
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,133
My mom bought me a watch
when I got a job, anyway.

186
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,719
But that's from your mom, not me.

187
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,515
Plus, you really wanted
a Big Bang Original.

188
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,143
That's true, but it's hard to buy.

189
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,814
So that's why I'm going to try to do it.

190
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,400
Why are you going this far?

191
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,028
Because I want you to feel the way I felt

192
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,406
when I received the wedding gifts.

193
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,952
Of course, it would be nice if I could do
as much as you did for me.

194
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,079
But I don't have the ability to do that.

195
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,207
So I'll try my best to get this watch

196
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,126
to show you how moved I was by it.

197
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,463
What is it?

198
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,342
It's nothing.

199
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,555
I'll try asking around
to see if anyone can find one.

200
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,850
Do you really think
it's that easy to find this watch?

201
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,687
It's like a treasure that only someone
with three generations of good karma

202
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,730
or someone who gave it their all can find.

203
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,108
Don't suffer for nothing.

204
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,693
Just trust me and wait.

205
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,319
I'll make sure to get it.

206
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,825
I feel like I already received it.

207
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,953
Just wait,
I'll definitely get one for you.

208
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,539
Okay, good luck!

209
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,598
HOW TO FIND A HUBLOT BIG BANG ORIGINAL

210
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,354
Na-eun is this dedicated
to trying to give me such a special gift,

211
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,023
I shouldn't have worried about it.

212
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,554
Let's have lunch.

213
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,605
Were they that hungry?

214
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,744
Hey, Mercedes.

215
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,996
How can I help you?

216
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,290
Navigate to Hublot Main Store.

217
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,086
Initiating navigation
to Hublot Main Store.

218
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,929
Once we get there, I'll drop you
at the front. You go ahead.

219
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,806
-I'll park and meet you up there.
-Okay.

220
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,808
I'll go straight to the store.

221
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,269
You two can grab lunch
at the department store.

222
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,270
Okay.

223
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,273
But what happens
if they've already passed your number,

224
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,025
or if they don't call you
before your lunch is over?

225
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,403
That's just it. There are no refunds.

226
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,738
It's better than buying one
from a reseller.

227
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,657
The premiums are over five million won.

228
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,952
And they rarely have them
so I'd have to wait for months.

229
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,706
I should have been a watch reseller,
not here working in a company.

230
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,041
Don't you get a reality check
when this happens?

231
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,710
The premium is five million won.

232
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,753
The watch itself costs
over ten million won,

233
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,339
And you still can't buy it
and have to wait your turn.

234
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,883
I do, indeed.

235
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:48,095
Honestly, if it wasn't for Jun-hyeong,
I wouldn't have done something like this.

236
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,015
And now I'm on a watch diet.

237
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,516
Watch diet?

238
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,311
A new kind of diet where you skip lunch

239
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,606
and go to department stores
to buy a watch.

240
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,318
What a luxurious diet, right?

241
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,821
At this point, the heavens should be
impressed by your efforts

242
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,324
and let you get that watch somehow.

243
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,410
I hope the ending is a happy one.

244
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,135
Someone I know helped me find
a Classic Fusion Aerofusion Titanium.

245
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,554
What's wrong, Na-eun?

246
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,931
Why aren't you going in?

247
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,809
What?

248
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,316
It's done, right?

249
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,027
Happy now?

250
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,075
Hey, Na-eun.

251
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,993
You bought a watch?

252
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,495
Where?

253
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,206
Yes, it seemed you were worried
about the watch too much

254
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,124
so I asked around about it.

255
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,169
But today, a coworker was at Hublot

256
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,296
and told me
the Classic Fusion was in stock.

257
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,967
So, I told him to hold it for me
and ran over.

258
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,259
Classic Fusion?

259
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,386
Classic Fusion?

260
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,474
It's this one.

261
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
I can't believe I managed to get this.

262
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,692
Well, I'm in Myeongdong right now,
so I'll take a taxi and head over there

263
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,443
No. You don't have to come.

264
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,570
What about the payment?

265
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,030
Well…

266
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,117
if I don't pay right now,
they say it might be sold to someone else,

267
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,284
so I paid with my card.

268
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,330
But I was going to buy it for you
as a wedding gift.

269
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,500
Then I'll come with you this evening
and change the payment card.

270
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,462
Okay. Then we can meet there after work.

271
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,965
Then around 7 p.m.?

272
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,884
Hey. You're working overtime later.

273
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,222
That's right.
I'm working overtime this evening.

274
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,849
What should we do?

275
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,352
I'll leave my card with the manager.

276
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,688
You can come later
and change the payment card.

277
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,733
-What?
-Will that be difficult?

278
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,280
No, I'll stop by.

279
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,782
Then I'll leave my card here.

280
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,869
Isn't it amazing that I got this?

281
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,164
I know. I can't believe
you got it so easily.

282
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,958
Exactly. So this is why
they say "Winners win."

283
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,129
Now that the watch fiasco is over,
you have nothing to worry about.

284
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,257
Yes, I'm relieved now.

285
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,886
I'll call you back later.

286
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,389
He bought a watch?

287
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,016
Yes.

288
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,768
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,687
You couldn't even eat on time
because of me.

290
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,731
No, that's not the problem right now.

291
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,940
Right, Na-eun.

292
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,653
You worked so hard
but your boyfriend got the watch first.

293
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,990
No, I'm glad he got it
before I had to work too hard.

294
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,701
Let's go eat now.

295
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,037
I'll buy you
something really delicious. Let's go.

296
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,009
Min-woo, give me those documents.

297
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,180
You punk, what are you doing?

298
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,515
-My neck.
-Hey, Mr. Seo.

299
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,641
-What?
-You…

300
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,060
Hey, how did you get this?

301
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,061
This…

302
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,397
Isn't this that rare Hublot watch?

303
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,525
Looks like you
couldn't wait to show it off.

304
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,068
Hey, how did you get this?

305
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,278
Everyone's saying the watch is cool.

306
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,950
Please, sign here.

307
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,909
All right.

308
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,336
Okay, here you are.

309
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,089
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

310
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,175
-We're getting this for a wedding gift.
-One moment, I'll help you.

311
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,111
I'm home.

312
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,407
What is all this?

313
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,577
What do you mean? They're wedding gifts.

314
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,914
These are so old-fashioned and tacky.

315
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,583
Why you…

316
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,918
These are very expensive.
You don't know anything.

317
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,838
-They are?
-Of course!

318
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,049
I bought the best
and the most expensive things.

319
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,927
I could go my whole life
and still not have things like this.

320
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,221
I'll buy it for you.

321
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,640
Goodness, forget it.

322
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:48,270
You just remember that your mother
worked hard to get all this.

323
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,733
You don't need to do this.

324
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,528
Jun-hyeong's mom said
we should simply get the necessities.

325
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,365
The words simple and necessities
can't go together.

326
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,161
The Necessities include a blanket,
a traditional dining set, and more.

327
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,954
And that's just the start.

328
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,500
What she said actually means
to prepare everything properly.

329
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,005
Even so, she sent the price tag
just in case we got careless about it.

330
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,800
Mom, how many times do I have to tell you
it was the company's mistake?

331
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,928
Okay, let's say that.

332
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,389
It's not like we can tell
if it's a mistake or intentional anyway.

333
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,557
Mom, please!

334
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,560
Fine.

335
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,395
How did it go?

336
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,565
You ran out of the house
early this morning to buy a watch.

337
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,734
I got it.

338
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,569
Then why the long face?

339
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,740
Just because.

340
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,659
What is it?

341
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,662
It feels as if Jun-hyeong and his mom

342
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,790
can easily get whatever they want to buy.

343
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,543
But it feels like homework when we do it.

344
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,338
What's with that look on your ugly face?

345
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,549
Something seems to be bothering Na-eun,

346
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,176
but I don't know what it is.

347
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,473
Is she upset because I didn't go with her
to pay for the watch?

348
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,060
She knew you were working overtime.
She wouldn't be mad about that.

349
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,563
Right.

350
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,775
Na-eun isn't the type to get upset
about things like that.

351
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,486
So, then what's making her feel like that?

352
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,620
"I'll pick you up after work tomorrow
to buy your father's gift."

353
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,789
"No, there's traffic. Let's meet
at the department store at six."

354
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,834
What? It's just a normal conversation.
She's not upset at all.

355
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,254
There are no emojis.

356
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,593
How much of an idiot are you?

357
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,179
And her messages are short and concise.

358
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,473
Na-eun usually says, "Nope,"

359
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,100
-and "See you outside."
-Gosh, shut up.

360
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,310
Darn it.

361
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,687
I really thought Na-eun was mad.

362
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,898
Why are reading so much
into these messages?

363
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,317
Frankly, what is there for Na-eun
to be mad about?

364
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,528
You got such an in-demand watch
right away through your connections.

365
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,697
Right.

366
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,243
-What?
-That's it.

367
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,162
What?

368
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,833
Na-eun said she wanted to
buy you a Big Bang

369
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,711
and that's a little cheaper
than the Classic Fusion, right?

370
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,214
Are you even hearing yourself?

371
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,632
Do you think it makes sense to say

372
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,301
that Na-eun is mad
because I got an expensive watch?

373
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,095
She's the one paying for it.

374
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,889
She could be upset if you bought
a more expensive watch without asking.

375
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,976
Plus, Na-eun is kind of
the money-conscious type.

376
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,230
Seeing that she calculated the price
of the gifts, that must be it.

377
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,109
Come on.

378
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,448
Are you crazy?

379
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,912
You think she's mad that she bought
an expensive watch for a wedding gift?

380
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,998
What sort of person
do you think Na-eun is?

381
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,585
I mean, there's no other
reason for her to be angry.

382
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,754
There is. There are a lot of reasons.

383
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,172
Then, what is it?

384
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,010
I don't need to tell you
and you don't need to know.

385
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,012
What a stonewall.

386
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,100
Was this the question
you wanted to meet me to ask?

387
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,894
Did Jun-hyeong ask you to do this?

388
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,437
No.

389
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,731
I was just curious.

390
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,110
Why would you want to know
why Na-eun is mad?

391
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,362
Because by being curious
about these things,

392
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,239
I get to see you.

393
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,161
Every time I ask you out to eat,
you say you're busy.

394
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,997
I have no choice but to use Na-eun
as an excuse to see you.

395
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,708
What I want to know is

396
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,002
why do you want to eat with me?

397
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,212
-Are you interested in me?
-Yes.

398
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,552
Now that you know my intentions,
shall we start talking comfortably?

399
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,511
No.

400
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:35,056
Now that I know your intentions,
I'll make sure to be even more formal.

401
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,101
Why? We're not that different in age.

402
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,353
-Let's just relax.
-People think

403
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,398
speaking comfortably makes them closer.

404
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,776
Okay, I agree.

405
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,777
Then…

406
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,113
let's speak formally but get closer.

407
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,324
-Good idea, right?
-No less than Jung Woo-sung

408
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,492
is my standard.

409
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,828
No matter how hard you try,

410
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,456
it's not going to work on me.

411
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,959
I hear that I look like someone a lot.

412
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,380
Can you think of who it might be?

413
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,174
I don't know.

414
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,342
-You really can't?
-No.

415
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,718
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

416
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,387
It's short, so watch carefully.
Focus on my face.

417
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,772
-No way.
-You can see it, right?

418
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,440
-It can't be.
-You do, right?

419
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,193
You don't look like him at all.

420
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,028
You got it.

421
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,074
Thank you for agreeing.
Gosh, I do like him, I do.

422
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,659
You admitted to it.

423
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,826
This is great.

424
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,621
Hui-seon.

425
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:44,209
This is just a personal question
that I'm only asking because I'm curious,

426
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,962
but why did you calculate the price
of Na-eun's wedding gifts?

427
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,881
How did you know about that?

428
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,800
No way.

429
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,135
Did Jun-hyeong see my message to Na-eun?

430
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,805
This is crazy.

431
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,974
No, you can't call Na-eun.
Consider my situation.

432
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,559
-As if that's any important.
-What?

433
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,106
If you call Na-eun, she'll know
that the two of us are seeing each other.

434
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,818
How can you say something like that?

435
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,027
We're seeing each other?

436
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,737
We are right now, aren't we?

437
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,364
The two of us.

438
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,744
Just let them work it out.

439
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,372
Do you really think
this would lead to a serious fight?

440
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,749
It'd be hilarious if it really did.

441
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,295
Don't worry about that.
Why don't we go see a movie?

442
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,463
-There's a really good movie--
-I've seen it.

443
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,423
What?

444
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,551
But I didn't even mention the title.

445
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,886
Let's make a toast.

446
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,434
Come on, Hui-seon.

447
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,021
You are charming,
I will be falling for you

448
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,355
Gosh, how charming.

449
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,277
How about a glass of wine?
The mood seems right,

450
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,113
Hey, Na-eun!

451
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,242
Wasn't it hard getting here?
What about dinner?

452
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,786
Let's eat later and shop first.

453
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,956
What are you saying? Eating is important.

454
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,334
Let's go get that tteokbokki you like.

455
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,376
Jun-hyeong.

456
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,378
Are you hungry?

457
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,257
No.

458
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,092
Then let's go in.

459
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,433
Welcome.

460
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,355
How is this?

461
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,941
Since this is for your father,
I think something simple would be best.

462
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,109
Yes.

463
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,571
That one's good. He doesn't like
things with obvious branding.

464
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,989
Yes, this is perfect.

465
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,951
Do you think we should get the shirt,
necktie, and belt together?

466
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,163
Or a wallet, business cardholder,
and belt together?

467
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,541
I think it'd be fine with just the belt.

468
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,046
Your mom said I should
get the necessities for the gift.

469
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,422
so I need to do everything I can.

470
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,134
She said to be simple.

471
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,809
Let's just get the belt, Honey.

472
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,770
Excuse me.

473
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,731
I'll take this belt, wallet,
and business cardholder.

474
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,066
Yes, ma'am.

475
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,401
Honey.

476
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,445
Should we get it engraved for him?

477
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,543
Na-eun.

478
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,004
What's got you upset like this?

479
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:43,179
You need to tell me so that I can
apologize or give you an explanation.

480
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,474
We're shopping for
wedding gifts right now.

481
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,309
We have to do something about this.

482
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,272
Na-eun.

483
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,275
Is this

484
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,027
because of the watch?

485
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,407
Really?

486
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,037
It meant a lot to me and I had a plan.

487
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,914
So that's what made me more upset.

488
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:14,502
You should've told me earlier.
Then I wouldn't have bought it.

489
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,839
I'm not angry that you bought a watch.

490
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,632
I know.

491
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,927
But I bought an expensive watch
without your permission--

492
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,888
An expensive watch without my permission?

493
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,433
What are you talking about?

494
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,896
Do you think the reason I'm angry
is that you bought an expensive watch?

495
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,237
I guess you do.

496
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,407
How could you think of me like that?

497
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,161
No, I know that you're upset,
but I don't know the reason why.

498
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,205
My mind has been going
all sorts of places.

499
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,792
Why do you think I even thought
of something like this?

500
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,336
So it's my fault?

501
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,214
That's not what I meant.

502
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,092
No, I'm sorry. I wasn’t thinking enough.

503
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,636
What are you sorry about?

504
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,035
I'm sorry, Na-eun. Are you that upset?

505
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,872
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,961
No, you don't even know why I'm angry,
but you think an apology fixes everything?

507
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,883
I'M SORRY NA-EUN.
ARE YOU THAT UPSET?

508
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,137
I'm sorry, Hui-seon.

509
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,892
Min-woo said people close to Na-eun
would know why she's upset

510
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,604
and suggested that I meet and ask them.
So I took the liberty of contacting you.

511
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,898
You did well.

512
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:03,194
I need to know exactly why Na-eun is upset
so that I can help her feel better.

513
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,488
You still don't know why?

514
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,952
I think it's the watch
but I don't know exactly…

515
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:16,374
Well, because you came all this way
to try to solve this with Na-eun,

516
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:20,044
I'll be kind and make it
a multiple-choice question.

517
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,590
One. She received
the traditional wedding box so easily

518
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,718
but there's so much to do
with the wedding gifts and it's hard.

519
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,054
Two. Na-eun really wanted to
buy you the watch,

520
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,599
but you went and bought it alone.

521
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:38,354
Three. You bought the watch alone
and got excited alone too.

522
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:42,734
Four, Na-eun couldn't even see
the actual watch

523
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,944
and still went alone
to pay for it with her card.

524
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,323
Which of these is the answer?

525
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,784
It's all of them.

526
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,952
Correct.

527
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,174
Well…

528
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,635
These things happen in life.

529
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,803
You think you'll regret it if you say it,

530
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,931
but it bothers you if you don't.

531
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,352
-What?
-For example,

532
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,146
you saw my message to Na-eun
telling her how much the gifts cost

533
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,482
but you didn't say anything to her.

534
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,319
Hui-seon, how did you…

535
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,737
Does Na-eun know, too?

536
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,115
No, I'm the only one that knows.

537
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,786
Well, it's not important how I found out,
so let's move on.

538
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:40,667
What's important here is
why I'm going as far as to tell you this.

539
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:45,463
It's because I wanted to help you
clear up a misunderstanding.

540
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,632
A misunderstanding?

541
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,301
It's not because Na-eun is a snob
or a calculating person

542
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,637
that she added up the price
of the items she got.

543
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,889
It's because in that box,

544
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,933
there was a price tag left on an item.

545
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,853
So she wondered if she was supposed
to prepare the wedding gifts accordingly.

546
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,064
That's why she did that.

547
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,318
Even if it had a price tag on it,
how could she think that?

548
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,821
Yes, it didn't make sense.

549
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,698
Just like someone thinking

550
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,617
that their fiance is mad at them
for buying an expensive watch.

551
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,538
I was frustrated
because I didn't know why Na-eun was--

552
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,540
Na-eun must have been frustrated, too.

553
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,084
It doesn't seem like a big deal,

554
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,629
but it's something related
to her parents-in-law,

555
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,342
So Na-eun's been worrying all by herself.

556
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:36,180
Well, it was later confirmed
to be a mistake on the company's part,

557
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,393
but until then, it must have been
weighing heavily on her.

558
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,939
Also, with the added weight
of the reasons I spoke of earlier.

559
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,868
Who is it?

560
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,327
It's Jun-hyeong, Mother.

561
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,080
What?

562
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,332
Goodness. Hey, Jun-hyeong.

563
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,417
Come on in.

564
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,837
All right.

565
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,380
Have you eaten yet?

566
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,091
Goodness, yes. It's well past dinnertime.

567
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,092
Come on in.

568
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,011
Didn't you have dinner yet?

569
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,054
Yes, I have.

570
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,805
This is bread. Please have some.

571
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,058
I bought it from Na-eun's favorite bakery.

572
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,352
Did you two fight?

573
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,854
No, we didn't.

574
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,189
We don't fight.

575
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,732
I'm just being scolded.

576
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,111
Where's Na-eun?

577
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,669
Darn it.

578
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,239
I'm sorry.

579
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:22,203
I didn't understand the meaning
behind your gift and acted like a fool.

580
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,916
I want to give you a nice present too.

581
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,460
Because I want you to feel the way I felt

582
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,796
when I received the wedding gifts.

583
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,385
I was so engulfed in my excitement
of finding that watch

584
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,721
that I didn't even consider your feelings.

585
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,432
I was an idiot.

586
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,060
I didn't even thank you.

587
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,981
Like pouring gas onto a house on fire,

588
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,818
I misunderstood you
and hurt your feelings.

589
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,821
I was such a fool.

590
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,074
I'm sorry, Na-eun.

591
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,580
I won't let that happen again.

592
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,958
Don't be angry, okay?

593
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,631
I'm sorry.

594
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,271
I'll do my best so that
you don't feel sad all by yourself.

595
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,192
So forgive me, will you?

596
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,864
I swear on this watch.

597
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,783
But doesn't this watch look great on me?

598
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:55,213
I'll do my best
so that you don't have to suffer alone.

599
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,466
I'm sorry.

600
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,538
You'll be busy going around
looking at houses and furniture.

601
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,415
You could help them out.

602
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,875
Is that okay with you, Na-eun?

603
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,669
Did you make a list of appliances to get?

604
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,295
Wait, Na-eun.

605
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,548
How about we buy the dishwasher later?

606
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,592
-Why are you doing this?
-What did I do?

607
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,136
It seems like I tagged along
when I shouldn't have.

608
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,680
What would you do
if your mom left like that?

609
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,224
I wouldn't have created
this situation to begin with.

610
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,559
-What is it that's bothering you so much?
-Forget it, just go!

611
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,187
Na-eun.

612
00:37:55,189 --> 00:38:00,194
