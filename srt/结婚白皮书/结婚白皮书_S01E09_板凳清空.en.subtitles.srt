1
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,130
Did you get home safe?

2
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,056
If I apologize over the phone,
it'll just make her angrier.

3
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,988
NA-EUN

4
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,157
Na-eun.

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,450
Forget it, just go!

6
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,827
I can't do anything
while feeling like this.

7
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,038
Go home and try to fix things
with your mom.

8
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,874
I'll figure out the furniture on my own.

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,717
I'll just drink this and call her.

10
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,843
Okay.

11
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,198
HAPPY GAME WORLD
CATCH THE PASSING WINTER!

12
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,129
CALL HISTORY
MOM, JANG MIN-WOO

13
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,592
I should have called her when I was drunk,
but how did I hold out so well?

14
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,305
What should I do now?
She must be so angry.

15
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,268
NA-EUN

16
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,519
No.

17
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,355
It's already too late.

18
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,524
I might as well wash up, have breakfast,

19
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,652
and call her when my mind is clear.

20
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,538
EPISODE 9
BENCH-CLEARING BRAWL

21
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,471
Na-eun.

22
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,399
Are your stocks down?
Why are you staring at your phone all day?

23
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,402
Hui-seon.

24
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,490
So you went to look for furniture
with your mother-in-law on Saturday,

25
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,867
but she got angry and left.

26
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,746
Then Jun-hyeong left to comfort his mom,
but he hasn't contacted you yet?

27
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,292
Saturday night and all Sunday.
He still hasn't called me this morning.

28
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,295
-Is this some kind of a game?
-I think he wants to break up.

29
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,673
And I think you want to fight me.

30
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,468
That's not what I meant.

31
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:43,097
He left on Saturday like that,
and you didn't hear from him all weekend.

32
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,061
But Na-eun, what if he's not calling you
because he's mad too?

33
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,312
Why would he be mad?

34
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,523
Because you didn't go after his mom
with him, and you just left first.

35
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,234
That's outrageous!

36
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,277
It was Jun-hyeong who insisted on shopping

37
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,863
when I told him to go after his mom.

38
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,201
But then when we did go look,
he upset me by doing it half-heartedly.

39
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,913
But then I'm supposed to convince him
and go after his mother with him?

40
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,582
You have a point.

41
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,628
Yes, well, let's say he is angry.

42
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,506
But even still,
how could he leave like that

43
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,299
and not call me all weekend?

44
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,593
He's changed.

45
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,347
In the past, even when there was
the tiniest thing wrong,

46
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,517
he would be anxiously trying to solve it
any way he could.

47
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,559
Not anymore, though.

48
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,856
Now he just apologizes mechanically
to get out of the situation he's in.

49
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,402
I feel like I'm marrying
a totally different person.

50
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:43,283
When you prepare for marriage,
you see new sides of your partner.

51
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,119
Once you're married, you'll see even more.

52
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,745
More than now?

53
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,206
I can't even get used to
how he's acting now.

54
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,458
That's why I told you from the beginning

55
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,669
that marriage is not a happy ending.

56
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,963
Then what is a happy ending?

57
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,008
A good death?

58
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,094
I'm laughing because of you.

59
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,932
If you laughed, call him first.

60
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,726
Me?

61
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,521
If you apologize first,
the other person does too.

62
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,109
If you call them first and resolve things,
they'll make another mistake later,

63
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,736
then think, " it'll be fine."

64
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,036
Jun-hyeong is obviously the former.

65
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,081
If I apologize first, he will too.

66
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,791
But you said he's changed.

67
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,211
No, the basic personality traits
don't change.

68
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,509
Call him.

69
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,886
We're going now.

70
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,268
Aren't you so jealous of Na-eun?

71
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,271
Why would you be jealous
of all that stress?

72
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,274
I want to be stressed out
about a boyfriend too.

73
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,944
No, I technically am
stressed about a boyfriend.

74
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,029
What?

75
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,489
Because I can't find one.

76
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,742
Lower your standards,
you'll find one fast.

77
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,077
Gosh.

78
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,164
Says the woman who won't accept
anyone who's less than Jung Woo-sung.

79
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,793
That's why I decided to
only consider looks.

80
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,960
Nothing else.

81
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,423
Hui-seon, congratulations.

82
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,966
Pardon?

83
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,178
I saw you on my way out of
the office that day. He had a nice car.

84
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,813
What car? Hui-seon, did you buy a new car?

85
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,315
No, it was a gift from her boyfriend.

86
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,900
She was going back and forth

87
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,736
about whether to take
the keys to a sports car.

88
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,696
Gosh, I was kind of jealous.

89
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,907
Hui-seon, you're blessed.

90
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,325
No, that's not it.

91
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,410
He's not my boyfriend,
nor is that my car--

92
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,873
You said you'd only consider looks,
but he has a sports car too?

93
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,377
-No…
-Looks are important to you, Hui-seon?

94
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,003
Yes.

95
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,214
She only wants someone
of Jung Woo-sung's caliber.

96
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,966
He must have been so handsome, right?

97
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,808
I see you're already blinded by love.

98
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,476
Wait…

99
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,811
No way!

100
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,398
Hui-seon, so did you really find
a great guy this time?

101
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,899
A super handsome guy?

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,902
-No, that's not it.
-Gosh, I'm jealous.

103
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,904
I want one too.

104
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,579
JANG MIN-WOO

105
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,417
This is driving me nuts.

106
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,843
Moron.

107
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,434
NA-EUN

108
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,941
She's not talking to you either?

109
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,068
She did.

110
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,864
"Moron"?

111
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,282
What does that mean?

112
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,367
"Moron."

113
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,329
Maybe she wanted to curse at you
but did it so a roundabout way.

114
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,164
So she wrote "moron" instead.

115
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,124
What did I do to hear such harsh words?

116
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,335
Did I ghost her like you did
to your fiance?

117
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,795
What did I do wrong? Damn it.

118
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,088
I didn't ghost her.

119
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,758
I was going to call her,

120
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,928
but just the thought of it
made me feel exhausted…

121
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,930
After putting it off again and again…

122
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,681
That's how I got here.

123
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,647
You're the one who caused this
and you're sighing? Jeez.

124
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
But I have no regrets.

125
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,612
What?

126
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,990
The time I spent alone yesterday
without contacting her

127
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,410
was peaceful and happy.

128
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,913
Gosh, you…
Are you really having that hard of a time?

129
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,917
I'm wasting too much of my emotions.

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,087
I wish I could waste my emotions
on something like that.

131
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,840
You are right now. Much more than I am.

132
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,594
-Am I?
-She thinks of you as a moron,

133
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,930
but you're worried about what she meant.

134
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,433
Is there a greater waste
of emotion than that?

135
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,436
Gosh, this damn punk. How dare you?

136
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,813
You asshole!

137
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,526
Hey, you got a message.

138
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,199
Did you go to work? I've been
waiting for your call all weekend,

139
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,701
but you didn't even message me.

140
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,912
Is your mother still upset?

141
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,459
Let's have dinner together, all right?

142
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,651
Na-eun, I…

143
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,278
"I'm sorry?"

144
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,616
I want to order more noodles.

145
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,910
Is this the time to order more noodles?

146
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,746
Are you out of your mind?

147
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,748
This is driving me nuts.

148
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,708
Why did I bring up noodles?

149
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,837
I can't get nervous.
Things go south when I'm nervous.

150
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,381
Ma'am, can I have
another serving of noodles?

151
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,424
Coming up.

152
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,496
You must have been really hungry.

153
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,414
You're eating well.

154
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,338
I haven't had an appetite since Saturday,
so I haven't eaten since.

155
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,465
I don't think I got my appetite back.

156
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,092
You should at least eat a lot.

157
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,345
It's okay. Go ahead and eat.

158
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,598
I have to go on a diet
before the wedding, anyway.

159
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,439
Let's not be childish, Kim Na-eun.

160
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,902
-Na-eun, I want to apo--
-I'm sorry.

161
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,447
You were really upset on Saturday, right?

162
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,075
-What?
-During the weekend,

163
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,370
while we were out of contact,
I looked back on what happened.

164
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,747
I think I was shortsighted.

165
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,168
I should have persuaded you and
gone to talk to your mom together.

166
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,506
No, it's my fault.

167
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,801
As you said, I'm the one who created
the situation and escalated it.

168
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,094
But I took it out on you.

169
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,847
No, I'm the source of all this.

170
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,975
If I was uncomfortable
going out with your mom,

171
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,936
I should have spoken up
and said that I was.

172
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,106
No, Na-eun. It's me
who didn't contact you all weekend,

173
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,900
and who created that situation.
It's all on me.

174
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,612
Then let's agree we were both wrong,

175
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,240
and let's be careful
not to let this happen again.

176
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,661
Okay.

177
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,913
Let's do that.

178
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:34,170
So Jun-hyeong, let's go see the furniture
later when your mother is feeling better.

179
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,464
Why don't we go look
at places to live this week?

180
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,967
We're going with your mom, right?

181
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,635
My mom?

182
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,264
We don't know what to look for in a home,
so it'd be nice if she went with us.

183
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,184
Then, after that, we can go
eat some delicious food

184
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,852
and get some fresh air.

185
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,189
Okay, I'll talk to my mom.

186
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,568
Thank you.

187
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,612
For what?

188
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,698
I actually thought of all sorts of things
on my way here.

189
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,951
I felt like the way I used to feel
before a big exam.

190
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:10,206
I'm really thankful
that you're so understanding.

191
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,419
I'll do my best so that
this won't happen again.

192
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,133
If you apologize first,
the other person does too.

193
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,928
I knew it.

194
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,438
Of course.
Obviously, I should go with you.

195
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,564
Gosh, don't even try.

196
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,068
Don't think about taking your mom.
You two should go alone.

197
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,904
What do they know about housing?
Why would they go alone?

198
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,572
I should go and take a close look.

199
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,244
Yes, we don't know
what to look for in a home.

200
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,956
Don't worry. I have 20 years
of real estate experience.

201
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,290
I'm very knowledgeable.

202
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,169
You said you were uncomfortable
around your mother-in-law.

203
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,296
Jun-hyeong will feel the same way.

204
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,675
He needs to feel that discomfort too.

205
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,052
That way he won't carelessly
do things like

206
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,513
asking his mom to go
furniture shopping with them.

207
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,348
Look at your mom, jeez.

208
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,183
Mom, don't say that.

209
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,227
I don't want to fight with Jun-hyeong.

210
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,439
Gosh, I'm not sure. I think Jun-hyeong
needs to experience these discomforts

211
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,483
so he doesn't create
another situation like that.

212
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,945
If not, he'll always be
on your in-laws' side like your father.

213
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,533
If your dad felt even half of what
your grandmother did to me,

214
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,243
I wouldn't be living like this.

215
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,953
Gosh, here we go again.

216
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,747
I don't want to talk about it
anymore, either. Forget it.

217
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,501
Then should I go with dad?

218
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,878
Forget it.

219
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,880
I'll go talk to the real state office

220
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,132
and I'll write down anything
worth checking out.

221
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,633
You two go have a look.

222
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,552
Why are you doing that?

223
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,638
Do you think I'll go and harass Jun-hyeong

224
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,473
when he's going to be my son-in-law?

225
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,395
-Goodness.
-Gosh, don't worry.

226
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,857
I'm not so crazy as to spoil things
before my daughter's wedding.

227
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,823
Gosh, I'm telling you not to worry.
Just trust me.

228
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,077
Cheers!

229
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,829
Goodness…

230
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,600
Was she supposed to come?

231
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,689
Hello, Mother.

232
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,692
Na-eun, it's nice to see you so often.

233
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,613
-Hello, have you been well?
-Yes. Hello.

234
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,741
-How have you been doing, Mother?
-I've been doing well, of course.

235
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,621
Gosh, you should have told us
your mom was coming too.

236
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,373
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,502
Does it make you feel uncomfortable
that I came unannounced?

238
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,213
No, I'm not uncomfortable.

239
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,216
It just bothers me that
I may be a bit underdressed

240
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,593
to be greeting you today.

241
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,013
Gosh, no. You look great.

242
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,183
You were surprised
that I suddenly came, right?

243
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,687
Actually, I was worried if I should come.

244
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,648
I spent all night hesitating
and decided to come this morning.

245
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,358
That's why I couldn't let you know.

246
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,365
When you're not sure,
it's better to just not come.

247
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,746
Pardon?

248
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,875
No, I just wondered
why you would worry about that.

249
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,254
It's your son's first home,
so I'm glad you're here to look together.

250
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,966
Thank you for saying that.

251
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,137
After this, let's all go
get something good to eat together.

252
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,808
Actually, I have something
to make up for with Na-eun

253
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,854
so I made a reservation
at a Chinese place that I frequent.

254
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,274
No, you didn't make a mistake.
It wasn't anything like that.

255
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,194
No, because of me,
you couldn't look at any furniture.

256
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,656
I wouldn't feel good about
just moving on from that.

257
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,409
You really don't have to do that…

258
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,370
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

259
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,169
Are you okay with a Chinese restaurant?

260
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,005
Yes, sure, I'd love to.

261
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,926
How lucky is Na-eun
to have a mother-in-law

262
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,846
who micromanages her so meticulously?

263
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,391
"Micromanage"?

264
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:45,147
Oh, I'm saying that you're very attentive.

265
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,153
Thank you for recognizing that.

266
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,159
I'll make sure to micromanage Na-eun
as if she were my own daughter.

267
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,085
Why does your skin
look so good today, Mother?

268
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,587
-Did you get a facial?
-No, why?

269
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,256
Your face is glowing.
Is that your natural aura?

270
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,510
Gosh, my son-in-law has
such a great sense of humor.

271
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,896
Where are you going now?

272
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,689
I'm taking you home.

273
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,901
-Seo Jun-hyeong!
-Mom, please.

274
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,321
I'm not just going with Na-eun.
Na-eun's mom will be there too.

275
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,074
It wouldn't be polite
for you to come unnoticed.

276
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,910
I'm only going
because Na-eun's mom will be there.

277
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,121
But, why? So you can get even with her?

278
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,414
Are you kidding me right now?

279
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,919
You're right, it's not the situation
to be joking. So please go home.

280
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,754
You think I'm doing this for nothing?

281
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,464
That day…

282
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,386
Anyway, I want to apologize
to Na-eun for that day

283
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,390
and promise that I won't interfere
in your affairs from now on.

284
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,143
If that's the case, let's make plans
for another day--

285
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,646
It'd be uncomfortable for Na-eun
to make plans for a different day.

286
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,192
It's better to say everything
while her mom is there.

287
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,246
This is great.

288
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,707
This is the perfect home for a newlywed.

289
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,293
-I see everything is facing the southeast.
-Yes.

290
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,586
You know your stuff.

291
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,212
All right, come this way.

292
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,255
Let's go.

293
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,471
Yes, come on in, yes.

294
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,516
All right, please have a look around.

295
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,030
This place is nice, right?

296
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,908
There's a park nearby
so the surrounding area is pleasant.

297
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,492
This place is very spacious too.

298
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,747
And above all, this place is newly built.

299
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,125
Goodness, this place
is really nice and clean.

300
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,127
It's very open and facing the south,

301
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,754
so there will be plenty of sunlight.

302
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,049
It's well structured with a park nearby.
It's nice. What do you think?

303
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,344
It is nice, but it's too far
from the subway.

304
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,179
This place is pretty close to the station.

305
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,599
You see? There.
You see the subway station there, right?

306
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,267
Mr. Kim.

307
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,937
Don't pull that
on a fellow real estate agent.

308
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,356
Just because it's visible
doesn't mean it's close.

309
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,275
But it only takes ten minutes
to walk from here.

310
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,735
I'd say that's close.

311
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,488
Goodness, Mr. Kim.
You must have gotten quite healthy.

312
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,406
You can walk that distance in ten minutes?

313
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,076
I doubt I could make it here
in 20 minutes even if I ran.

314
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,578
Her health must be suffering.

315
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,082
You know it's hard to find
leased homes these days.

316
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,708
We were barely able to see this one.

317
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,754
Goodness, you seem to have
some great connections.

318
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,924
You have a person like him
to show us such a nice home.

319
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,885
You must like this place.

320
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,473
Yes, I do like it.
It seems perfect for them as newlyweds.

321
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,226
Well, the surrounding area is nice,

322
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,313
and, above all, it's newly built
so there won't be much to fix.

323
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:18,610
This place is nice,
but the location isn't great.

324
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,114
Since Na-eun takes the subway to work,

325
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,450
it'll be best to find a home
that's near a subway station.

326
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:32,291
Well, Jun-hyeong could drop her off
at the station by car in the morning.

327
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,086
And walking back on the way home would
be good exercise, don't you think?

328
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,089
Goodness, don't say that.

329
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:44,052
Na-eun gets so exhausted after work,
that even now she barely makes it home.

330
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,265
So to say she should walk that far
after work is a bit…

331
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,355
It's asking too much, Mom.

332
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,357
It'd be hard for me to walk that far, too.

333
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,447
You're right. I was a bit shortsighted.

334
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,324
No, it's okay, Mother.

335
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,535
Mom, since I have a car,

336
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,871
let's find a place that makes it easier

337
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,123
for Na-eun to commute
as her mom suggested.

338
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,628
You're okay with that, right?

339
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,549
Yes, well…

340
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,759
Of course.

341
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,407
There's a supermarket,
and it's close to the station,

342
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,077
making it easy for both Jun-hyeong
and Na-eun to commute.

343
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,121
It's close to your house and
easy to get to Jun-hyeong's mom's.

344
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,416
Although the home was built
in the '90s, look.

345
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,418
Considering the surrounding
infrastructure,

346
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,422
it's great when you think about
the value of the investment.

347
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,550
Of course, it's in a big complex,
near a station, and in a school district.

348
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,760
What do you say?

349
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,970
Yes, I…

350
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,183
Even if you split the housework,

351
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,144
women always end up doing it once more.

352
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,980
It'll be good to choose a place
that she's comfortable in.

353
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,984
Yes, I also think that
Na-eun's comfort is the top priority.

354
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,779
Goodness, no. Na-eun shouldn't be
the only one comfortable.

355
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,614
You should like it too.

356
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,492
-Yes, well, I do like it.
-How about you?

357
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:35,288
I like it. It's only 30 minutes to work
by subway from here.

358
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,207
That's true,

359
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,334
but there's tons of traffic
even at this hour,

360
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,711
so when Jun-hyeong is
getting back home from work…

361
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,301
Why doesn't Jun-hyeong
try using public transportation?

362
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,096
You can save money on gas
and get some exercise.

363
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,475
It'll be uncomfortable for someone
who's been commuting by car

364
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,394
to adjust to public transportation.

365
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:01,773
And this place looks older
than Jun-hyeong.

366
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,316
It's just too gloomy here

367
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,695
for them to start their new life
as a married couple.

368
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,572
Na-eun.

369
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,493
Wouldn't it be nice to start
your newlywed life in a brighter place?

370
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,080
A bright place would be nice, but…

371
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,123
Right.

372
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,292
Ms. Park is right about that.

373
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:24,296
For a newlywed couple,
this place is quite old

374
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,174
-and it hasn't been fixed up…
-Right, Ms. Lee?

375
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:31,720
Gosh, that's right, Na-eun. See?
Even your mother agrees.

376
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:36,766
So, let's go with the place from before,
and Na-eun could get a car--

377
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,393
I'm sorry Ms. Park.

378
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,983
Why don't we consider buying it?

379
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,651
What?

380
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,990
-Are you saying we should buy this place?
-Yes.

381
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,993
As you said, this place is quite old

382
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,663
and I also don't think it'll be good
for the kids as their first home.

383
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:03,210
But if we get it all fixed up
and decorated before they move in,

384
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,213
they won't need to move again later.
I think it would be good.

385
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,797
Yes, that's great.

386
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,759
There's an urgent sale out
on the eighth floor across from here.

387
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,260
Really? How much?

388
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,847
If you pay in full within the month…

389
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,767
It'll be cheaper by 50,000,000 won.
Should I make a call now?

390
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,269
Yes. Let's have a look first.

391
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,812
Okay, just a moment.

392
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,314
Give me a moment.

393
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,398
Wait…

394
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,651
I know what you mean, Ms. Lee,

395
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,488
but to buy a place, our budget is…

396
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,783
Gosh, if we do end up buying it,
our family would obviously pitch in too.

397
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,953
And if it's not enough,
the kids could take out a loan.

398
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,956
Mom, would that be okay?

399
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,582
No.

400
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,794
Who buys a place so impulsively like this?

401
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,594
Yes, it is very sudden,

402
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,806
but now that we're here,
it seems like a great deal.

403
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,183
They have a unit for sale too.

404
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,643
But still, I think it's better

405
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,479
to be careful since there would be
a lot of money involved.

406
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,816
Let's agree to
think about this slowly later.

407
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,235
Let's go, guys.

408
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,741
Are you not coming, Jun-hyeong?

409
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,410
Jun-hyeong.

410
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,503
Jeez.

411
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,804
-Are you really going to be this way?
-What did I do?

412
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,724
Na-eun's mom was talking
and you cut her off and left.

413
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,851
Then did I have to keep listening to her?

414
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,060
Mom!

415
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,396
Na-eun's mom is the one at fault here.

416
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,440
Our family is providing 500 million won.

417
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,152
Isn't it impolite to talk about
buying a home without talking to us?

418
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,321
And 500 million won
isn't a small amount of money.

419
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,699
Obviously, it's something that
we should have been consulted about.

420
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,284
Mom, please!

421
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,286
What? What about you?

422
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,705
Get it together.

423
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,958
Why is Na-eun's comfort the top priority
when looking for a home?

424
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,629
Seriously, if I hadn't followed you,
you would have fallen for it.

425
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,048
Was that why you came?

426
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,426
Not to promise that you wouldn't
interfere in our marriage?

427
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,387
That too, among other things.

428
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,892
You need to think about it too.

429
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,895
After the three of us
went furniture shopping,

430
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,647
you're going with Na-eun and her mom
to look for a home?

431
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,776
Gosh, it was just a recipe for trouble.

432
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,445
What are you saying right now?

433
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,365
I was the one
who suggested that we do that!

434
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,160
-What?
-Na-eun's mom is a real estate expert.

435
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,828
Obviously, we should get her help.

436
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,458
Well, even if that's the case…

437
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,003
Anyway, Na-eun shouldn't
have done that either.

438
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,297
After I left that day,

439
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,759
she didn't send me a single message
asking if I was okay.

440
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,844
She didn't ask me if I was okay, either.

441
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,221
Why bring that up now?

442
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,683
Even if it wasn't me,
if someone leaves like that,

443
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,020
it's basic manners to check on them.

444
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,065
I've brought it up
because she crossed the line.

445
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,318
So now you're bringing up manners?

446
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,195
Because you're upset about the house?

447
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,530
Upset?

448
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,990
I'm talking about manners!

449
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,202
Seriously…

450
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,294
How unreasonable.

451
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,797
Mom, don't say that.

452
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,801
Let's lease a place
that Jun-hyeong's mom likes.

453
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,971
Why pick a place that she likes
when you're going to live in it?

454
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,974
If it's because they're providing money,
we can split it in half.

455
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,518
Even if I need to get a loan,
I'll get that money for you.

456
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,020
Mom.

457
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,148
If you suddenly bring up buying a place,

458
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,192
Jun-hyeong's mom would
obviously be flustered.

459
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,612
I know that, but it's an urgent sale.

460
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:03,241
If you don't buy that place now,
you won't be able to buy it in a year.

461
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,951
I get it. I do.

462
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,496
But if his mother is so against it,
how can we buy that place?

463
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,293
Also, if we get on her bad side
before Jun-hyeong and I even get married,

464
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,044
you know it'll only make life hard for me.

465
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,921
I'm doing this because I know that.

466
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:21,718
People always push boundaries to see
just how far they can go.

467
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,763
If we show them
that they can't push us around,

468
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,973
they won't try to
cross our boundaries again.

469
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,392
So what should we do?

470
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,394
We need to stay firm on this.

471
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,855
If we fold here,
it's likely going to be all over.

472
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,732
Mom…

473
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,027
Stop that and listen carefully
to what I'm saying.

474
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,696
Why do you think his mom came out today?

475
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,075
She told us earlier.
She wanted to apologize to me--

476
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,745
That's just something she tacked on.

477
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,372
The real reason is because
I was going to be there.

478
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,584
The wedding hall is the one that we chose,

479
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,170
and if we also get the home we like,

480
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,464
that means we've gotten the upper hand.

481
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,883
And she doesn't like that.

482
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,720
Mom, this is not the time
for conspiracy theories.

483
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,305
Conspiracy theories?

484
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,849
I suffered under my mother-in-law
for over 30 years.

485
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,976
I can see what an in-law is up to.

486
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,981
I can't bear to watch my daughter suffer
at the hands of her mother-in-law.

487
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,068
The issue was about
whether we buy or lease the place,

488
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,569
so how does that fit in?

489
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:26,157
Having a daughter is no longer something
to be ashamed of these days.

490
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,535
We should be proud of having one instead.

491
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,339
What would you like to have, Mother?

492
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,343
You said you were a regular here, right?

493
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,137
What's good here?

494
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,812
Na-eun.

495
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814
Yes?

496
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,901
Would you rather buy a place or lease one?

497
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,321
I, well…

498
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,950
Mom, what are you doing?

499
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,828
Well, it's not like
I said something wrong.

500
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,414
I was just curious what she thought.

501
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,002
Don't ask her.
You can talk to me about that.

502
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:25,258
It'll be their home, so their opinions
are what's important here.

503
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,260
Yes, you are right about that,

504
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,014
but what do you think Na-eun would say
in a situation like this?

505
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,933
What's wrong with this situation?

506
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,941
Jun-hyeong, you talk first.
Which place do you like best?

507
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,905
Well…

508
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,032
Mom, why are you doing this?

509
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,621
It may seem like I'm rushing things
in your eyes,

510
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,206
but I don't think
you should pass up this chance.

511
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,376
A large apartment complex,
near a subway, school, and a supermarket…

512
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,545
That place is a gem
in the real estate world.

513
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,798
It's an urgent sale on top of that.
We have to get this place.

514
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,384
Jun-hyeong, you've heard that

515
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,095
housing prices in Seoul
are at their cheapest today, right?

516
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,847
Yes, of course.

517
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,183
Since you're an expert,
I respect your opinion.

518
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,519
Na-eun, you've heard
housing prices in Seoul

519
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,480
are at their highest now, right?

520
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,607
Yes, I've heard that.

521
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,150
Exactly.

522
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,278
So there's no need to rush into it.

523
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,199
You two can lease a place first
and apply for a housing program.

524
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,243
I'm sorry to cut in while you're talking,

525
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,038
but I've already looked into those.

526
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,041
Na-eun and Jun-hyeong
are above the income requirements,

527
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,001
so they don't qualify for those programs.

528
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,672
Then they would need to apply
for a family housing program,

529
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,507
they have no chance with just two kids.

530
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,760
Do you think you can have
three or four kids?

531
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,180
Gosh.

532
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,808
The real estate policies
are always changing, so--

533
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,018
The real estate prices
are always changing too.

534
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,152
Excuse me.

535
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,824
I need to run to the bathroom.

536
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,838
Seriously, Mom…

537
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,094
Goodness…

538
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,930
Are you okay?

539
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,224
Yes.

540
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,185
This housing issue isn't easy.

541
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,520
You're right.

542
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,148
I'll try to get them on a different topic.

543
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,316
I don't think
that's going to solve the issue.

544
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,820
So what should we do?

545
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,115
What do you want to do about our place?

546
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,658
Let's think about that later.

547
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,994
Let's focus on
resolving their dispute today.

548
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,664
I don't think that is
going to solve anything.

549
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,459
It's better that we decide
what we want to do,

550
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,879
whether it's buying or leasing,
and tell them our decision.

551
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,882
Then we can either convince them
or compromise with them.

552
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,343
Do we really need to do that now?
Let's talk about it later.

553
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,389
Jun-hyeong, there's not much time left
before our wedding.

554
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,599
We don't have time.

555
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,602
Rather than having to go to
each side of the family,

556
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,688
-we should figure out what we--
-Fine, let's go with what you want.

557
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,398
I'm fine with both.

558
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,816
What would you like to do?

559
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,364
"I don't want to deal with this situation
so I'm leaving it up to you."

560
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,408
That's what that sounds like to me.

561
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,204
No, that's not what I meant.

562
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,873
I wanted to talk about this later
and you wouldn't listen.

563
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,208
That's not it.

564
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:49,295
Just getting over the situation at hand
is not going to solve the actual problem.

565
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,257
Here we go again.

566
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,596
"Here we go again"? What are you saying?

567
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,992
Tell me. What did you mean by that?

568
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,455
Na-eun, let's not do this.

569
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,959
I don't want to fight with you.
And I don't like to waste my emotions.

570
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,420
Our mothers are out there,
so let's not do this here.

571
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,381
Let's talk about it later alone.

572
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,549
So what if we're alone?

573
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,219
Every time a serious topic comes up,
you always make me decide

574
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,888
or try to apologize your way out of it.

575
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,599
That's because I don't want to
fight with you.

576
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,476
I'm sick and tired of doing this.

577
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,230
Is that why you keep giving me
empty apologies as if it's your hobby?

578
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,360
You don't like that I apologize to you?
Then should I just not apologize?

579
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,487
What?

580
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,907
I give in to what you want
not to avoid a fight.

581
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,618
I just want to do what you like
and go with what you want.

582
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,829
Why are you nitpicking at what I say?

583
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,084
Nitpicking? You think I'm nitpicking?

584
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,088
Let's just move on from this.

585
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,466
I'm already on edge worrying about
our moms being offended.

586
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,676
Not you too…

587
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,053
And who's the person
who created this situation

588
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,097
after what happened
at the furniture store?

589
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,559
Should I not have come?

590
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,900
Mother, not that's not what I meant…

591
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,359
Mom.

592
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,862
I'll explain everything.

593
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,532
You be quiet. I have something
I'd like to ask Na-eun.

594
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,619
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,748
I don't want to hear an apology,
nor am I scolding you.

596
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,252
I'm sincerely curious.
How do you really feel?

597
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,839
-Mother…
-You say you're okay with something,

598
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,926
but then tell Jun-hyeong off like this.
I don't understand.

599
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,430
I'm sorry.

600
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,727
Don't say you're sorry.

601
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,189
You need to explain this to me
so I can understand you.

602
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,486
Do you really not know?
Or are you pretending not to know?

603
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,154
Mother.

604
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,239
Mom.

605
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,017
I told you not to get them involved
and just go with him!

606
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,435
Why did you have to do that?

607
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,021
Why are you telling Na-eun off?
Not you too!

608
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,148
The wedding shoot is this Saturday.

609
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,900
A wedding shoot in this situation?

610
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,653
How can we take wedding photos
feeling this uncomfortable?

611
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,030
Are you asking me to make you feel better?

612
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,658
I created this situation
and dragged everyone into it.

613
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,368
It's all because of me.

614
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,536
I'm the bad guy.

615
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,495
Jun-hyeong!

616
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,038
So what is it that you want?

617
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,332
Do you want this wedding
to get called off?

618
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:20,214
