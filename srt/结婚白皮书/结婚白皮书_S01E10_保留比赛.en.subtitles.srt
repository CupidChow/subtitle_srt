1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,372
Here we go again.

2
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,585
"Here we go again"? What are you saying?

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,212
Na-eun, let's not do this.

4
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,716
I don't want to fight with you.

5
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,136
Our mothers are out there,
so let's not do this here.

6
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,888
Let's talk about it later alone.

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,181
So what if we're alone?

8
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,851
Every time a serious topic comes up,
you always make me decide

9
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,520
or try to apologize your way out of it.

10
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,231
That's because I don't want to
fight with you.

11
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,108
I'm sick and tired of doing this.

12
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,820
Is that why you keep giving me
empty apologies as if it's your hobby?

13
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,033
You don't like that I apologize to you?
Then should I just not apologize?

14
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,452
What?

15
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,455
I give in to what you want
not to avoid a fight.

16
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,124
I just want to do what you like
and go with what you want.

17
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,752
Why are you nitpicking at what I say?

18
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,507
Nitpicking? You think I'm nitpicking?

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,675
Let's just move on from this.

20
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,054
I'm already on edge worrying about
our moms being offended.

21
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,305
Not you too…

22
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,557
And who's the person
who created this situation

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,726
after what happened
at the furniture store?

24
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,229
Should I not have come?

25
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,067
Mother, not that's not it…

26
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,152
Mom.

27
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,239
-I'll explain everything.
-You be quiet.

28
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,741
I have something I'd like to ask Na-eun.

29
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,953
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,375
Don't say you're sorry.

31
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,711
You need to explain this to me
so I can understand you.

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,092
Do you really not know?
Or are you pretending not to know?

33
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,802
Mother.

34
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,886
Mom.

35
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,889
As a woman, it's problematic not knowing

36
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,308
what it's like for her to be
with her mother-in-law.

37
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,310
And it's the same
if you're pretending not to know.

38
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,354
Problematic?

39
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,776
Mom, what are you saying right now?

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,987
It's just that I made a mistake--

41
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,990
No. Mother, I'm the one
that made the mistake.

42
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,909
-So please--
-You stay quiet.

43
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,873
Da-ryung, if you have
something to say, say it.

44
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,125
What exactly is the problem?

45
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,506
Do you really not know that it's difficult
for a woman to befriend her mother-in-law?

46
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,261
That's just a stereotype.

47
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,389
I don't want that sort of
uncomfortable relationship with Na-eun,

48
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,850
so I'm working really hard
to be good to her--

49
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,271
Even if you try to be good to her,
it can still make her uncomfortable.

50
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,524
Why are you saying that?

51
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,360
Mom, please stop…

52
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,946
Mom.

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,241
Why are you acting like this?
Why are you always taking Na-eun's side?

54
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,702
I'm not taking sides, Mom. But it's--

55
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,122
I'm sorry, Mother.
That's not what my mom is trying to say--

56
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,832
Why are you apologizing?

57
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,252
Honestly, Mi-sook knows well
just how uncomfortable

58
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,548
it'd be for a daughter-in-law to go
furniture shopping with her mother-in-law.

59
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,591
Mom.

60
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:40,637
I went because Na-eun said
she wanted me to go.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,890
If she had told me, I wouldn't have gone.

62
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,141
Na-eun, you too…

63
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:50,063
You could've just turned me down from
the beginning. Why create this situation?

64
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,732
And what did you tell your mother
about me for her to--

65
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,816
Mom!

66
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,154
Please stop.

67
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:00,990
Seo Jun-hyeong.

68
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,743
This is all my fault.

69
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,664
It's my fault things escalated
to this point too, so scold me.

70
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,714
Mother, I'm sorry.

71
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,050
We'll leave first. I'll contact you later.

72
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,888
Hey, Jun-hyeong.

73
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,442
EPISODE 10
SUSPENDED GAME

74
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,825
Get in.

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,538
How could you
yell at your mother like that?

76
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,832
Especially, in front of Na-eun
and her mother?

77
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,086
-Get in first.
-Do you think this is my fault?

78
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,674
You know how hard I've tried
to treat Na-eun well.

79
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,053
After all that, she pretends to like it
but then berates you from behind.

80
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,097
Wouldn't that make me upset?

81
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,476
Don't scold Na-eun. This is all my fault.

82
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,646
Are you really taking her side even now?

83
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,024
I'm not taking sides!

84
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,818
I created this situation
and dragged everyone into it.

85
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,362
It's all because of me. I'm the bad guy.

86
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,447
Jun-hyeong!

87
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,407
What do you want me to do?

88
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,367
I'm doing my best,

89
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,662
but if you keep acting like this,
what am I supposed to do?

90
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,372
So what is it that you want?

91
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,583
Do you want this wedding
to get called off?

92
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,837
-How can you say that?
-If not that, then what?

93
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,590
What do you want me to do?

94
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,362
Jeez, so you finally did it.

95
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,947
Dad.

96
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,371
It's because you weren't there.

97
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,042
How could I sit and watch
when his mom was going after her?

98
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,127
You could have said it nicely.

99
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,006
Nothing good will come out
of having conflict with his mom.

100
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,758
How can you say that?

101
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:28,012
You're the one who did something wrong,
so what's wrong with saying that?

102
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,390
If this causes problems with the wedding,
will you take responsibility?

103
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,601
Don't scold mom too much.

104
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,769
The same goes for you.

105
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,480
I told you not to get them involved
and just go with him!

106
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,273
Why did you have to do that?

107
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,904
Why are you telling Na-eun off?
Not you too!

108
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,198
You think you have the right
to raise your voice?

109
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,908
Whatever. This is so annoying!

110
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,328
She's so smart
and graduated from a good university.

111
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,081
It's annoying to see her
lower her head and be anxious,

112
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,627
and it's annoying that she has to
go through what I did with my in-laws!

113
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,838
-Jeez.
-This is all your mom's fault, you know?

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,798
Why are you bringing up my mom?

115
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,513
Jeez.

116
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,973
Gosh, seriously.

117
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,576
Mother, did you make it home safely?

118
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,454
I'm sorry for…

119
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,125
I don't want to hear an apology.

120
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,171
I'm sincerely curious.
How do you really feel?

121
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,771
Na-eun, you're also in the wrong.

122
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,149
Why did you cause all of this?

123
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,152
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,862
I'm sorry, Mother.

125
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,530
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:16,621
Do you really not know that it's difficult
for a woman to befriend her mother-in-law?

127
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,372
Why are you saying that?

128
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,415
Mom.

129
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,461
Why are you acting like this?
Why are you always taking Na-eun's side?

130
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,426
What do you want me to do?

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,931
I'm doing my best, but if you keep acting
like this, what am I supposed to do?

132
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,376
That's because
I don't want to fight with you.

133
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,586
I'm sick and tired of this.

134
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,131
You don't like that I apologize to you?
Then should I just not apologize?

135
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,465
Jun-hyeong.

136
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,511
Jun-hyeong.

137
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,774
It was me.

138
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,278
Yes. Did you need something?

139
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,031
Aren't you done
with the proposal review yet?

140
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,575
Proposal?

141
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,411
You…

142
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,872
The Simple Water Supply Policy Proposal.

143
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,459
It's supposed to be reviewed
and reported on this morning.

144
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,585
Yes, sir.

145
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,212
I'll send it over right now.

146
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,465
Hey, you really…

147
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,051
Why have you been so out of it lately?

148
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,095
I can understand you're busy
with your wedding preparations,

149
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,765
but if it keeps affecting your work…

150
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,433
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,310
Please be more careful.

152
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,413
Hey. Gosh, you punk.

153
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,290
Drink this and pull yourself together.

154
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,712
Did you fight with Na-eun again?

155
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,839
You think I only fought with Na-eun?

156
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,258
Then what, who did you fight with?

157
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,514
What? What happened?

158
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,059
You talk to Hui-seon, right?

159
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,144
Didn't she say anything?

160
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,189
Forget about all that.

161
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,483
I think she blocked me, dammit.

162
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,819
Jeez.

163
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,322
Do you

164
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,951
talk to my mom, by chance?

165
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,079
Why would I talk to your mom?

166
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,540
Could you do it now?
Ask her how she's doing.

167
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,960
Do you talk to my mom?
You don't, so why should I?

168
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,798
You fought with your mom?

169
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,385
Wait, looking at your state,
it seems worse than that.

170
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,512
Well…

171
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,515
Did Na-eun and your mom get into it?
Is this round two?

172
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,933
I don't know.

173
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,145
I just want to forget about marriage

174
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,814
and go and hide somewhere.

175
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,108
Hey…

176
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,738
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

177
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,284
You remember the wedding shoot
is this Saturday, right?

178
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,703
Come to the makeup studio
on time with the bride.

179
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,288
Jeez.

180
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,252
COME TO THE MAKEUP STUDIO
ON TIME WITH THE GROOM

181
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,214
The pork cutlet is good, right?

182
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,759
What's with you? Did something happen?

183
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,094
What should I do?

184
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,638
The wedding shoot is this Saturday.

185
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,515
So what?

186
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,477
How can I have my wedding shoot
in this situation?

187
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,147
Our moms fought
and Jun-hyeong and I are in a cold war.

188
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,442
Well, regardless of the situation,
you have to do the wedding shoot.

189
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,403
Right. If you don't,
that's a couple of million down the drain.

190
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,530
Money isn't the problem here.

191
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,366
Not doing the wedding shoot at this point

192
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,994
is like saying you won't go through
with the wedding.

193
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,414
Make up with Jun-hyeong
and have your wedding shoot.

194
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,959
We'll only end up fighting again.

195
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,836
Na-eun.

196
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,049
I haven't had
even a single quiet day lately.

197
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,968
This is killing me.

198
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,970
That's what wedding planning is like.

199
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,474
Why do you think a lot of couples
break up during the planning process?

200
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,268
That's quite ironic,

201
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,188
breaking up while preparing
to spend your lives together.

202
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,398
I've been through it before, so I know.

203
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,652
Wedding planning is kind of like
doing a group project.

204
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,571
And I'm the group leader.

205
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,698
You think it'd be easy

206
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,159
because the deadline was set
and our task was clear,

207
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,455
but your team goes out of control,
and coordinating opinions is even harder.

208
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,833
The deadline keeps approaching
and you're the only one left working.

209
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,168
What's more annoying is

210
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,215
that the rest of the group won't
help me at all while they complain.

211
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,427
You end up taking the blame
for everything.

212
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,931
That's exactly it. A group assignment.

213
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,809
I don't want to be the leader anymore.

214
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,812
Just hang in there a bit longer.
The deadline is almost here.

215
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,730
Hui-seon.

216
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,525
I don't think I can do
the wedding shoot like this.

217
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,403
Then what are you going to do?
Just suck it up and do it.

218
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,613
It's your one and only wedding shoot.

219
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,284
You can't guarantee
it'll be her one and only.

220
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,037
Right, you can't guarantee it.

221
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,297
Your mom isn't doing very well.
Give her a call.

222
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,405
You're taking the bus?

223
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,574
The bus takes longer.

224
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,827
If I go home early,
my mom might pester me.

225
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,333
Do you want to get a drink?

226
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,542
No.

227
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,297
I'd rather take some quiet time
to organize my thoughts.

228
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,553
Why don't you

229
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,765
go to Jun-hyeong and try talking to him
about everything instead?

230
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,769
I don't think I can do that.

231
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,813
Why not?

232
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,901
I feel like I might fall off a cliff
if I make one mistake.

233
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,280
I feel like I'm on the edge
of that cliff now.

234
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,052
Is your face paralyzed?

235
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,472
You told me to show off my looks
and not my wealth.

236
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,062
You better close that mouth
unless you want to get disqualified.

237
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,234
I forgave you even though you called me
a moron and this is what I get?

238
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,446
That's because you brought that car
to our company building

239
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,448
and started all sorts of wild rumors.

240
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,034
-Those rumors made me…
-If you want them to stop,

241
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,744
why don't we make them come true?

242
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,080
I asked you to meet me today
because of Jun-hyeong and Na-eun.

243
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,042
You heard what happened
when they went house hunting

244
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,460
with their moms, right?

245
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,963
This is the first time I'm hearing that.
So that's why he said that!

246
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,424
Anyway, their wedding shoot is this week,

247
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,552
but they still haven't made up.
This is really serious.

248
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,095
So let's try to help them.

249
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,891
Jeez, I can't even help myself.
How can I help someone else?

250
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,769
-What?
-I mean,

251
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,896
I still don't know whose car you got into

252
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,732
the night Jun-hyeong delivered
the traditional wedding box.

253
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,901
So, how can I expect to help someone else?

254
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,902
Come on.

255
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,571
Why would you want to know that?

256
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,074
Do I need to tell you again?
I'm interested in you.

257
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,241
No.

258
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,744
No, I get it. Please stop saying it.

259
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,623
It was my ex-husband.

260
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,960
Ex-husband?

261
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,756
And you got into his car at night?
Isn't it over between you two?

262
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,510
I have, but we still have
a debt to take care of.

263
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,803
A debt?

264
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,972
We didn't have enough money for a home,
so we took out a loan.

265
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,224
That was why we divorced.

266
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,018
So, be careful with loans

267
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,020
and take marriage seriously. Okay?

268
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,189
No, I just like doing things easily.

269
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,777
Now that you've got your answer,
let's move on.

270
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,698
Bring Jun-hyeong
to the bar tomorrow by 7 p.m.

271
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,367
I'll bring Na-eun.

272
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,160
Then, what next?

273
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,372
We'll carefully get them
to make up over drinks.

274
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,625
They must be tired and sensitive
from being so focused

275
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,544
on the wedding preparations.

276
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,964
If they can relax,
they'll be able to naturally make up.

277
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,842
You know how close they were before,
don't you?

278
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,345
I know just how lovey-dovey they were.

279
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,599
But can't we be like that, too?

280
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,977
No.

281
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,982
Seriously, I don't feel like drinking
right now!

282
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,109
If you won't drink,
at least have some water.

283
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,611
This place here has great water. Come on.

284
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,905
-Let's go in.
-Seriously.

285
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,533
Are you crazy?

286
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,369
-Hey!
-Hey, right here.

287
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,464
What?

288
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,844
If Na-eun was going to be here,
you should have told me!

289
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,847
If I had told you, do you think
you would have come?

290
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,974
But still, damn it…

291
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,226
Stop complaining.

292
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,562
Hui-seon and I will lighten up the mood,

293
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,731
so just try to make up with her.

294
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,150
This isn't a problem we can fix like this.

295
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,444
Then what?

296
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,403
I'm sorry.

297
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,822
I'm sorry for arranging this
without telling you.

298
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,781
What?

299
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,619
I know that you two would fix things
if we just left you to it,

300
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,496
but something you said yesterday
bothered me.

301
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,624
What did I say?

302
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,793
That you felt like you were
on the edge of a cliff.

303
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,133
It's hard to resolve things
when you're on edge like that.

304
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,136
I know that feeling all too well

305
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,056
so I pushed things a little.

306
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,350
I know.

307
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,268
I understand what you're trying to do,

308
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,187
but I just…

309
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,564
I'm so confused right now.

310
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,317
Na-eun.

311
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,069
Just remember this.

312
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,321
If you don't make up with her today,

313
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,782
you'll have to do your wedding shoot
like this tomorrow.

314
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,455
So take the chance we're giving you,

315
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,582
and do whatever you can
to make up with her.

316
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,105
Well, shall we drink now?

317
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,815
-Shall we?
-Yes.

318
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,149
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

319
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,985
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

320
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,779
Why are you drinking juice?

321
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,656
I drove here.

322
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,917
Do something.

323
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,170
Sitting awkwardly like this reminds me

324
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,424
of those blind dates we used to
go on in college, don't you think?

325
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,928
Hello, my name is Jang Min-woo.

326
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,641
Doesn't it remind you of that, Hui-seon?

327
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,936
No. It's been so long
that I don't remember.

328
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,482
Walking on eggshells like this

329
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:02,154
reminds me of all those hard times
at my in-law's house.

330
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,705
Gosh, give us a break, will you?

331
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,125
I'm trying to lighten the mood
by bringing up this sad story.

332
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,002
How can you not laugh?

333
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,670
I'll laugh for you.

334
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,841
You are so funny.

335
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,678
Why are you laughing like an idiot?

336
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,306
How could you say that?

337
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,267
Gosh, did you hear that?
Thank goodness, I did it on purpose.

338
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,729
Goodness, what a brutal joke.

339
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,609
This won't do. What should we do?

340
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,945
Okay. Why don't we play darts?
The loser pays for the drinks.

341
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,113
-Sounds great.
-Okay.

342
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,907
-Then we'll be on one team.
-Okay.

343
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,326
-You and Na-eun will be a team, okay?
-Yes, a team.

344
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,535
-Okay.
-Let's go.

345
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,620
-Let's go.
-Go quickly.

346
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,163
-Let's do darts.
-Come on. Hurry.

347
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:01,838
One, two, three.

348
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,757
-There you go.
-Yes!

349
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,093
You're doing great.

350
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,637
Great job.

351
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,805
Na-eun, throw it.

352
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,895
Six points.

353
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,108
Last one.

354
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,486
Hey, we won!

355
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,572
All right, you're buying.

356
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,574
I'll pay.

357
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,576
Well…

358
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,499
Jeez…

359
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,678
-I'll get going now.
-Okay, get home safe.

360
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,720
All right, bye.

361
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,454
They'll be okay, right?

362
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,998
Of course.

363
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,751
They'll figure it out on their own,
so don't worry about them too much.

364
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,753
I'll take you home.

365
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,545
How is your mom?

366
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,592
She's fine.

367
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,012
Is your mom okay?

368
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,015
She's okay.

369
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,525
What time

370
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,195
should I pick you up tomorrow?

371
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,875
I'll take a taxi there.

372
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,007
All right.

373
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,771
Bye.

374
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,698
Just a moment, sir.

375
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,337
This is driving me nuts, damn it.

376
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,599
Let's go.

377
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,101
L STUDIO

378
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,530
NA-EUN: OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU SOON

379
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,335
Hey, you're here.

380
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,961
Hey.

381
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,132
You must be tired
to have come all this way.

382
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,467
No, I'm fine.

383
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,764
I bought some coffee for you.

384
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,643
Okay, thanks.

385
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,606
I see that the bride is here.

386
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,566
-We'll start right away.
-Okay.

387
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,567
Come along.

388
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,746
Goodness, I knew it'd be perfect for you.

389
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,082
I mean, have you ever seen a bride
this beautiful?

390
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:29,999
She's so pretty.

391
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,876
-Goodness.
-The groom must be so happy.

392
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,423
Goodness, your skin is so great
and you look so pretty.

393
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,364
All right, smile.

394
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,033
Okay, bride, smile.

395
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,830
Groom, smile with your eyes too.

396
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,914
Okay.

397
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,667
Could you give me a bright smile?

398
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,753
A little more naturally.

399
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,842
Can the bride link arms with the groom
so that you two look more intimate?

400
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,635
Okay.

401
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,305
All right, bride, relax.

402
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,224
Yes, relax and smile.

403
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,272
You two need to smile.

404
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,816
We can edit everything else,

405
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,985
but we can't add a smile for you.

406
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,737
I'm sorry.

407
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,911
Na-eun.

408
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,662
Let's talk after the shoot.

409
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,874
All right, if you've relaxed now,
let's start again.

410
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,006
Let's move that way.

411
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,138
Groom?

412
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,059
Jun-hyeong.

413
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,481
I can't keep doing this.

414
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,774
Let's talk first.

415
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,609
We'll be right back.

416
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,325
Na-eun.

417
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,410
Let's not do this.

418
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,831
I can't stand
how awkward it is between us.

419
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,208
I wanted to say everything
in the taxi yesterday,

420
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,087
but I held back because I was worried
that you'd get more upset.

421
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,214
But I can't let this continue.

422
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,465
Jun-hyeong.

423
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,592
A wedding shoot in this situation?

424
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,220
How can we take wedding photos
feeling this uncomfortable?

425
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,766
So, are you asking me
to make you feel better?

426
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,893
That's not what I'm saying!

427
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,313
Na-eun, we're having
our wedding shoot right now.

428
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,399
This is for our wedding.

429
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,694
But can we really have
our wedding shoot like this?

430
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,740
Don't just listen, say something!

431
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,164
It's not that I'm not saying anything,
I don't think I can.

432
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,793
What?

433
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,296
I don't know what to say to you.

434
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,632
Then at least get mad!

435
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,428
So that you can just apologize
and we can move on?

436
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,183
That's how we got here in the first place.

437
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,144
The two of us…

438
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,444
Excuse me.

439
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,572
The schedule is tighter than we thought,
so we need you back.

440
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,198
All right, we're coming.

441
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,038
Na-eun.

442
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,873
Let's go.

443
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,208
They're waiting for us.

444
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,593
Please look at each other.

445
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,430
Okay. Groom, put your hand
on the bride's waist.

446
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,557
Okay, great. I'll take some photos.

447
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,184
Okay.

448
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,104
Okay, wonderful.

449
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,314
For the next pose,

450
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,150
we'll have the bride and groom
face each other.

451
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,860
Okay.

452
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,403
Here we go.

453
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,280
All right.

454
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,823
Yes, smile.

455
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,408
Show that you love each other.

456
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:37,622
Great. And lastly,
we'll have the two of you kiss.

457
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,457
A little close.

458
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,792
Okay, good.

459
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,961
Okay, bride, get closer

460
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,587
and kiss the groom.

461
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,007
Great.

462
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,732
You're right.

463
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,195
What do you mean?

464
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,824
What's the point
of doing the shoot like this?

465
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,033
It's pointless.

466
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,876
The reason I wanted to marry you was

467
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:29,757
because I wanted to see
what we'd be like when we grew older.

468
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,595
So I wanted us to get married
and grow older together.

469
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,643
But not anymore.

470
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,774
I don't want to see what we'd be like

471
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,029
after fighting and hurting each other.

472
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,832
This is how I feel,

473
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,502
so I don't think it's right

474
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,174
just to go ahead with the wedding.

475
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,554
Na-eun.

476
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,432
Let's…

477
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,060
stop this.

478
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,956
-I'm not saying this out of anger.
-Do you really want to end it like this?

479
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,667
I think the two of them
might be having problems.

480
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,419
But if they're having problems…

481
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,089
Mom. I'm not getting married.

You need to be over your feelings
for it to really be over.

483
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,675
Are you sure you can do that?

484
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,719
Can you go on
without ever seeing him again?

485
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,388
We were planning our wedding
just a few days ago.

486
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,558
Before we fight again…
Before we fight more, let's end this.

487
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,851
I can't break up with you.

488
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,811
Why not?

489
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,563
Because I still love you!

00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:14,028
