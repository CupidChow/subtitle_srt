1
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,938
What are you doing right now?

2
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,065
A drag bunt.

3
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,485
Come on, who goes for a bunt
when you're already at two strikes?

4
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,987
Making a move no one expects
is what pros do.

5
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,364
Hey, just hit the thing
and get a run in already.

6
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,451
You'd get yourself a base hit
if you hold the bat like this.

7
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,577
Hey.

8
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,955
You may have some bad experiences
with drag bunts, but not me.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,500
-Bad experiences?
-You must have failed

10
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,920
to surprise Na-eun with a bunt when
talking about your finances, but not me.

11
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,505
Who says I've failed?

12
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,382
I realized my drag bunt
wasn't going to work out

13
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,092
and changed my strategy.

14
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,303
And also, that has
nothing to do with baseball.

15
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,807
They're the same.

16
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,850
Baseball and life are exactly the same.

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,269
We're standing on
our own personal pitcher's mound.

18
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,814
You're in a battle with Na-eun,

19
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,233
and I'm in a battle with myself.

20
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,402
Excuse me, sir. Are you drunk?

21
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,947
I'm drunk on myself.

22
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,783
He's definitely not normal.

23
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:01,538
Also, when I'm stepping up to bat,
your advice means nothing to me.

24
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,373
All I can do is trust in myself

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,667
and focus on my game.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,107
All right, strikeout!

27
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,485
-Today's pitcher just made a strikeout.
-Sir, you whiffed the ball.

28
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,281
Jeez, you don't have to be
so upset about it.

29
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,742
It's not like you were ever
any good at hitting the ball. Get up.

30
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,954
No, I was just stretching
and getting myself ready.

31
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,085
That's gross.

32
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,964
-Get out of the way.
-Gosh.

33
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,720
EPISODE 3
DRAG BUNT

34
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,978
Gosh, I heard you're getting married.

35
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,189
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

36
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,860
I guess you'll be very busy
once you start planning your wedding.

37
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,654
I'll make sure it doesn't
interfere with my work.

38
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,448
It's okay if it does a bit.

39
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,825
There's no need to be
that loyal to the company.

40
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,870
You're going to look for her
the most whenever she's away.

41
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,123
That's a given, isn't it?
I work here to scold my juniors.

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,753
So, what neighborhood
have you decided to live in?

43
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,338
What?

44
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,674
Ma'am, their families only just met
for the first time.

45
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,177
Did I get too ahead of myself?

46
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,514
But planning a wedding out
isn't anything you can't handle.

47
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,600
The main thing is to find a place to live.

48
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,728
So once you're done with it,
you're done with 80 percent of it.

49
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,148
Thankfully, my in-laws
will be helping us to get a place.

50
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,691
We'll be starting with a full lease.

51
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,279
We haven't discussed where yet though.

52
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,074
Hey, if you can go for a full lease,

53
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,327
it'll be better to buy it with
both your savings and a loan.

54
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,581
Plus, since your boyfriend is older,
he must have saved up some money.

55
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,042
-Money?
-Yes.

56
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,630
If only my husband had saved up
some money before we got married,

57
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,257
we'd already have a house by now.

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,093
What happened…

59
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,223
My husband used to spend a lot of money
on me before we got married.

60
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,142
So I figured he had some money saved up.

61
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,520
Once we got married,
it turns out he was broke.

62
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,356
He spent all of his paychecks on me.

63
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,276
And I couldn't get mad at him
because he spent them on me.

64
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,820
That's why

65
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,240
I took control of all of his finances
as soon as we got married.

66
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,451
You had no idea at all
before you got married?

67
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,869
I had no idea.

68
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,664
Don't you usually open up about
how much you have saved up

69
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,001
and other financial matters
before you get married?

70
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,544
That's what most people do.

71
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,839
Even I used to discuss with my husband
how much each of us saved,

72
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,799
how much to spend on the wedding,

73
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,510
and how much to spend on our house
before we got married.

74
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,928
You did that too, right?

75
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,972
Sorry?

76
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,223
Yes.

77
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,392
I guess you didn't.

78
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,936
She didn't.

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,604
No.

80
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,028
You haven't talked about
money with your boyfriend?

81
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,364
Wait. How can you not talk about money
when you have a wedding to plan?

82
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,910
Well, the thing is, we never talked
about money when we were just dating.

83
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,289
Wait. So you have no idea
his financial status?

84
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:35,043
I have no idea how much he makes,
let alone how much he's saved up.

85
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,628
Plus…

86
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,507
since we took care of the house easily,
we didn't need to talk about money.

87
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,761
Okay, so you're trying to
prepare for a wedding

88
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,765
without knowing how much he's saved up
or even what your budget is going to be?

89
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,559
I never thought about it,

90
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,771
but since his parents are helping us,
I planned to follow the unspoken rule.

91
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,731
The unspoken rule?

92
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,441
If the man provides the house,
then the woman provides a dowry

93
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,736
and wedding gifts valued at
about 10 percent of the cost of the house.

94
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,905
Then what about the cost of the wedding?

95
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,907
As much as I think I should?

96
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,409
Depending on how it goes?

97
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,413
You're going to wait and see
who pays first every time?

98
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,000
Or are you going to fight each other,
as you decide who will pay?

99
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,588
If that's not how you want to do it,
you better go talk to him right now.

100
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,007
-I should, shouldn't I?
-Of course!

101
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,551
Money is to marriage
what gasoline is to cars.

102
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,221
Just like how you need gasoline
for your car to move,

103
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,348
you need some money to get married.

104
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,433
Stop wasting time
and go talk to him already.

105
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,477
Okay.

106
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,153
Jun-hyeong.

107
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,782
What do I even say to him?

108
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,368
Jun-hyeong, how much money do you have?

109
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,870
No, that's too much.

110
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,042
Did you make a lot of money
at your company?

111
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,836
How much do you make?

112
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,547
That one's way too forward.

113
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,840
What is it?

114
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,924
What?

115
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,260
Weren't you just about to say something?

116
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,600
Come on, what is it? Just tell me.

117
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,562
Well, the thing is…

118
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,566
Money…

119
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,776
Money?

120
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,948
I have a lot of it saved up.

121
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,076
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,911
I mean,

123
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,415
it's been over eight years
since I've been at this job,

124
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,542
so I managed to save up a lot of money.

125
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,586
Are you bragging?

126
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,338
No, I'm not trying to brag. It's just…

127
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,175
We're going to a showroom, right?

128
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,094
So feel free to pick out
everything you want

129
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,721
since I have a lot of money.

130
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,934
I had no idea
where you were going with that.

131
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,983
I'm going to trust you
and splurge a little bit today.

132
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,373
Na-eun, I guess
we really are getting married.

133
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,458
What?

134
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,002
Things feel so official
now that we're here.

135
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,713
It actually feels like
we're going to get married.

136
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,885
All right, let's talk about our financial
situation a little later on.

137
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,137
For now, let's just focus on browsing.

138
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,224
Na-eun, check that out.

139
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,976
Look at this bed right here.

140
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,146
It's very comfy.

141
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,065
Actually, I had my eye on this one.

142
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,274
Really?

143
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,903
This is so comfortable.

144
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,405
So this is why they say
this is a good brand.

145
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,076
I can make a purchase here, right?

146
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,745
Of course, you can.
I'll help you over on this side.

147
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,121
-All right.
-Wait.

148
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,917
We'll be back
after we browse a little bit more.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,460
Sure. Okay.

150
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,796
What's going on?

151
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,131
Oh gosh, look at this.

152
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,009
-This is incredible.
-This bouquet is totally your style.

153
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,095
It's so lovely. It's so pretty.

154
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,722
You must be the bride.

155
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,516
Pardon?

156
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,605
Do you know the price range
this bouquet falls in?

157
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,190
It really is pretty, isn't it?

158
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,443
We've been in the wedding business
for over ten years now,

159
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,113
so our prices are a bit on the higher end.

160
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,448
So, that would be how much?

161
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,286
I can provide all the details
if you come inside.

162
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,330
Sure, let's go in and hear her out.

163
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,958
The price doesn't matter at all
if that's what you want.

164
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,420
He's right. The bride's choice
is always the best choice.

165
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,257
Sorry, but we just started looking around.

166
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,675
We'll be back soon.

167
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,600
I don't think there's a need
to rush into any decisions.

168
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,351
Let's take our time looking around.

169
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,271
Why? Didn't you like that bouquet?

170
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,522
Even if I liked it,

171
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,358
we should still check out
other shops and compare prices.

172
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,818
Compare prices?

173
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,487
Come on, you should
just go for it if you like it.

174
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,157
You bragged on the way here
about your savings.

175
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,825
That's because

176
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,996
I didn't want you to feel pressured
about paying for everything.

177
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,873
Pressure? I don't feel any at all.

178
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,793
This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.
We shouldn't feel pressured about it.

179
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,962
Really?

180
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,715
Well, I don't really know
your financial situation.

181
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,344
I heard that it's pretty common for people

182
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,263
to open up about their finances
and build a budget together

183
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,932
before they get married.
Should we do that too?

184
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,685
-A budget?
-Yes.

185
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,063
Well, I'm not really into that idea.

186
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:48,981
Why not?

187
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,734
Well, coming up with a budget means

188
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,986
we'll be putting a limit
on what we can do.

189
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,073
We'll have to worry about the cost
every time we do something.

190
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,949
I feel like it's going to be stressful.

191
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,743
That might be the case,

192
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,038
but having a budget could help us
be really efficient.

193
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,624
Na-eun.

194
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,169
This is our one and only wedding.

195
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,258
I don't want to have any regrets
rather than worrying about efficiency.

196
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,677
That's the same for me too.

197
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,680
I want to do it in the most economical way
without any regrets--

198
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,558
But that means we'll be looking for
something cost-effective.

199
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,769
It doesn't mean we'll be looking for
something that's actually good.

200
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,022
I looked it up online, and they said that

201
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,192
wedding planning businesses
are all basically pretty similar.

202
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:37,488
So, I think we'll be satisfied
if we pick based on value.

203
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,697
You've got it all wrong.

204
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,491
We can worry about the price later.

205
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,618
You should go with
whatever you want the most.

206
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,252
Please take a look at our pamphlets.

207
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,965
These are some awesome pictures.

208
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,801
Shall we go to the Maldives
for our honeymoon?

209
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,764
I should have asked him
if he could actually afford to

210
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,975
not have any regrets
as soon as he said that.

211
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,190
Is it because a trip
to the Maldives is too expensive?

212
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,611
But I heard there isn't much to do

213
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,822
on the islands once you get there.

214
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,869
Then how about fun-filled Cancun…

215
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,416
or not.

216
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,711
What about Bali? Or Hawaii?

217
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,798
Anywhere is fine. Let's think it over
before making any decisions, okay?

218
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,019
Gosh, so you just ended up
coming back with all these pamphlets?

219
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,771
Jeez, that's a long trip
to collect some papers.

220
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,399
Something just felt off.

221
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,153
All of a sudden,
Na-eun seemed concerned about money.

222
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,113
It felt like I was walking on eggshells,

223
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,741
so I couldn't even bring myself
to suggest anything.

224
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,660
I wonder why she did that all of a sudden.

225
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,497
That's because you're not dating anymore.

226
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,999
You're getting married.

227
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,629
It's not about whose money
is whose anymore.

228
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,340
You're at the stage where you need
to put your money together.

229
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,509
My wife was the same

230
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,969
the moment we started
preparing for our wedding.

231
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,097
If I had known that she would be
so nuts about money,

232
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,266
I would have never married her.

233
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,352
That's a heartbreaking story.

234
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,812
I wish I could turn back time.

235
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,398
Come on, you're living a happy life.
What are you talking about?

236
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,902
No, I don't. I'm not doing well at all.

237
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,531
Can't you tell how much I'm suffering
by how bloated I am?

238
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,616
Because of my wife's nagging,

239
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,326
I became this fat.

240
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,915
-You find this funny?
-No, sir.

241
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,796
Hey, Jun-hyeong. Who's going to be
handling the finances then?

242
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,008
We haven't talked about it yet.
We just started preparing for marriage.

243
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,176
Really?

244
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,637
Hey, Il-han. Get over here!

245
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,888
What's up?

246
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,808
Hey, Jun-hyeong hasn't handed over
control of his finances yet.

247
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,810
Really? Oh, man.

248
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,396
Okay, then you should
listen to us very carefully.

249
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,647
All right, Jun-hyeong.

250
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,275
You need to worry about
just two things from now on.

251
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,359
What could they be?

252
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,987
Trust and love.

253
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,364
No, it's not.

254
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,741
Faith and virtue?

255
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,243
No.

256
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,245
-Are you living in the Joseon dynasty?
-Love and virility!

257
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,496
Please…

258
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,583
So what does he need to worry about?

259
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,126
Listen closely.

260
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,087
The two things are
the control of your finances and…

261
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,422
-your authorization certificates.
-Your authorization certificates.

262
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,756
-Exactly.
-Exactly, right.

263
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,757
Certificates?

264
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,634
Come on, was that it?

265
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,553
How can you say that?

266
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,015
This isn't simply an issue about
who's holding onto the bank books.

267
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,350
Half of the power over your marriage
rests on this matter.

268
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,270
Hey, reading all these pamphlets
won't make any difference.

269
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,148
One way or another, the wedding
is going to happen either way.

270
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,691
Of course, it's best to avoid marriage.

271
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,235
But if you give up control
of your finances, then…

272
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,821
Your entire life will be changed.

273
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,157
Again, not getting married
would prevent everything.

274
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,411
Once you give up all control,
you'll have to fight for a penny.

275
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:16,415
It can turn a man petty. And then life…

276
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,918
starts to get exhausting.

277
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,212
Look at him. Look at how bloated he is
from all the exhaustion.

278
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,797
Look. Bloated like a blimp.

279
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,799
-Isn't this just fat?
-I'm just bloated.

280
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,717
Really?

281
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,970
-Are you laughing?
-No, wait.

282
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,222
I understand about
having control over your own money.

283
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,766
But what about
the authorization certificates?

284
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,517
I'm starting to get frustrated.

285
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,894
The next target is

286
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,980
the authorization certificates
once you give up control of your finances.

287
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,067
Listen to me. Once you hand over
your authorization certificates,

288
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,902
all of your financial activities
will be revealed.

289
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,987
And then you're basically
in shackles, okay?

290
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,697
Jun-hyeong, mark my words.

291
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,825
You must control your finances and protect
your authorization certificates.

292
00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:00,209
So is this why the government tells us
to protect our authorization certificates?

293
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,922
Is that your idea of a joke?
It's not funny at all.

294
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,384
-It has no meaning either.
-Hey, so are you not going to do so?

295
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,680
Hey, are you really going to take
what they said to heart?

296
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,556
Do you think they were just joking?

297
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,059
They looked like they were ready
to write it down in blood.

298
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,435
What are you talking about?

299
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,272
Hey, listen carefully
if someone's giving you serious advice.

300
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,108
Come on.

301
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,235
If you have authorization certificates,

302
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,113
you have access to your credit card bills
and bank account activities.

303
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,155
Sure.

304
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,658
That means Na-eun can see

305
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,244
how much you spent and where you spent it.

306
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,371
So what? It's not like
I spend my money in weird places.

307
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,416
That's true, but you'll have to
worry when she'll check them.

308
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,710
-What?
-You said it earlier.

309
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,838
How you felt like you were walking
on eggshells at the showroom.

310
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,174
What do you think is going to happen
if you feel that every single day?

311
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,511
-I'll probably get stressed.
-That's right.

312
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,222
Then what's going to happen
if you keep getting stressed?

313
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:01,103
Then you'll be bloated
and end up like him.

314
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,148
Jeez. So don't get cocky
just because you look handsome.

315
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,026
One day, you'll end up like that
in a blink of an eye.

316
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,319
Gosh…

317
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,826
A budget?

318
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,996
Having a budget could help us
be really efficient.

319
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,207
I don't want to have any regrets
rather than worrying about efficiency.

320
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,876
That's the same for me too.

321
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,962
I want to do it in the most economical way
without any regrets--

322
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,756
We can worry about the price later.

323
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,883
You should go with
whatever you want the most.

324
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,886
We have such different views…

325
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,015
What's going to happen if only one of us
is in control of our finances?

326
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,356
Hey, Na-eun.

327
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,235
Instead of stretching your shoulders out,
I think you should get your thoughts out.

328
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,448
Should I just talk about things
after we get married?

329
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,994
Once we get married,
we'll have to talk about living expenses,

330
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,704
so he'll have to bring it up first.

331
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,457
Yes, that sounds pretty good too.
Doesn't it?

332
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:08,337
So that means your boyfriend will
spend all of his savings on the wedding,

333
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,964
and you two will start with a clean slate.

334
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,802
-Would writing him a letter be better?
-Hey, that's a good one too.

335
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,137
Letters are good for
when something is hard to bring up.

336
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,932
-You should start the letter like this.
-Like what?

337
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,559
"This letter began in England--"

338
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,522
Jeez, why are you two doing this to me?
Can't you see how serious I am?

339
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,690
Hey, we're just getting frustrated.
That's all.

340
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,443
Just go and duke it out with him
like a grown-up.

341
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,779
What are you talking about
duking it out for?

342
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:38,492
But it's not like you're asking him
for money or anything.

343
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,037
All you're doing is asking
how much he's saved up, right?

344
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,748
You just want to know his monthly pay
and the budget for your wedding.

345
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,334
Is it that difficult
to ask him such questions?

346
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,003
It would have been better
if we talked about it earlier

347
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,922
when I brought it up.

348
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:56,635
But since I keep trying to bring it up,
it seems like I'm fixated on money.

349
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,595
When that's not it at all.

350
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,472
Think about it, okay?

351
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,100
Jun-hyeong's telling me
that marriage is a one-time thing

352
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,310
so I should go with whatever I want.

353
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,021
Then I talk about getting the best thing
at the most reasonable price

354
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,731
and how much I've saved.

355
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,067
Don't you think it'd look like
I'm being too calculative?

356
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,404
How is that being calculative?
It's being smart.

357
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,781
Do you think I can do it?

358
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,118
Of course, you can. Now grab your stuff.

359
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,745
Let's go.

360
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,122
Stop frowning.

361
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,089
-Na-eun--
-Jun-hyeong.

362
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,260
You go first.

363
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,097
It's not really a big deal,

364
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,058
but I read online today

365
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,395
that money is the most important issue
when it comes to getting married.

366
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,521
What?

367
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,065
I was just about to say the same thing.

368
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,442
Really?

369
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,485
We're on the same page about everything.

370
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,778
That's really interesting.

371
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,072
I had no idea you were going to
talk about money.

372
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,658
Yes, I was talking to my colleagues,

373
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,076
and we talked about
who should manage the finances.

374
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,914
I figured that was something
that we needed to talk about.

375
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,333
Manage the finances?

376
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,128
You mean who manages
all of our money after we get married?

377
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,380
Yes.

378
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,718
Wait, does he really want to
talk about this right now?

379
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,347
We haven't even talked about
the wedding costs yet.

380
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,390
Na-eun, do you dabble in stocks at all?

381
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,226
-No.
-What about ETFs?

382
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,518
I've heard of them.

383
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,561
What about bonds?

384
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,521
I've heard of them before too.

385
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,398
You don't invest in anything then?

386
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,859
I do. I just do it all with the bank.

387
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,946
I make sure I don't lose any of my money
by putting everything in my savings.

388
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,405
How about you?

389
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,074
I do a lot of investing.

390
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,619
I look for the companies
that have long-term upward trends,

391
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,621
then the interest rates
are higher than the bank.

392
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,706
Suddenly you're looking
a little different.

393
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,792
You sound like a financial expert.

394
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,669
Jeez, it's nothing really.

395
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,420
Well, that's good.

396
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,965
Since you know a lot about that field
of expertise,

397
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,842
you can be in charge
of handling the money in our family.

398
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,598
Instead of that, how about
we each manage our finances separately?

399
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:08,934
Separately?

400
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,894
We have different ways
of managing our money.

401
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,481
So I think it'll be better for us
to manage our money separately.

402
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,318
I see.

403
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,153
Honestly, apart from this,

404
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,282
we'll still have to spend a certain amount
individually even after we get married.

405
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,867
I thought if only one person manages it,

406
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,996
we might end up having arguments.

407
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,458
Well, that could happen.

408
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,378
We both have been doing well enough
on our own until now.

409
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,505
What do you say we keep it that way?

410
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,426
-Then…
-What is it?

411
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,846
It's nothing.

412
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,266
Let's keep things separate then.
Yes, that sounds good.

413
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,163
I'm in control of my money.

414
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,956
-Great.
-Good job!

415
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,085
Come join us. We're at a BBQ joint
right in front of the office.

416
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,588
We decided to handle our own finances.

417
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,716
-Your finances? All of a sudden?
-What did you guys even talk about?

418
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,345
You went there to talk about money and
ended up losing your right to handle it?

419
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:30,432
She went to fight
but was completely knocked out instead.

420
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,934
I don't even know.

421
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,238
I'm home.

422
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,364
Hey.

423
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,210
Do you usually walk around
with beer in your bag?

424
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,465
I got one for you too, Mom.

425
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,305
Other girls are worried about losing
weight before they get married.

426
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,641
But I think you're trying
to pack on a beer belly.

427
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,186
I'm just thirsty, that's all.

428
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,938
Something's bugging you, right?

429
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,399
Where's Dad?

430
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,655
If he's not home, that means
he's out drinking. Why waste your breath?

431
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,662
What is it?

432
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,373
Did you fight with Jun-hyeong
or something?

433
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,834
-No.
-Then?

434
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,585
Just…

435
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,714
Now that we've started preparing
for the wedding, things are hard.

436
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,717
I can't even talk about
what I really want.

437
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,886
Forget it. I don't care anymore.

438
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,098
If I keep going,
I'll just end up being the petty one.

439
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,349
Did you say petty?

440
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,394
I don't know what happened,
but being petty

441
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,979
while you're just dating
is basically nothing.

442
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,940
-What?
-Wait until you're married.

443
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,484
You'll feel like you're being petty
if you say anything

444
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,988
but if you stay quiet you feel
as if you're being suffocated.

445
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,949
But do you know what's the most
frustrating thing about that situation?

446
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,159
What's that?

447
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,203
Your dad has no idea
about what is actually going on

448
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,164
even though I feel like I'm dying.

449
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,792
-Why wouldn't Dad know?
-Because I just give up on bringing it up.

450
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,047
You know, sometimes,
you want him to figure it out

451
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,675
and handle things first

452
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,677
before you have to even say anything.

453
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,390
But I realized that if I say nothing,
he has no idea about every single thing.

454
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,808
Of course, you should tell him…

455
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,144
if you want him to know.

456
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,313
Of course! You should say something.

457
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:46,359
If you keep quiet just because
you feel like you're being so mean,

458
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,571
then he is never going to figure it out.
You'll be the only one suffocated.

459
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,636
You actually did the impossible.

460
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,055
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

461
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,309
I knew that Jun-hyeong was going to do it.

462
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,645
Congratulations. Have another one.

463
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,355
What's gotten into you guys?

464
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,482
All we did was have
a reasonable discussion.

465
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,234
Either way, congratulations. Cheers.

466
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,445
No, you shouldn't be the one
to congratulate him.

467
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,113
Why would you congratulate him?

468
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,115
You don't even have a girl.

469
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,911
Seriously? At least set me up with someone
if you're going to tease me.

470
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,663
You can nag at me after paying me

471
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,539
and rag on me
after setting me up on a date.

472
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,126
Don't laugh at me, man. You're the worst.

473
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,712
He's getting married
but he's never set me up on a date.

474
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,631
No. Just don't get married.

475
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,174
It's not even good for you.

476
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,801
You should just live alone.

477
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,804
No, I'm going to get married
and have an ally who'll stick with me.

478
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,139
No. It's not like that at all.

479
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,308
-What?
-An ally? My ass.

480
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,812
You'll just end up feeling like even your
sworn enemy would treat you better.

481
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,190
Why do you keep on saying that?
You're living happily with your life.

482
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,401
No, I'm not. Not at all.

483
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,819
She always talks about money.

484
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,113
I'm sure she has
a sixth sense regarding money.

485
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,865
It gives me chills down my spine, man.

486
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,244
Jeez, that scared me.
She looks exactly like my wife.

487
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,329
I got goosebumps.

488
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,165
If it wasn't for my kids,
I'd be long gone by now.

489
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,667
I know.

490
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,294
Jun-hyeong.

491
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,129
You should really reconsider
getting married.

492
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,131
I heard your future wife also goes on
about money all the time.

493
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,758
No, I didn't mean that.

494
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,469
I meant that she had a better idea
of how to handle money than I did.

495
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,055
That's "potatoes-tomatoes."

496
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,516
-No, it's "tomatoes-tomatoes."
-Are you sure?

497
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,477
-Or is it apples and oranges?
-Come on, please.

498
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,105
Hey, let's all talk
about stocks or something.

499
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,523
The stocks--

500
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,151
No. This is not the time
to be talking about stocks.

501
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,987
How could we talk about stocks
when Jun-hyeong's life is on the line?

502
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,822
This is exactly why you're single.

503
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,659
If Jun-hyeong's future wife
talks about money all the time now,

504
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,495
then she's going to go crazy
after getting married.

505
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,748
-And soon, she will--
-Jeez.

506
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,878
Can we stop now?
It's getting hard to listen to.

507
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,674
Hey, just listen, all right?

508
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,968
You may not like it now,
but just wait until you're married.

509
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,930
I'm sure you'll be talking about it,
saying we were right, after one year.

510
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:25,101
I'll bet you ten bottles of soju that
you'll do exactly what I said just now.

511
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,812
Not just ten bottles.
Make it twenty bottles.

512
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,855
-Really?
-Yes.

513
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,733
-Sure, it's the same thing anyway.
-You know you regret it.

514
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,235
-Let's have a drink.
-I can't believe you guys!

515
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,820
Hey, Jun-hyeong.

516
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,866
Hey…

517
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,118
I'll leave first.

518
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,495
I'll pick up the bill.

519
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,621
Hey!

520
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,998
Damn it. I'll bring him back.

521
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,208
Is he really leaving?

522
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,125
Hey!

523
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,046
Hey, you can't just leave like that.

524
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,800
Damn, it's insane.

525
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,471
They had a few drinks.
Just chalk all of it up to the alcohol.

526
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,057
I mean, it feels like
I'm going to go insane.

527
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,725
What?

528
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,938
I proposed to Na-eun just a few days ago
and look what I'm doing right now.

529
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,273
What do they even know about her?

530
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,818
How the hell
can they talk about her like that?

531
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,404
Hey, they didn't really mean anything.

532
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:21,366
-Let it go in one ear and out the other.
-Jeez, it's driving me nuts.

533
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,993
You know they can't say a thing
when they're at home.

534
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,955
That's why they're this way outside.
Just let it go.

535
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,749
And he's bloated from exhaustion?
That's not bloating.

536
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,920
-Did you see how much he ate?
-He really was going to town, that pig.

537
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:38,508
I actually listened to them
and talked about controlling finances.

538
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,304
Where are you going?

539
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,973
Where are you going?

540
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,558
Hey, Jun-hyeong.

541
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,184
What the hell?

542
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,477
I can't believe him…

543
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,106
How can he just run off like that?

544
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,323
Then…

545
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,867
What is it?

546
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,952
It's nothing.

547
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,038
Let's keep things separate then.
Yes, that sounds good.

548
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,221
Hello?

549
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,057
-I want to see you.
-Right now?

550
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,811
Yes. I'm headed over to your place,
so come down in about 20 minutes.

551
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,397
-Jun-hyeong.
-I know it's late,

552
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,026
but even if it's just for a moment,
I'd really like to see you.

553
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,821
No, not that. I'm actually in front of
your place right now too.

554
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,989
My place?

555
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,074
When did you get there?

556
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,494
You should have called me
if you were coming.

557
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,454
I had something I needed to drop off.

558
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,498
Just wait for me inside
for a second, then.

559
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,124
I'll head home right now.

560
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,375
Okay.

561
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,088
Did he have a lot to drink?

562
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,654
-You scared me.
-Na-eun.

563
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,447
Jun-hyeong.

564
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,075
I thought you left already.

565
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,159
Where were you?

566
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,702
I bought some stuff
to help with your hangover.

567
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,996
I figured you probably had a lot to drink.

568
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,332
Are you okay?

569
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,090
What's going on? Did something happen?

570
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,720
Jun-hyeong.

571
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,727
Do you know
who my favorite movie director is?

572
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,688
-A movie director?
-Yoo Ha.

573
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,356
Yoo Ha? What's that supposed to mean?

574
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,608
He's the director
of Marriage is a Crazy Thing.

575
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,279
All right. I have everyone's bags
so we can get out of here now.

576
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,948
I think I'm in the middle
of the dream right now.

577
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,575
-Can I help you?
-You have to pay.

578
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,286
-Nobody paid yet?
-No. It's 180,000 won.

579
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,208
You prick… You should have paid
if you were going to eat like that.

580
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,128
You're trying to dine and dash,
aren't you?

581
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,213
That son of a bitch.

582
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,555
You got caught up
in everything your colleagues said?

583
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,226
It was my idea to be responsible
for our own finances,

584
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,937
but it was just the timing.

585
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,231
No.

586
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,693
I'm going to stop making excuses.
I wasn't thinking things through.

587
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:48,197
I should have come to a conclusion after
having thorough discussions with you.

588
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,159
I think I made it difficult for you
to hear what I had to say

589
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,245
because I had already decided
before talking to you. I'm sorry.

590
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,248
No, it's totally fine.
There's no need for you to apologize.

591
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,044
I agree that we should each
look after our finances separately.

592
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,172
-What?
-It's just like you said.

593
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,507
We have very different views
on how we handle our finances.

594
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,135
So I'm sure we'll end up arguing
if one of us handles it.

595
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,970
Let's just stick to our original plan,

596
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,848
but let's just make sure
to be transparent.

597
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,558
What do you think?

598
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,102
Great.

599
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,608
Anyway, what made you drop by
so late at night like this?

600
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,609
Oh, right.

601
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,489
I wanted to give you this.

602
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,033
What's this?

603
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
A Status Report on Kim Na-eun's Assets?

604
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,291
I've overused my talent and energy.

605
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,628
I wanted to keep things simple,
but I couldn't help myself.

606
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,757
How much is this?

607
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,885
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands,
ten thousand, hundreds?

608
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,972
You're very rich!

609
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,515
This is something worth bragging about!

610
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,768
Actually, I wasn't trying to
toot my own horn that day.

611
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,396
I actually wanted to ask you
how much you had saved up.

612
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,024
I started stressing over how I could
ask you, and then that's what happened.

613
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,777
I figured it would be a lot easier
to get things done

614
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,612
if we knew how much we've saved

615
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,990
and how much
we should spend for the wedding.

616
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,702
You're right.

617
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,705
We should have talked about this first.

618
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,624
Yes. You were going way too fast.

619
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,962
If you have a minute,
I can do something else really fast.

620
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,213
Gosh, stop it.

621
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,007
No more joking around.

622
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,341
I want you to tell me.

623
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,552
How much have you saved up?

624
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,762
One hundred million won?

625
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,640
Two hundred million won?

626
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,481
Are you being serious?

627
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,070
You're joking, right?

628
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,909
I thought your eyes were going to pop out!

629
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,870
-I'm joking.
-Come on!

630
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,247
I'll organize things
and let you know by next week.

631
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,915
Okay.

632
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,794
Also, Na-eun…

633
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,837
Yes?

634
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,508
We're going to be married soon,

635
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,179
but what will you do if you can't
even bring things like this up?

636
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,140
I just want to be really careful
with how I word things.

637
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,934
I'm here to listen to everything
you want to talk about,

638
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,937
so don't struggle all by yourself,
and just come and talk to me.

639
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,149
It makes me feel worse if you're having
a hard time all by yourself.

640
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,776
Deal?

641
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,445
Deal.

642
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,906
Get over here.

643
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,579
What time is it?

644
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,123
It's 11 p.m. I have to get going.

645
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,834
It's already late,
so you should stay the night.

646
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,420
No, you know my dad
is going to be up waiting for me.

647
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,881
-I really have to go.
-Just stay the night.

648
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,258
No. I really have to go.

649
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,343
Sorry.

650
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,805
Okay. Just give me a second.

651
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,890
I'll go with you.
Let me change really quick.

652
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,433
-Okay.
-All right.

653
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,485
NOVEMBER CREDIT CARD STATEMENT

654
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,119
NOVEMBER CREDIT CARD STATEMENT
33,355,790 WON

655
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,206
What the hell?

656
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,851
I was also worried about
how we're going to do in the future.

657
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,769
Forget it.
Let's just learn to be cool with it.

658
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,938
Men mature once they get married.

659
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,275
I'm sure he knows that we can't be
spending so much like we used to.

660
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,027
So I chose to go for the one
where you'll be the focus.

661
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,113
You're putting on a surprise again?
You just proposed to her.

662
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,323
Something feels very off.

663
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,284
Why do you have to
work overtime all of a sudden?

664
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,953
What do you think
I've been up to these days?

665
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,206
The party is over,
and now the battle begins.

666
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:13,713
