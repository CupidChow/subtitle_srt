1
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,627
His mom is sick and he doesn't even call.

2
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,506
He must act more generously than this
to his worst enemy.

3
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,635
Sons never take care of their parents.

4
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,765
Gosh, look at the place.

5
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,853
My goodness.

6
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,438
Goodness, what is going on?

7
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,731
Jeez, seriously.

8
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,987
Goodness me!

9
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,865
Gosh, seriously. Jeez.

10
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,792
Wait.

11
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,211
Why did he throw all this away?

12
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,718
So what is it that you want?

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,471
Do you want this wedding
to get called off?

14
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,775
EPISODE 11
HOME RUN

15
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,498
Let's

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,042
stop this.

17
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,427
Please excuse us.

18
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,268
What are you doing right now?

19
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,816
I can't do this anymore.

20
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,444
What do you mean by that?

21
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,530
Why can't you?

22
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,703
Na-eun.

23
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,039
Regardless of how angry you are,

24
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,834
there are things you should
and shouldn't say.

25
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,005
-How can you ask to break--
-I'm not saying this out of anger.

26
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,718
Then what?

27
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,512
You want us to break up here and now?

28
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,850
Do you really want to end it like this?

29
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,103
Yes.

30
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,881
I was scared.

31
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,554
I felt the end coming closer and closer.

32
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,268
So, I blew up first.

33
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,939
I didn't want to hurt him any longer.

34
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,318
No.

35
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,866
I didn't want to get hurt any longer.

36
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,552
Then what?

37
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,263
You want us to break up here and now?

38
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,808
You really want to end things like this?

39
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,978
Yes.

40
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,735
She broke up with me so easily.

41
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,196
Marriage is serious business.

42
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,533
All right, fine.

43
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,578
I can't do this either.

44
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,476
You're home.

45
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,050
You left like that
and haven't called me since.

46
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,719
And now you don't even greet your mother?

47
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,975
Where did all your respect
for your mother go?

48
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,398
I have something to
talk to you about, so sit up.

49
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,907
Get up, please!

50
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,494
I'm here because I've reached
the end of the rope.

51
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,164
Your wedding is right around the corner.
How are you going to not say anything?

52
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,710
I can't do this anymore.

53
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,840
Let's

54
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,300
stop this.

55
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,603
Seo Jun-hyeong!

56
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,230
Gosh, seriously.

57
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,944
She took a day off because she's sick?

58
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,326
Na-eun took a day off
without even telling us?

59
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,372
And right after her wedding shoot?

60
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,263
Did Jun-hyeong come into work today?

61
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,975
He did, but he's not doing too well.

62
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,727
Why? Did something happen?

63
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,229
Na-eun didn't come into work today.

64
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,983
Can you try to ask Jun-hyeong
about what's happening?

65
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,329
What is it?

66
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,413
What?

67
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,127
I was just wondering
if something happened.

68
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,921
Why do you care?

69
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,047
It's just that…

70
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,466
Na-eun didn't go to work today.

71
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,762
She didn't go to work?

72
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,791
NA-EUN

73
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,707
The wedding invitations are out.
What should we do?

74
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,667
And what about the wedding shoot?

75
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,753
What about the contract
for the wedding venue?

76
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,232
PLEASE CANCEL EVERYTHING

77
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:16,240
PLEASE CANCEL EVERYTHING

78
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,542
CHAMGOOD REAL ESTATE

79
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,299
Welcome--

80
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,593
Goodness.

81
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,805
-My gosh.
-Gosh.

82
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,688
All right. Have this.

83
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,939
Thank you.

84
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,402
The office is nice and cozy.

85
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,237
Goodness, thank you.

86
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,407
Does the coffee taste all right?

87
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,701
Yes.

88
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,078
It's nice.

89
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,297
But, what brings you here?

90
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:19,595
There's something I'd like to
discuss with you regarding the kids.

91
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,974
I'm so sorry, but before you speak,

92
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,311
would it be okay if I spoke first?

93
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,813
Of course.

94
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,817
This time around,
I believe my wife made a bit of a mistake

95
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,985
when the kids went to look for a home.

96
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,323
I think I should apologize for that first.

97
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,328
She should have discussed it thoroughly

98
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,664
with your family,

99
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:52,795
but she saw a nice place, got ahead
of herself, and ended up causing problems.

100
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,840
Would you please kindly understand?

101
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,134
It's fine.

102
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,554
Honestly, I wasn't any better that day.

103
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,682
Real estate is your area of expertise,

104
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,435
but it seems I was opposed to the house
for no reason.

105
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,063
I regretted it a lot after I went home.

106
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,483
Goodness, thank you for saying that.

107
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,445
Of course, you'd be worried.

108
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,572
We're talking about a lot of money here.

109
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,283
It's only right to take your time
and think about it.

110
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:26,203
It would have been nice
if you had been there, then…

111
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,543
That's my second biggest regret in life.

112
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,795
What was the first?

113
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,713
Well…

114
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,426
Why are you looking at me?

115
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,929
Why are you laughing?

116
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,181
Well…

117
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:52,021
The reason I came by unannounced

118
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,817
is because I was wondering
if Na-eun had said anything.

119
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,653
What do you mean?

120
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,991
Jun-hyeong has been having
a hard time lately.

121
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,579
I think the two of them
might be having problems.

122
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,874
I haven't heard anything. Have you?

123
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,836
She has been avoiding me lately
so I haven't even seen her.

124
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,839
But if they're having problems…

125
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,592
I think the situation is quite serious.

126
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,928
Serious?

127
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,138
Wait, how can they be having
serious problems?

128
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,640
Their wedding is in a few days.

129
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,850
Who's the one who caused this?

130
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,478
The culprit is right here.

131
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,190
No, I was--

132
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,567
No, don't even think about making excuses.

133
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,819
Take responsibility
and focus on fixing it.

134
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,321
-You understand?
-Yes!

135
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,710
What is it?

136
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,213
What made you take the day off
without even telling us

137
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,298
and come here acting all gloom?

138
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,261
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

139
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,806
No.

140
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,224
So?

141
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,769
We broke up.

142
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,901
We broke up.

143
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,490
Don't make me laugh.
How could you two break up?

144
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,118
You're joking, right?

145
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,829
You just fought with him, right?

146
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,336
Are you really going to break up?

147
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,298
Why?

148
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,219
Did something happen at the wedding shoot?

149
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,097
No.

150
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,266
I just

151
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,519
couldn't do it anymore.

152
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,064
Fighting and apologizing,

153
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,692
then moving on like we have no choice.

154
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,320
I didn't think I could keep doing that,

155
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,822
so I asked to break up.

156
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,038
But still, Na-eun…

157
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,169
This happened constantly
while we ere planning for the wedding,

158
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,047
so it was obvious how it would be

159
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,758
after we got married.

160
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,761
You're right.

161
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,095
Good job.

162
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,186
Hey!

163
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,230
Why are you doing this too?

164
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,650
It's better to break up now
than regret it later.

165
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,319
Breaking up after getting married
is a lot more difficult.

166
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,073
Right, breaking off an engagement
is easier than divorce.

167
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,449
You did good, Kim Na-eun.

168
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,327
Hey. Na-eun's upset.
Let's sing her a song.

169
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,828
-But we should…
-Come on.

170
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,122
-Wait.
-Come on.

171
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,625
To the right.

172
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,877
A little more to the right. To the right.

173
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,879
Just you wait.

174
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,841
What?

175
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,343
How could that happen?

176
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,761
Isn't this a scam?

177
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,930
Hey, get it together.

178
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,099
Hey, you're the one
who needs to get it together.

179
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,392
Jeez.

180
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,936
What? There's no money left.

181
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,397
-Su-yeon.
-Yes?

182
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:04,940
Money.

183
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,654
I'll be right back!

184
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,907
Let's just buy one, okay?

185
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,409
That'll probably cost less.

186
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,703
Hui-seon, Su-yeon's hand
is going to get sore.

187
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,750
Unbelievable. Gosh.

188
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,712
-Please.
-Please.

189
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,130
Thank you, Hui-seon.

190
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,882
I'll be right back, Na-eun.

191
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,801
-Come back quick, Su-yeon.
-Okay.

192
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,345
It's time to stop, Na-eun.

193
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,513
I can't.

194
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,016
I have to get that one.

195
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,101
What are you going to do with it?

196
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,812
I'll keep it as a token of my breakup.

197
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,775
I don't have money.

198
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,277
Damn it, there's no money left.

199
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,197
How far did she go to get change?

200
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,783
Hurry back!

201
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,079
You should stop this
and give Jun-hyeong a call.

202
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,207
I can't.

203
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,626
I'm not going to be that pitiful.

204
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,044
And this isn't?

205
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,132
If you keep putting it off,
you'll really break up.

206
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,344
Did you not hear me?

207
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,595
We broke up.

208
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,430
Your relationship isn't that simple.

209
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,600
Then what?

210
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,896
You need to be over your feelings
for it to really be over.

211
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,649
Are you sure you can get over him?

212
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,776
Can you go on
without ever seeing him again?

213
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,280
Think about it carefully.

214
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,284
Is it Jun-hyeong you don't like
or is it the situation?

215
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,122
If you don't like Jun-hyeong anymore,
that can't be helped.

216
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,832
But if it's the situation,

217
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,501
you should try to
find a solution with him.

218
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,504
You can break up any time,

219
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,633
but now is the only time
when you can solve this together.

220
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,983
Think about it carefully.

221
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,945
Is it Jun-hyeong you don't like
or is it the situation?

222
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,455
12 MISSED CALLS
MOM

223
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,727
RECIPIENT
SEO JUN-HYEONG, KIM NA-EUN

224
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,794
"We met someone who makes us feel happier,

225
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,257
so, on a warm spring day, we are promising
to spend the rest of our lives together."

226
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,010
"We will become a loving family
who listens to each other

227
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:24,765
and supports each other
more than anyone else."

228
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,726
"We would be delighted

229
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,146
if you joined us to celebrate
the day our love comes to fruition

230
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,024
to wish us a happy beginning
to a beautiful journey."

231
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,277
-What do you think?
-Well…

232
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,820
It's touching.

233
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,032
-This is really good.
-Do you like it?

234
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,618
Okay, then let's go with this.

235
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,044
…TO WISH US A HAPPY BEGINNING
TO A BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY

236
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,317
Goodness.

237
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,195
You're home.

238
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,030
Mom.

239
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,367
Have you had dinner?

240
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,339
Are you

241
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,552
and Na-eun having problems?

242
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,930
The stew is good.

243
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,769
The wedding's coming up. Shouldn't I know
what's happening with you two?

244
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,231
I'll tell you when I sort things out.

245
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,567
Sort things out?

246
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,653
Did you two have a big fight?

247
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,948
If this is because of what happened
between us adults,

248
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,326
we already met and resolved things.

249
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,619
So you two hurry and make up.

250
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:13,999
Don't be stubborn
and let go of your pride.

251
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,169
What good does it do you
to beat her in an argument?

252
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,340
Weren't you displeased with Na-eun?

253
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,217
Why would I be displeased with Na-eun?

254
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,138
If you think about it,

255
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,975
she didn't do anything wrong that day.

256
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,895
It's my fault that I stirred things up

257
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,816
when you two were doing just fine.

258
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,236
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

259
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,530
Because I'm worried.

260
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,744
It's obvious you love her to death.

261
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,288
That's nonsense.

262
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,167
Even when you were dating,

263
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,879
the only girl you brought home was Na-eun.

264
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,005
Do you know that?

265
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,341
And that's not all.

266
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,511
You two had been dating
for just three months when you did that

267
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,471
and you told me you wanted to marry her.

268
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,765
I was seriously shocked.

269
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,310
Seeing how rash you were being
when you had never done that before,

270
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:18,063
made me think you
knocked her up or something.

271
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,319
That's because I was sure of it
from the moment I met her.

272
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,948
That you would marry her?

273
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,743
Why?

274
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,453
What made you think so?

275
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,416
Because she was Kim Na-eun.

276
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,919
What?

277
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,932
I'm doing it because it's Kim Na-eun.

278
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,228
Because she is the one
I love more than anyone else.

279
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,565
That's why I want to marry her.

280
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,902
I want to love her and cherish her
more than anyone else in my life.

281
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,162
It's all because she was Na-eun.

282
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,797
Because she was Kim Na-eum.

283
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,395
Are you going to sleep here?

284
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,606
Should I go get you a blanket?

285
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,859
Bring a pillow too.

286
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,652
Jeez, and a pillow too?

287
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,946
Our daughter is a bright one, isn't she?

288
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,742
Of course, I'm bright.

289
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,702
Enough of that. Get her up.

290
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,078
Get up already!

291
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,082
-Mom.
-What?

292
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,294
I'm not getting married.

293
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,503
Jeez.

294
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,134
Just how much did you drink?

295
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,595
Mom, how could you say that?

296
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,722
I'm saying I won't get married…

297
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm saying I'm bailing on my wedding…

298
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,603
You…

299
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,771
No.

300
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,982
You don't need to be sorry. It's fine.

301
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,569
This isn't your fault, Mom.

302
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,321
It's not mine, either.

303
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,531
It just

304
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,034
happened.

305
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,247
It just happened somehow.

306
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,083
We…

307
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,002
Jun-hyeong and I

308
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,922
broke up.

309
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,802
Jeez, how embarrassing.

310
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,595
Are you not coming inside?

311
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:00,016
Why are you embarrassed
when my heart is hurting this bad?

312
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,018
Jeez, and my head hurts.

313
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,815
I'm sorry, Dad.

314
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,610
I promise I'll do better next time.

315
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,113
Next time?

316
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,239
Yes.

317
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,450
I can do better next time.

318
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,745
Since I've planned for a wedding once,

319
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,330
I can do everything

320
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,916
better next time.

321
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,634
What?

322
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,804
Goodness.

323
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,851
You…

324
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,324
Jeez.

325
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,996
No, this is just…

326
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,956
Okay.

327
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,917
I'll get up, you can sit down.

328
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,675
Hurry and say what you have to say.

329
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,514
Our wedding invitations came out.

330
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,267
SEO JUN-HYEONG, KIM NA-EUN

331
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,687
So what?

332
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,068
-Na-eun.
-Don't call me that.

333
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,487
Call me, "Ms. Kim Na-eun" from now on.

334
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,073
I don't plan on being friendly with you.

335
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,575
We're going to be sworn enemies.

336
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,205
Jeez, why would we be sworn enemies,
Ms. Kim Na-eun?

337
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,248
Don't call me that either.

338
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,001
I'm upset
so just don't call me by my name.

339
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,879
What do you want me to do?

340
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,381
What do you mean?

341
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,883
I'm not marrying you.

342
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,385
The end. Over.

343
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,095
Did you not hear me earlier?

344
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,429
I heard it all.

345
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,058
I also heard that you'd do better
the next opportunity that you get.

346
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,393
Of course.

347
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,895
People with experience
always have the advantage.

348
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,688
Gosh, please!

349
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,774
What?

350
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,864
How much did you drink?

351
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,244
Asshole.

352
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,371
What did you say?

353
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,834
I really loved you.

354
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,466
Hey…

355
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,095
And she's running again.

356
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,481
Na-eun.

357
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,109
Ms. Kim Na-eun.

358
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,619
Na-eun.

359
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,002
Who's breaking up? Why would we break up?

360
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,131
What can we do now then?

361
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,216
I should be asking you that.

362
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,428
We were planning our wedding
just a few days ago.

363
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,680
Then suddenly you say you "loved" me?

364
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,223
Why is that in the past tense?

365
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,895
If you want to break up with me,
does that mean our relationship is over?

366
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,565
How could you think about breaking up
just because you're mad at me?

367
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,318
You should think
about how to overcome this together.

368
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,821
You think I thought about
breaking up right away?

369
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,031
That's not true.

370
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,160
I wanted to speak honestly with you.

371
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,579
But you kept avoiding it.

372
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,456
All you did was apologize!

373
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,503
You said that we were at it again

374
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,047
and that you were sick of this.

375
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,300
What could I possibly say
to someone who said those things?

376
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,887
We make each other uncomfortable
without getting to communicate

377
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,096
even if we're together.

378
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,807
How can we get married like that?

379
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,893
It's only because I didn't want
to fight with you--

380
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,936
Exactly.

381
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,647
Before we fight again…

382
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,441
before we fight more, let's end this.

383
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,073
Who are you to end this?
And what are we ending?

384
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,825
Jun-Hyeong.

385
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,077
I can't break up with you.

386
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,995
Why not?

387
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,747
Because I still love you!

388
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,129
From the moment I decided to marry you…

389
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:45,134
No, from the moment I first saw you,
my feelings haven't changed.

390
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,013
I can't live

391
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,891
without you.

392
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,436
So let's not do this,

393
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,106
Na-eun.

394
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,652
Let's work things out together as we go.

395
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,280
I'll really do my best.

396
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,747
Hurry and accept his apology.

397
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,542
Stop making a big fuss at night.

398
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,378
Those are the good times.

399
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,172
Goodness.

400
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,428
Don't fight.

401
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,512
Thank you.

402
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,267
I guess we don't need to send out
wedding invitations to the neighbors.

403
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,312
They found out all at once.

404
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,231
How embarrassing, seriously.

405
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,151
-Come inside.
-Goodness.

406
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,450
Are you okay? Are you feeling sick?
Should I go buy you some water?

407
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,745
I'm so embarrassed
because everyone saw us.

408
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,666
Don't laugh.

409
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,138
I love you.

410
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,350
I still…

411
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,436
No, I've always loved you

412
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,813
so I can't break up with you.

413
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,899
I know you feel the same way.

414
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,908
Is it possible that we won't fight again?

415
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,452
No.

416
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,995
We'll fight a whole lot.

417
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,081
How could we not fight?

418
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,084
We're two different people
who decided to live together.

419
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,753
We'll fight like cats and dogs.

420
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,465
But you still want to live with me?

421
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,051
Na-eun.

422
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,054
I'm not fighting because of you.

423
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,639
I'm fighting because it's you.

424
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,308
Even when we fight,
I want to be by your side.

425
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,643
Even if we fight,

426
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,396
it's because I want to be happy with you.

427
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,073
I love you, Na-eun.

428
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,422
SOJU, BEER, SNACKS

429
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,017
Did you call me
because you needed someone to drink with?

430
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,061
No.

431
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,608
It's because I'm embarrassed
to apologize sober.

432
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,030
Gosh, you don't need to apologize.

433
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:57,827
Forget it. I'll count that as an apology,
so stop punishing yourself.

434
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,748
I…

435
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,085
didn't say that because I hated you.

436
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,257
It's because I have trauma
from my mother-in-law.

437
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,303
Just how hard did she make it for you
that you feel this way?

438
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,097
It's a long story.

439
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,684
Anyway, because I've been through it,

440
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:26,105
I couldn't stand to see my daughter
go through the same thing.

441
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,649
That's why I went a little overboard.

442
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:33,029
I mean, but I never treated her like that.

443
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,908
Gosh, Na-eun is such a good girl,
I don't know what to do with myself.

444
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,538
What about the price tag
on the wedding gift?

445
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,962
That was just the company's mistake.

446
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,424
You swear on Jun-hyeong's name?

447
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,760
Gosh.

448
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,554
That's so immature.

449
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,266
Who even says that at our age?

450
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,855
You sent it on purpose, didn't you?

451
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,778
Something felt off when I saw that.

452
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,571
It was like a warning sign
of a difficult mother-in-law.

453
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,449
Honestly, it wasn't because of Na-eun,
it was because of you.

454
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,331
You humiliated me with changnanjeot
at our first meeting.

455
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:33,047
If you say you've pickled changnanjeot
to someone who's only ever bought it,

456
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,216
what does that make me?

457
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,475
Say what you like.

458
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,021
I don't have any right
to say anything to you.

459
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,907
Ms. Park.

460
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,369
Please take good care of Na-eun.

461
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,624
If you treat her well,
she'll do the same for you.

462
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,921
You can hate and abuse me all you like,

463
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,800
but please be kind to Na-eun.

464
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,852
I would do that even if you hadn't asked,

465
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,646
since she looks nothing like you.

466
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,652
Thank you, Ms. Park.

467
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,241
Please take good care of Jun-hyeong too.

468
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,624
Cheers.

469
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,001
Thank you.

470
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,096
Na-eun.

471
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,792
Forget it. Act like you did before.

472
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,294
I have a conscience too, you know.

473
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,046
I should at least keep it up
for a few days.

474
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,051
I'm happy to see you smile.

475
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,179
Please keep smiling like that.

476
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,268
I'm sorry.

477
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,520
What?

478
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,357
For saying we should break up
at the studio.

479
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,529
I shouldn't have run out like that then.

480
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,240
It's fine.

481
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,118
I'm the one
who made you feel that way then.

482
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,456
If my partner wasn't being sincere
and kept trying to rush things

483
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,252
when I was busy with work and the wedding,

484
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,880
while thoughtlessly letting his mother
intervene and complicate things,

485
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,509
-I'd explode too.
-Right, your mom…

486
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,971
Is she okay? Did she say anything?

487
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,432
She pushed me to make up with you quickly.

488
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,975
There's nothing to worry about.

489
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,562
No, that's with you.
With me, it'll be different.

490
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,564
What should I do?

491
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,150
Should we go talk to her now?

492
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,778
No. We're not doing that from now on.

493
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,906
Then what?

494
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,881
I'm sorry to have to see you again
under these circumstances.

495
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,049
It's fine.

496
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,386
My wife seems to have made
a huge misstep with your wife.

497
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,221
I'm deeply ashamed.

498
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:13,142
I heard about it too late,
so I couldn't apologize sooner.

499
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,518
Gosh, don't mention it.

500
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,479
We also made mistakes on our part,

501
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,732
but your wife came to
talk it over with us at our office.

502
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,776
We resolved things well.

503
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,444
It's no problem.

504
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,698
I made a mistake, so it's only right
that I go to her and make an apology.

505
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,492
Goodness, no.

506
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,787
My hastiness is what caused all this.

507
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,414
Let's not argue about it.

508
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,168
Let's just laugh it off
as a one-off thing.

509
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:43,631
Yes, we should. We just tried to do
what was best for the kids.

510
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,386
It would have been better if only the kids
had gone to look for a house,

511
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,722
but things got complicated
because we got in the way.

512
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,432
So from now on,

513
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,852
we've decided not to get involved
in any of the housing issues.

514
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,270
We will do the same.

515
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,649
From now on, you two make the decisions
without our help,

516
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,526
whether it be the home or the interior.

517
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,568
-Okay.
-Okay.

518
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,586
What should I do, sir?

519
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:27,091
I can get Na-eun to change her mind,
but as for our mothers…

520
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,594
First of all,

521
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,805
let's meet all together.

522
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,974
But what if round two starts?

523
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:39,228
I'll meet your dad in advance
and talk to him so that doesn't happen.

524
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:44,650
Then once we're all gathered,
the dads will apologize to each other.

525
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,485
Then what will the moms do?

526
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,113
Nobody there wants this wedding
to be called off.

527
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,825
Everything will get settled there.

528
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,787
Then after the mood has been lightened,

529
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,039
you go in for the final blow.

530
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,791
The final blow?

531
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,710
Yes, that's what life is all about.

532
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,254
If you do it right,

533
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,214
it will all end well.

534
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,849
First of all,

535
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,728
I'd like to apologize for worrying you
right before our wedding.

536
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,191
We're sorry.

537
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,402
We'll do our best
to not let this happen again.

538
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,653
Yes.

539
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,990
We brought you all here today
because we would like to

540
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,828
apologize for worrying you
and to give you something as well.

541
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,548
This is our wedding invitation.

542
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,551
We wanted our parents
to be the first to get them.

543
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,889
SEO JUN-HYEONG, KIM NA-EUN
LOVE

544
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,395
THANK YOU FOR RAISING ME FOR 36 YEARS
JUN-HYEONG

545
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,193
THANK YOU FOR RAISING ME FOR 32 YEARS
NA-EUN

546
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,362
Thank you for raising me so well
for 36 years

547
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,699
so that I could get married now.

548
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,584
Thank you for raising me so well
for 32 years

549
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,127
so that I could get married now.

550
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,927
We will do what's right and pay back
our gratitude by living harmoniously.

551
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,597
Well, we're not asking for that.
Just don't fight with each other.

552
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,100
Right. Be good to each other from now on.

553
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,519
And stop calling your parents together.

554
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,687
That's what I'm saying.

555
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,481
How long are you going to
keep punishing your parents?

556
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,400
Yes.

557
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,859
-We'll do well.
-We'll do well.

558
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,486
All right.

559
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,323
In the spirit of moving past all this,
shall we have a drink?

560
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,951
-Yes.
-You first.

561
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,495
Thank you.

562
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,665
Here, take this.

563
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,959
Here.

564
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,561
It's no big deal.

565
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,439
Just live the life that makes you happy.

566
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,481
I'm sorry.

567
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,150
Why do you keep apologizing?

568
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,776
Goodness, my sweet daughter.

569
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,069
Mom.

570
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,988
You want us to make a larger deposit?

571
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:39,325
Your wedding is soon,
so I don't know if that'll be possible.

572
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,118
Why are you sweating so much?

573
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,454
You might faint before the wedding begins.

574
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,748
Run. This is your last chance.

575
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,750
Do you think our wedding

576
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,877
will go well?

577
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:57,551
