1
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,246
Congratulations!

2
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,124
As if to ridicule our naivety
in believing that

3
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,627
everything would be okay
following the dramatic reconciliation,

4
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,882
eventful days unfolded once again.

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,259
You want us to make a larger deposit?

6
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,677
Or find another place.

7
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,262
Goodness.

8
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,807
Your wedding is soon,
so I don't know if that'll be possible.

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,435
What should we do?

10
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,025
As we were looking for a home,

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,778
I personally found out

12
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,281
why Seoul's citizens are divided into
two categories, landlords and tenants.

13
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,745
I realized that having hotel-like
or cafe-like interior decor

14
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,790
was just a pipe dream.

15
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,461
And our second wedding shoot,
which we had to pay double for,

16
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,923
after stopping the first one
because of an impulsive breakup,

17
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:35,428
taught me to be extra careful
with things that cost money.

18
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,947
HYEON-JI: I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE IT.
TOMORROW'S MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S BIRTHDAY.

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,240
HYE-SEONG : NA-EUN, I'M SORRY

20
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,868
And as my friends came up
with a lot of excuses to miss my wedding,

21
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,249
I realized what it meant
to find out who my true friends are.

22
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,171
As I came to learn all these things,
time passed,

23
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,633
and suddenly it was the day
before my wedding.

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,890
FINALE
REACHING HOME PLATE

25
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,101
Left foot, right foot.

26
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,395
Left foot, right foot.

27
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,814
No, Dad, you're too stiff.

28
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,484
Be natural and a bit more relaxed.
And you're too fast now.

29
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,070
You said earlier I was going too slow.

30
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,490
This is supposed to be performed
in three beats per measure.

31
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,702
Hey, Na-eun,
this isn't some sort of military parade.

32
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,495
Why do we need to practice all day?

33
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,290
We need to practice
so no mistakes are made tomorrow.

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,375
At this rate, I'm going to
get muscle cramps.

35
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,962
I'll be limping my leg
during the bride's entrance.

36
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,381
I'll do fine tomorrow
so let's stop for today, okay?

37
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,050
Okay, then just this last time.
One last time.

38
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,261
Seriously, you said that moments ago.

39
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,471
Well, if you do well,
it'll be over quickly.

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,223
Goodness, okay.

41
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,018
-Hey, do you hear something?
-What?

42
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,436
I think we have a phone call.

43
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,400
Dad!

44
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,535
I'm so nervous.

45
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,746
Then you should be with your boyfriend.

46
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,749
I can't. It'll be worse
if he gets nervous.

47
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,293
Will I do well tomorrow?

48
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,088
You're nervous today, but you'll be
too busy to be nervous tomorrow.

49
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,548
-Is it really like that?
-Yes.

50
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,176
Just listen to the wedding planner.

51
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,512
If she says, "Come here," go.
If she says, "Stand here," stand there.

52
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,389
If she says, "Take pictures," do that.

53
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,892
She'll eventually tell you
to enter the wedding hall.

54
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,727
Then just walk down the aisle.

55
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,356
Things will fly by and before you know it,
the ceremony is over.

56
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,026
I want it to be over already.

57
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,237
I've never seen you so nervous before.

58
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,906
You'll know how I feel
when you get married.

59
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,199
No.

60
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,408
What?

61
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,993
I won't be able to.

62
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,495
Why?

63
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,956
I thought about it carefully

64
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,167
and I think my soulmate is already dead.

65
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,587
I mean, if that's not the case,
then why hasn't he shown up yet?

66
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,967
Just wait. Once the wedding is over,
I'll set you up on a blind date.

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,010
Hey, and what about me?

68
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,222
Hui-seon, you should just date Min-woo.

69
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,807
Min-woo is a good guy.

70
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,684
Don't even say that.

71
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,604
He rents all these flashy cars
to keep hitting on me.

72
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,189
Jeez, it's so embarrassing.

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,607
No way.

74
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,735
Was he the guy who drove a sports car
to come to see you at work?

75
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,903
Yes.

76
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,446
It was an S-Class this time.

77
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,949
He must have a second job
renting out cars.

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,785
Those are all Min-woo's cars.

79
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,121
What?

80
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,416
He has an abalone farm in Jindo,
doesn't he?

81
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,127
His face gives me "fishing village" vibes.

82
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,964
No, it's more like "agriculture" vibes.
Does he have a big orchard in Chungcheong?

83
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,466
No, what's with you guys?

84
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,347
Look.

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,933
SECOND SON OF FUZIMA CONSTRUCTION

86
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,568
Gosh…

87
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,572
Here. This is the script
for tomorrow's wedding.

88
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,866
Look it over carefully.

89
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,244
Look at it, punk.

90
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,873
Study it and just read
exactly what it says.

91
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,127
All our parents are going to be there,
so just leave everyone alone.

92
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,754
And no weird party tricks.

93
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,216
My father's coworkers will be there too,
so you need to be serious

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,760
and follow the script.

95
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,677
Got it?

96
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,512
Then, what are you going to do for me?

97
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,891
I'll buy you some really nice liquor.

98
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,561
Hey. That's not what I'm asking for.

99
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,105
Then what?

100
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,150
After the wedding ceremony,
call Hui-seon, me, and everyone else,

101
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,652
and have an after-party
and a housewarming party.

102
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,655
Well, if there's time,
a couple's trip too.

103
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,700
Be a little proactive with it, would you?

104
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,911
Fine, I'll do that
if the situation allows it.

105
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,373
Hey, if that doesn't work,
then just have a big fight with Na-eun.

106
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,209
You're good at that, aren't you?

107
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,712
I'm getting married tomorrow.
How could you?

108
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,257
But once you get married to Na-eun,

109
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,551
there won't be as many excuses
to meet Hui-seon!

110
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,386
What's the point? You don't click.

111
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,930
What do you mean we don't click?

112
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,348
Your…

113
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,516
It's your face.

114
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:37,021
Hui-seon is all about looks,
but you're not her style.

115
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,773
My face?

116
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,194
Hello, I'm Jang Min-woo.

117
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,446
Damn it, I'm sorry. Please, stop.

118
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,323
Why are you doing that to me? Tell me.

119
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,033
No, I'm sorry.

120
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,493
Okay.

121
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,414
Hey, Na-eun.

122
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,457
Yes.

123
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,001
No. I just saw something I shouldn't have.

124
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,047
What?

125
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,882
What about Min-woo?

126
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,306
By the way, congrats, Na-eun.

127
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,183
Thank you, Min-woo.

128
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,019
Live a happy life from now on,
and don't fight.

129
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,230
Thank you, ladies.

130
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,692
Thanks to you two, we were able to
make it to our wedding.

131
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,945
That's nowhere enough
in expressing your gratitude.

132
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:30,074
After the wedding, take us all out
and buy us drinks.

133
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,951
You be quiet.

134
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,203
You're the one
who did the least work here.

135
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,081
-Me?
-That's not true.

136
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,878
It was Min-woo who worked the hardest
during the bridal shower.

137
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,005
Min-woo?

138
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,214
I mean…

139
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,135
We've been around each other long enough

140
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,511
to call each other by name.

141
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,391
Does this make you feel uncomfortable?

142
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,685
Goodness, no. I love it.

143
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,146
Su-yeon, call me whatever you like.

144
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,232
I offended you during the bridal shower,

145
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,569
but you let it go
and even suggested that we not be formal.

146
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,778
Well, I'm very thankful.

147
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:12,241
It's nothing. You can make mistakes.
You can relax when you're around me.

148
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,328
Okay.

149
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,417
You've always called Jun-hyeong,
"Na-eun's boyfriend"

150
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,045
but now you're calling Min-woo by name.

151
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:30,301
Because it feels inappropriate
to be calling Na-eun's boyfriend by name.

152
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,137
So, that's why you always
referred to him like that?

153
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,224
After tomorrow, just call him by his name.

154
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,642
Oh, that's good.

155
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,810
Okay, Jun-hyeong.

156
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,772
Min-woo.

157
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,693
I haven't had a woman
address me this way in a long time.

158
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,284
Hui-seon, are you interested in him?

159
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,869
What?

160
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,289
-No?
-That's great.

161
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,584
Na-eun, then could you set me up
on a date with him?

162
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,213
Well, I don't think Min-woo
is your type, though?

163
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,924
I won't know unless
I spend some time with him.

164
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,512
You're making your intentions
too obvious by doing this right away.

165
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,389
What? What's wrong with that?

166
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:21,477
Wait, Hui-seon.
Would you feel upset if I meet him?

167
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,397
What?

168
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,190
No?

169
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,316
Na-eun.

170
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,319
Introduce them to each other.
You two should meet.

171
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,446
Call him up and plan something.

172
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,365
Go see him.

173
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,836
Jun-Hyeong, let's head out.

174
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,297
It's the day before our wedding.
We should go rest.

175
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,009
Didn't you say you had plans too,
Hui-seon?

176
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,136
Me? No?

177
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:01,559
By the way, Su-yeon and Min-woo
would look good together.

178
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,311
Really?

179
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,397
-What?
-You think they'd look good together?

180
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,488
Lucky you. You must be happy to hear that.

181
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,575
Of course.

182
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,827
Su-yeon and I would look good together.

183
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,828
But…

184
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,581
I think Hui-seon would look even better

185
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,334
with me.

186
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,592
It's embarrassing since everyone is here.

187
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,517
So, Su-yeon did that on purpose?

188
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,187
-To taunt Hui-seon?
-Yes.

189
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,272
I mean, with Hui-seon's personality,

190
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,149
if she keeps in contact with someone,

191
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,234
it definitely means
she's interested in them.

192
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,446
But she keeps denying it.

193
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,115
Also, I think it'd be a waste
if she missed out.

194
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,953
I thought it'd be nice
to have someone like that around,

195
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,498
but not as a boyfriend.

196
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,042
-Were you in on it too?
-Yes.

197
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,380
Even if she's interested, she still needs
a little push to get started.

198
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:17,259
For Hui-seon, it's hard to admit
that she's interested in someone.

199
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,636
Why?

200
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,887
Because she's divorced?

201
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,764
And her age.

202
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,432
And her age.

203
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,768
Jeez, talking about this
makes me feel so lonely.

204
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,065
There will be a lot of my acquaintances
at the wedding. Try to pick someone out.

205
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,318
Once we're back from our honeymoon,
I'll set you up with them.

206
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,903
Thank you.

207
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,948
So then does that mean we can all go
on a couple's trip together?

208
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,700
You're already talking
about a couple's trip?

209
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:46,038
She falls in love quickly. Just a simple
gesture and she's head over heels.

210
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,129
Well, they say
wine is all about the aroma.

211
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,298
-Is this wine?
-Is this juice?

212
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,725
I hope things work out between them.

213
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,519
That'd be nice.

214
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,439
Should we give the bouquet
to Hui-seon tomorrow?

215
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,192
You're just as intense as Su-yeon.

216
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,695
You're right, it is pretty rushed.

217
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,659
After today, it's over.

218
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,453
What is?

219
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,249
We won't have to part ways
and go to separate homes anymore.

220
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,835
You're right.

221
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,920
It'll be over after the wedding ceremony.

222
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,924
Thinking about the wedding again
makes me nervous.

223
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,551
Which part?

224
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,638
I'm worried I might trip
while going down the aisle,

225
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,557
or whether our guests will come.

226
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,351
There's nothing to worry about.

227
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,604
What's there to worry about
if I'm by your side?

228
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,440
If you fall, I'll definitely help you up.

229
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,068
And if the wedding is too quiet,
I'll make a huge fuss over you.

230
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,656
And if you still feel worried,

231
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,369
you can focus on thinking
"This is the end of it."

232
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:08,996
What?

233
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,292
There were a lot of incidents
while we prepared for our wedding, right?

234
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,421
But after tomorrow, all of that is over.

235
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,925
"Once this wedding is over, we're free."

236
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,053
Thinking that will make you
look forward to the wedding.

237
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,347
But how could you?

238
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,974
You should be waiting for the moment
to be married to me.

239
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,353
I can't think about
getting married to you.

240
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,562
Why?

241
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,732
Because my heart races
just thinking about it.

242
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,247
It's tomorrow.

243
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,624
I'm excited.

244
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,464
I'm home.

245
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,757
Hey, welcome home.

246
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,681
You're here.

247
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,810
What's going on here?

248
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,815
No way! Did you get
another meridian massage?

249
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,112
People don't change. Goodness.

250
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,072
Mom!

251
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,907
Is it bad?

252
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,201
Of course, it is.

253
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:34,248
Well, that woman said that the bruising
was only because it was my first time.

254
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,209
She guaranteed
I wouldn't be bruised this time.

255
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,420
Now she's made me look like this again.

256
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,090
After this ceremony is over,
I'm going after that woman.

257
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,135
That's okay.

258
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,722
Since this is the second time,
there's no way

259
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,391
I wouldn't be just as upset
as the first time!

260
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,060
Why are you doing this to me?

261
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,480
At least she's consistent.

262
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,400
She was bruised at the family meeting,
and she's bruised at the wedding.

263
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,613
Seriously, this man.
I'm already sorry enough as is.

264
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,533
-Then stop doing things to be sorry about!
-Dad, don't be like that.

265
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,993
Mom, it's okay.

266
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,995
We can just give you thicker makeup.

267
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,916
I'm sorry for everything.

268
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,334
I said it's fine.

269
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,629
It hurts me more to see you
feeling down like this.

270
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,596
Goodness.

271
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,224
I worked too much to do good
by you when you were young.

272
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,811
But now you've grown up beautifully
and are getting married.

273
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,314
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,108
Again?

275
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,860
Why do you keep apologizing?

276
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:51,075
Since you're getting married,
I just have so much weighing on my mind.

277
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,495
I couldn't give you the same things
other kids had,

278
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,497
I didn't always speak kindly to you,

279
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,082
and I nagged you every day.

280
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,543
I know it was all for my sake.

281
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,339
And if you think about it,
I should be the one apologizing.

282
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,218
I haven't done enough for you two,
yet I'm getting married.

283
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,262
No.

284
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,473
Na-eun,

285
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,811
being my daughter
is more than enough for me.

286
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,402
Thank you for being born.

287
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,990
Mom.

288
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,038
Okay! That's enough for today.

289
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,877
Hey, your mom's already bruised up.
If her eyes get swollen on top of that,

290
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,756
it'll look like we have problems at home.
So stop now.

291
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,843
Jeez!

292
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,847
Goodness, my sweet daughter.

293
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,223
Mom.

294
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,561
-Come on, enough of that!
-Gosh.

295
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,603
Quit it.

296
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,856
What's with you today?

297
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,191
-Dad.
-My goodness.

298
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,361
-I'll do better.
-All right. Jeez.

299
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,822
Goodness, no. I'm not sad.

300
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,617
My son getting married is like having
a huge weight lifted off me.

301
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,453
I'm relieved.

302
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,206
Gosh, having an older son is tiring.

303
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,375
Mom.

304
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,461
Goodness.

305
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,547
Yes. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

306
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,591
Thank you.

307
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,178
My goodness. Why didn't you call?

308
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,346
I thought you might be feeling down,
so I came by.

309
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,891
Why would I feel down?

310
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,059
Who knows.

311
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,479
Because it's the day
before your only son gets married?

312
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,483
Jeez, is that something to be down about?
I feel relieved.

313
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,277
My mom is cooler than I thought.

314
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,447
Of course! And I'll be
a really cool mother-in-law too.

315
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,784
Mom, please do that.

316
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,578
Since I've experienced what it's like

317
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,663
when Na-eun and your opinions
don't match up,

318
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,624
I really couldn't do it.

319
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,793
What are you talking about?

320
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,754
From now on,
your role is really important.

321
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,090
Depending on how you act,

322
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,968
your married life could be
either heaven or hell.

323
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,221
Come on, it's not that serious.

324
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,515
This isn't a joke, so listen to me.

325
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,144
Your married life depends on you.

326
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,940
If you cherish Na-eun, so will I.

327
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,777
If you respect your mother,
Na-eun will do the same.

328
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,737
You got it?

329
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,073
Yes. I'll bear that in mind.

330
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,828
-Mom, do you want a glass of wine?
-Sure.

331
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,332
Mom, thank you.

332
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,460
For what?

333
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,133
Well, you know, for raising me so well.

334
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,680
My goodness.
Why are you acting so out of character?

335
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,432
Well, I just did.

336
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,564
Goodness, you must have matured
now that you're getting married.

337
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,993
JUN-HYEONG LOOKS CUTE
EVEN WITH A BALD HEAD. I LOVE YOU, SON

338
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,275
SUNDAY, APRIL 10

339
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,685
Jeez.

340
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,479
How unlucky.

341
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,590
SEO JUN-HYEONG, KIM NA-EUN

342
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,758
Hey, Jun-hyeong.

343
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,051
-Yes.
-Come here.

344
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,803
Okay.

345
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,932
What's with that look? Relax your face.

346
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,061
Thank you.

347
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,908
Hey, Jun-hyeong.
Na-eun's mom's face looks a bit…

348
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,788
Hey, what's wrong with you?

349
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,832
Why are you sweating so much?

350
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,793
Mom, I'm so nervous right now.

351
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,881
My heart rate is through the roof.

352
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,382
Goodness.

353
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,844
Go have a cheongsimhwan.

354
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,721
I already had one.

355
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,641
Eat one more. You might faint
before you even go into the ceremony.

356
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,352
Okay.

357
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,230
Goodness.

358
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,865
Take a deep breath.

359
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,872
Jun-hyeong, don't be nervous.

360
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,292
No, I'm not nervous.
I'm just a little anxious.

361
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,836
Right? It's nerve-wracking.

362
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,214
It's normal to feel like this
before the wedding.

363
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,551
Jun-hyeong. look at me.

364
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,807
You said this to me yesterday.

365
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,726
"What's there to worry about
if I'm by your side?"

366
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,687
If I fall, you'll be there to pick me up.

367
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,482
You said you'd fix it
if something happened.

368
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,611
Of course, I will.

369
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,155
I'll do the same.

370
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,032
So don't be nervous.

371
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,201
I'm right by your side.

372
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,092
What is it?

373
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,683
-I'm even more nervous now.
-What?

374
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,853
Because you look more beautiful
than I thought you would be.

375
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,020
Jeez.

376
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,357
I guess you're not nervous anymore
now that you're joking.

377
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,694
Do you think our wedding will go well?

378
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,112
Of course!

379
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,407
We can do anything well
when we're together.

380
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,034
You're right.

381
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,537
It's the two of us here, right?

382
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,374
We've got this.

383
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,668
I'll go out there now.

384
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,087
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

385
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,553
-Na-eun.
-Yes?

386
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,681
You look amazing today.

387
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,810
You too.

388
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,334
Congratulations.

389
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,418
-Eat before you go.
-Okay.

390
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,170
-Hello.
-Welcome.

391
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,671
Thank you.

392
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:15,180
Won't there be a huge difference between
your father who works for a conglomerate

393
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,599
and me who just runs a real estate office?

394
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,311
From our jobs to the number of guests,
and even the number of wreaths.

395
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,526
Min-woo.

396
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,574
-Goodness.
-My gosh!

397
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,202
Goodness, thank you for coming
from so far.

398
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,121
This isn't for just anyone.
This is your daughter's wedding.

399
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,832
I'd come even if you were having
the wedding in Jeju.

400
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,418
Thank you. Hurry on in and find a seat.

401
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,255
Goodness, you have
a full face of makeup today.

402
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,048
You really tried your best.

403
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,511
Well, we're paying a lot of money for it,
so I asked them to pull out all the stops.

404
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,554
Wonderful, you look pretty.

405
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,976
Well, I guess you're doing
much better than you seemed to.

406
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,437
-What?
-You must have a really great social life.

407
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,397
Well…

408
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,066
How cool.

409
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,569
Go on in.

410
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,779
Head on in. Yes.

411
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,115
Jeez.

412
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:21,788
SANMU CORP. CEO LEE GANG-MIN
TAERANG C&T CEO HAN JEONG-SU

413
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,500
Hello, Mr. Park.

414
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,669
Gosh, thank you for coming
from so far away.

415
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,795
This is my wife.

416
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,089
Yes, okay. Eat before you go. Okay.

417
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,429
-I'm Jun-hyeong's senior colleague.
-Yes. Nice to meet you.

418
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,763
Thank you.

419
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,850
I see he gets his looks from his mother.

420
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,060
Congratulations.

421
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,062
Please look after Jun-hyeong.

422
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,815
Was there a lot of traffic?

423
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,816
Hey.

424
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,526
So you're finally getting married?

425
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,486
Jeez.

426
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,905
Congrats.

427
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,702
This is my wife. She and your fiancee work
at the same company. The same department.

428
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,996
Yes, thank you for coming.

429
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,331
Congratulations.

430
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,666
When looking at Na-eun,

431
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,669
I wondered who would get to marry
a smart and beautiful woman like her.

432
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,255
She's marrying such a handsome
and tall man.

433
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,299
Gosh, thank you.

434
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,468
I'm so jealous.

435
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,348
Of what?

436
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,061
I should poke my eyes out.

437
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,730
Jun-hyeong, this is your last chance.

438
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,023
What?

439
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,650
What?

440
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,070
Run. Right now!

441
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,572
-You want me to run?
-What?

442
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,865
Jeez!

443
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,202
What are you saying
on such a special occasion like this?

444
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,079
Jeez, this again.

445
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,831
I'm sorry. He goes too far with his jokes.

446
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,250
No, it's not a joke.

447
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,627
Hurry on in.

448
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,504
Let's all hang out together later.

449
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,546
Congrats.

450
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,715
Mr. Seo!

451
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,217
Congrats on your wedding.

452
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,053
You look great. Do well, okay?

453
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,639
What's with you guys?
Did you go to a salon?

454
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,349
You look so beautiful.

455
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,892
You're the most beautiful today.

456
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,936
You look amazing too.

457
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,524
Seeing you in full makeup, it seems
you're trying to impress someone.

458
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,444
We know everything. No point in asking.
Hui-seon is embarrassed.

459
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,614
If that's the case, I wonder
if I should give Hui-seon the bouquet.

460
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:23,493
Jeez, you two get along too well
when you're teasing me.

461
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,870
Stop joking and focus on your wedding.

462
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,581
You will never be able
to relive today again.

463
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,583
No, we could live it again.

464
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,127
What?

465
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,380
Hui-seon. She's just wishing me well.

466
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,339
How so?

467
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,384
Of course! She's saying that it might
be you who gets married next.

468
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,470
Hey, at this age, does dating
always mean marriage?

469
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,307
Na-eun, I thought you were a modern woman
but you're quite old-fashioned.

470
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,976
She said dating!

471
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,978
I heard it too. Those two must be dating.

472
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,397
Seeing you joke like this,

473
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,275
it seems you're not nervous at all,
are you, Ms. Bride?

474
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,901
Rather than being nervous,

475
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,530
I just want to get through this wedding.

476
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,741
Get through it?
This is only the beginning.

477
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,825
What?

478
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,911
Well, you think it's over
once you walk down the aisle?

479
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,955
After this, you need to go perform
pyebaek.

480
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,791
Then after pyebaek,
you'll need to go pay for the wedding.

481
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,793
And then you have the honeymoon.

482
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,755
Once you come back, you have to
go greet each other's families.

483
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,382
Then there's the ordeal
of having a housewarming party.

484
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,470
-I wasn't going to bring this one up, but…
-What?

485
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:28,725
After marriage, you realize
that it was heaven before marriage.

486
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,311
She is still going on about that.

487
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,899
Congrats on your wedding, Kim Na-eun.

488
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,484
I mean it.

489
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,444
Congratulations, Na-eun.

490
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,445
I mean it.

491
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,739
Thank you both.

492
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,534
If you're thankful,
you have to live a happy life.

493
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,329
Be happy.

494
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,124
Cut. I'll take just one more photo here.

495
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,627
One, two, "Happy."

496
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,339
What? Hey!

497
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,548
-Hey there!
-You're here?

498
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,342
-You're here?
-Hey!

499
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,052
Gosh, how pretty.

500
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,472
Na-eun, you look so beautiful.

501
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,891
-You look amazing.
-You're taking photos, right?

502
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,809
-Yes.
-Yes.

503
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,644
Yes, then please come close together.

504
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,229
You're so pretty.

505
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,314
One, two.

506
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,193
You still don't have a girlfriend? Gosh.

507
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,569
Hey Hui-seon.

508
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,154
Hey.

509
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,386
Isn't it bright in here?

510
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,680
Well, I did go to a barber.

511
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,891
-Well, Min-woo, I'll see you later.
-Okay.

512
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,269
-I'm going to go greet Jun-hyeong.
-Okay, go ahead.

513
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,604
Would you like to go with me?

514
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,484
What?

515
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,527
Well…

516
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:07,156
I forgot to
congratulate Jun-hyeong, actually.

517
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,119
Right, I haven't greeted him either.

518
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,620
Let's go together.

519
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,668
Do you two know Jeong-sin?

520
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,627
No?

521
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,713
I'd like to get to know him

522
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,464
starting now.

523
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,593
Well…

524
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,388
-Min-woo.
-What?

525
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,223
Who are they?

526
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,475
As for her, you don't need to know her.

527
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,978
As for this person,
take her to go greet Jun-hyeong

528
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,064
and tell her all about yourself. Go..

529
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,483
-Wait, Min-woo, me?
-Yes, go, Jeong-sin, go.

530
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,776
It's hectic. Just go.

531
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,819
-Okay.
-Go.

532
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,737
Okay, bye.

533
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,864
Wait, I want to go too.

534
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,539
Don't look at other men like that
in front of me.

535
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,042
I'll get jealous.

536
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,379
You're fucking awesome.

537
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:13,806
Seo Jun-hyeong and Kim Na-eun's wedding
ceremony is starting now.

538
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,017
Everyone, please give
a big round of applause.

539
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,530
Please give them a round of applause.

540
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,744
All right, the ceremony's star,

541
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,038
Seo Jun-hyeong,
will be making an entrance.

542
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,041
Everyone, please take a look behind you.

543
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:00,937
Jun-hyeong.

544
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,480
Are you ready?

545
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,359
All right, groom, please enter.

546
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,571
Please give a big round of applause.

547
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,539
Please give another round of applause
to the groom

548
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,041
who's walking toward a happy future.

549
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,153
It's no big deal.

550
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,238
What?

551
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,658
You'll realize that all things must pass.

552
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,244
So there's no need

553
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,079
to overwork yourself.

554
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,165
Do what's needed

555
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,209
and just live the life
that makes you happy.

556
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,546
That's the only thing

557
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,382
we've ever wanted for you.

558
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,968
Living a life that makes you happy.

559
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,264
Dad.

560
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,059
That's all you have to do.

561
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,692
All right, here's the real star
of the day.

562
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,819
The bride will be making her entrance.

563
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:37,283
Please welcome the bride
with a big round of applause and cheers.

564
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,333
Bride.

565
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:47,960
Please, enter.

566
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,380
Everyone, please give
a big round of applause.

567
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,101
Kim Na-eun, the most beautiful bride
in the world, is coming down the aisle.

568
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,451
The groom, Seo Jun-hyeong,
please come forward and greet the bride.

569
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,539
Take care of her.

570
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,833
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

571
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,001
I'll make sure Na-eun is happy.

572
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:58,865
Please congratulate them
with a round of applause with love.

573
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,745
I promise to be a loving husband

574
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:09,250
who makes my wife smile every day
with generous love and expressions.

575
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,793
I promise to be a loving wife

576
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,297
that makes a smile spread
across my husband's face every day.

577
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,634

00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:23,806
I promise to respect my husband

We will never forget
everyone's warm blessings

580
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,477
and promise to live a happy life.

581
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,520
No, you won't.

582
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,983
I, Seo Jun-hyeong,
take Kim Na-eun as my wife.

583
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,946
I, Kim Na-eun, take Seo Jun-hyeong
as my husband.

584
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,699
-And promise here today
-And promise here today

585
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:45,036
-to stay by her side forever.
-to stay by his side forever.

586
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,998
The two have pledged
to keep their vows to each other.

587
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,210
Give them a round of applause
to congratulate them on becoming one.

588

Groom, bride…
Please, march down the aisle happily.

589
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,812
-One, two, three!

590
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:35,229
