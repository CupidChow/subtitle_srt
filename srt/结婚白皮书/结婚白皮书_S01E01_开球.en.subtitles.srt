1
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,760
Thank you.

2
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,514
That's nice and warm, isn't it?

3
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,895
It's nice to come out
for a walk like this.

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,022
I know, right?

5
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,609
You must be cold.

6
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,321
No, I'm fine.

7
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,115
No, your colds always last for so long.

8
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,743
I'm really fine.
Are you sure you won't be cold?

9
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,913
-Please, it's just a--
-It's okay. I'm really not that cold.

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,791
Maybe we've been outside too long.

11
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,503
Let's start heading back now.

12
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,483
Na-eun?

13
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,652
Yes, let's go.

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,081
EPISODE 1
FIRST PITCH

15
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,627
Thanks for everything, Jun-hyeong.
I'll head in.

16
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,504
Hold on.

17
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,715
Let's finish this song
before we say goodbye.

18
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,385
All right.

19
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,411
I'll head in now.

20
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,204
You should get going. It's cold.

21
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,917
I wish I didn't have to go.

22
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,170
I really have to go. You should too.

23
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,048
Fine. I'll leave once
I see that you've made it inside.

24
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,134
No. You leave first.

25
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,802
Oh, right.

26
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,805
You should put this back on
before you leave.

27
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,687
Good night.

28
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,572
Good night.

29
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,324
Bye.

30
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,495
Oh gosh. It's too cold out, isn't it?

31
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,080
Jeez, it's cold. Let's hurry up.

32
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,832
Gosh, it's cold.

33
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,445
What would it feel like

34
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,990
to get married?

35
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,793
Hey, Na-eun.

36
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,586
Hui-seon, what took you so long?

37
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,089
-Sorry. Where is Su-yeon?
-She went to the bathroom.

38
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,132
-Hurry up.
-Hey there!

39
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,550
The ceremony started already.

40
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,846
This couple has vowed
to love each other forever.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,642
They will now exchange their rings,
a symbol of their love.

42
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:32,188
The groom will place his ring
on his beloved bride's finger first.

43
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,648
They must be really happy.

44
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,777
-Nervous and excited at the same time.
-I doubt it.

45
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,948
Then do think you'll feel
the responsibility when you get married?

46
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,366
As if.

47
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,785
-Now, the bride will present…
-Then?

48
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,206
As someone who's already been there
and back, this is how it feels.

49
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,167
"Why did I ever decide to do this?"

50
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,627
Gosh, please.

51
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,964
How could you say that to someone
who started considering marriage?

52
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,425
Marriage? Are you going to get married?

53
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,636
Congratulations!

54
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,723
I guess it's about that time for you.

55
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,727
You've been in a relationship for 2 years,
and you're 32 and Jun-hyeong is 36, right?

56
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,646
Gosh, why do you have to
bring age into this?

57
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,606
You're just like our parents,

58
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,151
thinking we need
to be married by a certain age.

59
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,405
I'm against the idea of that as well.

60
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,657
-Marriage…
-Just crunch the numbers.

61
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,951
Then go for it
once everything seems to add up.

62
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,786
What?

63
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,997
So…

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,708
Your boyfriend has it all
when it comes to looks.

65
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,961
As for his career, he has a dream job
working in the public sector.

66
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,047
Then I guess it all comes down to this.

67
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,884
How prepared are his mother
and father for their retirement?

68
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,386
Hey, how can you talk about
something so materialistic

69
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,013
while at a sacred place like this?

70
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,474
Wedding halls aren't necessarily sacred.

71
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,643
We pay an admission fee to get in.

72
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,647
What do you mean by that?
Do you mean the congratulatory money?

73
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,025
Jeez, you young people these days…

74
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,195
Su-yeon, congratulatory money
is hardly an admission fee.

75
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,198
You should think of it
more as a type of variable insurance.

76
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,574
Minus any service fees,

77
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,368
you can get back
about 80 percent of the initial amount.

78
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,413
This applies to congratulatory money too.

79
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,501
You guys have no respect
for the institution of marriage.

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,172
Where did you have your wedding ceremony?

81
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,174
I bet it was at a really expensive place.

82
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,385
Gosh, you must have been
absolutely gorgeous back then.

83
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,054
Jeez.

84
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,726
What are you doing?

85
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,270
This wedding hall is really pretty.

86
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,815
They have
such a nice atmosphere too, right?

87
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,401
Are you really thinking
of getting married?

88
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,736
Did Jun-hyeong ask you to marry him?

89
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,116
No, it's not that.

90
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,743
I was at the park the other day.

91
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,206
And I saw an old couple
taking a walk together.

92
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,750
They just looked so peaceful
and happy together.

93
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,086
I started to imagine that
if Jun-hyeong and I got married,

94
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,838
that's how we'd end up one day.

95
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,881
I started to look forward to our future.

96
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,177
Hui-seon, I should get married
if I'm starting to feel like this, right?

97
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,639
That's right. You get married
when everything feels like that.

98
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,183
And when you start to think
that going to jail after killing him

99
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,144
might be a good idea,
you should get divorced.

100
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,812
Gosh, do you have to be so extreme again?

101
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,939
So? Are you going
to be getting married soon?

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,152
-I'd have to talk with Jun-hyeong first.
-No.

103
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,653
Don't do it.

104
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,197
You should never be the first
to bring up marriage.

105
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:29,991
Why not?

106
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,660
It shouldn't be the woman
who brings up marriage first.

107
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,328
Okay, but why?

108
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,414
Marriages…

109
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,500
only happen when the man
has the will to get married.

110
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,501
Please, Hui-seon.

111
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,546
It's the 21st century, okay?
Why do you speak so old?

112
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,674
It's like she's trapped
in the 90s all by herself.

113
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,676
You're going to
see Jun-hyeong later, right?

114
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,054
You should buy yourself
a nice bouquet of flowers,

115
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,681
and tell him you caught it at the wedding.

116
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,225
Then you'll naturally start
talking about marriage.

117
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,895
All you have to do
is steer the conversation

118
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,315
so that he's the one
who brings up "marriage" first.

119
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,358
Na-eun, just get out of here. Jeez.

120
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,861
Wait for me.

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,946
Hey.

122
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,879
What is it?
Don't you like the sound quality?

123
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:30,218
No, I just started thinking
of something Hui-seon told me earlier.

124
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,345
What did she say?

125
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:38,100
She said marriages only happen
when the man has the will to get married.

126
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,686
Marriage?

127
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,813
Yes, isn't that just ridiculous?

128
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,526
She sometimes says things that make
no sense in such a sincere way.

129
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,444
I think today was one of those days.

130
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,364
I mean, why should marriage
solely depend on the man's opinion?

131
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,450
It should happen
when things click between both people.

132
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,827
What? Yes.

133
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,665
Do you think the marriage will be
messed up if the girl brings it up first?

134
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,791
No, right?

135
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,710
If either person in a relationship wants
to get married,

136
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,589
then they can talk it out
and let things go their natural course.

137
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,717
Let's say I were to bring up the topic
of marriage with you first,

138
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,136
-it's not like we wouldn't get married--
-Hey, well…

139
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,180
I think we better pick
which one to buy now.

140
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,268
-What?
-Do you…

141
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,853
like this one?

142
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,189
Or do you like this one?

143
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,484
I don't know.

144
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,444
Let's go with whichever one you like.

145
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,072
The one I like?

146
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,742
Well, what I like is you.

147
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,708
All right, I guess
I'll go with this one then.

148
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,132
Marriages…

149
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,176
only happen when the man
has the will to get married.

150
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,483
I mean, why should marriage
solely depend on the man's opinion?

151
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,612
It should happen
when things click between both people.

152
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,031
What? Yes.

153
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,791
Don't you like the pasta?
Should I get something else for you?

154
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,001
No.

155
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,129
I guess I haven't fully digested my lunch.

156
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,507
-Should I get you digestive medicine?
-It's not that serious.

157
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,976
I just have something
that's been bugging me, that's all.

158
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,604
What is it?

159
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,690
-Before, when I mentioned marriage--
-What?

160
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,319
I think they're having
some promotion here. Look.

161
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,238
The first prize is a free ride on a yacht.

162
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,576
Awesome!

163
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,538
Seriously?

164
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,124
Could he really be avoiding
talking about marriage?

165
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,876
Let's ask for our ticket.

166
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,836
That can't be it.

167
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,297
There's no way. Why would he?

168
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,223
I bet all the servers
are pretty busy though.

169
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,392
Maybe we should wait
instead of bothering them.

170
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,351
Marriage.

171
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,145
What?

172
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,819
Marriage!

173
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,000
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

174
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,004
-What about marriage?
-I just wanted to say the word.

175
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,883
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

176
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,635
Na-eun…

177
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,524
Was he really trying
to avoid talking about marriage?

178
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,943
That doesn't make any sense.

179
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:17,903
Jeez.

180
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,030
WOULD IT BE OKAY
FOR ME TO GET MARRIED TO HIM?

181
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:24,118
I mean, whoever wrote this
must already know the answer.

182
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,204
It's obvious they shouldn't be getting
married to someone like this.

183
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,789
Jeez, get real.

184
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,500
"Please…

185
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,588
don't get married to anyone

186
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,966
who makes you want to reach out
to strangers on the internet."

187
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,806
-What do you want?
-Hui-seon, this is crazy.

188
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,724
What is?

189
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,767
Jun-hyeong keeps on avoiding
talking about marriage.

190
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,188
You ended up bringing it up first,
didn't you?

191
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,773
I mean, technically I brought it up first.

192
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,359
I didn't ask him
for us to get married or anything.

193
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,570
Since I went to a wedding earlier today,

194
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,906
I brought it up naturally.

195
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,201
He's being so rude
and just openly ignoring it.

196
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,914
It's just as ruder to keep talking about
marriage when he isn't even interested.

197
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,707
Who's side are you on right now?

198
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,876
Do I have to pick a team or something?

199
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,086
-I'll go with whoever's going to win.
-Come on!

200
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,881
-Is this any time to be joking?
-I wasn't joking.

201
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,300
Why would he start
avoiding talking about marriage?

202
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,635
He wasn't like this.

203
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,472
Do you think he's changed his mind?
But that can't be it.

204
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,100
Is he trying to tell me that
he won't marry me? But why?

205
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,063
Slow down, Na-eun.

206
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,359
This is exactly why I told you
not to talk about marriage first.

207
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,569
Girls like you
who always overthink things,

208
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,488
end up with crazy scenarios in their head

209
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,115
if the man starts acting odd.

210
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,909
Take a look at where you're standing.

211
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,286
I bet you've already dug your own grave.

212
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,874
-What do I do now?
-What do you mean what do you do now?

213
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,918
The marriage was already mentioned

214
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,629
and Jun-hyeong isn't
interested in it at all. That's it.

215
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,382
But it's not that simple.

216
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,426
Something feels really off.

217
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,805
Well, that's just how you feel.

218
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,975
Don't get yourself all worked up
and give yourself a hard time.

219
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,977
Just take it easy, Na-eun.

220
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,770
Anyway, hang up. I'm busy.

221
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,749
As soon as I saw Jun-hyeong

222
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,794
focused on his phone
despite my short absence,

223
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,881
I realized…

224
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,301
why I had felt so strange

225
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,012
when nothing had happened just now.

226
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,185
Excuse me, do you have any glue on you?

227
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,104
Glue?

228
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,609
I was hoping I could get you to "stick"
around so I could ask you something.

229
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,321
I have some tape though.

230
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,114
Sorry?

231
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,491
To tape your mouth shut
if you try to talk to me.

232
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,673
I brought my own glue this time
so that I can "stick" around.

233
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,384
I'd better go find myself some tape.

234
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,761
Some heavy-duty stuff.

235
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,221
Gosh, you're not making it easy, are you?

236
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,932
What?

237
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,101
I gathered my courage
to approach you like this.

238
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,312
I know how lame my jokes are.

239
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,232
Do you have any idea what it feels like
to keep using them just to talk to you?

240
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,109
So why do you keep on doing it then?

241
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,154
Because I'm interested in you.

242
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,918
This entire time…

243
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,630
I always thought that

244
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,091
I had the upper hand in this relationship,

245
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,010
thinking about how much he was dying

246
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,846
to be with me
when we first started dating.

247
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,640
I'll get going, then.

248
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,646
What is it?
Is there something you want to tell me?

249
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,858
Yes. Get home safely.

250
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,778
Is that it?

251
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,697
What?

252
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,116
Yes.

253
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,953
There's something we haven't covered yet.

254
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,039
What's that?

255
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,929
And that's why
whether it came to dating or marriage,

256
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,059
I was confident that things would
go exactly the way that I wanted.

257
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,313
However…

258
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,027
it became overwhelmingly clear today

259
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,739
that things have done a complete 180.

260
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,371
Hey, are you feeling better?

261
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,084
I'm sorry, but I think
we should call it a night.

262
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,505
-What?
-Sorry, my stomach isn't feeling good.

263
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,426
Well, I'm hungry because
I haven't had anything since lunch.

264
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,136
Could we at least finish this?

265
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,679
-Jun-hyeong--
-I'll be quick.

266
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,389
Just give me a second.

267
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,733
I'm sorry to bother you.

268
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,861
We're currently running an event
to celebrate our fifth anniversary,

269
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,406
handing out scratch tickets
to our guests as a part of the promotion.

270
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,450
You can choose one of the scratch cards.

271
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,410
Thank you, we'll be leaving soon.

272
00:17:59,036 --> 00:17:59,870
I'll pick them.

273
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,332
Right now?

274
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,834
You know that
I have the Midas touch, right?

275
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,587
I always get lucky
when it comes to raffles.

276
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,014
Do you want to scratch it off?

277
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,393
No. You do it.

278
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,815
Okay. Then I'm going to
put all my skills to the test.

279
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,865
FREE MEAL AND FREE YACHT RIDE

280
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,575
This is wild.

281
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,120
I think I might actually have a gift.

282
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,957
-Congratulations, sir.
-Congratulations!

283
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,972
Careful.

284
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,684
Hello.

285
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,527
Wait.

286
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,072
You can't come in here.
This is off-limits.

287
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,783
-But you can head upstairs to the deck.
-Sorry?

288
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,203
The thing is,
this place is a mess right now.

289
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,040
Plus you're supposed to make reservations
at least a month in advance,

290
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,667
but you didn't. So it's too messy.

291
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,502
It doesn't have to be tidied up.

292
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,338
Can I just stay inside for a moment?
I'm so cold right now.

293
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,256
Come on, damn it.

294
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,674
Oh gosh, I'm sorry.

295
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,927
Either way, you can't go in.
You really can't go in.

296
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,762
Just go upstairs.

297
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,765
How many times do I have to tell you
to just go up to the deck?

298
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,726
Just go up, please.

299
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,978
Let's just go up to the deck.

300
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,015
It's incredible up here!

301
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,185
Rather than the view, it's just too cold.

302
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,479
The night wind is no joke.

303
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,443
You're right. It is pretty cold.

304
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,865
I wouldn't do this
even if somebody forced me to.

305
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,700
What?

306
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,702
What do you mean?

307
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,791
Isn't it so nice up here?

308
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,835
I didn't know
a nice place like this existed in Seoul.

309
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,004
Right. Maybe
it's because we're on a yacht.

310
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,131
We have always wanted to hop on a yacht.

311
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,927
Sitting on top of a yacht
and feeling the wind is refreshing.

312
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,886
Look.

313
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,805
What am I supposed to say
in a situation like this?

314
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,140
Should I ask him
why he's avoiding marriage talks?

315
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,267
Or…

316
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,601
A place like this in Seoul?

317
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,895
…should I ask him
if he doesn't want to marry me?

318
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,438
-Should I?
-Where are we, though?

319
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,984
-Look.
-But what if he says he doesn't?

320
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,235
I love it.

321
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,197
-What would happen then?
-It's so nice being on a yacht together.

322
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,119
This isn't going to work.

323
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,498
I'm too cold, so I'm going to ask him
for a blanket or something.

324
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,208
Hey! I'll go ask him.

325
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,795
I'll ask the captain
and bring back a blanket for you.

326
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,963
No, I'll just go.

327
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,881
But why?

328
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,092
Because I'm just about ready
for a fight right now.

329
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,593
If he doesn't give one,

330
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,263
I'm ready to push him overboard
and sail this yacht.

331
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,268
Na-eun.

332
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,063
The captain said
we weren't allowed to go in there.

333
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,734
I'm just going to see if he's there
and ask for the blanket if he's in there.

334
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,194
Maybe you're a bit worked up right now.

335
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,488
It'd be better if you calm down for--

336
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,948
Please…

337
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,176
Is this why you told us
not to come in here?

338
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,137
-It's not like that--
-You could have told us.

339
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,639
That you were getting ready
for your next guests.

340
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,767
I thought

341
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,270
you were being rude to us
because we came for free.

342
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,150
NA-EUN, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

343
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:49,409
NA-EUN, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

344
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:58,919
You were…

345
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,219
trying to propose to me today?

346
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,933
I had no idea.

347
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,686
What do I do?

348
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,898
It's okay.

349
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,191
It's all right.

350
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,835
I'm such a dummy. Seriously.

351
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,588
-It's okay.
-It'll be a good memory.

352
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,966
Well, it's better than
everything going as planned.

353
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,427
You must have worked so hard
to plan all of this.

354
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,682
I got caught up with all these
weird thoughts and ruined everything.

355
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,768
I told you, it's fine.

356
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,688
This wasn't the kind
of surprise I was planning,

357
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,940
but you were surprised nonetheless.

358
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,901
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm fine.

360
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,239
Take a look over there.

361
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,992
A really handsome guy is about to pop out.

362
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,248
Hey, Na-eun. You must have been startled.

363
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,418
I wanted to say thank you for saying yes

364
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,212
when I asked you out
on that bright winter day back in 2019.

365
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,717
Every day since then has been happier
than anything I could have wished for.

366
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,469
Thank you so much for everything.

367
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,513
Cut! Gosh, this is the worst.

368
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,515
Why Na-eun, though?

369
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,725
What do you even mean?

370
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,894
Am I in love with someone else
other than her?

371
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,147
Can't you understand at once?

372
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,858
That's not what I'm asking you.

373
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,319
-Then?
-Come on, you've dated before.

374
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:51,865
Based on their looks and other factors,
a lot of them were better than Na-eun.

375
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,158
Jeez, so what do you want?

376
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,077
I mean, whenever any of them
mentioned marriage,

377
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,079
you felt pressured and dodged the topic.

378
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,041
But now, you think it's so obvious
to marry Na-eun.

379
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,711
-That's why I was just curious.
-I guess that's because

380
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,755
I love her?

381
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,091
Jeez, then you didn't love
all of your ex-girlfriends?

382
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,719
Are you some kind of dating robot or what?

383
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,347
Hello, I am Giga Jun-hyeong.

384
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,849
Will you marry me?

385
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,100
Seriously, damn.

386
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,645
Is it because you're
now ready for marriage

387
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,439
and it just so happens
that you're currently with Na-eun?

388
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:28,068
Or is it because she's good enough
and isn't lacking or has too much

389
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,487
that you're willing
to settle down with her?

390
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,783
Well, that's…

391
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,332
Why do I want to get married to her?

392
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,795
Is it's because I think she's good enough?

393
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,297
Or…

394
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,551
is it's because I'm ready to settle down
and she just happens to be with me?

395
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,471
No.

396
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,599
I'm doing it because it's Kim Na-eun.

397
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,853
Because she is the one
I love more than anyone else.

398
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,233
That's why I want to marry her.

399
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,990
I want to love her and cherish her
more than anyone else in my life.

400
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,700
I love you, Na-eun.

401
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,911
Let's get married.

402
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,851
Kim Na-eun.

403
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,229
Will you marry me?

404
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,057
Thank you.

405
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,647
Thank you more.

406
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,986
Are you happy, Na-eun?

407
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,118
Gosh, today was not an easy day for me.

408
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,621
You have no idea
how much energy I wasted today, either.

409
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,872
Seriously.

410
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,041
You hardly ever bring up marriage.

411
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,837
"Does she not want to get married to me?
Or does she not want to get married now?"

412
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,047
You put all these crazy questions
in my head.

413
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,049
Marriage!

414
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,930
But once I finished
preparing for the proposal

415
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,765
you started to bring up marriage.

416
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,727
I'm sorry, but I think
we should call it a night.

417
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,604
Well, I'm hungry because
I haven't had anything since lunch.

418
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,772
Could we at least finish this?

419
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,525
-Jun-hyeong--
-I'll be quick.

420
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,280
I had everything planned out,
even the little scratch tickets.

421
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,490
But you wanted to go home
because your stomach was upset.

422
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,079
WE'LL BE HEADING OVER THERE SHORTLY

423
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,373
You can't come in. You really can't.

424
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,293
How many times do I have to tell you
to just go up to the deck?

425
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,586
Let's just go up to the deck.

426
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,756
I scheduled it so we'd be there
20 minutes after leaving the dock,

427
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,258
but you kept insisting you'd go in there.

428
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,218
Jeez, man.

429
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:26,806
Rather than the view, it's just too cold.
The night wind is no joke.

430
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,771
Gosh, you're right. It is pretty cold.

431
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,732
I had the engagement ring hidden
in my coat,

432
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,735
but then you kept hinting you wanted me
to give you my coat.

433
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,744
And at that moment
we finally made it into the cabin…

434
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,207
Is this why you told us
not to come in here?

435
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,716
I don't think I'll ever forget tonight.

436
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,806
I don't think I'll ever forget it either.

437
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,893
Thanks, Jun-hyeong.

438
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,692
I love you.

439
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,124
Oh my gosh, congratulations!

440
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,836
You'll be filling in that empty spot
that I vacated.

441
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,173
Is that similar
to the law of conservation of idiots?

442
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,969
Of course. Slots need to open
for the next woman to get married.

443
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:50,723
You really have a way of turning tragedies
into comedies.

444
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,559
I guess that comes with being Korean.

445
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,145
Congratulations.
Are you planning to get married this fall?

446
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,315
Probably?
Wait. Do you want to catch the bouquet?

447
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,443
She doesn't even have a boyfriend.
Why toss your bouquet to her?

448
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,071
She might be planning on
setting me up on a blind date.

449
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,114
Me?

450
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,867
-Okay, I'll ask Jun-hyeong about it.
-Great!

451
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,120
So I'll be the one
who catches your bouquet then.

452
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,498
If you're going on a blind date now,
to catch the bouquet--

453
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,042
Don't you worry a thing about any of that.

454
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,503
I fall in love at the blink of an eye.
Don't worry about that.

455
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,506
I'm worried that you might
end up embarrassing me.

456
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,552
I'll be expecting a lot of coaching
from you too.

457
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,847
What's the point of that?
You both don't listen to me at all.

458
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,266
How much of a happy ending
would it have been

459
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,226
if you didn't bring up anything
about getting married?

460
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,478
It's still a happy ending.

461
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,940
Honestly, having those twists makes it
feels more like a fairy tale.

462
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,860
It's been a bit rocky,
but now I'll be sailing smooth.

463
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,194
Like Cinderella.

464
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,530
Who told you that things will go smoothly?

465
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,782
This is as happy as it gets.

466
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,951
Just wait until you start
getting things ready.

467
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,870
Happiness ends, and the hardships begin.

468
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,457
Are you throwing shade at me
or trying to curse me?

469
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,877
-I have to know, so I can repay the favor.
-I'm only giving you the facts.

470
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,421
You have no idea what kind of a hard road…

471
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,715
No, it's a path of suffering, actually.

472
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,176
That's okay.

473
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,137
No matter what might lay ahead of me,

474
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,473
I'll be happy as long as
I'm with my Jun-hyeong.

475
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,860
Can I try it on just once?

476
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,374
Reveal yourself!
Who dares to touch the remote control?

477
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,086
The game hasn't started yet.

478
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,423
The game has started.

479
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,717
Baseball starts
the moment the first pitch is thrown.

480
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,260
What has gotten into you, sir?

481
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,554
But it's just some celebrities
throwing the ball.

482
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,515
No, not at all.

483
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,934
It's more like the eve of the festival.

484
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,144
And it's like the proposal
before the marriage.

485
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,729
It's like a marching parade before battle

486
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,565
and a ritual during which
we pray for victory.

487
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,735
So imagine how lame the game will be
if we missed out on that.

488
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,695
Exactly.

489
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,530
Okay.

490
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,793
Kim Hae-ri, the cheerleader,
will throw the ball to start the game.

491
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,555
The first pitch is over.
It's time for the main game to start.

492
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,682
Friend, let's keep our guard up.

493
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,434
The festivities are over,

494
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,311
and war is upon us.

495
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,668
-What's the first step to getting married?
-The meeting of the parents?

496
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,295
That's the first thing
you should do before getting married.

497
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,797
Just think of it as
preparing for some kind of a summit.

498
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,508
So please avoid talking about
any wedding gifts and smile.

499
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,761
What, did a stork drop you off?
Did I pick you up under a bridge?

500
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,597
How could you have still not
discussed these things with him?

501
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,932
-Time bombs?
-My mom overreacts to everything

502
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,100
and my dad jokes around too much.

503
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,186
And he sure isn't going to
make it any easier.

504
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,146
You're no joke either, Mother.

505
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,773
I was absolutely stunned
when I first met you.

506
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,942
If you have that much sense in you,
then you better watch it today.

507
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,361
It's as if I'm in a minefield right now.

508
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:38,409
