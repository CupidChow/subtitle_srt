KBD LEAGUE HIGHLIGHTS

2
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,260
I think the pitch went a little wild.
The batter gets to walk to first base.

3
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,386
It seems that way.

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,475
Something like this

5
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,144
will never happen again.

6
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,063
Ever!

EPISODE 6
BEANBALL

8
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,626
The store is that way.

9
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,522
Was it crypto or the lottery?

10
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,773
What do you mean?

11
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,483
You can tell me.

12
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,654
Can you give us a moment?

13
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,451
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

14
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,994
Well, if not both,

15
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,331
then is our family
just much richer than I thought?

16
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,376
Like way wealthier than we make it seem?

17
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,087
What are you trying to say?

18
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,050
You're going to put
all of this in the gift box?

19
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,972
Gosh, you used to act like you'd give her
every last penny if she asked,

20
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,765
so why are you trying to stop me now?

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,687
Not too long ago, you were upset
about the wedding hall,

22
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,815
and you said you'd show Na-eun
what our family is made of.

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,485
That's it, isn't it?

24
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,657
You're going overboard on the gifts
just to flaunt our family's status.

25
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,034
How could you say that?

26
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,661
What do you take your mother for?

27
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,373
-You definitely said that our family--
-If you say one more word,

28
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,292
I'll return everything.

29
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,173
Seriously.

30
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,060
Your daughter-in-law is so lucky.

31
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,024
My mom is trying to take this
as an opportunity

32
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,901
to flaunt our family's status.

33
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,235
Can you stop?

34
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,822
I know it's too much,

35
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,534
but I want to do this
because she's our newest family member.

36
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:26,247
I've always wanted to do this
for my future daughter-in-law.

37
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,541
If you don't treat the bride well
during the wedding,

38
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,084
it upsets them for the rest of their life.

39
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,211
So I did go a little overboard.

40
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,047
You have no idea how I feel

41
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,966
and you're trying to make me out
as an evil mother-in-law.

42
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,386
Who said you were an evil mother-in-law?

43
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,972
Who was it? I'll teach them a lesson.

44
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,807
Goodness!

45
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,267
You're so sly.

46
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,728
Your son is so funny.

47
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,064
Gosh, he's just immature.

48
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,526
Please wrap everything up in pink.

49
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,905
Yes, ma'am.
I'll wrap everything in this tone here.

50
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,617
-Mom, hold on.
-Okay.

51
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,410
Hey, Na-eun.

52
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:09,123
I'm going to give the alcohol
and scarf to my son's in-laws,

53
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,125
so please take extra care
when you wrap them.

54
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,502
Make sure the pouches

55
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,462
for the Five Blessings
are facing the right way,

56
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:18,716
and have the ducks
and the marriage letter packed at the top.

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,884
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,763
Hold on.

59
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,188
Well…

60
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,774
Please include the price tag too.

61
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,068
If they don't like it,
they'll have to return it.

62
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,319
Yes, ma'am.

63
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,083
-Soo-chan.
-Yes?

64
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,626
-It must be the rice cake.
-Okay.

65
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,503
I'm coming!

66
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,093
Goodness, thank you.

67
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,595
What should I do with it?

68
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,098
-Let's put it here so it doesn't harden.
-Okay.

69
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,942
Hey, just sit down.

70
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,277
Right, Na-eun.

71
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,281
You got told off to stay put
and stop wandering about.

72
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,159
They really don't need to go this far.

73
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,371
It's their daughter's wedding,
how can they?

74
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,542
Both families agreed to prepare
simple gifts so this is unnecessary.

75
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,878
But why is the bride
receiving the gift first?

76
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,880
Usually, the bride sends the gift first

77
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,175
and the groom's family gives you back
half its value through their gift.

78
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,260
I did see that on the Internet,

79
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,555
but Jun-hyeong's mom included
a marriage letter as per tradition

80
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,348
and insisted that she send one first.

81
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,351
Someone who follows these traditions

82
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,063
wouldn't be the type of person
to prepare "simple gifts."

83
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,107
No, Jun-hyeong's mom
is a very simple person.

84
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,860
Simple is what we agreed on,
so it will be simple.

85
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,862
When our families met,

86
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,490
Jun-hyeong said we would do
all the wedding preparations

87
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,827
and his mom said she'd trust us with it
and not interfere at all.

88
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,789
She's not like
other mothers-in-law, right?

89
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,040
-Yes.
-Yes.

90
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,542
Well, that's because
it's still before the wedding.

91
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,213
Do things change after the wedding?

92
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,506
They do.

93
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,133
If the circumstances change,
so does the attitude.

94
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,176
How so?

95
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,847
Su-yeon, the moment that
she becomes your mother-in-law,

96
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,975
you'll have to focus
as if you're in a literature class.

97
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,102
Why?

98
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,062
Literature class?

99
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,272
What did you do in literature class?

100
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,274
You studied poems, right?

101
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,527
You need to understand
the poet's intentions

102
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,946
and analyze what's between the lines.

103
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,449
Your mother-in-law's words
will be just like a poem.

104
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,244
You'll have to understand
the intention behind what she says

105
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,913
and know how to analyze
what's hidden between the lines

106
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,165
in order to live a peaceful life.

107
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,794
If she says, "I'm fine, Honey,"

108
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,089
you have to see if she really is fine,
or if she's just saying that

109
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,843
and actually means, "It's not fine at all,
so please come help me."

110
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,803
You have to know what she actually means.

111
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,723
Everything that in-laws say
has some sort of hidden meaning,

112
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,726
and everything they do has a reason.

113
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,939
You must know their intent
and read between the lines.

114
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,485
That way, your family is at peace
and you will feel comfortable too.

115
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,612
Just hearing that makes me tired.

116
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,949
That's not true.
It's not like that nowadays.

117
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,368
Jun-hyeong's mom is a really nice person.

118
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,620
Hui-seon, cut it out.
Especially in front of Su-yeon.

119
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,206
Hearing negative things
like this every day

120
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,125
will make her not want to get married.

121
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,671
Right. I failed at marriage,
so feel free to ignore my opinion

122
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,049
and think of Na-eun's wedding story
as an answer sheet.

123
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,801
I've been doing that from the start.

124
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,478
Jun-hyeong is almost here.

125
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,050
I'm coming!

126
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,096
Come on in.

127
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,849
-Goodness, welcome.
-Hello!

128
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,107
All right. Goodness,
you must've worked hard.

129
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,984
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

130
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,654
Goodness…

131
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,868
Na-eun, Hurry and open it up.

132
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,870
I'm so curious about what's inside.

133
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,802
This…

134
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,930
This isn't just a "simple" suitcase brand.

135
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,224
What? Why? Is it expensive?

136
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,144
No, it's not, Father.

137
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,980
Hui-seon is just joking.

138
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,191
I'll go ahead and open it.

139
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:51,632
Didn't we decide to have simple
wedding gifts and dowry at the meeting?

140
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,509
Yes, she did say that,

141
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,013
but I guess my mom wanted to
buy her new daughter-in-law many things.

142
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,181
This is what we ended up with
while we were shopping.

143
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,727
So your mom prepared all of this herself?

144
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,896
Your mom must have had a hard time.

145
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,483
-Here you are, Father.
-Okay.

146
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,819
And…

147
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,196
this is for you, Mother.

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,323
For me?

149
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,407
Yes.

150
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,575
Oh, my goodness.

151
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,333
Goodness.

152
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,419
Gosh, how pretty.

153
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,839
That's sophisticated, right?

154
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:32,798
Here.

155
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,342
What do you think?

156
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,761
-You look beautiful.
-Really?

157
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,887
Yes.

158
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,263
My goodness.

159
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,808
And this is
another present for you, Father.

160
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,602
What? Another?

161
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,895
Gosh, this…

162
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,652
What? Is it something good?

163
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,572
This liquor is so good

164
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,742
that I'll spend my whole life
worrying about when I should drink it.

165
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,454
It's so good that I want to beg him
to call me over when he opens it.

166
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,665
No, I'll be enjoying this all on my own.

167
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,458
-Please?
-Oh, my.

168
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,919
Who are you to make a fuss about that?

169
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,420
Louis is thirteen years old.

170
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,923
Gosh.

171
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:18,135
Did your mom consider
my parents' tastes when she got these?

172
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,306
That's not easy to do.

173
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,392
She's amazing.

174
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,578
That was so amazing.
Gosh. I'm so jealous of Na-eun.

175
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,416
You're so naive.

176
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,168
Why are you jealous? They owe them
just as much in return.

177
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,005
Marriage is a trade
where you have to get back

178
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,507
exactly what you give.

179
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,094
In marriage, you'll need to provide labor
if you don't have money.

180
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,762
I see.

181
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,557
So, if the in-laws buy the couple a house,

182
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,936
the daughter-in-law will feel pressured
to participate in their ancestral rites,

183
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,897
or make kimchi for them every year?

184
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,023
That's right.

185
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,234
A marriage gift like that means

186
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,737
you have to give the in-laws a gift
that's worth just as much as they spent.

187
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,406
You never know,

188
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,742
but it'll probably be a headache
when it's their turn to send gifts.

189
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,827
But still.

190
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,455
How many mothers-in-law would do so much

191
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,249
just to take care
of their daughter-in-law?

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,295
Honestly, Na-eun's boyfriend
is a one-in-a-million.

193
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,840
Even her in-laws are perfect.
Na-eun is so blessed.

194
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,468
Then you can meet someone like that too.

195
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,719
I'd like to.

196
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,472
But men like that don't like me.

197
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:49,059
Well, forget about having one.
Where do you find them in the first place?

198
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,228
There's nobody like that around me.

199
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,148
You need to go out
and make opportunities to find them.

200
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:58,527
Why are you here spending your precious
weekend off with your coworkers?

201
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,780
If you want to meet someone,
go to a place where guys hang out.

202
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,867
Even if you do that,
some people just can't find one.

203
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,951
Gosh.

204
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,036
What?

205
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,542
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

206
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,920
Gosh, hey, it's cold.
Shall we take a taxi?

207
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,254
-Sure.
-Hey, taxi!

208
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,006
It's coming.

209
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,049
Here!

210
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,930
Hey, hurry up and get home.

211
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,266
My house is on the way to yours,
so you can just let me off there.

212
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,061
No. I have to go
in the opposite direction.

213
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,563
Go. Take her to Oksu-dong, sir.

214
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,982
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay, bye. Be safe.

215
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,025
Bye.

216
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,575
What's with her all of a sudden?

217
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,710
Unbelievable.

218
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,927
You did a great job.

219
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,220
It was nothing.

220
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,853
I think Hui-seon has a boyfriend.

221
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,357
Someone came and picked her up in a car.

222
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,776
What is it? What is it about?

223
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,071
She's saying she thinks
Hui-seon has a boyfriend.

224
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,739
I don't know what she means.

225
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,201
Hui-seon only dates men
who are on Jung Woo-sung's level.

226
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,953
Gosh, she's got high standards.

227
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,040
Her first husband was both ugly and mean,

228
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,459
so now she wants someone better.

229
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,005
She's amazing, right?

230
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,215
In a way, helping me get married

231
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,593
and listening to my complaints
probably isn't easy.

232
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,597
I'm thankful that she always
takes me seriously and gives me advice.

233
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,683
Min-woo said the same thing.

234
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,227
Did Min-woo catch that?

235
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,438
He's for thoughtful than he looks.

236
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,399
As if. It was probably just a guess.

237
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,569
Did you like the box?

238
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,906
Putting the price aside,

239
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,117
I'm grateful that she picked out
each item with our family in mind.

240
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,830
Honestly, it's not easy to pick out gifts
for others like that.

241
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,415
That's right.

242
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,126
Let's make sure
we treat your parents well.

243
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,673
Thank you, Jun-hyeong.

244
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,511
Gosh, enough of that will you?

245
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,477
What are you doing?

246
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,771
Your mom's been so excited since earlier.

247
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,190
Am I the only one?

248
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,692
Everyone from the other shops
wants to have a look.

249
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,027
The group chat is on fire.

250
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,904
They're saying the gifts are wonderful

251
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,490
and are congratulating you
on finding such a great husband.

252
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,950
Right, isn't it great?

253
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:51,992
Of course!

254
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,994
Jun-hyeong's mom is the best.

255
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,664
Of course, not everyone can do that.

256
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,874
Not even I could do that.

257
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,127
Hey, Na-eun. Try on that fur.

258
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,547
They're saying
they want to see you try it on.

259
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,008
Gosh, she's just so excited.

260
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,260
Of course, I'm excited!

261
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,138
My daughter is getting married
and is being treated so well.

262
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:18,185
Right. There's no other daughter-in-law
who gets treated like this.

263
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,857
Shall we have a look?

264
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,567
That hurt.

265
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,363
Why? Is something there?

266
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,448
What's this?

267
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,004
PRICE: 20,000,000 WON

268
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,088
What?

269
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,094
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

270
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,929
Goodness.

271
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,391
She didn't take off the price tag.

272
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:01,145
Well, she probably forgot to take it off.
She prepared so many of them.

273
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,813
Of course.

274
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,402
What are you doing?

275
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,030
This doesn't seem right.

276
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,532
I don't think this was a mistake.

277
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,118
Jun-hyeong's mom said so
during the meeting.

278
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,037
"Sapphire, mink,

279
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,957
diamond bracelet, a 24-karat cutlery set,
and a mother of pearl wardrobe."

280
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,417
She didn't stop there.

281
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,377
And went on to say she doesn't need them.

282
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,588
"Let's keep the wedding gifts
and the dowry simple."

283
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,881
Do you not remember that?

284
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,382
How is this simple?

285
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,635
Hui-seon said earlier
that all of the items here are expensive.

286
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,138
Forget it.

287
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:41,101
All we need to know is how much she cares
about her daughter-in-law.

288
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,812
We don't need to nitpick
about how expensive these are.

289
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,939
My goodness.

290
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,526
She left the price tag on
in case we thought that way.

291
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,111
You're so clueless.

292
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,866
No, Mom.

293
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,243
She's not the type to do that.
It must be a mistake.

294
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,746
This sort of thing is not a mistake.

295
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,831
I know her, she wouldn't do that.

296
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,875
What about this?

297
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,959
Look.

298
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,508
Hey, Mom.

299
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,176
Did you deliver the gifts?

300
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,677
Of course.

301
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,597
Everyone liked it so much
that it made me feel proud.

302
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,141
I'm glad to hear that.

303
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,143
Seeing how everyone liked it,

304
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,688
it makes me regret what I said

305
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,150
when we were shopping for the gifts.

306
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,111
I didn't know you cared for her so much.

307
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,071
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,448
If you understand now, it's fine.

309
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,743
Na-eun said she wanted to meet you
and thank you personally.

310
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,995
She asked me to find out when you're free.

311
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,163
Sure.

312
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,251
I'm fine anytime. Tell her to come
whenever it's convenient for her.

313
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,670
All right, I'll check with her
and let you know.

314
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,631
Hey, just one more thing.

315
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,219
Did Na-eun's family say anything else?

316
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,971
No, why?

317
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,098
No, it's fine.

318
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,724
Well, drive safely.

319
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,893
Yes, text me when you get there.

320
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,229
Bye.

321
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,256
JUN-HYEONG

322
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,442
Oh my gosh.

323
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,238
You scared me. Why are you standing
in front of the door like that?

324
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,449
Go inside.

325
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,951
Sit down.

326
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,081
Gosh.

327
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,797
Use this for the wedding gifts.

328
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,342
Mom…

329
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,386
I saved this money
for your wedding anyway.

330
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,555
Don't worry, just use it for the gifts.

331
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,066
ACCOUNT HOLDER: LEE DA-RYUNG
BALANCE 50,000,000 WON

332
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,193
All of this?

333
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,073
If a woman can't provide wedding gifts
and the house appliances,

334
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,991
they'll hear about it all their lives.

335
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,118
It's very upsetting.

336
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,957
So go and get them wedding gifts
that will make their jaw drop.

337
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,000
Mom…

338
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,253
I couldn't sleep
because I felt so offended.

339
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,255
Brides usually send their gifts first.

340
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,339
I was suspicious

341
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,509
the moment she brought up tradition
and said she'd send them first.

342
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,135
They sent their gift first

343
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,097
as if to say, "Try and match this."

344
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,266
Come on, Mom.

345
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,353
Taking off the price tag
might have been the company's mistake.

346
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,855
There must be some misunderstanding.

347
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,607
What misunderstanding?

348
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,900
Calm down.

349
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,028
If she really intended that,
she wouldn't have left only one tag on.

350
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,530
She would have left them all.

351
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,411
When I see her later,
I'll try to find out what's going on,

352
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,496
so don't dwell on it too much, okay?

353
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,217
It's probably a mistake, right?

354
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,430
It could be a mistake.

355
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,391
But what bothers me is the item.

356
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,767
The item?

357
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,270
Which item was this tag on?

358
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,231
-A mink coat.
-When it comes to mink,

359
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,150
their prices are very private.

360
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,780
Even within the same brand,
there are so many different kinds.

361
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,825
The price varies depending
on the place of origin and design.

362
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:11,371
So you're saying she left the tag
on purpose to show us the price?

363
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,957
Well, if you look on the bright side,

364
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,210
she made it easier for you
to match how much she spent.

365
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,591
Does she want a dowry
on the same level like my mom said?

366
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,388
You can find the prices
for the other items online.

367
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,766
So you'll get the baseline
of how much to spend

368
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,726
if you add the mink to the total.

369
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,687
-The baseline?
-That's just how it's done.

370
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,983
Jun-hyeong's mom really isn't the type
to do that though.

371
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,194
It's the biggest conundrum of mankind.

372
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,988
No one knows if your mother-in-law
has always been like that

373
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,783
or if she's like that because
she became your mother-in-law.

374
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,619
No one knows,
especially not the daughter-in-law.

375
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,458
Marriage is really hard.

376
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,962
Marriage is hard
and in-laws are even harder.

377
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,924
That's why I gave up so quickly.

378
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,134
Oh, right.

379
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,845
Whose car did you get into
on the day I received the gifts?

380
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,557
-What?
-Su-yeon told me.

381
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,726
She said she saw you
getting in some guy's car.

382
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,522
Right. That was my brother.

383
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,774
You're an only child.

384
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,360
He's my cousin.

385
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,114
Yes, my cousin lives close to your house.

386
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,201
It's so obvious you're lying
that I can't let it slide.

387
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,203
Who was it?

388
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,331
You said you wouldn't accept
any less than Jung Woo-sung.

389
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,876
Wait, don't tell me…

390
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,798
Are you dating Jung Woo-sung?

391
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,177
What nonsense…

392
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,138
Hey, Jun-hyeong.

393
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,473
Yes, I'll be right out. Okay.

394
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,976
I'll talk to you later, all right?

395
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,228
Gosh, how chaotic.

396
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,857
-Hey!
-Right!

397
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,568
MOTHER, FATHER
PLEASE ADORE ME

398
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,071
Goodness…

399
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,408
You didn't need to do this.
Why would you bring these?

400
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,910
Well, you told me you like fruit.

401
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,912
Thank you, I'll enjoy them.

402
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,039
I'm more thankful to both of you.

403
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,750
Thank you for the marriage box.

404
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,127
Did you like it?

405
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,170
Yes.

406
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,673
There were so many nice things.
I thought that I was dreaming.

407
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,924
I really loved them.

408
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,094
Thank you so much.

409
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,304
Of course.

410
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,140
You going over budget paid off, Honey.

411
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:39,769
Why would you say that?
You'll make Na-eun feel pressured.

412
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,021
Na-eun…

413
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,441
I didn't go over budget.
I wanted to give you even more.

414
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,235
But Jun-hyeong stopped me,
so that's all I could do for you.

415
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,362
I'll do more for you later.

416
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,239
No, Mother.

417
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,533
You've already given me more than enough.

418
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:58,038
Right. Na-eun wouldn't be able to
sleep at night if you bought more things.

419
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,666
And from now on, if Na-eun needs anything,
I can do it for her.

420
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,918
Goodness.

421
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,669
Why don't you do that for me too?

422
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,546
Is there anything you need?

423
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,340
Well…

424
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,758
A painting?

425
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,055
I'd like to buy one
and hang it over there on that wall.

426
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,141
That does seem like
a perfect spot to hang a painting.

427
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,478
You could do that. You should buy one.

428
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,148
But if I buy it myself, I'll just keep
going back and forth on which one to get.

429
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,025
It's not easy to decide.

430
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,070
It would be nice to receive it as a gift.

431
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,988
Dad can buy it.

432
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,407
Gosh.

433
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,078
It'd be nice to get one as a gift.

434
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,916
Everything that in-laws say
has some sort of hidden meaning

435
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,044
and everything they do has a reason.

436
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,172
You must know their intent
and read between the lines.

437
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,885
That way, your family is at peace
and you will feel comfortable too.

438
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,305
Does that mean
she wants me to get her a painting?

439
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,975
Na-eun, do you like paintings?

440
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,271
I don't know much about art,
but I think it'd be good to know.

441
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,730
I'd like to learn someday.

442
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,607
That's right.

443
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,193
I'm going to peel some fruit.

444
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,528
Talk among yourselves.

445
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,113
I'll go help you, Mother.

446
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,198
Gosh, no. Have a seat.

447
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,534
Okay.

448
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,501
If she says, "I'm fine, Honey,"

449
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:31,006
you have to see if she really is fine,
or if she's just saying that,

450
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,676
and actually means, "It's not fine at all,
so please come help me."

451
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,847
I'll go help her with the fruit.

452
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,767
Tell your dad about how much
we've prepared for our wedding.

453
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,602
Okay.

454
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,573
I summed up everything you received
and it's around 80 million won.

455
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,413
What can I do to help?

456
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,707
Gosh. What are you doing? Go sit down.

457
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,127
I don't want you to be all alone in here.

458
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,547
Then sit there and chat with me.

459
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,631
Okay.

460
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,396
You mentioned paintings earlier,

461
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,565
so which artist is your favorite?

462
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,859
Well, I like everything.

463
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,861
I like Monet these days.

464
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,655
-Monet?
-What?

465
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,532
Don't you like him?

466
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,493
No, Monet is great.

467
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,122
Then who do you like
among living painters?

468
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,125
-What?
-Well…

469
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:53,755
Actually, the thing is,
you gave me so many nice things

470
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,342
and I'd like to give you
something special.

471
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,802
If you tell me the painter you like--

472
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,055
Gosh, if that's the case,
I can't tell you.

473
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,890
I shouldn't have brought up paintings.

474
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,893
No, it's fine. Feel free to tell me.

475
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,144
Never mind.

476
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,440
I gave you those things
because you are so sweet.

477
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,235
So just accept them thankfully, okay?

478
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,154
All right.

479
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,911
Then what should we get you
for the wedding gifts?

480
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,579
Wedding gifts?

481
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,959
My mom is really concerned
about what to give you

482
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,296
and I'd also like to repay you
for your kindness.

483
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,342
I thought it would be helpful
to know your tastes and preferences.

484
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,929
Have you been worrying
about the wedding gifts?

485
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,765
Yes, please give me a hint.

486
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,934
Then…

487
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,354
I'll tell you the answer,
so go back into the living room.

488
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,231
The answer?

489
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,860
Yes, there's a bag on top of the TV.

490
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,194
Open that.

491
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,405
No way.

492
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,908
Is it a wish list?
I've only ever heard of that.

493
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,202
So then, she left the tag on to…

494
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,205
It can't be…

495
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,544
WE WANT YOU TO BE HAPPIER

496
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,135
Don't just wander around.
Go home and sleep.

497
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,763
You'll scare the customers off.

498
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,598
But I can't sleep!

499
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,975
I'm so frustrated right now.

500
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,686
Gosh, you're always frustrated.

501
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,524
I told you after the meeting

502
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,526
that Jun-hyeong's mom is no pushover.

503
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,449
She'd be upset if she knew you said that.

504
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,743
-What?
-I mean, she's being so nice,

505
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,329
but you're analyzing
and nitpicking everything.

506
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,330
Nitpicking?

507
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,166
So I'm nitpicking for no reason?

508
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,504
Gosh, we should be happy
that this happened.

509
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,466
To be blunt, if she sent it to us with
the tag to show us how much she spent,

510
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,969
we can just send the same amount back.

511
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,557
Anyway, she sent these nice things
with Na-eun in mind,

512
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,144
so let's keep Jun-hyeong in mind
and buy nice things for them.

513
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,941
Look at you being so carefree.

514
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,402
I'm worried that her mother-in-law
will give her a hard time.

515
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,405
Gosh, it's the 21st century,
she won't do that.

516
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,076
Goodness, it's not like the old days
when the mother-in-law

517
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,994
would make her do hard labor.

518
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,957
These days, it's more like
having them lie on a bed of thorns.

519
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,000
If you know one thing, you know it all.

520
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,586
Jun-hyeong's mom
is not to be underestimated.

521
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,314
Na-eun.

522
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,652
You really thought it was going to be
a wish list, didn't you?

523
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,695
Goodness.

524
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,867
I wanted to send you to a skin care clinic
to make sure you took care of yourself,

525
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,827
but I forgot to include it with the gift,

526
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,162
so I put it here
to make sure I gave it to you.

527
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,373
I see.

528
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,167
You looked so cute being nervous
about the wedding gifts,

529
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,502
so I pulled a little prank.

530
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,796
I see I almost gave you a heart attack.

531
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,510
Well…

532
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:33,182
Na-eun, did you happen to see
the price tag in the box?

533
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,060
The price tag?

534
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,690
I wasn't going to mention it,

535
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,901
but it really bothered me.

536
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,486
I thought it'd be better
to talk to you about it.

537
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,572
Please, speak freely.

538
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:51,326
People either love or hate mink.

539
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,786
You might be against animal fur

540
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,164
or I could have gotten you the wrong size.

541
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,669
I thought it'd be better if you could
return it if you didn't like it

542
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,922
rather than just keeping it at home.

543
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,176
So I told them to leave the tag on.

544
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,305
Hey, well, did…

545
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,391
Did Na-eun's family say anything else?

546
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,185
No, why?

547
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,312
No, it's fine.

548
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,022
Well, drive safely.

549
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,066
Yes, text me when you get there.

550
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,610
Bye.

551
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,990
Why did I act so childishly?

552
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,787
What do I get from trying to show off
to Na-eun's mother?

553
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,872
How can I act like that at this age?

554
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,377
How am I going to face Na-eun now?

555
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,175
I had only asked for the brand tag
to be included,

556
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,844
but when I checked with the company later,

557
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,348
they also included the price tag.

558
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,642
I was so startled to hear that.

559
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,814
I was so worried
that I couldn't sleep at night.

560
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,026
So it was the company's fault.

561
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,655
It must have really bothered her.

562
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:14,283
I'm so sorry that I've been
such a petty mother-in-law.

563
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,161
It's fine, Mother.

564
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,330
I thought it was the company's fault.

565
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,166
I'm so glad you thought so.

566
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,253
Well, were your parents

567
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,173
weren't upset, were they?

568
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,967
Not at all!

569
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,262
My mom and dad both thought
there must have been a mistake.

570
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,514
I'm so relieved.

571
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:40,101
Gosh, that made me so worried.

572
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,311
I'll always think twice before I act

573
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,148
so that it doesn't happen again,

574
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,233
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,694
It's okay, Mother.

576
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,322
You said you were worried
about the gifts, right?

577
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,407
Yes.

578
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,827
Don't think about it too much.

579
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,621
Just get Jun-hyeong a nice watch
or something.

580
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:06,961
When I hang out with my friends,
they say their sons received watches.

581
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,047
A watch for Jun-hyeong.

582
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,593
And, a little gift for his father
so his feelings don't get hurt?

583
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,095
Yes, I'll take care of him too.

584
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,474
And if your mother is worried

585
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:24,562
that the gifts she prepared might not
suffice for her daughter's wedding,

586
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:28,649
she can just simply
get us the necessities.

587
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:35,281
Goodness. Don't feel pressured
and just do what feels right.

588
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,407
All right?

589
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,660
Let's go have some fruit.

590
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,085
What are you two talking about?

591
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,294
About golf.

592
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,378
Gosh, you two…

593
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:00,515
Gosh, Na-eun brought us delicious fruit.

594
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,225
It's so sweet.

595
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,392
This is my favorite.

596
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,440
Don't feel pressured,
just do what feels right.

597
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,030
I summed up everything you received
and it's around 80 million won.

598
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,923
You don't even have time
to prepare for your wedding,

599
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,175
so why are you lining up to buy a watch?

600
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,594
Your mom said I should
get the necessities for the gift,

601
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,179
so I need to do everything I can.

602
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,391
But I was going to buy it for you
as a wedding gift.

603
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,393
Isn't it amazing
that I managed to get this?

604
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,479
It meant a lot to me and I had a plan.

605
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,692
Something seems to be bothering Na-eun,
but I don't know what it is.

606
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,861
No, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight.

607
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,404
What are you sorry about?

608
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:05,204
