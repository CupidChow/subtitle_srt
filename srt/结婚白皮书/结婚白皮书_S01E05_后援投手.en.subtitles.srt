00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,663
CHAMGOOD REAL ESTATE

2
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,507
Goodnessâ€¦

3
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,898
Why are you looking at me like that?

4
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,649
You have a crush on me now?

5
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,652
Don't say such terrible things.

6
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,906
Why did Jun-hyeong come here
all of a sudden?

7
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,493
How many times do I have to tell you?
He came here for advice about the wedding.

8
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,914
What do you know about wedding halls
that he would come to consult you?

9
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,665
It doesn't make sense.

10
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,419
Considering he came this far,
there must have been another reason.

11
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,921
Gosh, seriously.

12
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,507
I don't even need to look
at your past life to know.

13
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,550
My previous life?

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,512
You're accusing and making me
confess to things I haven't done.

15
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,764
You're like a Japanese police officer
from the colonial era.

16
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,476
Did he really come here to ask
about the wedding hall?

17
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,687
Jun-hyeong didn't just come here.
Na-eun brought him.

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,565
They want us to help them
choose a wedding hall.

19
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,485
So I took the mound as a relief pitcher

20
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,487
to help out Na-eun.

21
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,114
So then,

22
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:58,076
what was the idea Jun-hyeong had
that would satisfy everyone?

23
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,788
Why would you ask me that?
I don't know either.

24
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,457
I'll have you as my "relief pitcher," too.

25
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,917
Tell me, what is it?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,710
Relief pitchers aren't like Siri.

27
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,462
They don't answer anything you ask.

28
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,756
You don't even know
what a relief pitcher is.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,800
Why wouldn't I know what that is?

30
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,927
They come forward to help
when they're needed.

31
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,053
Whatever, gosh!

32
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,054
Where are you going?

33
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,473
Tell me what you know before you leave!

34
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,725
What is it?

35
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,272
Come on. Seriously.

36
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,042
EPISODE 5
RELIEF PITCHER

37
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,799
What I felt the most
when I started preparing for the wedding

38
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,262
was that marriage and love
are definitely different.

39
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,849
Na-eun.

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,101
Will you marry me?

41
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,481
At first, I thought marriage
was an extension of a relationship,

42
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:15,069
but as soon as we started getting ready
for the wedding, I realized this.

43
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,613
If dating is focused

44
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,116
-on the happiness of the present,
-Congratulations, Na-eun!

45
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:26,372
then marriage requires us to focus
on the happiness of the future.

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,254
If you know what you need for marriage,
it's time to apply it in real life.

47
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,966
The party is over,

48
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,136
and now the battle begins.

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,266
With the strikeout,
they've turned the game around!

50
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,104
The ball is thrown
from second base to home.

51
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,191
The catcher missed the ball!
The runner is safe! Two hits in a row!

52
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,361
Are you going to war or something?

53
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,491
Life is a battlefield without gunfire.

54
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,786
Are you still drunk?
Do you want me to make you some soup?

55
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,873
It's time to get serious
about the wedding preparations.

56
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,709
Well, this is how I get in the zone.

57
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,045
So you haven't been serious
this whole time?

58
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,339
What have you been doing?

59
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,799
We're pretty much done.

60
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:22,512
I mean, we've decided on the studio,
dress, and makeup place.

61
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,265
So I'm checking out
some wedding halls with Jun-hyeong.

62
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,183
-Wedding halls?
-Yes.

63
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,352
We're going to look around the hotel
that he had in mind

64
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,730
and the convention hall
for the employees in my company.

65
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,110
-We have about 300 guests, right?
-Yes

66
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,530
How many guests are there
on Jun-hyeong's side?

67
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,240
There must be a lot, right?

68
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,661
Well, his father is an executive
at a conglomerate, so there must be.

69
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,413
A lot of wreaths will be sent too.

70
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,374
I wonder if our families
can even be compared.

71
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,501
If only you hadn't quit that company!

72
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,087
Jeez, your mother's at it again.

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,256
-Gosh.
-I'm not wrong.

74
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,217
If you stand in front of the venue,
you'll see the difference.

75
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,178
If that's the case,
we should just have a small wedding.

76
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,555
Just with the family.

77
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,265
I like small weddings too.

78
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,434
Why don't we go on a family trip
to Jeju Island

79
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,102
and have a small wedding instead?

80
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,397
Mom, that hurts!

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,399
That's the point! Why else would I do it?

82
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,776
We put so much money
into other people's weddings.

83
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,403
But a small wedding, seriously?

84
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,156
Don't bring that up again, both of you.

85
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,825
Dad was the one who brought it up first.

86
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,411
Right, when it comes to weddings,

87
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,205
we should reap everything we sow
like your mom just said.

88
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,708
That's right. Even if you spend
a lot on a wedding,

89
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,543
only you and the credit card company
will remember it.

90
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,504
Where did you hear that one?

91
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,799
-You should really think about it.
-All right, Mom

92
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,678
I was planning to have
a reasonable wedding anyway.

93
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,347
The party is over.

94
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,932
It's time to start being realistic.

95
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,684
That's right.

96
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,032
Please come up and try walking.

97
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,465
Out of all the hotels in Korea,
the photos come out best here.

98
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,383
The lights aren't all on

99
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,886
and the hall isn't decorated,
so it may look simple.

100
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,931
But it'll feel totally different
on the day of the main ceremony.

101
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,057
My gosh.

102
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,684
This place is perfect.

103
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:04,298
We have only two weddings a day
and there's a three-hour break,

104
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,469
so you can have a relaxed and calm wedding
without feeling pressured about time.

105
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,556
And there is
a professional wedding team in this hotel,

106
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,058
so the ceremony will go smoothly.

107
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,738
One of the reasons why this hotel
is so popular among prospective couples is

108
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,532
because of the bride's waiting room.

109
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,452
A professional florist decorates it
with real flowers.

110
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,246
And the lights are set up perfectly here.

111
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,832
This is the most perfect bridal room

112
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,042
of all of the wedding halls
that I've been to.

113
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,055
FRESH FLORAL DECORATION
13,200,000 WON

114
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,683
HALL RENTAL FEE
18,500,000 WON

115
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,435
MEALS, 73,600,000 WON
DECORATION, 4,300,000 WON

116
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,521
TOTAL AMOUNT
111,300,000 WON

117
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:12,533
I just imagined you sitting there
and it was amazing.

118
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,292
Honey, you love this place,

119
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,670
but I can clearly see
that you're having an internal conflict

120
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,048
because we promised
to have a realistic wedding.

121
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,175
No, I'm not.

122
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,552
Na-eun.

123
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,264
Let's focus everything we have
on this wedding.

124
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,935
Objectively and subjectively speaking,
it's so nice here.

125
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,645
It is nice,

126
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,855
but it's not easy to book a hotel.

127
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,274
Yes, that's right.

128
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,817
You have to make a reservation

129
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,362
at least ten months in advance
to have a hotel wedding.

130
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:54,033
But luckily, you two came
just as a reservation was canceled.

131
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,744
The entire universe is helping us.

132
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,540
If you don't make a reservation now,
someone else will take it.

133
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,583
You can make a deposit since you're here.

134
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,503
-All right.
-Hold on!

135
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,506
We still have to go
to the place I recommended.

136
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,402
It was here.

137
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,445
What do you mean?

138
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,033
The first time I told people
that I wanted to marry you.

139
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,619
I was watching a wedding here

140
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,081
and that's when I thought
how nice it would be if we were up there

141
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,499
on that platform.

142
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,084
And like fate,

143
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,962
you proposed to me.

144
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,673
Isn't it amazing?

145
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,385
It's like we and this wedding hall
are destined.

146
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,015
I know you saw the hotel first,
so this might not impress you.

147
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,477
If we have a private event company
come in and decorate it, it'll be amazing.

148
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,440
I've seen a lot of weddings happen here.

149
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,693
On the wedding day,
we'll have it decorated with flowers,

150
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,904
have a photo table and other decorations,

151
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,823
put up a video on the screen,

152
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,534
and have some special effects.

153
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,244
Then it'll be perfect.

154
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,497
It's luxurious yet casual.

155
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,500
Try to imagine it.

156
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,010
This is the highlight.

157
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,805
This is the best wedding buffet
I've been to.

158
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,684
It doesn't feel like a normal
wedding buffet that makes you bloated.

159
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,144
It's really delicious.

160
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,814
Luckily, there's an event planned
for today, so we can take a look and--

161
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,983
Honey. Wait a minute.

162
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,944
Let's not focus too much on the food.

163
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,864
It's not like guests
are coming to a wedding to eat.

164
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,699
For me, rather than the food,

165
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,661
I'd like for us to focus on the vibe.

166
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,871
-The vibe?
-Yes.

167
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,165
I'd like to have

168
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,627
a simultaneous ceremony
in a grand and luxurious atmosphere.

169
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,213
By simultaneous ceremony,

170
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,840
you mean having the meal
where the ceremony takes place?

171
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,758
Yes.

172
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,762
I wouldn't like to see people coming
and going to the dining hall

173
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,597
during the wedding.

174
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,059
That's great. There's a place
to do that here on the third floor.

175
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,310
No!

176
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,562
We can just have the wedding at the hotel.

177
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,066
I agree that
the vibe of the hotel is good.

178
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,735
But that hotel is hell to get to.

179
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,571
You told me when you went to
that hotel for a wedding

180
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,825
that you had to go around
and around to find a parking spot.

181
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,826
Don't you remember?

182
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,246
That's because I was late then.
If I'd gone early, I wouldn't have.

183
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,999
Then do we tell people to come early?
So it's easy to park?

184
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,754
Then let's try to find a hotel
with easy transportation.

185
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,134
Does it have to be a hotel?

186
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,677
-Yes.
-Why?

187
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,971
If the transportation is convenient,

188
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,849
the food is good,
and the hall is nice, I'd be happy.

189
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:09,562
Why do we have to get married at a hotel?

190
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,855
Tell me why.

191
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,067
Because I've wanted to
get married at a hotel.

192
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,152
Right, so why?

193
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:23,117
If you have a logical reason
for us getting married at a hotel,

194
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,411
I'll follow along
with what you want to do.

195
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,830
So give me a proper reason.

196
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,007
Just give it up.
It's easier if you give up.

197
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,593
No, there's still a chance.

198
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,137
The final date to make a reservation
is tomorrow.

199
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,473
Try to think of something.

200
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,309
A reason that I need to
get married at a hotel.

201
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,485
So, there was never a reason
for you wanting a hotel wedding,

202
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,278
but you wanted one?

203
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,156
Why?

204
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,782
Because I want to.

205
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,494
Because I think we should.
Because that was my plan!

206
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,332
Your logic is superb, right?

207
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:15,419
If you go on a debate,
you'll lose in a minute. Truly superb.

208
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,004
Hey, enough with that.

209
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,632
Help me think of a reason.

210
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,301
Damn it.

211
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,638
I have to persuade Nae-un by tomorrow.

212
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,141
Hey.

213
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,436
Do you want me
to tell you a faster method?

214
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,982
What is it?

215
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,735
It's easier to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

216
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,904
First, put a deposit on the hotel.
And say,

217
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,948
"I did it because I really
wanted this. I'm sorry."

218
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,116
"I'll pay for all the expenses."
And beg for forgiveness.

219
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,787
Then what? She'd rather get married
at a hotel than lose the deposit.

220
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,830
That solution is just superb.

221
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,291
Thanks to you,
my life will also be superb.

222
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,418
What a superb punk, really.

223
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,295
Your reasoning isn't logical!

224
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,422
Meanwhile, Na-eun has a powerful reason

225
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,550
for wanting to do the wedding
at the convention hall.

226
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,469
Are weddings about convenient
transportation and good food?

227
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,639
I can't let my wedding be
all about the guests.

228
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,433
Didn't she say the place was like destiny?

229
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,603
I was watching a wedding here

230
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,065
and that's when I thought
how nice it would be if we were up there

231
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,483
on that platform.

232
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,110
And like fate,

233
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,988
you proposed to me.

234
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,241
There's no story in the world
that can beat that.

235
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,326
Actually, there is.

236
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,665
-What is it?
-If it was your grandma's dying wish.

237
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,750
My grandma is still alive.

238
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,837
You make a will when you're alive.
Dead people can't say anything.

239
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,714
So go to your grandma right now

240
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,009
and tell her, "I want to get married,
but I have to do it at a hotel."

241
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,224
Who does he think he is? "Bulgasal"?

242
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,726
I told him what to do.

243
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,644
Gosh.

244
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,398
HUI-SEON, LET'S GRAB A BITE

245
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,692
She's not going to check my messages?

246
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,112
There's a way to make her check them.

247
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,628
JANG MIN-WOO
HAS SENT A PHOTO

248
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,464
A photo?

249
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,511
Jeez.

250
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,888
Dammit!

251
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,099
Look at this, you were ignoring
my messages,

252
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,478
but after sending you a picture,
you got curious and took a peek.

253
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,980
I knew this would happen.
So when are you free?

254
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,983
I'm trying hard to get you
to be my friend, Hui-seon.

255
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,318
Let's grab a bite.

256
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,155
"Whenâ€¦"

257
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,740
Oh, no.

258
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,996
-Who is it?
-What?

259
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,167
Well, my friend

260
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,169
asked me to grab a bite.

261
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,379
A woman?

262
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,630
A man?

263
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,966
Why would you ask that?
Of course, it's a woman.

264
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,425
Why? It could be a man.

265
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,512
No, she said she wouldn't date anymore.

266
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,806
Hey, when did I say I wouldn't?

267
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,891
I'd consider everything before dating.

268
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,018
-Conditions?
-Yes.

269
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:22,106
My first marriage failed
because I only considered his personality.

270
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,692
So now, I'm going to consider everything.

271
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,403
Their looks, voice, money,
family, and personality.

272
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,572
And they'll need to be
at Jung Woo-sung's level or higher.

273
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,574
-You're basically saying you won't date.
-Exactly.

274
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,078
Do you want me to say it again?
It's not that I won't date--

275
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,622
Na-eun, did you go see the wedding hall?

276
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,793
I did, but Jun-hyeong
and I had a disagreement.

277
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,212
Jun-hyeong wants to
have the wedding at a hotel

278
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,756
and I think a convention hall
would be just fine.

279
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,551
Do you like convention halls
more than hotels?

280
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,429
I like hotels too.
Hotels are certainly much better.

281
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,763
But it's expensive.

282
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,976
With fresh flowers,
a live performance, and the food,

283
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,436
even 100 million won't cut it.

284
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,857
But still, it's your one and only wedding.

285
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,734
Either way, the cost of the wedding

286
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,570
will be covered
by all the congratulatory money.

287
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,656
-So while you're at it, you can spend--
-You can't.

288
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,037
That sort of thinking is dangerous.

289
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,705
Dangerous?

290
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,126
Someone who was going to buy
a compact car for their first car

291
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,503
starts thinking,
"Should I just get a bigger one?"

292
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,672
"Should I get a safer one
while I'm at it?"

293
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,467
And in the end, buys a Mercedes
on an installment plan.

294
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,218
Weddings are the same.

295
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,596
It starts with an imported dress
over a domestic one.

296
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,765
Then a hotel hall over a convention hall.

297
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,934
If you keep going "while I'm at it,"

298
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,437
there won't ever be an end to it.

299
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,149
Right, your standards will get higher
and higher.

300
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,359
My smart girl, Kim Na-eun.

301
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,071
And from a guest's point of view,

302
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,823
a convention hall is much better
than a hotel.

303
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,326
-Why?
-Think about it.

304
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,870
All the good hotels are uphill.

305
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,956
Novotel, Shilla, Walkerhill, Banyan Tree.

306
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,086
If you go wearing heels
and don't catch the shuttle, you're dead.

307
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,755
All hotels on the flat land
are traffic hell.

308
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,006
That's right.

309
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,218
And if you do get married at a hotel,
it feels like you need to add

310
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,012
an extra 50,000
to the congratulatory money.

311
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,641
Why do I need to spend my money
for them to have a luxurious wedding?

312
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,309
That annoys me.

313
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,853
That's why I consider all of that

314
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,022
when deciding to do it
at a convention hall.

315
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,191
So it's decided to be a convention hall?

316
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,276
Well, 90 percent?

317
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,115
To be honest, I told Jun-hyeong to try
to convince me with a logical reason

318
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,866
for having the wedding at the hotel.

319
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,536
But there's no reason for us
to get married at a hotel.

320
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,205
But don't underestimate Jun-hyeong.

321
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,333
If he puts in his best effort
to find a reason, he'll find one.

322
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,754
That's why I have one other trick
up my sleeve.

323
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,965
What is it?

324
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,684
Wait, your father
is against a hotel wedding?

325
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,105
I understand that
you want to get married at a hotel.

326
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:12,109
So I went to my parents
to ask their opinion about having it there

327
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,529
and my dad suddenly objected.

328
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,365
Gosh, my dad.

329
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,412
But, why is he suddenly against it?

330
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,082
My relatives would rent cars
to come up from the countryside

331
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,919
and he's worried about serving them steak.

332
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,381
Their opinions on steaks
are quite polarizing.

333
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,259
Also, they'll be in the car for so long

334
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,846
that they'll want something
more stimulating and less greasy.

335
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,642
What should we do?

336
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,857
I can't just let it go like this.

337
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,903
Make sure you have room for 800.

338
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,615
There are people who come
without receiving an invitation.

339
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,992
That way, the guests won't come in vain.

340
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,619
Where is the ceremony being held?

341
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,122
Well. I'm looking into it.

342
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,917
You know I haven't been interfering

343
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,502
because you said you two will handle it.

344
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,632
You're going to interfere now?
Seeing how you brought it up.

345
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,883
Oh, gosh.

346
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,720
Since you brought it up,
you should get to the point.

347
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,932
Stop playing around and listen!

348
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,352
As you can see from the guest list,

349
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:32,439
employees from your father's company
and our older relatives are all coming.

350
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,068
Make sure you do this properly
so this doesn't affect your dad's image.

351
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,946
Dad's image, family reputation?

352
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,658
Of course, a wedding is a celebration
to both of you.

353
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,577
It's also an extension
of the adults' social lives.

354
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,580
Considering my father's image
and our family reputation,

355
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,794
we should have a formal wedding
at a luxury hotel, right?

356
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,003
Of course.

357
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,091
Make sure the ceremony
is dignified as possible.

358
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,098
Since it's your first ever comment
about the wedding,

359
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,475
I'll make sure to take it to heart

360
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,186
and make sure to
have the wedding at a hotel!

361
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:20,237
Honey, did you think
of a good enough reason

362
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,322
for us to have the wedding at a hotel?

363
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,908
-What?
-If you have one,

364
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,785
I'll try to persuade my dad.

365
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,790
How can I tell her the reason
is protecting my father's image?

366
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:44,386
Since it's our wedding, shouldn't we focus
on our opinions as much as possible?

367
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:49,266
After the incident with the finances,
we promised not to get swayed by others.

368
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:53,645
You're right, but as his daughter,
I can't ignore my dad's opinion.

369
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,772
That would be disrespectful.

370
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,026
You're right.

371
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,572
I can't just ignore
your father's opinion, right.

372
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,201
Then, Jun-hyeong. Should we just--

373
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,786
Let's go convince your father.

374
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,997
What?

375
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,501
All we need to do is convince your father.

376
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,962
As you've already agreed
to the hotel wedding.

377
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,840
Yes, that's right.

378
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,635
Well, then I'll try calling my dad.

379
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,097
He might already be off work.

380
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:39,399
MY DAUGHTER

381
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,699
He's not picking up.

382
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,536
Let's not waste our time going there.

383
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,330
We can plan something with him later.

384
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,624
Let's stop by the house and the office.

385
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,959
If he's not there, we can think again.

386
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,337
This kind of problem
gets more complicated with time.

387
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,130
It's best to resolve it quickly.

388
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,257
Let's go to the real estate office.

389
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,058
CHAMGOOD REAL ESTATE

390
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,692
-Dad.
-What? Oh, my.

391
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,236
Hello, Father.

392
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,447
What brings you here? You didn't call.

393
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,741
Dad, why didn't you pick up your phone?

394
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,202
I didn't know you called.

395
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,372
-Have you been well?
-Yes, of course I have.

396
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,207
Gosh, but what to do?

397
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,584
Your mom is out
at the shopkeepers' meeting.

398
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,420
That's fine, we came to see you anyway.

399
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,548
I can say hello to her another time.

400
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,216
Me?

401
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,926
You must not have eaten yet, Dad.

402
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,678
Let's go eat out somewhere.

403
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,596
I'll stay with dad and clean up here.

404
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,890
Jun-hyeong, you go get us a seat
at a restaurant.

405
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,436
What are you talking about?
We can just share this here.

406
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,731
How can three people share
a bowl of ramyeon?

407
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,941
Goodnessâ€¦

408
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,652
Ta-daâ€¦

409
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,705
The noodles will get soggy. Let's eat.

410
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,085
Goodness.

411
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,926
Father, please allow us to get married.

412
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,139
You're finally here to get permission
to get married?

413
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,808
You should've come
after having one or two kids.

414
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,227
That would've made it easier
to get permission.

415
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,312
Oh, no.

416
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,565
Father, it's not about
your permission to get married.

417
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,276
I was asking for permission to
have our wedding at a hotel.

418
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,529
A wedding at a hotel?

419
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,239
I told him about it.

420
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,450
How you said that you want the ceremony

421
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:57,454
at the employee convention hall
rather than having it at a hotel.

422
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:06,171
I understand why you are opposed to it,
so I've prepared some alternatives.

423
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,797
Alternatives?

424
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,550
If you don't like the idea of steak,

425
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,054
we can change the meal for all the guests
to a Korean traditional meal.

426
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,305
Would that be okay, sir?

427
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,393
Do you think that I'm against this

428
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,562
because of the food selection?

429
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,772
Gosh.

430
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,359
How could you think that of me?

431
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,155
Is it not because of the food?

432
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,659
Yes, there's the food,

433
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,620
but he's also against it
because of the transportation.

434
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,999
The hotel is located in Gangnam
where there's a lot of traffic,

435
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,586
and the older folks
aren't used to using a valet.

436
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,506
That's what worried him.

437
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,471
Just be honest with him.

438
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,610
I'm sorry, Jun-hyeong.

439
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,654
Actually--

440
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,031
It was because
of the number of guests, not the food.

441
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,287
The number of guests?

442
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,002
Jeez.

443
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,761
Won't there be a huge difference between
your father who works for a conglomerate

444
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,222
and me who just runs a real estate office?

445
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,767
From our jobs to the number of guests,
and even the number of wreaths.

446
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,687
Goodness, Father. Don't say that.

447
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,731
Well, if it were someone else, I'd think,

448
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,775
"Why care so much about that?
What a nosy world we live in,"

449
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,193
while condemning them.

450
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,864
But that's not the case when it comes
to them talking about my child.

451
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,701
The number of wreaths, guests, and things
like these don't seem to matter,

452
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,786
but to the wedding hosts,

453
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,873
they seem like measures of my merit.

454
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,792
Goodness.

455
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,970
I feel like I may be judged
for these things at the ceremony.

456
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,390
And I fear that my daughter
may be looked down on for that.

457
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,933
I'm getting all sorts of thoughts.

458
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,145
Na-eun would never be judged
or belittled over such a thing.

459
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,480
I wouldn't let that happen.

460
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,900
I know, I do. But that's just how I feel.

461
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,487
So if you have your wedding
at Na-eun's company convention hall,

462
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,072
I can brag to everyone

463
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,200
that my daughter works
for a large company.

464
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,118
That's why I was being stubborn.

465
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,841
Na-eun must have given you
a different excuse to protect my pride.

466
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,553
It's just a silly old man's thoughts.
Goodness.

467
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,180
No, sir, you're not silly.

468
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,433
We didn't pay enough attention
to these points.

469
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:10,021
I was just too focused on the wedding
that I didn't consider the guests.

470
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,484
What?

471
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,694
What's wrong?

472
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,325
A good idea just came to me.

473
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,869
-Right.
-Of course!

474
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,621
-What?
-What's wrong?

475
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,874
Gosh, he left the lights on again.

476
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,334
-Goodness.
-Gosh, you're right.

477
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,836
Go on in, I'll be right there.

478
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,629
-Come quickly.
-Okay.

479
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,214
-All right.
-Come quickly.

480
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,216
Oh, my.

481
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,138
-Goodness.
-What?

482
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,514
Hello, Mother.

483
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,225
No, what are you doing here
without calling me?

484
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,143
Mom.

485
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,478
Why didn't you call me
when Jun-hyeong was here?

486
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,065
No, we just stopped in
as we were passing by.

487
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,108
Okay.

488
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,111
But why are you feeding them ramyeon?

489
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,113
You should have at least
bought them some meat.

490
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,615
I didn't know
they were coming either. Jeez.

491
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,492
Mother, wait a moment.

492
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,911
-Please have a seat here.
-All right.

493
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,710
I just thought of a great idea.

494
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,463
All of a sudden?

495
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,133
We'll reduce the number of guests

496
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,011
and have a wedding
that can satisfy everyone.

497
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,597
Oh, my! There's such a thing?

498
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,516
I knew it. Smart kids are different.

499
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,727
There are always alternatives.

500
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,480
No, but what is this idea
you're talking about?

501
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,234
For our weddingâ€¦

502
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,831
Jun-hyeong!

503
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,462
What?

504
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,131
Sit down and talk. Sit.

505
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,008
-Why are you standing like that?
-The ramyeon's soggy.

506
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,927
Let's go out for some barbecue.

507
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,929
You're finished with your meeting, right?

508
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,639
It hasn't even started yet.

509
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,475
I stopped by
because the light was left on.

510
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,770
Don't be distracted. Just sit down.
Let's listen to what he has to say.

511
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,687
All right.

512
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,985
Go ahead, Jun-hyeong.

513
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,826
Right, so, what I justâ€¦

514
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,712
Sorry, you were really flustered, right?

515
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,840
Not at all.

516
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,133
I liked it.

517
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,053
Since your father spoke so honestly,

518
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,056
I felt like we became closer now.

519
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:55,562
And I also learned that there's a lot more
to consider when it comes to weddings.

520
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,357
It would have been nice
to have the wedding at a hotel.

521
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,901
It turned into a huge ordeal.

522
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,738
I'm sorry to both you and my dad.

523
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,533
Don't think like that.

524
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,994
Let's think of it as a blessing
now that we know.

525
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,955
Now that we know, we can take care

526
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,000
of your mother and father
and make sure they're comfortable.

527
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,918
That'll be enough.

528
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,338
And don't you worry too much.

529
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,147
Why haven't you gone back home?

530
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,400
Give me a drink too.

531
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,665
Here.

532
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,467
Don't worry about the number of guests.

533
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,888
I'm not.

534
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,517
I said all of that for you,
so don't let it get to you.

535
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,687
The number of guests
and wreaths are a measure of your merit?

536
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,564
Thenâ€¦

537
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,025
I'll send you 100 wreaths.

538
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,321
I'll hire people to stand in as
guests so we can match Jun-hyeong's side.

539
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,449
I know just how hard you've worked, Dad.

540
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,243
I'll give you that medal.

541
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,915
I'll give you a medal
whether it's a hundred or a thousand.

542
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,333
Don't be discouraged.

543
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,003
I mean it.

544
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,006
To me, you're both

545
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,093
amazing people
that can't be compared to anyone.

546
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,054
You don't ever need to feel discouraged

547
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,724
or compare yourself to anyone else.

548
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,019
Don't cry.

549
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,479
If you start crying,

550
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,898
we'll both be pitiful.

551
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,818
Okay.

552
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,619
From today on, I'll wear those medals
so I won't need to feel discouraged

553
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,746
no matter where I go.

554
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,587
By the way,

555
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,465
is money the reason you're against
having the wedding at a hotel?

556
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,385
It's not necessarily because of money.

557
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,722
The wedding hall
was just the best option for us.

558
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,976
If it's about money, you can
just hold the wedding at the hotel.

559
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,564
Your mom saved a lot of money
to help you get married.

560
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,441
Really?

561
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,193
But why hasn't she given it to me?

562
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,194
What?

563
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,280
Hey, just pick one.

564
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,574
If you're going to make me happy,
make me happy.

565
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,993
If you're going to ask for money,
ask for money.

566
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,997
So Dad, where is that money?

567
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,293
My goodness.

568
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,714
What?

569
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,009
You're having the wedding
at the convention hall?

570
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,637
It's a convention hall
for employees of Naeun's company.

571
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,600
And well, there's a special meaning to it.
It's a pretty nice place.

572
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:24,145
I sent you a link and photos of it.
Take a look.

573
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,105
If you see it, you'll be satisfied.

574
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,733
Na-eun chose the wedding hall, right?

575
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,111
No. We chose it together
after careful consideration.

576
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,948
You said that you wanted
the wedding to be at a hotel,

577
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,659
but now seeing you
change your mind like this,

578
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,995
Na-eun must have pushed for it.

579
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,206
No, that's not true!

580
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,458
I liked the hotel at first too.

581
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,335
But after seeing the convention hall,

582
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,962
there's not really any reason
to do it at the hotel.

583
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,091
What do you mean? You need to look out
for your father's image!

584
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,385
I understand your point of view
and about his image,

585
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,847
but I can't simply ignore all
the practical reasons for this one thing

586
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,849
and hold the wedding at the hotel.

587
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,060
This is Na-eun and me getting married.

588
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,021
Our opinions should come first.

589
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,151
I'm not ignoring your opinion, Mom.

590
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:16,155
I'm going to have a very formal
and dignified wedding there.

591
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,493
We won't lose face
nor will Dad's image be in jeopardy.

592
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,911
Just let it slide.

593
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,414
What about next time?

594
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,667
Next time, I'll wholeheartedly accept
your opinion!

595
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,585
Wholeheartedly?

596
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,796
Are you sure?

597
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:33,923
Yes.

598
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,259
All right, then.

599
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,178
You can have the wedding hall as you wish.

600
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,182
But it's time to send out
the marriage gifts, right?

601
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,268
I'll prepare them on my own terms.

602
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,230
Marriage gifts?

603
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,692
It seems that Na-eun doesn't know
what our family is like.

604
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,654
I think it's time to show her.

605
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,200
Okay.

606
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:26,309
Didn't we decide to have simple
wedding gifts and dowry at the meeting?

607
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,560
How is this simple?

608
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,937
She left the price tag on.

609
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,148
Does she want a dowry on the same level?

610
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,400
I told you after the meeting

611
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,360
that Jun-hyeong's mom is no pushover.

612
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,363
No one knows if your mother-in-law
has always been like that

613
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,783
or if she's like that because
she became your mother-in-law.

614
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,912
Then what should we get you
for the wedding gifts?

615
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:53,836
