1
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,040
NOVEMBER CREDIT CARD STATEMENT
33,355,790 WON

2
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,662
What a crazy dream.

3
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,585
Just seeing Jun-hyeong's credit card bill
is giving me nightmares.

4
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,174
EPISODE 4
OUTFIELD FLY BALL

5
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,099
Forget it.
Let's just learn to be cool with it.

6
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,561
There's no need to worry
about something I can't change.

7
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,064
Right.

8
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,109
You only ever plan a wedding once.

9
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,623
Amazing.

10
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,875
No, be natural.

11
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,251
Be sincere.

12
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,088
Na-eun, you look so pretty.

13
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,341
Amazing.

14
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,177
Be natural.

15
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,386
Jun-hyeong.

16
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,014
Hey.

17
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,936
-Hello.
-Hello.

18
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,771
-Was there a lot of traffic?
-No.

19
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,482
Today, we'll be visiting three shops

20
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,027
where you can look at their selection
of dresses and try them on.

21
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,697
All the bride needs to do
is choose the shop that best suits her.

22
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,117
Do I choose a dress
from the shop that I pick?

23
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,077
That's right.

24
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,495
One for the main ceremony

25
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,039
and three more for the wedding shoot.

26
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,124
Since you're here,
please have a look around.

27
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,626
-Okay, thank you.
-No problem.

28
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,712
There are so many dresses!

29
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,464
Come over here.

30
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:23,012
Today, we'll be visiting a shop
with mostly American brands

31
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,473
such as Vera Wang, Reem Acra,
and Oscar de la Renta,

32
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,809
a shop with many European brands
such as Valentino,

33
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,811
and lastly, a boutique that handles

34
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,105
both imported and domestic brands.

35
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,940
That will be our schedule today.

36
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,776
Oscar Reem?

37
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,905
In my experience, when a brand name
is difficult to understand,

38
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,990
it means it's expensive.

39
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,076
You are right.

40
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,621
It may seem expensive to you,

41
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,499
but wedding preparations
can never be cost-effective.

42
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,543
All the money spent will be worthwhile

43
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,461
and the results will be
just as satisfying.

44
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,964
So just trust me.

45
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,591
I'll see to it myself
to give you your dream wedding.

46
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,635
-Okay.
-All right.

47
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,952
For the hair accessory…

48
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,080
No…

49
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,290
No, something else.

50
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,958
This is better.

51
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,211
Put on these shoes.

52
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,714
I'll open the curtain.

53
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:49,891
What?

54
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,727
Goodness.

55
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,354
You have a western body shape,

56
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,399
so this foreign dress
fits you perfectly! Gosh!

57
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,693
That's a hard dress to pull off.

58
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,904
Wouldn't you agree, sir?

59
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,742
What? It doesn't look good?

60
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,286
I'm in total shock.

61
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,371
What?

62
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,209
You look so beautiful wearing that dress
that I'm shocked right now.

63
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,810
I'm so shocked that all the cells
in my brain stopped working for a moment.

64
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,521
I'm just speechless.

65
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:42,193
We're going to make everyone here cringe.

66
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,862
Honestly, I'm really nervous right now.

67
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,992
But there's something not right
about his outfit.

68
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,994
Why?

69
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,830
I think it's totally fine.

70
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,081
No, it's not.

71
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,750
The groom's looks are heavenly,

72
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,919
but his clothes don't accentuate them.

73
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,921
No way, heavenly?

74
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,923
Come on, you probably hear that every day.

75
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,135
Why don't you rent a tuxedo
from the collection line?

76
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,095
It will cost a little extra, though.

77
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,514
So there's a separate collection line.

78
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,266
Yes, Honey, try something on.

79
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,644
It's okay. Who even looks
at the groom's tuxedo, anyway?

80
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,187
We don't need to spend extra.

81
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,190
It's logical to
keep things like this basic.

82
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,817
Logical?

83
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,694
Weddings are about choice and focus.

84
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,738
So I chose to go for the one
where you'll be the focus.

85
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,329
Oh my gosh!

86
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,582
How are you so pretty?

87
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,750
-I like this one too.
-Right.

88
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,087
I knew you'd recognize
the most expensive one.

89
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,840
Of course, expensive things
are always pretty.

90
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,342
Na-eun, how much is this?
They're expensive, right?

91
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,470
They are expensive,

92
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,514
but the incessant add-ons
are the real problem.

93
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,515
Add-ons?

94
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,767
Weddings have always been
a war of add-ons.

95
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,687
When you do a shoot at a studio,
each new scene costs extra.

96
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,150
There are extra costs based on the level
of the makeup team you choose,

97
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,320
and the cost keeps going up and up.

98
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,739
Never mind the dress,

99
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,825
I happened to see Jun-hyeong's credit card
statement the other day.

100
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,828
The balance was beyond my imagination.

101
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,581
It's what he accumulated
before our marriage,

102
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,124
so I can't say much about it.

103
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,543
Right, it's not like
you'll pay it for him either.

104
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,005
Yes, so I just pretended
I didn't see anything,

105
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,217
but I guess it made me so anxious
that it gave me a nightmare.

106
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,804
But seeing what he did today
made me feel a bit relieved.

107
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,306
What did he do?

108
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,599
It's a very small thing.

109
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,061
This entire time, he had been saying
we should get whatever we want,

110
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,564
but now he's saying that it's all
about choosing what we want to focus on,

111
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,692
so he seems to be trying to
spend money rationally.

112
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,153
You know what they say.

113
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,697
Men mature once they get married.

114
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,324
I think Jun-hyeong will too.

115
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,995
I'm sure he knows that
we can't be spending so much

116
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,455
like we used to.

117
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,125
He's a very smart person.

118
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,003
What do you think?

119
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,463
-A bridal shower?
-A bridal shower?

120
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,923
-In a hotel suite?
-In a hotel suite?

121
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,009
It's traditionally the bride's friends
who do this for the bride,

122
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,095
but I'll prepare everything this time.

123
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,764
Just come and enjoy the time with Na-eun.

124
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,058
I've seen that a lot on Instagram!

125
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,018
I know what it is,

126
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,437
but that's something
the bride's friends normally plan.

127
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,940
-So we can book a room on our own and--
-No.

128
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:30,611
This is because I'd like Na-eun
to enjoy it without any stress

129
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,947
while she is preparing for the wedding.

130
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,076
Also, it's sort of a bribe to ask you both
to keep looking out for her

131
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,538
since I'm sure you'll help her
with preparations going forward.

132
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,123
So don't feel burdened.

133
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,336
What's with those looks?

134
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,463
What?

135
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,382
Well…

136
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,176
I was just thinking Jun-hyeong
is quite amazing.

137
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,470
It's usually not easy
for a person to change.

138
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,014
Right, yes.

139
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,183
You know how they say,
"You can't teach an old dog new tricks."

140
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,605
What's so great is that
he's managing to do it.

141
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,275
He's really an amazing man.

142
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,168
This is the perfect spot for a party.

143
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,420
It's great!

144
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,964
But I still don't get this.

145
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,884
You're putting on a surprise again?
You just proposed to her.

146
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,596
I made Na-eun upset recently,
and there are several other reasons.

147
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,765
Hey, the one that's upset is me.

148
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,351
If you're going to do an event,
do one for me.

149
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,685
What are you saying?

150
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,438
The other day, you left me
to take care of them.

151
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,482
And I had to pay for all of the drinks.

152
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,902
You took all the credit the next day
by buying coffee for everyone.

153
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,321
Why did you follow me here
and start nagging?

154
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,948
What are you talking about?

155
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,242
You're the one who begged me
to come with you

156
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,953
as if getting my sister's
employee discount wasn't enough.

157
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,706
You didn't have to come.
You just had to put in a good word for me.

158
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,832
Hey!

159
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,710
You think I'm a pushover?

160
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,797
You treat your friends like shit, asshole.

161
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:18,052
Okay, I'll pay for dinner and drinks.
Why are you being like this?

162
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,679
And a blind date?

163
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,723
I'll do everything but that.

164
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,266
Why? Come on.

165
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,810
Move.

166
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,978
We could put a table right here

167
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,273
with flowers, a cake, and decorations.

168
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,693
Let's use that side as a photo zone
and put a banner right across here.

169
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,114
Are you going to do this all alone?

170
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,156
No…

171
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,326
Na-eun's friends will come
and help me, so we'll get it done quick.

172
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,453
Okay, well then who's going to be filming?

173
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,747
Filming?

174
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,916
Jeez, hey.

175
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,545
You should record
these precious moments on video.

176
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,382
Taking a few photos on your phone
is different from a video.

177
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,843
You're putting a lot of time
and effort into this.

178
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,054
Even if you spend all that time
getting this ready, it'll be a waste.

179
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,347
Cut the crap.

180
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,349
What?

181
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,226
You don't care about any of this.

182
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,396
You're only acting interested now
since Na-eun's friends are coming.

183
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,065
That's not true.

184
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,568
You didn't even know
what a bridal shower was, right?

185
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,027
You still don't know, right?

186
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,613
Why wouldn't I know?
My two sisters have had

187
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,323
three weddings amongst them.

188
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,201
You punk, that's not something
to brag about so stop it.

189
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,202
Damn it.

190
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,912
Fine, I'll stop.

191
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,206
Just let me in, okay?

192
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,625
Invite me to the party.
This is a favor, man to man.

193
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,586
A bridal shower is something

194
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,046
that the bride
and her friends get together to do.

195
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,548
It's not a place for you to be!

196
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,674
Please!

197
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:42,344
Stop talking nonsense and
go take the measurements for the banner.

198
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,015
Go to hell, dammit!

199
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,184
Using this photo,

200
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,270
let's have it be 2m long and 3m wide.

201
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,105
The image quality
won't suffer much, right?

202
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,827
All right.

203
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,672
I know it's late, but can we meet?

204
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,925
We need to choose
a wedding photo studio soon.

205
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,552
If not, we might not be able
to book the place we want.

206
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,520
It'll be hard to do it during the week,
I've been working overtime.

207
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,063
Let's do it on the weekend.

208
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,566
It's not even audit season,

209
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,360
so why is he working overtime?

210
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,782
-Thank you!
-Yes.

211
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,331
You two could never be detectives.
You're hopeless.

212
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,668
-Why not?
-It's so obvious that you're spying.

213
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,128
Who said we were spying?
We were just looking at you.

214
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,588
Why?

215
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,590
Because you're pretty.

216
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,300
Something's going on.

217
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,803
You're not the type
to give compliments like that.

218
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,932
Hey, we're hungry. Let's order a sandwich.

219
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,234
This looks good.

220
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,485
I'm so hungry.

221
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,281
No.

222
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,533
Something feels very off.

223
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,369
Are you still going on about that?

224
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,955
It's because Jun-hyeong
never does overtime.

225
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,541
So what's wrong with that?

226
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,419
I've never seen anyone get so suspicious

227
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,796
just because their boyfriend
is working overtime.

228
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,924
Right, he might have volunteered
to work overtime to make money.

229
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,093
Money?

230
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,636
That's right.

231
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,973
Na-eun, overtime pay is high.

232
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,143
Your boyfriend might be working overtime
to earn some extra money

233
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,187
since so much money
will be going into the wedding.

234
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,398
No, he's not the type to do that.

235
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,318
He might have become
more responsible because of the wedding.

236
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,753
What's wrong?

237
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,923
You look like you're doing pretty well
considering all the overtime.

238
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,717
That's because I'm with you.

239
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,094
You're my pick-me-up.

240
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,390
Why do you have to
work overtime all of a sudden?

241
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,892
It's not even audit season.

242
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,477
Well…

243
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,230
Another department is swamped
with work, so I'm helping them out.

244
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,150
They said they needed someone,
so I volunteered.

245
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,361
You volunteered?

246
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,154
Yes.

247
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,909
Your boyfriend might be working overtime
to earn some extra money

248
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,329
since so much money
will be going into the wedding.

249
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,210
But it's almost over,
so I won't be busy next week.

250
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,547
Let's take a look at the album.

251
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,509
You said we might not be able
to book the studio we want if we're late.

252
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,136
Right.

253
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,641
I just need to
hold out for just a little longer.

254
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,434
Min-woo should be doing fine, right?

255
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,440
"Hello."

256
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,569
Hello.

257
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,988
-Hello.
-Hello.

258
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,033
Jun-hyeong was originally
going to come early to decorate the room,

259
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,161
but there was a problem with his schedule,
so I came in his place.

260
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,998
My name is Jang Min-woo,
I'm Jun-hyeong's friend.

261
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,875
I'm the same age as him.

262
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,546
We went to the same college and work
at the same company. I'm single.

263
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,381
I always welcome blind dates.

264
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,344
This place is huge.

265
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,138
Well, where should we start?

266
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,431
Well…

267
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,685
You two put up the banner.
I'll blow up the balloons.

268
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,355
All right.

269
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,496
Honestly, I saw your
credit card statement last time.

270
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,250
-Why?
-It wasn't on purpose.

271
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,253
It was just on the table
and I just happened to see it.

272
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,590
The balance was much bigger
than I could have imagined.

273
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,592
Last month's balance was--

274
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,053
I'm not getting mad
or nagging you about it.

275
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,305
I was just surprised when I saw it.

276
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,892
I was also worried about
what we should do in the future.

277
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:44,813
But seeing how you've been lately,
I feel that I was worried for no reason.

278
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,194
What have I been doing lately?

279
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,532
I thought it was strange
the way you were doing so much overtime

280
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,451
but Hui-seon and Su-yeon said

281
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,164
it was probably because you were
trying to earn more before the wedding.

282
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,710
They say when a man gets married,
he becomes responsible.

283
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,545
I'm impressed.

284
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,131
Yes.

285
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,050
Of course.

286
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,762
Move it a little more to the left.

287
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,222
A little more.

288
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,264
Here?

289
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,436
Now this time, Hui-seon,
if you would move it

290
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,979
a little bit over to the right.

291
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,777
Excuse me.

292
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,488
Is this really that important?

293
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,906
Of course, it is.

294
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,867
Doesn't it bother you
when these things aren't spaced evenly?

295
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,370
Na-eun will probably be taking
tons of pictures here.

296
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,998
What if the balloons are crooked in them?
It will stress her out every time.

297
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,293
All right, if you understand,
let's get that "L" placed.

298
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,254
Move it a bit farther to the right.

299
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,342
To the right. That's left.
Move it to the right.

300
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,353
Happy?

301
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,774
If we take pictures and it's crooked,

302
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,152
you're dead meat.

303
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,872
Everything's ready.
You can bring Na-eun over now.

304
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,540
Why? Who is it?

305
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,835
Well, my friends are nearby.

306
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,713
I told them we were in Gangnam
and they want us to stop by.

307
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,591
Let's go see them since we're close by.

308
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,800
Should we?

309
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,094
Wait. Let me just make sure I look okay.

310
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,394
You look pretty as is.

311
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,772
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

312
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,945
Who gets together at a place like this?

313
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,033
I guess it's like a private party.

314
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,035
It's annoying to move from shop to shop.

315
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,913
And they say it's not bad
to party this way.

316
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,459
Your college friends are pretty luxurious.

317
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,419
Is this how you partied, too?

318
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,339
Gosh, no.
I wouldn't hang out in a place like this.

319
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,342
I've never been to a pricey place
like this. It's my first time.

320
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,053
Then how did you know
the suite room is in the corner?

321
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,849
It's fine. It's all in the past.

322
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,935
I know you're not the same person.

323
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,148
This is it, room 1355.

324
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,399
Yes.

325
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,136
HAPPILY EVER AFTER
JUN-HYEONG, NA-EUN

326
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,180
What is this?

327
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,935
-Congrats!
-Congrats!

328
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,561
Congratulations on your marriage.

329
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,855
-Congrats, Na-eun.
-What is all of this?

330
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,899
Congratulations, Na-eun.

331
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,192
Min-woo, you're here too?

332
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,611
You prepared all of this for me?

333
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,867
Congrats on the wedding.
I wish you a happy life.

334
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,995
Thank you, Hui-seon.

335
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,082
Congratulations, Na-eun.
I wish you happiness.

336
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,458
Thank you, Su-yeon.

337
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,045
This was totally unexpected.

338
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,090
Did you know too, Honey?

339
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,425
Gosh, of course, he knew.

340
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,677
Jun-hyeong was the one
who prepared all of this.

341
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,680
What?

342
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,016
He prepared for everything,
including the suite.

343
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,268
He's a rare one. Truly one of a kind.

344
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,730
Even from a man's perspective,
he's a total Romeo. I'm telling you.

345
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,481
Zooming in on Romeo.

346
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,691
What?

347
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,530
He's right.

348
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,993
Your boyfriend was
so attentive and considerate.

349
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,747
Yes, right. Jun-hyeong worked so hard
to make all of this happen.

350
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,710
I'm very touched.

351
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,212
Na-eun must be really touched.

352
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,048
Zooming in on Na-eun.

353
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,885
I'm just so touched right now

354
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,304
that I'd like to have a word
with Jun-hyeong for a moment.

355
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,349
No.

356
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,853
It's your bridal shower,
enjoy your time with your friends.

357
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,646
I'll leave with Min-woo. Come on.

358
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,442
Just a moment.

359
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,743
They'll be okay, all right?

360
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,370
They'll be totally fine.
It's just a lover's quarrel.

361
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,664
Gosh, you two must be disappointed.

362
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,874
You worked so hard,

363
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,752
but it ended up going wrong
and now you can't enjoy it.

364
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,462
It's fine.

365
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,756
You worked hard too, Min-woo.

366
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,132
Gosh, no.

367
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,219
-Can my effort even compare to yours?
-Goodness.

368
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,721
You came to congratulate her
despite how much you've been through.

369
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,723
Compared to that, I really didn't do much.

370
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,103
Excuse me?

371
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,730
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,899
I didn't mean to bring it up,

373
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,984
it's just that
I really think you're amazing.

374
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,072
It's not easy to congratulate someone
when you've been hurt like that.

375
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,159
-Hurt? What do you mean?
-Jun-hyeong told me everything.

376
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,038
It doesn't mean he goes around
discussing people's private lives.

377
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,041
He just told me
so I wouldn't make any mistakes.

378
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,379
And, well, nowadays,
a divorce isn't a big deal, right?

379
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,715
Divorce?

380
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,802
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,428
Did I cross the line somehow?

382
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,764
Yes, you did.

383
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,475
I'm the one

384
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,270
who got a divorce.

385
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,982
I…

386
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,485
Unbelievable.

387
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,323
So you thought that
I was the one who got divorced?

388
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,910
You must be out of your mind. Listen.

389
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,496
I've never been married!

390
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,543
-No, wait, Su-yeon!
-Su-yeon!

391
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,170
-Wait.
-Don't you dare!

392
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,923
How ridiculous.

393
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,310
I overdid it, right?

394
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,605
-I shouldn't have--
-Don't try to sneak out of this.

395
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,483
Is this why your credit bill--

396
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,277
Wait.

397
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,237
Let me explain something first.

398
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,033
Last month's balance
was much higher than normal.

399
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,951
I had to prepare for the proposal

400
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,954
and the meeting of our families,
so the balance got really big.

401
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,999
You know that I'm not
an extravagant person.

402
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,250
I live off a salary too.

403
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:06,004
Right, so why are you
renting out a hotel suite--

404
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,465
This is extravagant, you're right.

405
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:13,053
But this is our one and only wedding.
I wanted to overdo it a little bit.

406
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,015
Also, after the incident
about our finances,

407
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,975
I know I made you uneasy.

408
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,772
I teamed up with Hui-seon and Su-yeon.
so you could take it easy and have fun.

409
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,316
But still,

410
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,028
if you keep spending money like this
before the wedding, we will suffer for it.

411
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:34,241
I've said many times that
we can't spend money like this anymore.

412
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,283
I know.

413
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,911
I won't go overboard from here on out.

414
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,081
But you really only live one life.

415
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,917
It's not bad
to go just a little overboard sometimes.

416
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,588
I wanted to do this for you
because I love you so much.

417
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,049
Gosh, you're such a smooth talker.

418
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,759
Forget it.

419
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,638
I promise not to overdo it anymore
and act responsibly.

420
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,181
Will you forgive me?

421
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,561
I'm promising you
and I'll seal it with a kiss.

422
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,607
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

423
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,693
Okay.

424
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,279
I won't overdo it anymore.

425
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,370
I'm sorry.

426
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,664
Goodness.

427
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,709
We're good?

428
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,546
How is it?

429
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,215
Well, it is pretty.

430
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,095
Wait.

431
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,555
I should call Hui-seon.

432
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,058
Wait for a second, Hui-seon.

433
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,853
I'm sorry if I made you upset.
I won't let it happen again.

434
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,856
Make sure we don't cross paths
so that it doesn't happen again.

435
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,192
If someone is trying to apologize,
you shouldn't act like this.

436
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,611
Someone trying to apologize
shouldn't act like this.

437
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,197
If you keep picking at my words,
we can't make up.

438
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,366
It's like you read my mind.

439
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,744
I have no intentions of
making up with you.

440
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,874
I'm Jun-hyeong's best friend,
so we will see each other.

441
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,209
I'll make sure to avoid
any chance of that happening.

442
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,254
You don't lose a single point.

443
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,298
Was I supposed to lose here?

444
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,094
I've been thinking this since earlier,

445
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,974
but you're fucking awesome.

446
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,684
So charismatic.

447
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,312
What's with this idiot?

448
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,980
I'm Jang Min-woo.

449
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,565
Pleased to meet you.

450
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,531
Hey, Na-eun.

451
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,783
Hui-seon, where are you?

452
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,951
Don't tell me you went home.

453
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,703
I'm still here,

454
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,914
but I'll be right there.

455
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,209
Wait for me.

456
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,004
Okay.

457
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,802
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

458
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,185
Thank you so much for everything.
You worked so hard.

459
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,521
Gosh, no. It's all thanks to Jun-hyeong.

460
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,272
-We only helped a bit.
-Right.

461
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,610
I know it was hard to make time
on the weekend to come help.

462
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,488
No. Thanks to this,
we can enjoy this hotel suite.

463
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,157
Goodness, money sure is great.

464
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,994
It is great,

465
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,248
but I don't think I should
take my eyes off Jun-hyeong.

466
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,252
I'll have to keep him under control.

467
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,339
Forget the finances.
Maybe I should take Jun-hyeong's card

468
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,716
and plan and pay
for all the wedding stuff myself.

469
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,760
Hey, what are you saying?
You can't do that.

470
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,471
-Why not?
-If you have money to spend on that,

471
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,640
put some money into the house.

472
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,559
If you don't, when you divorce,

473
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,019
he will have the house
and be happy that its value went up

474
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,607
but the woman will struggle to sell off
all the appliances and things she brought.

475
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,235
Hui-seon, you went too far.

476
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,154
I'm in the middle of my bridal shower.

477
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,739
This is reality.

478
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,865
In my case--

479
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,284
Are you talking
about your marriage right now?

480
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,495
It's so fun hearing you talk about that.

481
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,831
-I'm going to talk about divorce.
-That's even better.

482
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,958
-Jeez.
-All right, that's enough.

483
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,960
Right, Na-eun. That guy earlier…

484
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,504
That Jang Min-woo person
was something else.

485
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,132
Min-woo? Why? Did he do something wrong?

486
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,884
He thought I was a divorcée

487
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,345
and went on about how much I must
have been through. It was ridiculous.

488
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,014
He said that to you?

489
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,517
He's not the type to speak
so bluntly like that, though?

490
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,895
This won't do.
I'll try calling Jun-hyeong.

491
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,271
Hey.

492
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,483
I already told him that
I'm the one who got divorced, not her.

493
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,235
And we don't need to
tell Jun-hyeong all that.

494
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,653
Hui-seon.

495
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,780
Su-yeon.

496
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,573
I know that it upset you,

497
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:48,453
but let's not have someone like him ruin
Na-eun's one and only bridal shower, okay?

498
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,246
Here, take this.

499
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,750
Also, he didn't do it on purpose.

500
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,335
I'm sure he only meant well.

501
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,003
He even complimented me earlier.

502
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:01,925
You're letting him off the hook
because he complimented you, right?

503
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,303
What sort of compliment did he give you?

504
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,100
He said I was "fucking awesome."

505
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,144
What?

506
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,531
Seriously. Dammit.

507
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,533
What's inside that head of yours?

508
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,284
Why did you bring up the divorce?

509
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,412
I didn't say divorce,
I said that she must have been "hurt."

510
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,831
That's all I said.

511
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,125
The way you worded it
isn't what's important!

512
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,586
Why did you bring it up
in the first place?

513
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,840
I really did think it was amazing.

514
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,384
My sister once told me
how bothersome it is

515
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,345
to attend someone's wedding
after getting a divorce.

516
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,514
She really wants to congratulate them,

517
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,016
but she's worried they might think

518
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,434
that she's just pretending.

519
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,644
If she goes,

520
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,397
the couple might think she'd jinx them.

521
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,400
So she loses confidence
and feels torn about it.

522
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,526
But earlier,

523
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:06,114
those two seemed sincerely happy for her
while getting ready for the bridal shower.

524
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,201
If so, you could have
cheered her using your inside voice.

525
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,453
Because of you, I--

526
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,123
Okay, I'll go apologize to Su-yeon later.

527
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,500
I already apologized to Hui-seon.

528
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:25,091
Hey. Hui-seon and I had
such great chemistry earlier.

529
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,385
It was totally amazing.

530
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,180
Don't even think
about starting that nonsense.

531
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:35,518
Don't go near Hui-seon…
No, don't come anywhere near me.

532
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,438
Okay, fine.

533
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,149
You're so ridiculous, seriously.

534
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,108
Gosh.

535
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,985
Dammit.

536
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,405
What?

537
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,365
Thank you, Honey.

538
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,366
I love you.

539
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,794
HAPPILY EVER AFTER
JUN-HYEONG, NA-EUN

540
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,736
A wedding at a hotel?

541
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,905
Jun-hyeong wants to
have the wedding at a hotel

542
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,366
and I think a convention hall
would be just fine.

543
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,536
I'd like for us to focus on the vibe.

544
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,497
Let's focus everything we have
on this wedding.

545
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,665
Does it have to be a hotel?

546
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,041
-Yes.
-Why?

547
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,793
Give me a proper reason.

548
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,754
Are weddings about convenient
transportation and good food?

549
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,216
I can't let my wedding be
all about the guests.

550
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,093
The party is over.

551
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,678
It's time to start being realistic.

552
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:40,351
