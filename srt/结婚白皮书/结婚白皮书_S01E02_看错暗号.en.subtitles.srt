1
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,623
The ball somehow slips through!

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,125
Jeez, dammit.

3
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,502
How could he not catch that?

4
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,131
I think there was a miscommunication
with the catcher's sign.

5
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,257
Indeed.

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,885
-And with that missed sign…
-If the ball slips out like that,

7
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,179
is it the pitcher's fault
or the catcher's fault?

8
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,056
Both of them.
They both got their signs mixed up.

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,142
If the batter doesn't get a hit,
it's still going to be a walk.

10
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,270
And even if it's not a walk,
they're still going to make an error.

11
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,731
Our team's very kind-hearted.

12
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,858
They're not concerned at all
whether they win or lose.

13
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,445
The signs are so complicated.
I can see why they make mistakes.

14
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,739
I bet only smart people can read them.

15
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,033
They're paid professionals.

16
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,452
They should go die in a ditch
if they can't remember that.

17
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,497
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,625
No, a missed sign
is like poison when it comes to baseball.

19
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,629
As soon as you get one missed sign,
the battery goes out of sync.

20
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,422
It affects the entire team's mood

21
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,841
and before you know it,
you've blown the game.

22
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,220
Do you think we're going
to lose again today?

23
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,056
That's hard to tell.
It's still too early in the game.

24
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,142
But if we're to win the game,
one thing's for sure.

25
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,228
We can't have any more missed signs.

26
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,575
EPISODE 2
MISSED SIGN

27
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,170
Na-eun.

28
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,256
Will you marry me?

29
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,012
All right.

30
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,182
What's with that cheeky grin
so early in the morning?

31
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,561
-What?
-That's exactly what I'm asking you, man.

32
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,313
What are you imagining for you
to be grinning like that, you pervert?

33
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,607
Whatever.

34
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,734
Hey, what's the first step
to getting married?

35
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,865
-Dating.
-There you go talking nonsense again.

36
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,076
Jeez. Come on.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,246
Just go and ask Na-eun
what she wants to do first,

38
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,747
and do whatever she says.

39
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,043
You should do whatever your girl wants
if you want things to go smoothly.

40
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,672
I'll do that once we get married.

41
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,382
But as for everything before that…

42
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,926
Why? Did you guys fight?

43
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,264
I want to make sure she's going to be
the happiest bride ever.

44
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,516
You dumbass.
What are you even talking about?

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,768
Jeez, you're hurting my ears.

46
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,478
-Goddammit. Seriously.
-Hey.

47
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,647
I asked her to marry me,
so I should take responsibility.

48
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,609
It wouldn't be fair
if I asked her to handle everything.

49
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,153
I heard women stress out before marriage.

50
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,487
That's your opinion.

51
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,990
I bet they like
being in control of everything.

52
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,659
How would you know that?
You don't even have a girlfriend.

53
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,453
Why wouldn't I know?

54
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,414
I have two sisters
and they had three marriages in total.

55
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,459
-Is that something to be proud of?
-Of course it is.

56
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,086
Hey, I was there when they got married,

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,048
and all my brothers-in-law had to do
was just stand there and smile.

58
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,717
But it's a meeting of two people.
Why didn't he do anything?

59
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,720
That must be why
there were three marriages.

60
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,599
-Leave my family out of this, asshole.
-You said you were proud of it.

61
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,269
I am. Anyway,
my brothers-in-law both told me.

62
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,272
The easiest way is to go
with whatever they want.

63
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,983
So don't get all excited
and try to do something.

64
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,485
Just sit tight.

65
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,695
This is exactly why you don't have a girl.

66
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,406
If you know I don't have one,
at least introduce me to one.

67
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,075
You're leaving me behind.

68
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,952
What difference will that make?

69
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,828
You're zero for 100
when it comes to blind dates.

70
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,622
That's because I prefer
meeting people naturally.

71
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,751
You're supposed to introduce me
to Na-eun's friends casually.

72
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,045
Then I'll start dating
her friend from that day.

73
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,588
Hey, forget it. Whatever.

74
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,925
What did your sisters do first
before they got married?

75
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
They dated.

76
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,352
-This is it. This is the one.
-What?

77
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,230
This is the hotel vibe
that I was looking for.

78
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,606
For the longest time,

79
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,734
I always wanted to decorate my room
like a top-tier hotel.

80
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,862
I want to fill the house up
with things like this.

81
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,533
Hey, who buys a bed like that?

82
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,368
You have to actually lie down on it.

83
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,162
You did.

84
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,706
It's so comfy.

85
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,916
Plus, it's pretty too.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,420
I heard this one is the most popular model
and I get why.

87
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,798
I still think you're getting ahead of
yourself though.

88
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,925
What do you mean?

89
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,762
The meeting of the parents hasn't happened
yet you're looking at furniture?

90
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,556
The meeting of the parents?

91
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,059
That's the first thing
you should do before getting married.

92
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,730
It's also an opportunity for you
to receive your ancestors' blessing.

93
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,857
The blessing of my ancestors?

94
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,608
With the blessing of your ancestors,

95
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,529
you can avoid weird in-laws
or patriarchal families

96
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,197
while meeting their parents

97
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,825
for the first time before getting married.

98
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,369
But most people are just blinded

99
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,039
that they ignore those signs
by their ancestors.

100
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,667
They end up going mind over matter
and getting married.

101
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,628
Jun-hyeong isn't like that at all.

102
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,757
-If anything, my family's the problem.
-What?

103
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,969
I've met with his parents a few times
and they're really good people.

104
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,555
They are very cultured and elegant.

105
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,892
I want to grow old like them.

106
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,602
Plus, they're very nice to me.

107
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,062
-Really?
-Yes.

108
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,773
Still, being their son's girlfriend

109
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,900
and being
their daughter-in-law are different.

110
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,902
Even on all those audition shows,

111
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,696
the judging criteria change
from the preliminaries to the finals.

112
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,948
You think so?

113
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,494
I always thought the first meeting
between the families was just a formality.

114
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,497
No, it's different.

115
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,542
This is totally uncanny.

116
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,337
I talked about meeting our families
with Hui-seon earlier,

117
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,047
and you brought it up just now.

118
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,840
Were you thinking about that too?

119
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,550
Of course.

120
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,344
Great minds think alike.

121
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,519
This place is so nice.

122
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,853
It has such a nice vibe.

123
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,397
The food looks really good as well.

124
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,026
This place is the hottest spot
for any official family gatherings.

125
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,195
-It looks nice, doesn't it?
-Yes, totally.

126
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,738
As long as you like it,

127
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,658
let's ask our parents
and meet up next week.

128
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,035
That quickly?

129
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,164
Yes. The sooner we get it done,
the sooner we'll be married.

130
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,290
Gosh.

131
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,628
I think I'll finally feel like we're
getting married after our families meet.

132
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,339
What do I do? I'm so nervous.

133
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,049
What's there to be nervous about?

134
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,427
We've already met each other's parents,
and they're all good people.

135
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,806
But I heard it's different being
a girlfriend and being a daughter-in-law.

136
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,808
Please, my family isn't like that at all.

137
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,977
You know how cool my mom and dad are.

138
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,521
Of course, I know.
And yet, I'm still nervous

139
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,607
when I think of our parents meeting up.

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,820
I thought you might feel that way.
So there's something I prepared.

141
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,240
-Here, take a look.
-You prepared something else?

142
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,286
This is a list of things we need to be
aware of and prepare before the meeting.

143
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,332
Do your mother and father
have any favorite foods?

144
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,627
I don't know about any favorite foods,

145
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,754
but there's a lot of food
that they can't eat.

146
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,298
What?

147
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,634
Because they eat everything
that there's never any food left.

148
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,137
Hey, stop playing around.

149
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,055
We shouldn't be making jokes right now.

150
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,975
There are so many things to prepare
before the family meeting.

151
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,393
Look. Right here.

152
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,397
What? We're meeting up with them
next weekend?

153
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,566
What?

154
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,652
Hey, what kind of person

155
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,739
rushes into the first meeting
between the two families like this?

156
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,699
It just happened. It's okay, right?

157
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,702
Well, if Jun-hyeong's family
is okay with it, we are too.

158
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,704
Where are you guys going to be living?

159
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,956
I think Jun-hyeong's family
is going to help us.

160
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,625
He said he'd talk to her about it.

161
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,418
What is your budget?

162
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,214
I mean, if you've decided to get married,
you should settle these things first.

163
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,966
How could you have still not
discussed these things with him?

164
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,052
How much do you have?
And the wedding gifts?

165
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,096
Hey, but I don't think
I have anything decent to wear

166
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,098
if we're meeting them next week.

167
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,601
Mom.

168
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,853
-Yes?
-How about this one?

169
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,439
I think you look the best
in this one, Mom.

170
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,776
This will make it look like
I'm the one who's trying to get married.

171
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,735
Okay.

172
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,028
Then how about…

173
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,780
Okay. What about this one?

174
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,617
I'll look like a monk.
Like I've given up all of my worldly ways.

175
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,789
Gosh, I never seem to have any clothes
whenever it's time to go out.

176
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,123
Na-eun, stop!

177
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,550
Your mom may be searching
through her wardrobe,

178
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,802
but what she's really looking for is this.

179
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,472
Go get something.
Whatever tickles your fancy.

180
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,225
That's probably for the best, right?

181
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,770
I can't just wear anything
to our first meeting with their family.

182
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,231
It'd be a disgrace to Na-eun.

183
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,733
I heard Jun-hyeong's mother
is a very classy lady.

184
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,361
You should also
go find a suit or something.

185
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,572
Do you expect me to put it on today?

186
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,448
Is this the time to be joking around?

187
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,701
It's been a while
since you last wore your suit.

188
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,619
So just check if they still fit you

189
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,997
or if anything needs mending
before it's too late.

190
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,457
What are the in-laws going to think

191
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,751
if we show up to the meeting
looking all scruffy?

192
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,754
Jeez, that's enough!
Are we going to a fashion show?

193
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,383
We're going to say hello to them
and ask them to be kind to Na-eun.

194
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,260
What do you mean "enough"?

195
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,846
They say going to the meeting
of families is like warfare.

196
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,805
What?

197
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,849
That's not what I heard, Mom.

198
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,311
Are you some kind of general
riding into battle to lop off some heads?

199
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,354
Gosh, there you go. That's the spirit!

200
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,857
Am I wrong?
That kind of fighting spirit is the least

201
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,151
it'll take to make sure
we strike the first blow!

202
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,320
No, it's not, Mom.

203
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,832
Ta-da!

204
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,502
What's the occasion?

205
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,922
I was passing by the macaron shop
in the neighborhood and thought of you.

206
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,257
You like their macarons.

207
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,762
-Was I being too obvious?
-Yes.

208
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,184
I'm here to offer you a bribe
for the family meeting, your Majesty.

209
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,979
Please. What do you mean by a bribe?

210
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,359
Did Na-eun say something?

211
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,444
No.

212
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,280
I was just worried now that we're
going to meet up with her family soon.

213
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,075
Mom, I heard that
the entire mood can change

214
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,578
from one casual slip of the tongue
during the family meeting.

215
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,374
So please avoid talking
about any wedding gifts or dowries

216
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,167
and just try to keep smiling.

217
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,053
Here, take this with you.

218
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,389
What is this?

219
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,809
If you want me to say nothing
at the meeting,

220
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,561
just take that and leave it on my seat.

221
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,942
You're twisting everything I said.

222
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,903
Thank God, I didn't buy twisted donuts.

223
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,115
Jeez, my mom is so pretty.

224
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,286
All right, then tell me everything now
so I can keep quiet there.

225
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,871
How the wedding's going to be.

226
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,832
As best we can.

227
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,125
How so?

228
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,627
-The best the two of us can do.
-Jeez.

229
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,755
What, did a stork drop you off?
Did I pick you up under a bridge?

230
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,175
Mom, take a deep breath and hear me out.

231
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,470
It's common for couples
to put their heads together

232
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,723
and plan their wedding without
any interference from their parents.

233
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,142
That's the trend these days.

234
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,810
Is that so?

235
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,106
I supposed you two will figure out
the housing situation too, right?

236
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,652
When it comes to buying a house,

237
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,989
the current trend is for the parents
to help them out discreetly.

238
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,580
You're out!

239
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,542
Come on. So I can't even talk…

240
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,004
I'm going to put everyone in their place
when I meet up with them

241
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,047
because you're getting on my nerves.

242
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,884
Come on, Mom!

243
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,218
Just get out of here!

244
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,138
Hey, go back to your own place.

245
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,556
-Gosh. Go, hurry up!
-Jeez.

246
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,059
Here, get going.
Go home to your place. Hurry up.

247
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,269
But, Mom!

248
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,062
What do you mean, but?

249
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,106
Get home safely, bye!

250
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,904
How can he even call himself a son?

251
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,750
What is it? Are you getting nervous
because the family meeting is coming up?

252
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,419
There are time bombs all over the place.

253
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,879
Time bombs?

254
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,882
My mom overreacts to everything
and my dad jokes around too much.

255
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,138
Jeez, did I buy ice or a latte?

256
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,556
This whole thing is just ice.

257
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,893
Calm down. At least you still have
Jun-hyeong.

258
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,312
He is not going to make it any easier too.

259
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,814
-He's not?
-Your boyfriend?

260
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,985
He's not good when he gets nervous
or when the situation is uncomfortable.

261
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,946
Even when he was proposing to me,

262
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,866
he was so nervous that he had trouble
switching topics normally.

263
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,535
Every time I mentioned marriage,

264
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,245
he'd cut me off and acted so weird.

265
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,121
He caused a huge misunderstanding.

266
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,124
-So he's not good when he gets nervous?
-No.

267
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,503
His social skills vanish when that happens
and he becomes very clumsy.

268
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,671
That's a big problem.

269
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,464
Plus, you're just the same

270
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,133
for being so blind when
he was going to propose to you.

271
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,928
It's as if I'm in a minefield right now.

272
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,933
Just think of it as
preparing for some kind of a summit.

273
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,935
A summit?

274
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,687
Yes.

275
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,021
A summit is like

276
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,065
when all the workers do all the work,

277
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,360
then all the heads of each nation gather
to agree on the topic, saying,

278
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,445
"Thank you for coming all the way
out here."

279
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,241
"It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
and I look forward to working together."

280
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,535
The family meeting is exactly the same.

281
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,871
That's actually a perfect metaphor.

282
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,291
So there's just one thing
you need to be focusing on at the summit.

283
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,585
What is it?

284
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,589
Make sure there's no discussion
about any details.

285
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,424
So what you're saying is,

286
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,051
don't talk about wedding gifts
or my dowry?

287
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,428
Precisely!

288
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,806
Because at the end of the day,
the workers will handle everything anyway.

289
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,100
So during the summit, just keep saying,

290
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,728
"Let's keep things simple
and leave it to the kids."

291
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,187
This is what to aim for.

292
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,941
If you start talking
about who gives and receives what

293
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,568
and the price of everything,

294
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,946
that's when the real headache starts.

295
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,823
And it's only a matter of time
before someone's feelings get hurt.

296
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,868
You know everything
about getting married, Hui-seon.

297
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,288
Then did you still break up
even when things went so perfectly?

298
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
That's incredible though.

299
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,585
Let me clear this for you.

300
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,421
Can you believe her?

301
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,176
She has no respect for seniority.

302
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,142
I'm home.

303
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,060
Hey.

304
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,441
What's going on with mom?

305
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,986
Hey, she doesn't have the guts
to look you in the face.

306
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,905
What is that supposed to mean?

307
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,114
Did something happen?

308
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,451
Mom.

309
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,580
Are you upset that
I'll be marrying into another family?

310
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,748
Mom.

311
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,417
-Mom!
-No, it's nothing.

312
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,877
-What's going on?
-Hey, just…

313
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,296
-Come on, what is it? Let me take a look.
-Hey.

314
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,255
Just wait.

315
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,468
Mom!

316
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,514
What happened to your face?

317
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,058
Is it that bad?

318
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,185
I mean, only if I use my eyes.

319
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,313
With good eyesight, you can even see it
from across the street.

320
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,194
Well, I was only trying to get
a regular massage.

321
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,738
But the woman there told me
a meridian massage is good,

322
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,198
so I told her to go lightly

323
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,033
and now I look like this.

324
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,077
I'm going to rip her a new one.

325
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,663
What do we do? We're meeting up
with them tomorrow.

326
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,290
It's okay. I can cover it up with makeup.

327
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,460
I think you'll have to wear a mask.

328
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,088
Your dad's excited that
he has something to rag on me about.

329
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,007
He's diving in face first.

330
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,969
Makeup should be able
to cover all of this up, right?

331
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,263
If I can't cover it up,

332
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,392
you should just go with dad.
Tell them I have enteritis.

333
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,477
You're telling me to lie?

334
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,146
Why do we have to lie?

335
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,064
You can just get enteritis.

336
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,193
You know, it's really easy
to get enteritis in this house.

337
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,863
Everything we have
is past its expiration date.

338
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,366
If you're lucky, you might even find
rice cakes from your first birthday.

339
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,078
Dad, how can you crack jokes
in a situation like this?

340
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,538
Hey, you should laugh too.

341
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,624
Laughing is the best thing you can do
in these types of situations.

342
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,419
That's what you get
for going to get a massage.

343
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,587
Doesn't it hurt?

344
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,297
It does.

345
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,389
BRUISE CREAM

346
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,476
JUN-HYEONG

347
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,102
Can you come out right now?

348
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,236
Hey.

349
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,322
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

350
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,115
Didn't you say
you were going to your mother's?

351
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,578
What's up? Did something happen?

352
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,664
No. Nothing happened.

353
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,833
Something happened, right?

354
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,711
Sweetie…

355
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,257
If my mom happens to
get kind of intense at the meeting--

356
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,301
Why would your mom get intense?

357
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,095
Well, it's really nothing big.

358
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,598
I made a light joke the other day
and I think that upset her a little bit.

359
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,310
I knew this was going to happen.

360
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,480
-When you got nervous, you always--
-I'm not nervous.

361
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,359
Fine, you may not be nervous,

362
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,652
but I am.

363
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,030
So let's come up with something.
We can't leave this up to our parents.

364
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,073
What?

365
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,827
Let's come up with some signs
so we can control the mood.

366
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,455
That way, we can smooth things over
even if your mother gets a bit intense.

367
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,167
As for my mom, if she starts to overreact,
we'll be able to keep the mood light.

368
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,377
And most importantly,

369
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,171
I'll be able to keep you in check.

370
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,507
Me? Why me?

371
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,262
I'm quick at picking up on social cues,
so I'll give you a sign.

372
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,596
For example,

373
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,100
If the conversation touches on
an uncomfortable topic,

374
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,645
or if our parents start to get intense,
then I'll do this.

375
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,814
Yes, just like this.

376
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,149
I'll wink at you like this.

377
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,193
Then you step in and change the topic

378
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,528
to the food or the weather.

379
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,906
This? Like this?

380
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,701
Yes, and if I nod twice,

381
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,288
then just compliment my mom.

382
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,456
-Out of the blue?
-Yes.

383
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,334
My mom loves compliments.

384
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,753
She just gets excited
when someone compliments her.

385
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,924
Okay, and then if I do this,

386
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,677
this means I want you
to step outside for a second.

387
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,306
This means "stop everything."

388
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,728
I want you to stop whatever you're saying
or doing at that moment.

389
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,898
All right! I always knew
you were a genius.

390
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,692
I think I'm going to do really well.

391
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,798
-Mom.
-Yes?

392
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,550
You remember what I told you, right?

393
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,802
Gosh.

394
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,225
Hey, go easy on that!

395
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,270
Don't go overboard
just because you're feeling pressured.

396
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,023
What do you mean I'm feeling pressured?
Why would I feel any pressure?

397
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,193
Jun-hyeong's family should feel pressured
since we've raised such a wonderful girl.

398
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,903
Why should I feel pressured at all?

399
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,405
Goodness.

400
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,994
Hey, Jun-hyeong.

401
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,704
Are you here?

402
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,081
Okay.

403
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,666
Goodness me, good evening.

404
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,668
-I'm sorry we're so late.
-It's a pleasure to meet you.

405
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,003
There she is.

406
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,212
All right.

407
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,557
-Shall we head in?
-Yes, let's.

408
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,934
-Please, lead the way.
-After you.

409
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,352
Come, let's go.

410
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,075
-Take a seat.
-Yes.

411
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,168
What? Okay.

412
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,427
Dad, your seat is there.

413
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,678
What?

414
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,805
Jeez.

415
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,123
Gosh, we finally get to meet face-to-face.

416
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,209
I hope you didn't have
any trouble getting here.

417
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,460
No, not at all.

418
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,504
We were absolutely ecstatic

419
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,756
and couldn't wait to meet
our future in-laws.

420
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,010
I was wondering how Jun-hyeong
came to be so tall and handsome.

421
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,970
But now I guess he gets it all from you.

422
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,182
With such a strapping young man
as your son,

423
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,684
I bet there's nothing else
you could even ask for.

424
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,647
Compared to Na-eun,
he still has a long way to go.

425
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,525
I hope you can
teach him a good lesson or two.

426
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,195
Okay, the conversation is flowing nicely.

427
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,446
Now it's mom's turn.

428
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,199
If I may say, ma'am…

429
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,325
Gosh, look at me.

430
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,120
Since we're all becoming family now,
I should get used to formalities.

431
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,497
It's going to take me a while
to get used to it.

432
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,167
It isn't that easy
to get used to formalities.

433
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,295
Please feel free to call me
whatever is easiest for you.

434
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,338
Yes, indeed.

435
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,173
Nice one, Mom.

436
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,677
I must say, ma'am, you're so very refined.

437
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,597
Na-eun always talked about
how Jun-hyeong's mother was so chic

438
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,933
and elegant that I'd been curious.

439
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,811
Gosh, but seeing you in person,
you're gorgeous.

440
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:01,940
As they say these days,
you're in a class of your own.

441
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,651
Thank you.

442
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,488
That's it?

443
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,368
Isn't it common courtesy to return
a compliment if you've received one?

444
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,959
That signal.

445
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,211
If I nod twice,

446
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,088
then just compliment my mom.

447
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,427
You're no joke either, Mother.

448
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,762
I was absolutely stunned
when I first saw you.

449
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,932
Stunned?

450
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,476
Why? Did something happen?

451
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,854
When I went over to your house
to meet you,

452
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,230
only Na-eun's older sister was there.

453
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,857
Gosh.

454
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,235
What a wild joke to make
in front of your parents.

455
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,820
No, I'm being serious!

456
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,489
I bet people mistake you
for Na-eun's sister, don't they?

457
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,657
Oh, my.

458
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,285
Looking like sisters might be
an exaggeration.

459
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,372
But when I tell my customers that
my daughter is going to be married soon,

460
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,166
they sure do seem to be surprised.

461
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,044
I told you! I knew it.

462
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,295
You're doing a great job.

463
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,339
Now it's time to stop.

464
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,217
Now that you're getting meridian massages,

465
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,927
you're going to look a lot younger.

466
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,196
Why on earth would you tell him
everything like that?

467
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,280
It's not like that.

468
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,449
I just told him to act like
he didn't notice it

469
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,326
even if he noticed it.

470
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,371
Gosh, that was really embarrassing

471
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,456
in front of Jun-hyeong's mom.

472
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,668
I'm so embarrassed I don't think
I'll be able to keep my chin up.

473
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,170
This is just my opinion, Mom.

474
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,923
But I think the person who was
the most embarrassed there

475
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,633
wasn't necessarily you.

476
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,637
Let's laugh it over, Mom.

477
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,723
Laughing is the best thing you can do
in these types of situations.

478
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,612
I feel really sorry and thankful
after hearing that

479
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,740
you will be taking care
of the kids' house.

480
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,784
Not at all.

481
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,495
It's only right
that we'd try to do our best to help

482
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,789
our one and only son live his best life.

483
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,833
I hope you don't feel pressured.

484
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,128
I appreciate your telling us that.

485
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,964
For the wedding gifts and the dowry,

486
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,967
we'll prepare them handsomely
so that you won't be disappointed.

487
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,720
If you put it like that,

488
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,888
I guess I can really look forward to it.

489
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,688
If there is anything you want,
please let me know.

490
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,065
We'll do our best
to match whatever it may be.

491
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,444
If you're asking me what I expect…

492
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,616
Sapphires, mink coats, diamond bracelets,

493
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,995
a 24-karat cutlery set,
a mother of pearl wardrobe.

494
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,678
Nobody really needs
these types of things, do they?

495
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,681
Let's keep any wedding gifts
and the dowry simple

496
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,851
so that both families
can support our children to live well.

497
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,562
Who does she think
she's trying to toy with?

498
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,485
We'll do our best to prepare something

499
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:37,906
that won't make you feel too pressured.

500
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,869
That was a close one.

501
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,704
I better change the topic fast.

502
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,465
This is so salty and delicious.
It's perfect to have with rice.

503
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,592
Yes? Is that the changnanjeot?

504
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,719
So this is what they call changnanjeot?

505
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,930
This looks to me like garibijeot.

506
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,601
Mom, what are you doing?
Don't pick such a small hill to die on.

507
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,732
It is changnanjeot.

508
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,611
Jun-hyeong's father loves salted seafood
so I buy it very often.

509
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,864
Judging by the shape,
it's not pollack innards.

510
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,492
I know because I pickle them at home.

511
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,837
How about we ask?

512
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,508
Excuse me,
what kind of salted seafood is this?

513
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,929
-Yes.
-I believe it's modumjeotgal.

514
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,309
I heard that they mix
pollack innards and scallops together

515
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,020
to make salted seafood
and call it modumjeotgal.

516
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,565
Yes, that's right.

517
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,235
I remember going to a traditional
Korean restaurant the other day

518
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,862
and trying their modumjeotgal.

519
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,155
Isn't that right?

520
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,701
This is modumjeotgal?

521
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,414
Hey, you.

522
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,800
Father.

523
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,636
Was there something
you wanted to talk about?

524
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,472
Did you really have to go and ask?

525
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,933
-Sorry?
-I mean, so what if it was changnanjeot,

526
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,685
and so what if it was garibijeot?

527
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,687
It's the seed of discord anyway.

528
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,442
I was just curious
because their opinion was different.

529
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:41,029
If you have that much sense in you,
then you better watch your words today.

530
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,739
Jeez.

531
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,449
Yes, Father.

532
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,078
I picked a few perfect dates
for the kids to have their wedding.

533
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,413
Thank you.

534
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,793
I'll let you know which dates to select
after taking a look at it with my wife.

535
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,960
Of course.

536
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,964
You two are going to be very busy
once you start preparing for the wedding.

537
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,175
They have to work and prepare
for the wedding at the same time.

538
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,718
They'll be very busy.

539
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,720
You should help them out.

540
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,639
I wouldn't mind,

541
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,016
but Na-eun might find that
a bit uncomfortable.

542
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,896
What's there to be uncomfortable with
when we're all about to become family?

543
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,440
-Isn't that right, Na-eun?
-Yes?

544
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,026
Yes, of course, I'd like that.

545
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,157
Is their inability to pick up social cues
a genetic thing? Jeez.

546
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,202
That's fine, really.

547
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,956
Your family must be very busy as it is,
so you can just let them take care of it.

548
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,375
I'll be a good coach and help them

549
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,794
prepare for the wedding
without too many hitches.

550
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,170
There's no need to worry.

551
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,713
No, I insist.

552
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,467
I have more time to spare than you
since you have to work.

553
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,178
It's my one and only daughter's wedding,

554
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,639
so I'll have to come up
with some spare time.

555
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,934
For me also, it's my one
and only son's wedding,

556
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,019
-so of course, I should make--
-Excuse me.

557
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,904
I think we can handle things on our own.

558
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,698
Seo Jun-hyeong.

559
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,408
Here we go.

560
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,285
Jun-hyeong.

561
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,457
I know that you may think
that we lack in many ways,

562
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,711
but we'll make things work
with whatever we have.

563
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,130
We will prepare for the wedding.

564
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,300
I'm sure it won't be easy
to plan a wedding,

565
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,927
but we're going to work together

566
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,181
and do everything we can to make sure
that we won't disappoint you.

567
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,517
Please trust us and give us a chance.

568
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,107
I'll work together with Na-eun
to start the rest of our life together.

569
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,458
Gosh. You did well today.

570
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,751
It was nothing, Father.

571
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,420
-Did you enjoy the food?
-I sure did!

572
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,505
Thanks to you,
I'm leaving on a full stomach.

573
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,217
Your parents are very good people,
and funny as well.

574
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,388
Let's try and meet up like this
from time to time.

575
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,806
Yes, sir.

576
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,767
And, this is for you ma'am.

577
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,811
-What's this?
-They're macarons.

578
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,190
Jun-hyeong prepared these
for you beforehand

579
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,733
in case your blood sugar levels dropped.

580
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:27,153
-Eat them on your way home.
-Jun-hyeong did that?

581
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,782
I guess he's finally growing up now
that he's getting married.

582
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,828
He might not show it as much as he should,
but he cares about you a lot.

583
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,082
-I'm sure he does.
-Let's get going.

584
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,792
We should head out
for her to get some rest.

585
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,834
All right.

586
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,798
Na-eun.

587
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,095
Welcome to the family.

588
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,352
You did really well today,
go home and rest up.

589
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,604
I'm sure you worked up a real sweat today.

590
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,689
No, it was nothing.

591
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,440
Ma'am, these are some macarons.

592
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,403
It must have been a grueling evening.
Eat something sweet before going to bed.

593
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,782
You have enough sense for this,
but you can't pick up on social cues?

594
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,200
Anyway, good job today.

595
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,202
You should go and take some rest too.

596
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:19,330
Thank you, Father. Good night, Mother.
I'll be visiting you soon.

597
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,541
-Yes, sure thing. Anytime.
-Thank you, Mother.

598
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,002
-Good night, Mom.
-Yes.

599
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,086
You did well today.

600
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,838
-Good night, Dad.
-Yes.

601
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,679
-Bye.
-Good night, sir.

602
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,307
Gosh, that was no joke, was it?

603
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,686
Gosh. That was only the first meeting
between our families,

604
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,397
but I feel like we've already
gone through a whole wedding.

605
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,151
Planning a wedding won't be like this
for the entire time, right?

606
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,570
Of course not!

607
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,823
Now our parents are out of the picture.
It's just you and me now.

608
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,036
I heard couples fight a lot
when they start planning their weddings.

609
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,495
What do you mean?

610
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,664
That might be
what other people do, not us.

611
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,207
Have we ever even fought before?

612
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,834
We haven't.

613
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,711
And we'll never fight in the future.

614
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,212
-You're right.
-That's right.

615
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,338
Sweetie, I'm hungry.

616
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,339
Let's go.

617
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,136
Try giving the kids a call.

618
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,513
Just leave them.

619
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,308
We've already told them
to rest up and have a good night,

620
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,810
so repeating it over and over
is already too tiring.

621
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,815
Our daughter is really getting married.

622
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,985
Yes, she really is.

623
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,906
I always thought
getting her married would feel like

624
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,532
finishing all of my homework.

625
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,370
But now that she's actually doing it,
I feel all weird inside.

626
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,666
It'd probably feel just as weird
if she just kept living with us.

627
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,877
Do you not feel anything at all?

628
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,796
I feel sad, for sure.

629
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,383
But I'm just thankful that
she grew up well and healthy.

630
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,385
She grew up to be

631
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,930
such a pretty young woman
and she found a good partner.

632
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:03,059
So there's not much more I can ask for.
That's more than enough.

633
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,436
But…

634
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,107
didn't Jun-hyeong's mom look
like an intense character to you?

635
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,109
Don't you think she's going
to give Na-eun a hard time?

636
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,988
The only one who's intense
is this lady right here.

637
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,365
Please.

638
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,368
Seriously, it's like you were
born to annoy me.

639
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,745
Don't be so sad.

640
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,623
I mean, it's not like
they're moving far away.

641
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,209
Plus, she brought
such a great son-in-law to us.

642
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,336
Think of it as if we found another child.

643
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,881
And, I'm not saying this
just because they're ours,

644
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,593
but they're good kids.
They are great together.

645
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,390
By the way,

646
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,309
how much do you think
this wedding is going to cost?

647
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,353
Didn't you hear what Jun-hyeong said?

648
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,815
They will make things work
with whatever they have.

649
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,608
They said they'd do their best.

650
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,235
Don't try and get too involved.

651
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,821
Did that include
all of the financial stuff too?

652
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,989
Yes, of course.

653
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,450
If they invited both parents
to announce their marriage,

654
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm sure they already discussed that.

655
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:08,040
They must know that money is
the one and only thing that can make

656
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,168
or break a marriage, right?

657
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,420
I'm sure they know.

658
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,089
Of course, they do.

659
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,592
They've been dating
for more than two years now.

660
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,261
That kind of stuff
should already have been settled.

661
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,847
Think about how old they are, gosh.

662
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,743
You've never talked about money
with your boyfriend?

663
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,038
I have no idea how much he makes,
let alone how much he's saved up.

664
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,081
You need to worry about
just two things from now on.

665
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,625
-What could they be?
-They say that money

666
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,793
is the most important issue
when it comes to getting married.

667
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,462
How much have you saved up?

668
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,631
This is our one and only wedding.

669
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,759
I want to do it in the most economical way
without any regrets--

670
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,510
We can worry about the price later.

671
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,763
I don't want to have any regrets
rather than worrying about the costs.

672
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,389
I can't even talk about
what I really want.

673
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,726
If I keep going,
I'll just end up being the petty one.

674
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:14,774
