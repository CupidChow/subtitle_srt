1
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,289
What the hell?

2
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,957
He must be a rich Chinese guy.

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,209
-It totally doesn't suit him.
-Hui-seon.

4
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,299
Hui-seon.

5
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,177
I know you made eye contact with me.

6
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,095
Hui-seon.

7
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,932
What the hell? Is he crazy?
What's wrong with him?

8
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,685
-He's so loud.
-Isn't he embarrassed?

9
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,853
Right.

10
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,646
Well, you must be getting off work.

11
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,398
Yes…

12
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,485
Gosh, you have a nice car.

13
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,654
Well, you must know your cars.

14
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,115
Weren't you showing it off
so that I would notice it?

15
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,454
I just wanted to let you know
that I have a car too.

16
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,708
-Pardon?
-So don't take rides other men offer you.

17
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,709
Who was that man?

18
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,046
You got into his car at night.
There must be something between you two.

19
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,885
Are you two-timing me?

20
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,971
Well, you said you only accept guys
at Jung Woo-sung's level.

21
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,140
Are you really dating Jung Woo-sung?

22
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,228
If you're trying to get me to like you,

23
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,231
do it with your looks,
not your possessions.

24
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,651
Isn't this what you're supposed to do
when showing off your charms?

25
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,320
Something like this.

26
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,244
Min-woo, you're going way too overboard.

27
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,454
Do you know what a double play is?

28
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,791
-What, a double play?
-Yes, a double play.

29
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:08,044
If you embarrass me like this,
our friendship will be over,

30
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,421
and you won't get the chance
to go beyond that.

31
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,548
It's totally over!

32
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,176
Totally over?

33
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,428
Hui-seon.

34
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,514
Hui-seon.

35
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,850
Wait.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,227
Wait, that's not…

37
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,732
EPISODE 8
GROUND INTO DOUBLE PLAY

38
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,533
PRODUCT DELIVERY REQUEST FORM
NAME: KIM NA-EUN

39
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,202
Please make sure it's not late.

40
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,579
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,877
You know the wedding gifts
will arrive today, right?

42
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,089
You need to be there by six. All right?

43
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,508
Don't worry.

44
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,221
Will he be late again today?

45
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,478
…to save energy and reduce carbon dioxide.

46
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,065
Not only that, but also economic,
social, and regional…

47
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,652
So what's the solution?

48
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,448
Our team will check the relevant
regulations and correct them.

49
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,741
Damn it.

50
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,243
Is that the best you can do?

51
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,705
Yes, sir, we'll work with
the relevant ministries

52
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,207
and come up with a solution
as soon as possible.

53
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,923
Why do they keep asking obvious questions?

54
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,343
So they have something
to write about in the meeting minutes.

55
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,720
To reduce the initial investment cost,

56
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,473
-based on the human sequence…
-It's Friday night,

57
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,141
can't they take a hint?

58
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,477
It's not the first time this has happened.

59
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,437
Do you have plans after this?

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,276
I told you today is the day
we're presenting the wedding gifts.

61
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,032
Even if I leave now,
traffic is going to be bad.

62
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,702
You'll be late because of work.
You can't help that.

63
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,788
Don't even say that.

64
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,539
What?

65
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,085
If I say I'm late because of work
one more time…

66
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,169
If you do?

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,047
That will be all for today's meeting.

68
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,260
What? He's gone?

69
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,763
Do you really have to ask?

70
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,433
If that happens, the place I'll need
to go to won't be my wedding,

71
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,395
it'll be my funeral.

72
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,946
My promise to not let this happen again
becomes meaningless…

73
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,368
I'll do my best
so that you don't have to suffer alone.

74
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,078
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,372
…as things get more complicated.

76
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,959
Jun-hyeong, our wedding
is just around the corner.

77
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,169
We need to figure out
our housing situation soon.

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,755
I want to figure it out too.

79
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:02,176
We have to get rid of this place first
and use the money to get a new place.

80
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,513
-But this place isn't selling.
-Right, so we need to think of a plan B.

81
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,599
Should we find a rental with a
lower deposit using my savings?

82
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,477
Honey, don't be so impatient.

83
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,315
If worse comes to worst, we can live here.

84
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,609
You want to live here as newlyweds?

85
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,029
It's already packed full of your stuff.

86
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,532
And besides that, do you realize
that I have to transfer three times

87
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,701
-on the subway just to get to work?
-Right.

88
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,619
I didn't think of that.

89
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,790
Don't just spit things out,
think a little before you throw out ideas.

90
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,045
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,885
It took so long to hand over
the materials for the audit.

93
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,471
You said we should select
our rings together.

94
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,681
You know how it is for me.

95
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,600
It was hard for me to make time too.

96
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,810
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,857
Honey.

98
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,360
Is this color better, or this one?

99
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,571
Yes, they're both pretty.

100
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,573
But are you buying hanbok?

101
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,410
-What?
-When I told my coworkers that

102
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,538
I was going to shop for hanbok,
they said it's better to rent one

103
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,415
since we'll hardly wear it.

104
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,584
You really don't listen
to what I say, do you?

105
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,296
-What?
-I already said that

106
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,716
it'd be a waste of money to get a hanbok.
But your mom said it'd be better

107
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,928
to wear one when I greet the relatives,
so we decided on it, remember?

108
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,514
I do. I remember.

109
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,891
I'm sorry. I've just been
so busy with work lately.

110
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,351
That excuse again?

111
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,353
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,946
I'm on the brink of disaster.
I can't make any more mistakes.

113
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,843
I'm home!

114
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,761
Hey.

115
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,098
Did you open everything without me?

116
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,268
We went ahead
because we thought you'd be late.

117
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm sorry, Dad.

118
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,397
You should have come early
on a day like this.

119
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,442
The whole department had a meeting,
so I couldn't leave early.

120
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,112
I'm sorry, Honey. You did good.

121
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,785
What's all this?

122
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,871
Are these the wedding gifts?

123
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,040
You and your mom
must have worked so hard on this.

124
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,584
Right.

125
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,379
Everything you prepared is so sincere.

126
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,882
We're so grateful and overjoyed.

127
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,552
I better thank them properly
when we see them later.

128
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,220
I should call them later too.

129
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,847
Yes, of course you should.

130
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,682
Look at this.

131
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,853
She knew your father and I liked golfing.

132
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,523
She even gifted us matching golf outfits.

133
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,943
Na-eun, how can you be so sensible?

134
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,528
I knew it.

135
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,701
So, are you almost ready for the wedding?

136
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,705
Yes, once we find a house and move in
our furniture, it's basically finished.

137
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,625
Yes, your place is going to sell soon.

138
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,127
Now it's time to look
for your newlywed home.

139
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,923
Hey, your mom has been quite worried
about your place not selling.

140
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,217
We've been quite worried too.

141
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,719
We need the money from that house

142
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,681
so we can start to think about
where to look for a new home.

143
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,559
Gosh, are you really saying that
in front of your mom?

144
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,061
Thank you, Mom.

145
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,188
Thank you both.

146
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,484
You'll be busy going around
looking at houses and furniture.

147
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:50,279
Yes, we're pressed for time
so I'm worried.

148
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,990
But Jun-hyeong has a great sense
in decorating the house.

149
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,244
I do?

150
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,370
Yes.

151
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,414
Your place now is really pretty.

152
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,835
My mom did that for me.

153
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,965
Mother, so you were the talented one.

154
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,052
I always thought his place looked
sophisticated and had great decoration.

155
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,264
Honestly, I've never lived alone before.

156
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,267
I don't know anything
about interior design,

157
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,144
so I was going to ask Jun-hyeong to help.

158
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,355
I had no clue
that you did all of it for him.

159
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,357
You could help them out then.

160
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,821
Yes, that would be nice,
but I'm sure she is busy.

161
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,864
I can try asking my mom.

162
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,243
No, I'm sure your parents are even busier.

163
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,203
They have to run their office too.

164
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,163
You should help them.

165
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,958
Well, I'm happy to help them,

166
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,335
but is that okay with you, Na-eun?

167
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,381
Yes, I'd love it.

168
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:55,595
But can we go looking for furniture
after we find a house?

169
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,598
I need to know the size of the house
so that I can--

170
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,850
You shouldn't buy things all at once.

171
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,893
You should take time to look around

172
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,563
and get an idea
of what kind of interior you want.

173
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,567
I'll teach you how I do it,
so it'll be easy if you follow me.

174
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,362
Great. We were already so busy as is.

175
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,824
It'll save us a ton of time
if you help us. Right?

176
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,201
Yes, I guess we got lucky.

177
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,212
You're picking out your furniture
with your mother-in-law?

178
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,339
It just happened.

179
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,424
It's frustrating just thinking about it.

180
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,095
I don't mind going around with her
if it's for something else,

181
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,513
but this is for our home.

182
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,765
That's right.

183
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,976
If you go with his mom,
she's bound to interfere.

184
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,062
I won't be able to buy what I want,

185
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,564
and I'll regret it
every time I look at my furniture.

186
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,734
Then you'll blame Jun-hyeong
for creating this situation,

187
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,736
and then conflict will arise--

188
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,739
Hui-seon, that's not true.
You went too far.

189
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm not even married to Jun-hyeong yet.

190
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,451
Fine.

191
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,497
Anyway, everything Jun-hyeong does
has been bothering me lately.

192
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,458
It's been less than two weeks
since he promised he'd do better,

193
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,460
but he's always late because of work,

194
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,004
and now I have to go
furniture hunting with his mom?

195
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,927
I learned this foolproof trick
from a friend.

196
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,928
Should I teach you?

197
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,471
A foolproof trick?

198
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,099
Yes, not only for your mother-in-law,

199
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,395
but I heard it works on all the elders
who try to meddle in your affairs.

200
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,146
What is it?

201
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,857
Okay, Hui-seon, try to nag at me.

202
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,150
Nag?

203
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,404
Hey, what's with your clothes?

204
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,739
You're only dragging
your husband's name through the dirt.

205
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,325
Gosh, I can't let that happen.

206
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,785
What should I do, Mother?

207
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,372
Do you really not know?
Just wear something more proper.

208
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,832
Why are you so disheveled?

209
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,710
No. What should I do
to clean myself up, Mother?

210
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,380
What are you doing right now?

211
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,714
Are you kidding me?

212
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,383
I wasn't trying to kid around.

213
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:01,637
I can't believe you thought that.
What should I do, Mother?

214
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,433
Hey, you're getting on my nerves.
Stop it. Quit it.

215
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,351
This isn't foolproof,

216
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,895
it feels like she'd totally cut me off.

217
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,691
I can't let you get cut off.
What should I do, Na-eun?

218
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,986
Hui-seon.

219
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,614
I don't want to shop for furniture
with Jun-hyeong's mom. What should I do?

220
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,533
What should I do?

221
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,745
I hate it. I don't even want to
look at you two.

222
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,426
MOTHER

223
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,471
Na-eun, are you asleep?
I'm sorry for messaging you so late.

224
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,726
I looked up some living room interiors
that might suit your new home.

225
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,769
Look at them for reference.

226
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,737
This isn't my style though.

227
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,040
They're very pretty.

228
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,970
Are you out of your mind?

229
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,307
You idiot. Do you have
even a single thought in your head?

230
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,475
What did I do?

231
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,394
Going with your mom
to buy furniture for your newlywed home?

232
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,564
If you post it on the internet,
no one would believe it.

233
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,316
What are you talking about?

234
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,984
Hey, think about it.

235
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,947
Usually, we end up fighting with
our parents if we go shopping with them.

236
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,242
So who would want to go furniture
shopping with their mother-in-law?

237
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,868
Na-eun was okay with it, though.

238
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,995
Do you think she agreed
because she was okay?

239
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,456
You must think that every morning
when I say, "Good morning,"

240
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,708
I'm actually having a good morning.

241
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,711
Gosh, can't you read the room?
How are you that thoughtless?

242
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,590
So Na-eun had no choice
but to agree with it?

243
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,758
Yes!

244
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,301
But why?

245
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,305
It's not like my mom did that
to give her a hard time.

246
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,849
She just said she'd help
with furniture hunting.

247
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,601
It's because it's her mother-in-law.

248
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,771
Damn it. I fell for it again.

249
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:20,317
Anyway, you learning about life
through the internet is a problem.

250
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,277
What?

251
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,945
You think all mothers and daughters-in-law

252
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,073
go through the conflicts
you read about online?

253
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,324
But that's not true.

254
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,619
There are a lot of mothers-in-law
who get along with their daughters-in-law.

255
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,414
They just don't post about it
on the internet.

256
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,417
My mom and Na-eun get along so well.

257
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,210
They care for each other so much.

258
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,130
Jeez, he only sees what he wants to see.

259
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,342
These conflicts have years of history
for a reason.

260
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,011
That's not true for my family.

261
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,680
Don't compare us
to those ridiculous stories.

262
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,224
We're on a totally different level.

263
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,977
You're not going to get it
until it happens.

264
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,395
Hey, give me some shampoo.

265
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,107
Hey, buy your own.
You have plenty of money.

266
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,442
That one's mine, actually.

267
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,444
Is it yours?

268
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,989
Here, drink this.

269
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,992
I bought this
from my favorite coffee shop.

270
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,619
Thank you.

271
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,706
She's been making a fuss about
getting you that coffee all morning.

272
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,753
That's because it's delicious.
I want Na-eun to try it.

273
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,004
Try it.

274
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,715
It smells so good.

275
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,716
Right?

276
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,636
This cafe is good at roasting,
so even the smell is different.

277
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,096
Thank you.

278
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,556
Of course.

279
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,266
By the way, Na-eun,

280
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,103
you don't have to be so polite.

281
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,105
You can be comfortable around me.

282
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,899
Okay.

283
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,860
You look like
you're in a great mood today, Mom.

284
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,197
Honestly, I couldn't even sleep
last night.

285
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,742
I was so excited about the three of us
going out together like this

286
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,035
for the first time.

287
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,498
I was worried about
making sure I could be of help too.

288
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,752
It must've been like the night
before a school field trip.

289
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,008
My goodness.

290
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,680
This is how they sell beds these days.

291
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,266
It's nice, right? This place
comes up on social media a lot.

292
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,102
The world has gotten better.

293
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,981
Na-eun, the bed you saw is here, too?

294
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,066
Yes, this one.

295
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,236
-This one?
-Yes.

296
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,954
Goodness.

297
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,999
No, it's fine. Lie down.

298
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,044
You have to lie on the bed
to choose the one you like, of course.

299
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,383
I heard that many people buy Simmons beds
for their newlywed homes.

300
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,926
That's right.

301
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,387
And this model is on sale right now.

302
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,097
-On sale?
-Yes, ma'am.

303
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,266
It's our wedding promotion,

304
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,852
so we're giving mattress discounts
and other freebies.

305
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,856
And if you pay with Simmons Pay,
you can pay in 36-month installments.

306
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,315
That's nice.

307
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,153
So I found that
if you get all the benefits,

308
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:13,032
along with this mattress, frame,
and the headboard together--

309
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,491
Wait, Na-eun.

310
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,828
Would you let us have a word?

311
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,250
You don't want just the mattress,

312
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,503
but the full set
with the frame and the headboard?

313
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,338
Yes.

314
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,424
Goodness.

315
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,261
If you go with this headboard,
it won't be easy to take care of.

316
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:39,058
You won't have much time
after coming home from work,

317
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,601
will you be okay with that?

318
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,564
She's right.

319
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,109
Looking at it, it does seem like
it'd be hard to maintain.

320
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,486
Right.

321
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,238
You're not using your bed
for just a day or two.

322
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,449
If you keep in mind
that you might move later,

323
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,285
and have a baby someday,

324
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,622
wouldn't it be better to choose
something easy to manage?

325
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,501
I didn't think of that.

326
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,378
Beds and furniture last for a long time,

327
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,380
so you need to think about them carefully.

328
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,217
Yes, I'll think about it again.

329
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:18,013
Then, we'll go with this mattress,
and for the headboard…

330
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,181
How about this?

331
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,600
It looks easy to take care of.

332
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,185
It's pretty and neat.

333
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,855
-Can you tell us about this one?
-Yes, ma'am.

334
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,773
Okay.

335
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,946
How about this? Is this popular
among young people these days?

336
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,615
Yes, that's right.
This is our most popular product.

337
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,076
What?

338
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,370
Did I do something wrong again?

339
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,499
Honey, have you ever gone shopping
with your boss?

340
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,917
All of a sudden?

341
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,920
Have you ever gone shopping
with your department head?

342
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,965
Why would I go shopping
with my department head?

343
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,636
Because they can help you
with their insight and experience.

344
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,389
No, why are you suddenly…

345
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,688
Are you talking about my mom?

346
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,400
Wouldn't it be so nice
to go shopping with a boss

347
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,110
whose favor you'd want to win over?

348
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,655
They can help you
and change your preferences too.

349
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,203
We need to go look for houses next week.

350
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,622
We still have to choose
our wedding invitations,

351
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,374
then there's the wedding shoot too.

352
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,085
I don't have any time and I'm in a hurry,

353
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,172
but going shopping with my boss
must be great, right?

354
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,674
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,552
Do better, okay?

356
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,387
Okay.

357
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,809
We can check home appliances on our own.

358
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,978
It'd be nice to look around
since we're here.

359
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:52,232
Na-eun, you shouldn't buy
all your appliances all at once.

360
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,737
You can save money by looking around
at different shops and comparing prices.

361
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,821
Yes.

362
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,325
So I'm planning to visit several different
department stores and outlets.

363
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,535
She's so smart.

364
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,663
Did you make a list of appliances to get?

365
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,581
Yes.

366
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,500
I wrote down a few things at home.

367
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,130
Television, air conditioner,
AirDresser, refrigerator,

368
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,634
robot vacuum, washing machine,
dryer, dishwasher…

369
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,551
Hold on.

370
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,055
Did you just say dishwasher?

371
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:27,726
Yes, nowadays they say
you can't live without a dishwasher,

372
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,687
a robot vacuum, and a dryer.

373
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,606
Then we should buy them.

374
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,567
In my opinion,

375
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,738
I think it'd be better to buy a dishwasher
after buying a house.

376
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:45,535
You're going to be leasing your home,
not buying it.

377
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,871
If you put a dishwasher
into a leased home,

378
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,791
it might cause a problem
with your landlord.

379
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:51,917
Come on.

380
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,878
We can talk to them about it
so there's no problem.

381
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,630
Or we could buy a standing dishwasher.

382
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,882
It sounds troublesome though.

383
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,761
Just how many dishes
can a newlywed couple make?

384
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:07,683
How about we buy the dishwasher later?

385
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,316
But I'd like to buy one now.
What should I do?

386
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,864
If you want to buy it, you should.

387
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,000
That's right, Na-eun.

388
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,878
I think a kimchi refrigerator
was missing from your list earlier.

389
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,381
At first, I did consider buying one,

390
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,759
but after giving it thought,
it'll be just Jun-hyeong and me,

391
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,554
so I didn't think we needed one
and crossed it off the list.

392
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,308
You need a kimchi refrigerator
even if it's just the two of you.

393
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,895
There's a huge difference between
putting kimchi in a regular refrigerator

394
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,647
and putting it in a kimchi refrigerator.

395
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,650
We don't eat enough kimchi
to justify getting one.

396
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,570
Do you think you only put kimchi
in a kimchi refrigerator?

397
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,948
If you put fruits and vegetables in it,
it keeps them crisp and tasty.

398
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:09,661
And storing beer in them
makes them taste so refreshing.

399
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,586
Mom, we'll buy it if we need it.

400
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,088
As you said, we might have to
move around a lot.

401
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,882
There's no need to add more baggage.

402
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,051
Why don't you reduce it elsewhere?

403
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,054
A kimchi refrigerator
won't take up that much space.

404
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,518
Na-eun, I'll buy you a small one
that doesn't take up too much space.

405
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,687
Make sure to use it, okay?

406
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,776
I don't want to buy one, though.
What should I do?

407
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,613
Na-eun, you…

408
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,698
The way you're talking…

409
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm sorry. I was speaking strangely,
wasn't I?

410
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,247
No.

411
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,334
It wasn't strange. Do you think so, Mom?

412
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,962
Of course, not.

413
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,717
I guess I just took it the wrong way.

414
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,197
Is there a smaller one?

415
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,907
There should be.

416
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,910
I'll take this call really quickly.

417
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,161
-Okay, sure.
-Okay.

418
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,084
Mom, stop looking at
the kimchi refrigerators.

419
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,627
Why are you so stuck on them?

420
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,048
I'm not. I'm just telling you that
you're going to need one eventually.

421
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,842
We can just buy kimchi when we need it.

422
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,095
Why would you buy kimchi?

423
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,515
I'll make you kimchi every year,
so take it and eat it.

424
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,767
Goodness, we're okay.

425
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,435
We can just buy kimchi.

426
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,396
There's no need to make them yourself.

427
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,316
Are you worried
I'll call Na-eun to help make it?

428
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,779
Why are you saying it like that?
I'm just worried it will tire you.

429
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,408
And I haven't had a hard time
doing it all these years?

430
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:15,620
Gosh, you've never even
helped me marinate the cabbage.

431
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,372
I can see right through you.

432
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,541
Buy a kimchi refrigerator,
I'll buy it for you/

433
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,960
Why are you doing this?

434
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,087
What did I do?

435
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:28,675
We don't need it,
but you're forcing your preferences on us.

436
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,135
You're nitpicking how Na-eun talks,

437
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,138
telling us "Buy this. Don't buy that."
Picking fights.

438
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,433
Nitpicking?

439
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,226
Picking fights?

440
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,606
-Mom.
-I'm sending my son off to get married,

441
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,776
and trying to do everything I can do
to help you out, but what did you say?

442
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,571
Mom, what I meant was

443
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:54,868
that all we were looking for today
was advice on how to decorate the house.

444
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,246
We weren't trying to ask your permission
to buy something or not.

445
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,666
But you trying to dictate
what we should buy makes us uncomfortable.

446
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,543
And do you think I feel comfortable?

447
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,922
I'm trying my best
not to make you two feel uncomfortable.

448
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,632
Since we're going to be a family,

449
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,134
I'm trying to make sure
we get along with each other.

450
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,387
I'm doing all of this, but what?
I'm picking fights?

451
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,098
Mom, I'll take it back. I made a mistake.

452
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,143
No, you didn't.
That's what you really think.

453
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,939
They say that raising a son is no use.

454
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,650
You shouldn't treat your mother this way.

455
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,860
Mom, I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

456
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,656
We can just get a kimchi refrigerator
that you…

457
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,173
It seems like I tagged along
when I shouldn't have.

458
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,052
I'll leave first.
You two keep looking around.

459
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,555
Mom!

460
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,641
I'll call you back later.

461
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,357
Mom, you can't just leave like this.

462
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,526
What's wrong, Mother?

463
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,528
Are you upset with me?

464
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,738
If it's because of how I talked…

465
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,906
It's not.

466
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,451
Na-eun, I'm just
suddenly feeling very dizzy.

467
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,955
If you feel dizzy, we should
drive you back in Jun-hyeong's car.

468
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,958
No, it'll be quick if I take a taxi.

469
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,629
It would've been better
if it had been just the two of you.

470
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,840
I came here for no reason

471
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,967
and made everyone uncomfortable.

472
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,136
I feel so bad.

473
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,847
I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.

474
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,850
If you feel dizzy,
should we go together to the hospital?

475
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,477
No, it's not that bad.

476
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,647
I just need to go home
and lie down for a while.

477
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,650
Well, don't worry about me.
Just go in and finish up.

478
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,112
How can we not worry
when you're leaving like this?

479
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,574
I'm fine.

480
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,703
Buy Na-eun something to eat,
finish up, and come home.

481
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,123
No, let's all go home together instead.

482
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,376
No, it's okay.
Go back inside and look around.

483
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,220
What should we do?

484
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,765
Jun-hyeong, let's go after her.

485
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,438
No, let's go check out the bed
from earlier.

486
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,441
-How can we do that in this situation?
-It's fine.

487
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,818
I'll go resolve things with her later.

488
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,445
Let's go.

489
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,327
Are you okay?

490
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,011
The person you have called
cannot be reached. Please leave a--

491
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,436
Do you like that one?

492
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,563
Yes, it's nice.

493
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,857
What?

494
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,693
I'm okay with everything,
so choose what you like.

495
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,780
We're both going to use it,
so we should buy one we both like.

496
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,911
Then should we go with the set
that you've been looking at?

497
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,870
Jun-hyeong.

498
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,167
If you're worried about your mom,
let's go home.

499
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,211
I said it's fine.

500
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,548
You're looking and acting like
you're not, though.

501
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,591
Why are you being stubborn?

502
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,093
You said we don't have time.

503
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,847
Are you doing this because of what I said?

504
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,225
Not necessarily.

505
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,936
It's true that we don't have much time.

506
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,189
If you really think that,
look around seriously.

507
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,233
You're being so wishy-washy.

508
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,526
I'm sorry.

509
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,529
I really don't know what I should do.

510
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,323
If I just go follow her, we lose time.

511
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,827
But if I stay here, I'll feel bad.

512
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,040
What would you do
if your mom left like that?

513
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,418
I wouldn't have created
this situation to begin with.

514
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,463
"This situation?"

515
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,173
As I said before,

516
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,050
the uncomfortable situation
of having to shop with your boss.

517
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,553
Then you should've said that
in the beginning.

518
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:28,016
How can I say that
right in front of your parents?

519
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,897
Honestly, I couldn't even sleep
last night.

520
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,066
I was so excited about the three of us
going out together like this

521
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,777
for the first time.

522
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,906
I was worried about making sure
I could be of help, too.

523
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,743
What is it that's bothering you so much?

524
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,207
Mom is doing her best to treat you well.

525
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,463
I'm not uncomfortable with your mom,
I'm uncomfortable with this situation.

526
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,341
I'm choosing the home appliances
that you and I will be using

527
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,676
but I'm forced
to prioritize her preferences!

528
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,470
-Na-eun.
-Forget it, just go!

529
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,601
I can't do anything
while feeling like this.

530
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,937
Go home and try to fix things
with your mom.

531
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,940
I'll figure out the furniture on my own.

532
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,400
Hey, Kim Na-eun.

533
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,152
Na-eun!

534
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,337
He doesn't even come to stop me.

535
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,887
That's why you came here?

536
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,598
Am I your third choice? Jeez.

537
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,686
I can't believe this is all
because of a kimchi fridge.

538
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:58,022
Gosh, you didn't even listen to me
when I tried to stop you.

539
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,691
I didn't see this coming.

540
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,485
I thought Na-eun and my mom
would be different.

541
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,781
Forget it. Don't get married.
Just live alone.

542
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:12,120
Hey, you idiot! Weren't you going around

543
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,539
talking about how she's the one?
And now you're…

544
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,209
I still like Na-eun.

545
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,878
I miss her even now.

546
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,005
But I'm not going to go see her. Why?

547
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,841
We'll fight again if I do.
I'm tired of apologizing.

548
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,261
You really must be upset.

549
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,516
I don't know what to do.
It's driving me crazy.

550
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,728
No matter what I do,
the situation keeps getting worse.

551
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,063
If I apologize,
she's mad at me for apologizing.

552
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,690
It's driving me nuts.

553
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,317
Gosh.

554
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,736
I'm still jealous of you.

555
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,905
Of what?

556
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,782
You're getting ready for a wedding.

557
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,786
Then you and Hui-seon should date.

558
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,122
Hey, why…

559
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,957
Why are you suddenly bringing her up?

560
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,418
Just because.

561
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,505
Seeing how you're making fun of me,
you must be okay.

562
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,763
Well, did Hui-seon talk about me?

563
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,767
What did she say? Did she say something?

564
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,894
She didn't talk about you.

565
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,188
She talked about what you told her.

566
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,940
What?

567
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,192
At first, I thought
Hui-seon was telepathic,

568
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,111
but I realized you must have told her
after I thought about it.

569
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,325
What are you talking about?
Tell me the full story.

570
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,622
Are you a human messenger pigeon?
Why do you go around and talk so much?

571
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,332
Why can't you keep a secret?

572
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,960
I have to bring those things up
so that she'll see me.

573
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,922
You're so shameless
after selling out your friend.

574
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,343
The night
the wedding gifts were delivered,

575
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,095
was it you who came to pick her up?

576
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,807
That night?

577
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,558
It wasn't me.

578
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,938
Hey, what was that about?
Did someone go pick up Hui-seon?

579
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,523
I wasn't the one who saw it,

580
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,152
Su-yeon said she saw Hui-seon
get in another man's car that night.

581
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,863
What's with this woman?

582
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,156
She had another man?

583
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,783
No way.

584
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,495
Seriously. She said she wouldn't date
anyone less than on Jung Woo-sung's level.

585
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,539
Women are all the same.

586
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,210
Shit, could she actually be
dating Jung Woo-sung?

587
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,134
I don't think I'll stand a chance then.

588
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,303
But I still have the looks and money…

589
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,288
Dad, give me a call.

590
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,876
I want to check if my phone is broken.

591
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,295
We did this earlier already.

592
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,381
But why isn't Jun-hyeong calling me?

593
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,133
He's the one who's in the wrong.

594
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,261
He must be too ashamed to call you.

595
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,638
Just let it slide.

596
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,016
He didn't even apologize.
How can I do that?

597
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,977
What's the point of hearing his apologies?

598
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,605
Do you get an extra apology
for every ten apologies he makes?

599
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,647
Dad…

600
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,401
People will say sorry and then turn around
and do something wrong again.

601
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,278
So just let it slide sometimes.

602
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,698
If a married couple fights too often,
they can't last that long.

603
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,658
We're not even married yet.

604
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,078
If he did something wrong,
he should apologize.

605
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,039
When Jun-hyeong apologizes,
do you feel better?

606
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,543
I'll do my best.

607
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,213
I'm sorry.

608
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,715
I'm sorry.

609
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,927
I'm sorry.

610
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,513
No.

611
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,809
I feel worse because it makes me
feel like I'm a bad person.

612
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,788
Did you have dinner?

613
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,289
Get out.

614
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,091
I'm the one who needs meditation.

615
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,928
I'm also the one
who needs self-reflection.

616
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,139
I'm the one who committed a sin.

617
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,891
Seo Jun-hyeong.

618
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,937
Please let me be born as a soccer ball
in my next life.

619
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,481
A soccer ball?

620
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:55,444
So that I can endure it
when I get kicked around by people.

621
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,114
Namo Amitabha.

622
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,449
Gosh.

623
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,496
Please let me be born as a soccer ball

624
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,790
so that I don't get blamed
for not being able to read the room.

625
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,709
Gosh, stop with the nonsense.

626
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,796
How bad do you think I feel
to say such things, Mom?

627
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,722
You feel bad because of me,
Na-eun feels bad because of me,

628
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,807
and I also hate myself.

629
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,935
In my next life,
I want to be born as a soccer ball

630
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,271
and live without worries.

631
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,900
If you're here to ask for forgiveness,
just ask for it.

632
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,068
Are you going to forgive me?

633
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,117
Mom.

634
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,785
I'm really sorry.

635
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,914
I won't say something like that again,
so please cut me some slack.

636
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,250
I'm so sick and tired of
hearing your apologies.

637
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,711
Gosh, I'm sick of saying it too.

638
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,673
At this point, I say it so much
I feel like I'm a broken record.

639
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,261
Who do you apologize to so much?

640
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,473
Is it Na-eun?

641
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,934
No.

642
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,894
At my workplace.

643
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,563
Things are not looking
too good these days.

644
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,690
Hey.

645
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,152
This is the last time
I'm letting it slide.

646
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,321
There won't be a next time.

647
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,157
As expected, my mom is the best.

648
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,327
Thank you.

649
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,870
Goodness.

650
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,956
You're so sly.

651
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:30,915
Jeez.

652
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,084
Did the furniture hunt go well?

653
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,212
Do you think we could
look at furniture in that situation?

654
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,507
You don't have time,
you should have looked around!

655
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,220
What did Na-eun say?

656
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,015
Of course, she told me to
go and cheer you up.

657
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,559
She wanted to come here together,

658
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,896
but I came alone
because I didn't want her to see me beg.

659
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,526
Don't do things that make you have to beg.
You're going to be the head of the family!

660
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,988
You're right.

661
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,533
I don't know if I can
be the head of the family.

662
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,163
Marriage is hard.

663
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,183
How lucky is Na-eun
to have a mother-in-law

664
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,936
who micromanages her so meticulously?

665
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,688
"Micromanage?"

666
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,649
Why don't we consider buying it?

667
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,109
Are you saying we should buy this place?

668
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,861
Jun-hyeong, you've heard that

669
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,196
housing prices in Seoul
are at their cheapest today, right?

670
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,490
Na-eun, you've heard
housing prices in Seoul

671
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,742
are at their highest now, right?

672
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,077
And who's the person
who created this situation

673
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,038
after what happened
at the furniture store?

674
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,622
Here we go again.

675
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,255
