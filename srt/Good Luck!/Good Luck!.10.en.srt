1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,240
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,780
It's pretty.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,950
(Lottery Ticket)

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,950
Zero, two, zero, three.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,450
(Episode 10)

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,760
Thanks, honey.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,930
And...

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,330
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,700
Why are you crying like a fool?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,110
I'm really...

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,440
fine with this.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,280
Eleven.

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,280
Sixteen.

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,620
Nineteen.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Twenty.

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,850
What is this?

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,990
I can't believe this.

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,630
I mean, he took me to the motel...

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,360
just so he could use the restroom?
It makes no sense.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,670
Is there something wrong with him?

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,940
Just wait and see.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,640
I will be sure to make him mine.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,310
Darling.

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,950
When can I see you again?

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,550
- What?
- I want to see you again.

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,980
When will you be free next?

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,090
You said your grandma was ill.

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,260
Do you have time
to be out and about like this?

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,860
Well, she is ill,

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,390
but what can I do? I'll miss you.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,500
Whatever.

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,800
Here. Punch in your bank account number.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,340
My bank account number?

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,810
Why do you want my account number?

35
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,610
Don't ask.

36
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,050
Just do it.

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,980
Darling.

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,490
I didn't know you cared so much about me.

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,530
- Here.
- Hold on.

40
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,040
Oh, here.

41
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,470
There.

42
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,310
Darling, did you really send me money?

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,980
Check it yourself.

44
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,520
Okay.

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,690
Oh, here. How much is this?

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,630
Fifteen dollars?

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,000
What is this, darling?

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,700
Fifteen dollars?

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,500
Did you perhaps forget
to punch in a few zeroes?

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,640
Earlier, I spent 30 dollars
on your credit card...

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,270
to get gas for my car
because of the discount.

52
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,470
So, I sent you half of that.

53
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,970
Fifteen dollars.

54
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,010
What?

55
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,210
Are you saying...

56
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,280
we're splitting gas money?

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,850
That's right!

58
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,890
I did all the driving,
so I should only pay a third of it,

59
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,460
but I'm being generous,

60
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,930
knowing that your grandmother is ill.

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,590
What? "Generous?"

62
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,000
I paid for the ramyeon and the coffee too.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,100
I never asked you to.

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,770
Also, I didn't even touch the ramyeon.

65
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,570
As for the coffee,

66
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,940
it upset my stomach,

67
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,640
so I had to run to the restroom earlier.

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,710
Why? Got a problem with it?

69
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,820
Oh, the signal changed.

70
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,860
I'll make a right and drop you off
in front of the crosswalk over there.

71
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,960
Take the bus home from there.

72
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,730
I don't care. Do whatever you want.

73
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Oh, dear!

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,740
- Oh, gosh. What was that? Darn it.
- Goodness, what did you do?

75
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,310
Gosh, my neck.

76
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,910
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

77
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,140
- Oh, dear.
- Are you all right?

78
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,550
- Goodness.
- Did he get hit by that car?

79
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,350
What's wrong with you?

80
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,020
You can't cut in front of me like that.

81
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,590
- I think he hit that man.
- I know.

82
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,590
- Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
- Is he badly hurt?

83
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,190
I thought the light was green.

84
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Oh, my.

85
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,830
Gosh, my car was scratched.

86
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,130
What will you do about this?

87
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,700
What do you mean, what will he do?

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,600
Just let your insurance company
take care of things.

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,200
Insurance, my foot!

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,110
I won't do any such thing.
How do I trust those people with my money?

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,040
Good grief.

92
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,880
Give me money to fix my car.

93
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,710
Money to fix your car?

94
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,120
It'll probably cost me
hundreds of dollars from the looks of it.

95
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,060
Darn it. Just give me a hundred dollars.

96
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,290
I went easy on you.

97
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,330
What? I worked all day today...

98
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,160
and only made five dollars.

99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,930
Even if I work myself
to the bone all month,

100
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,500
it'll be less than 30 dollars. Oh, dear.

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,840
Look here, man.
You must not get what's going on here.

102
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,410
- You.
- Record a video.

103
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,540
- You crossed on a red light, didn't you?
- What is he doing?

104
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,350
- Should we see whose side the law is on?
- What's with him?

105
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,410
- It's not that. I was just...
- Hey.

106
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,020
Let's just go, darling.

107
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,750
What money would this old man have?

108
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,320
As if he doesn't have any money.

109
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,290
He says he has five dollars.

110
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,320
Are you seriously thinking
of taking that from him?

111
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,790
Yes.

112
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,430
- Gosh, what...
- Come on.

113
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,860
- But... What are you...
- Come here.

114
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,170
- That's...
- Stay still.

115
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,770
But that's...

116
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,770
- all the money I earned today.
- What is that man doing?

117
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,210
Is he serious? Isn't that too harsh?

118
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,740
That's exactly five dollars.

119
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,840
Without this money...

120
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,510
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

121
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,820
I'll have to starve!

122
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,420
- Be quiet!
- Oh, dear.

123
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,450
You're making such a fuss.

124
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll give you an extra dollar.

125
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,830
Here. That's enough, right?

126
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,460
I won't even get to eat!

127
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,500
- Darling, will you really take this?
- Oh, my!

128
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,730
I'll wire you three dollars.

129
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,070
Let's just give this back to him!

130
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,040
Let go of me!

131
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,200
- Should we call the police?
- Do you think...

132
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,640
my money just grows on trees?

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,940
May the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion
be with you.

134
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,810
Please have mercy on this poor soul.

135
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
What?

136
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,490
Who are you people?

137
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,250
If you have time to film this stuff,

138
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,920
you should just go
and make some money instead!

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,490
Don't you know the phrase,
"Guilty of being poor?"

140
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,160
Not having money is a crime!

141
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,530
Who are you to lecture someone
over three measly dollars?

142
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,600
- Darn you!
- Oh, my.

143
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,830
Aren't you being too mean
to a helpless man?

144
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,870
- He almost hit that guy.
- What?

145
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,440
Why is he doing that
over a mere three dollars?

146
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,410
- What's wrong with him?
- I know, right?

147
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,740
He must be crazy.

148
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
You don't have a job, do you?

149
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,410
My goodness.

150
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,450
- Hey, if you have time to film this,
- My gosh. What should we do?

151
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,050
go and make money,
you useless waste of space!

152
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,090
My goodness.

153
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,230
This is it. The new crypto mining machine.

154
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,900
Gosh, this is nice.

155
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,970
Hey, thank you so much
for letting me in on this.

156
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,970
Don't mention it.

157
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,400
By the way,
how did you come up with the money?

158
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Did your father give you money?

159
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,310
No, not exactly.

160
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,610
They say wishes come true
if you wish hard enough.

161
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,840
I found a way somehow.

162
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,380
I'll make money soon
to become successful like you.

163
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,450
Okay, make money and become rich soon.

164
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,650
Yes, I will. For sure.

165
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,350
Yes.

166
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,060
I started my business.

167
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,930
The money? I borrowed it.

168
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, I came across a pushover
to lend me 30,000 dollars.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,030
So, I invested it with my buddy. Right.

170
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,870
Yes, okay. Let's meet up sometime soon.
I'll invite you.

171
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,710
Okay. Bye.

172
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,480
Where did you invest my 30,000 dollars?

173
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,580
Gosh, you startled me.

174
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,910
Hey, why are you eavesdropping
on other people's phone calls?

175
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,350
Tell me.

176
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,320
Where did you invest my 30,000 dollars?

177
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,790
Why should I tell you that?

178
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,990
Our contract doesn't mention
anything like that.

179
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,190
All I have to do is repay you
in two months.

180
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,930
Even if you lose all my money,

181
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,230
you have to guarantee me the principal.
You know that, right?

182

such unlucky stuff like that?

Will you keep using violence like this?

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,220
This happened because you bit me.

192
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,990
What?

193
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,290
Why would she bite you?

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,730

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,370
Of course, I do.

199
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,100
Why wouldn't I know her?

200
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,840
It doesn't seem like you just know her.

201

Tell me.
What's going on between the two of you?

202
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,910
That's weird.

203

1,000 dollars for living expenses.

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,320
Today at work...

357
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,060
Forget it. Let's talk at home.

358
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,590
Why? What happened?

359
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,460
Nothing. Let's talk later.

360
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
What?

361
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,240
Why didn't I just bite my tongue
at that moment?

362
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,670
I don't own that district.

363
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Why did I let myself get fired
by being so proud?

364
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,510
Gosh, whatever.

365
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,180
(Children, elderly people, pregnant women
must be careful when using the escalator.)

366
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
What?

367
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,960
What's he doing here?

368
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,060
No way.

369
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,930
Why would he be here at this time of day?

370
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,840
I'm so upset that I'm seeing things.

371
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,910
I should eat some good food
and pull myself together.

372
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,380
(Premium Braised Short Ribs)

373
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,010
Did something happen, Tae Hyung?

374
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,150
I couldn't reach you for a few days,
so I was worried.

375
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,950
What?

376
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,350
Oh, right.

377
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,690
I tagged along on my dad's work trip,
so I was busy.

378
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,820
That's why I couldn't call you.

379
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,290
Did you wait for my call?

380
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,230
Well, kind of.

381
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,830
So? Did the work trip go well?

382
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,300
Yes, thanks for asking.

383
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,630
Right, I brought you a gift.

384
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,540
What is it?

385
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,540
It's from Russia.

386
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,510
Oh, my. Thanks, Tae Hyung. It's so pretty.

387
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,410
You think it's pretty? You're prettier.

388
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,620
Oh, come on.

389
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
About Seo Woo.

390
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,760
Just pretend not to know
about my wedding in front of her.

391
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,030
Sorry.

392
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
- I'll be right back. I have to take this.
- Sure.

393
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
All right.

394
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,940
Let me ask you something.

395
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,180
You seem like the type
who'd know a lot of men.

396
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,110
Why do you like Tae Hyung?

397
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,810
Because he's cool.

398
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,080
He's stylish, and he has a nice car.

399
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,650
Do you know how jealous women look
when they see me with him?

400
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,290
And when the girls in my department
find out that I'm dating him,

401
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,390
they'd probably die of jealousy.

402
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,200
So, that's it?

403
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,900
Yes. Why?

404
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,400
Do I need another reason?

405
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
No.

406
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,140
You two suit each other.

407
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,080
My gosh. Really?

408
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,910
The truth is,

409
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,120
I didn't think
Tae Hyung would fall for me so easily.

410
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,220
Of course,

411
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,990
I can make any guy fall for me
when I set my mind to it.

412
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,820
What am I saying now?

413
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,330
Anyway, eat up, neighbor.

414
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,670
- What?
- No, go away.

415
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,070
- My goodness.
- Oh, boy.

416
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,610
Who left this here?

417
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,940
My gosh. Isn't he that man?
The three dollars.

418
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,540
- Oh, it's him!
- Three dollars? My goodness.

419
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,410
Sir, nothing was deposited
into your account today.

420
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
What?

421
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,820
- No deposit was made?
- That's right.

422
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
What?

423
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,630
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

424
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,200
Please leave a message after the tone.

425
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
What?

426
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,770
Hey, it's me.

427
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,240
Why aren't you answering your phone?

428
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,970
Didn't you say
the money would be deposited today?

429
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,370
How come I haven't received it yet?

430
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,980
Call me as soon as you get this message.

431
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,450
(Your interest payment is due
on May 2, 2025.)

432
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,220
I have all these expenses.

433
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,890
Yes, Gwang Sik is doing well
at his new job,

434
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,230
so we can get through this.

435
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,430
I should try to be positive.

436
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,640
- What?
- Hey, Mom.

437
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,300
Mi Jin isn't home yet, right?

438
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,210
Yes.

439
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,710
I'm coming home now.

440
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,980
It's fine.
I'll just say I left work early today.

441
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,510
Mom!

442
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,210
How would Mi Jin know that I got fired?

443
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Yes.

444
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,250
Mi Jin has no idea now.

445
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,260
Just be careful
so she won't find out, Mom.

446
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,390
Yes, I'm coming now.

447
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,330
Heat up the kimchi stew for me.
I'm hungry.

448
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
All right.

449
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,940
Hey, you're home.

450
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,210
What about Gwang Sik? Where is he now?

451
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,010
Oh, honey. You're home early today.

452
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,080
You're home early too.

453
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,380
I wasn't feeling too well,

454
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,490
so I left the office early today.

455
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,320
Why do you look so upset?
Did something happen?

456
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,890
- You left work early?
- Well...

457
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,890
I guess what I had for lunch
wasn't sitting right.

458
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,530
I suddenly felt like
I was coming down with something.

459
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,730
I wanted to stay and keep working,

460
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,830
but my manager kept telling me to go home,

461
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,130
so I came home early.

462
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,530
- Is that so?
- Yes.

463
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm so grateful.
I should thank your manager.

464
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Hey, there's no need.

465
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,410
Hello, I've reached Sabi Corporation's
accounting department, right?

466
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,010
May I speak to the manager?

467
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,340
Hey, give me that.

468
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,510
Honey, have you lost your mind?

469
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,680
Why would you suddenly call
my office like that?

470
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,420
Do you think I'm lying that I'm sick
when I'm not sick at all?

471
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,520
No! I think you're lying to me
that you still have the job...

472
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
when you got fired! Why?

473
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,130
Well, honey. It's not like that.

474
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,290
Why? Are you going to lie again?

475
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,400
Don't even bother.
I already called your office and checked.

476
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,970
I must say, you're a good actor.

477
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,070
You should've been an actor.

478
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,540
What? Your manager sent you home?

479
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,670
- You left work early? Darn you.
- Hey, it hurts.

480
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,010
What's with you? Hold on.

481
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,140
- Mom! Do something.
- Goodness.

482
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,810
Shut it. Mi Jin!

483
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,310
What are you doing
in front of your mother-in-law?

484
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,350
I'm so disappointed in you too, Mother.

485
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,250
As his mother,
you should've advised him not to lie.

486
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,860
How could you team up with him
and deceive me?

487
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,190
I get that you wanted
to take your son's side,

488
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,160
but this is unacceptable.

489
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,370
Let's talk in our room.

490
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,010
Why did you have to let things
get out of hand like this?

491
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,710
- Mom, I'm so scared. Help me, Mom.
- Gosh, you fool.

492
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,310
What are you going to do now?
What will you do?

493
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,280
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

494
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,480
I got fired too.

495
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,650
How are we going to make ends meet now?

496
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,320
What? You got fired?

497
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
But why?

498
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,190
Why?

499
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,090
You can't be in this situation too.

500
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,230
How could you quit without a plan?

501
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,860
You should've held out, no matter what.

502
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,060
You should've held out
like your life depended on it!

503
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,600
How could you say that to me?

504
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,800
- I mean, I'm also...
- What about you?

505
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,370
Have you ever brought home a paycheck?

506
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,770
You always get fired in less than a month
wherever you go!

507
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,170
How many years has it been...

508
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,540
since I became the breadwinner
because of my incompetent husband?

509
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,350
I know that, but...

510
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,080
Honey, what are you doing?

511
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,520
What are you doing right now?

512
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,760
My gosh. Don't do this, honey.

513
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,260
Get off me! I can't live with you anymore.

514
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,500
Honey, please hear me out.

515
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
- Mi Jin.
- Mom!

516
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
- Wait.
- I'm really sorry.

517
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,110
- Honey.
- Mom!

518
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,110
Honey...

519
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Mom.

520
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,850
(Jackpot Chicken)

521
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,620
Honey, what is that?

522
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,720
(Lottery Ticket)

523
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,820
My goodness.

524
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,290
Why did you buy so many lottery tickets?

525
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,360
Honey.

526
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,090
We decided to let it go.

527
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,400
I saw my late mother in my dream.

528
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,130
My mother told me
that she'd make me happy.

529
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Seeing how vividly
I can still remember it,

530
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,170
it must not be an ordinary dream.

531
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,870
We can give up on the lost lottery ticket,

532
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,310
but I'm sure I still have luck on my side.

533
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,880
That's why I bought these.

534
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,250
Gosh, honey.

535
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,150
Grandma.

536
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,220
Oh, my grandbaby.

537
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
Mi Jin.

538
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,650
What brings you here at this hour?

539
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,060
Mom.

540
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Oh, my.

541
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,290
What is it?

542
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,630
What's wrong?

543
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,500
Did something happen?

544
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,670
But still, how could you leave home?

545
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,340
It's not like
it's just your husband at home.

546
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,640
Your mother-in-law is there too.

547
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,610
How could a daughter-in-law leave home...

548
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,940
just like that?

549
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,640
Get up. Hurry!

550
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,450
No, I'm not going back.

551
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,950
You guys should take care
of your own problems.

552
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,250
Don't you know that
this only reflects badly on you?

553
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,450
Who will think badly of me? Mother?

554
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,620
My mother-in-law who schemed with her son
to fool her daughter-in-law?

555
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,960
How could she?

556
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,260
Come on. She didn't fool you.

557
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,900
All parents have soft spots
for their kids.

558
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm sure she had no choice
but to go along with it.

559
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,500
Oh, whatever.

560
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,970
I can't stand
to even look at Heo Gwang Sik.

561
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,200
How could he totally fool me like that?

562
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,970
Had I known,

563
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,110
I wouldn't have quit my job.

564
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,210
You quit your job? But why?

565
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,510
I don't know!

566
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,380
Seriously, what's wrong with my life?

567
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,290
I always put my siblings first as a kid
since I was the eldest.

568
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,820
And as an adult, I met the wrong man...

569
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,260
and only suffered.

570
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,420
What in the world is wrong with my life?

571
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,330
Since you're here,

572
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,260
you should sleep here
and go home tomorrow.

573
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,500
Let her get some rest.

574
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,770
Come with me.

575
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Goodness.

576
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,020
Gosh, my dear Ji Woo.
Are you doing origami?

577
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,520
Yes, Grandpa.

578
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,620
I did a good job, didn't I?

579
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,490
Ji Woo, you can't...

580
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,960
do origami with this.

581
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,830
Why? I did it last time.

582
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,170
What? Where?

583
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,470
On your birthday.

584
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,480
I made a fortune teller
with the same kind of paper.

585
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
With this?

586
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,650
(Lottery Ticket)

587
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,780
Dad, when are we going
to Grandpa's birthday party?

588
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,790
Oh, wait a minute.

589
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,320
Grandma has to talk to Mom
about something.

590
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,960
She'll call us when they're done.

591
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,860
Gosh, seriously.

592
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,530
I'm bored.

593
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,960
I want to do origami.

594
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,860
A brand manager!

595
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,770
Dad, can I use this paper?

596
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,030
Oh, sure.

597
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,010
Hurry, sweetie!
There's so much good food here!

598
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,510
Oh, my! You're such a funny guy!

599
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,960
But the numbers are different.

600
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,260
Two, three.

601
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,630
It was something like that.

602
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,200
Ji Woo, where is that paper now?

603
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,100
- What?
- Where is that paper now?

604
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,010
Is it here? Or did you take it home?

605
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,580
You didn't throw it out, did you?

606
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,450
What's wrong, Grandpa?

607
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,810
You're scaring me.

608
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,450
I'm sorry, Ji Woo.

609
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,890
Grandpa was just so surprised. That's all.

610
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,260
I've been looking for that piece of paper.

611
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,260
Perhaps...

612
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,160
(Lottery Ticket)

613
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,260
Could you tell me where it is?

614
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,570
(Lottery Ticket)

615
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,110
(Good Luck!)

616
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,420
- I bet he's feeling the burn now.
- What's going on?

617
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,890
Isn't this a lottery ticket?

618
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,550
Oh, it's right.

619
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,720
Just wait until I catch them!

620
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,490
Why did you go to the restaurant
early in the morning?

621
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,490
What?

622
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,660
It wasn't just a piece of paper.
It was a lottery ticket.

623
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,800
