1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,210
Is it true?

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,810
Is it really true
that you won the lottery...

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,420
with my ticket?

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,890
It's true.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,000
You said you bought that lottery ticket
with automated random numbers.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,530
Then, did you...

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,670
lie to me?

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,540
Tell me.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,280
Say it!

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,110
Just say something!

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,410
Say it!

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,280
Yes, it's true.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,160
That lottery ticket...

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,590
You gave it to me.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,100
I lied.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
How could you...

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,270
do this to me?

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,370
Whenever I was in trouble,
you stepped in and handled it for me.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,980
You nearly killed those jerks
who beat me up.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,920
Even when you were in pain,
you smiled as soon as you saw me.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
How could you deceive me like this?

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,860
Do you care more about money
than you do about me?

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,430
Is it more important than our friendship?

24
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,060
Is that why you couldn't tell me?

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,030
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,740
I have no excuse.

27
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,010
But ever since I won the lottery,

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,710
I haven't had
a single peaceful night of sleep.

29
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,880
I felt terrible for you
and was overwhelmed with guilt.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,490
But I swear, I never meant
to deceive you on purpose.

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,460
So, please...

32
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,190
Please believe me, Mu Chul.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,670
Get out.

34
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,780
Get out of my house right now!

35
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,440
You should be the one to get out.

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,980
You're the one who should leave, not me.

37
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,980
This is my house!

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,650
Get out! It's my house!

39
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,420
Give us back our money, you thieves!

40
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,090
- Get out!
- Hey, lady!

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,890
Are you drunk?

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,790
Why do you keep saying this is your house?

43
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,830
This is our house.
My family bought this house!

44
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,700
I bet you're all enjoying yourselves
with that lottery money.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,330
It belonged to my husband.

46
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,870
Your father stole
my husband's lottery ticket!

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,070
What did you say?

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
My dad stole the lottery ticket?

49
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,240
Do you get it now?

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,850
You're the ones
who should get out of this house, not me!

51
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,980
How dare you speak such nonsense?

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,520
Come here. You need to leave!

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,280
Let go. Let go of me!

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,290
Let go!

55
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,750
Seok Jin, Gwang Sik.
Hurry up and drag her out!

56
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,490
Okay. Lady, get out. You need to leave.

57
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,190
If you so much as lay a finger
on my mother, you'll pay for it.

58
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,860
Mom, let's go.

59
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
- Goodness.
- Oh, dear.

60
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,410
Mom.

61
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,710
Here, have some water.

62
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,350
Mom.

63
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,820
Is what you said earlier really true?

64
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,650
Tell us. Is it really true
that the lottery ticket was ours?

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,090
Yes, it is true.

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,130
Your dad bought the lottery ticket.
It's ours.

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
I went to the lottery ticket store
earlier today...

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,030
and checked their security footage.

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,270
Then how did it end up in their hands?
And knowing that...

70
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,740
Seriously, how could they do this?

71
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,720
- My gosh.
- Dad.

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Dad.

73
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,830
Oh, gosh.

74
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,750
Where did you go?

75
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,620
Did you meet with Mr. Kim?

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,490
Did he tell you about the lottery ticket?

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,900
You must have been so shocked.

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,740
It was absolutely shocking for me too.

79
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,710
Of course, you're shocked and hurt.

80
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,050
Had I known about it,
I would've done everything to prevent it.

81
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,420
Who would have thought
your friends would do this to you?

82
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,820
I had no idea they were like this.

83
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,270
They gave it to us, so that's that.

84
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,240
I can't believe she made a scene,
demanding it back.

85
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,850
Honestly, it's not like
Dad stole that lottery ticket.

86
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,920
It's not like he took it by force
against his will.

87
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,750
Dad has been feigning ignorance
this whole time,

88
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,150
so in a sense, he did deceive him.

89
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,890
Are you saying
we should give the money back to them?

90
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,620
I'm just stating a fact.

91
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,960
Since he hasn't fully gotten
his memory back,

92
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,100
I get why
they can't just take our word for it.

93
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,700
Still,

94
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,070
I can't believe she's actually asking us
to give the house back.

95
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
- Dad.
- Dad.

96
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Hey.

97
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,910
That family found out
about the lottery ticket.

98
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,650
Did you know?

99
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,690
What...

100
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,800
Honey. So you know, don't you?

101
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,800
What about Mr. Han?

102
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,640
Does he know too?

103
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,210
I just spoke with Mu Chul.

104
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,780
What did you tell him?

105
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
You said
you'd never give him the money, right?

106
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,950
Is that important now?

107
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,620
Of course, it is important.

108
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,020
Mi Ja was here earlier.

109
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,620
She blew up at me,
insisting we give the house back.

110
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,990
You don't care about that?

111
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,990
When you see Mr. Han again,
tell him firmly...

112
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,860
so they won't even think...

113
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,930
about asking for the money
or the house back.

114
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,530
Do you hear me?

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,450
I mean, how could they not say a thing
after taking our lottery ticket?

116
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,780
Isn't that considered stealing?

117
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,250
They didn't take it.
They said Dad gave it to them.

118
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,320
Right, but that's what they're saying.

119
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,830
Either way, the fact is
they've been hiding it all this time.

120
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,090
They bought this house
and did everything else with that money.

121
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,200
How could they not say
a word about it to us?

122
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,600
Honestly,
I don't understand that part either.

123
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,270
They're no strangers. They're friends.

124
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,870
How could his friend do this to us?

125
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,910
They saw how much we were struggling.
They saw everything.

126
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,880
Gosh, if we're this upset,

127
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,910
Dad must be absolutely devastated, right?

128
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,080
Darn, I don't even know.

129
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,610
These numbers.

130
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,680
Do you know what these are?

131
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,950
How would I know?

132
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,720
What are these numbers?

133
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,620
How do you know?

134
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
You.

135
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,560
Have you won the lottery before?

136
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,630
Win the lottery? As if.

137
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,660
That's just what I hear from people.

138
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,160
That's so fascinating.

139
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,230
I just bought a lottery ticket
with automated random numbers.

140
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,130
I never imagined that was
the Daewoon Building's completion date.

141
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,930
Have you thought about
the extra investment?

142
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,160
You'll have to decide soon.

143
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,080
Isn't Dad going to eat?

144
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,250
He says he's not hungry.

145
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,220
About the lottery winnings.

146
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,220
I think we should get it back.

147
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,990
That lottery ticket was Dad's anyway.

148
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,560
I don't know what happened
between Dad and Mr. Kim,

149
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,290
but I don't think
we should just leave things as is.

150
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Right.

151
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,770
If we had that money,
we wouldn't be struggling so much.

152
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,600
Honestly, if I just think about the money,
that seems like the right thing to do.

153
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,490
Are you sure you don't want to eat?

154
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,160
About the lottery winnings.

155
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm going to get that money back for sure.

156
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,910
All of the winnings
and even our house that they took.

157
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,910
I'm going to get it all back,
no matter what.

158
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,810
I can't live like this. I feel so wronged.

159
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,290
You must be really upset.

160
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,890
Don't worry. I'll always be on your side.

161
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,660
No matter what happens,

162
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,700
I will never betray you.

163
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,570
Let's be strong, okay?

164
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,010
Mu Chul.

165
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,110
Honey.

166
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,020
Go and tell Mr. Han.

167
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,590
We won't give them a single penny
from that money.

168
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
If they ever come back
and make all that ruckus again,

169
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,320
we won't let it slide.

170
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,400
Honey, let's give them the money.

171
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,270
Wait, what are you saying?

172
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,640
I can't do this anymore.

173
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,770
Let's just give them half of the winnings.

174
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,910
Are you crazy?
Why would we give them that money?

175
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,210
Then, what about our kids?

176
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,210
What about me?

177
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,480
Can't you please understand me?

178
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,890
You know better than anyone
how I've been so anxious...

179
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,920
because of that lottery ticket.

180
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,430
Seeing how Mu Chul is in shock,

181
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,960
I think I really did the wrong thing.

182
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,700
Let's give them the money now,

183
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,870
and please let me live in peace.

184
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,540
When did you...

185
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,370
not live in peace with that money?

186
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,410
You bought the house you wanted...

187
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,780
and made a grand gesture
of giving your first love money.

188
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,410
You did everything you wanted to.

189
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,810
How much more peace do you want?

190
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,320
I'm the one who has never had...

191
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,420
a moment's peace since we won that money.

192
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,320
Because you held onto that money
and didn't let me spend a penny,

193
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,130
I never even got to buy anything I wanted.

194
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,690
Do you know how it feels...

195
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,360
to have to steal money as a mother...

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
so she can give it to her kids?

197
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,970
Whatever.

198
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,510
Give me the bankbook this instant.

199
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,870
From now on,

200
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,940
I can't let you handle that money anymore.

201
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,980
What? Give them half the money?

202
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,150
I could never do that!

203
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,050
Where are you going?

204
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,020
Give me the passcode before you go.

205
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,190
Give me the passcode to the safe!

206
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,030
(Kim Dae Sik)

207
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,710
What? Dad wants to give them the money?

208
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,680
Gosh, that makes no sense.

209
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,710
He already received it.
Why should he give it back?

210
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,350
I don't think that's right either.

211
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,410
There's no legal obligation
for Dad to return the money.

212
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,050
So, what do you think, Mom?

213
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,550
Of course, I won't give it to them.

214
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,190
You guys haven't even gotten
to spend that money.

215
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,320
Why should we give it to them?

216
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,720
It's utter nonsense!

217
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,160
Gosh, the money is all under Dad's name.

218
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,190
What if he just gives it away?

219
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,260
This won't do.

220
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,730
Honey, you said you'd only receive
500,000 dollars from Dad, right?

221
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,970
Yes, I did.

222
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,040
I should ask for five million
like I did before.

223
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,710
Seok Jin, have you paid back
the 4.5 million dollars?

224
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,640
Yes, a little while ago.

225
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,910
Ask to have that back too.

226
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
Ah Jin, you too.

227
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,150
Don't say that you don't need money
like last time.

228
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,050
Just ask for the money, no matter what.

229
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,550
If you don't need it,
you could give it to Mom,

230
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,490
but just get the money first.

231
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,830
We can't lose our money to that family
just like this.

232
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Where are you going?

233
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,240
Quit working at that company immediately
and break up with Seok Jin.

234
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Mom.

235
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,710
I told you that I wouldn't allow you
to get involved with that family.

236
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,710
Do you still not get it
after what you saw yesterday?

237
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,950
You can never be with Hye Sook's son.

238
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,650
Break up while I'm being nice.

239
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,750
Also, you.

240
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,850
You're forbidden from going out today.

241
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,200
Were you dating that guy, Kim Seok Jin?

242
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Hey.

243
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,740
I hear you're dating my sister.

244
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,420
Are you sure about this?

245
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,880
What do you mean?

246
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,490
Our families are at each other's throats.

247
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,490
Are you sure
you can keep your relationship going?

248
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,390
Seo Woo and I will deal with that
on our own. Bye, then.

249
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,140
Hey, Seo Woo.

250
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,040
Seok Jin, can you let people know
that I can't come to work today?

251
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,380
My mom won't let me go anywhere.

252
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,680
Okay, I will.

253
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,750
You must've been so shocked yesterday.

254
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,550
I wonder if your family and mine
will end up enemies.

255
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,890
Okay, bye.

256
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Who was that?

257
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,260
Oh, Seo Woo.

258
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,390
She has something going on at home,
so she can't come.

259
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,860
Is that right?

260
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,800
By the way, is something wrong?

261
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,730
You don't look so great.

262
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,230
No, it's nothing.

263
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,110
Hey, Mu Chul. You're here.

264
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,250
Do you have something to say to me?

265
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,060
Did you know
that the winning lottery ticket was mine?

266
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,690
No, I didn't.

267
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,860
I found out through your wife.

268
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,700
How could Dae Sik do this to me?

269
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,340
Even if he wanted the money so badly,

270
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,780
I never even imagined that he'd trick me.

271
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,210
You were shocked too, weren't you?

272
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,280
Did you feel betrayed like I did?

273
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,850
Well...

274
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,420
Dae Sik says that I gave him
that lottery ticket. Should I believe him?

275
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,330
He even lied to me
that he won with automated random numbers.

276
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,330
Am I supposed to...

277
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,500
believe him?

278
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,270
Dae Sik,
my best friend whom I trust the most,

279
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,340
tricked me and lied to me. That is...

280
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,110
what pains me.

281
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,650
I wish I could get my memory back,

282
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,520
so I could find out how this happened!

283
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,390
Gyu Tae.

284
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,690
What am I...

285
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,100
supposed to do now?

286
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Mu Chul.

287
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,240
Can't you...

288
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,070
just believe Dae Sik?

289
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,180
- What?
- As you know,

290
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,850
you don't even remember what happened.

291
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,620
Being suspicious of him
will only cause more pain for both of you.

292
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,290
If you just believe what he's telling you,

293
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,190
it'll ease both your minds.

294
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,360
I'm sure Dae Sik...

295
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,600
had his reasons for what he did.

296
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,440
And he must have felt uneasy about it
the whole time.

297
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,610
We both know how he is.

298
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,480
You know
he must have felt terrible about it.

299
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,440
The decision...

300
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,380
is yours to make,

301
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,680
so please consider it carefully.

302
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
I'm heading out...

303
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,170
to consult a lawyer.

304
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,500
I want to ask the lawyer what I should do
to get the lottery money back.

305
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,410
Wait and see what happens.

306
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Mother.

307
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,800
Are you going somewhere?

308
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,670
What brings you here, Ye Won?

309
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,170
I was in the area,
so I thought I should stop by.

310
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,740
I didn't know you were going out.

311
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,770
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have something urgent to take care of.

312
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,410
Let's talk another time, okay?

313
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Mother.

314
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,910
Seok Jin seemed really upset earlier.

315
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,420
Did something happen?

316
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,750
(Kim Dae Sik)

317
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,920
It seemed like Seo Woo didn't come to work
because of it too.

318
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,160
I'm asking because I'm worried.

319
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,030
Seo Woo didn't come to work?

320
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,860
She got a job?

321
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,060
My gosh. You didn't know?

322
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,630
Seo Woo works at our company.

323
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
What?

324
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,740
Seo Woo works at Seok Jin's company?

325
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,610
So, you don't know anything.

326
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,110
What should I do?
Can I tell you this or not?

327
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,580
It's fine. Hurry up and tell me.
What's going on?

328
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,020
The thing is...

329
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,050
Seok Jin and Seo Woo are dating.

330
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
What?

331
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,160
Who's dating whom?

332
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,930
Your next-door neighbor, Seo Woo.

333
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,460
That's why Seo Woo came to work with us.

334
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,300
To see Seok Jin.

335
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,970
What?

336
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,340
- Oh, gosh...
- Mother, are you all right?

337
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,110
(Reception, Payment)

338
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,580
Ms. Hwang Geum Ok, you can go in now.

339
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,580
Yes!

340
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:31,830
(Ultrasound Room)

341
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,040
Congratulations.
You are six weeks pregnant.

342
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,480
So, I am...

343
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,320
actually pregnant?

344
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,890
Here. You see this, right?

345
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,890
This dark spot is the gestational sac.

346
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Let's see. You should be able
to hear the baby's heartbeat now.

347
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,800
You can hear it, right?

348
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,800
This sound...

349
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,200
It's coming from inside my womb?

350
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,070
Right, you said
you had trouble conceiving before.

351
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,110
How long were you trying?

352
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,850
For about 3 to 4 years?

353
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,110
For quite a while.

354
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,950
I've never been able to conceive before.

355
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:32,560
Right, so how did you manage
to conceive at 54?

356
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,330
I think you're the oldest expectant mother
at our hospital.

357
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,390
Anyway, congratulations.

358
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,800
Thank you.

359
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,340
What? You own the Daewoon Building?

360
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,440
And Mu Chul has no idea?

361
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
That's right.

362
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,680
What if he finds out?

363
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,550
Just tell him before it's too late.

364
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,850
Just say you were temporarily holding
the ownership of the Daewoon Building.

365
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,420
That you planned to return it to him
when his memory returned.

366
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,120
That was your plan, wasn't it?

367
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,790
Yes. It was, at first.

368
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,590
But...

369
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,630
I've already come too far to turn back.

370
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,000
I should just...

371
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,670
sell it and give him the money.

372
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,500
I was going to do that,

373
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,270
but couldn't because Dae Sik found out.

374
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,610
Dae Sik knows about this?

375
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,110
Speaking of which,

376
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,450
I've been offered
a great investment opportunity.

377
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,750
I'm thinking of selling the building
without telling Dae Sik,

378
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,760
then investing the money...

379
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
and giving Mu Chul
the profits from that investment.

380
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,060
My goodness.

381
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,680
My baby.

382
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,510
Why did you come to me?

383
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,520
I'm old and nothing special.

384
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
But you know what?

385
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,230
Mommy will protect you no matter what.

386
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,760
So...

387
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,430
don't go anywhere.
You have to stay with me.

388
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,140
Okay?

389
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,680
(Number One Real Estate, 669 Chicken)

390
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,520
(Number One Real Estate)

391
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,960
Then you will really sell the building?

392
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,830
Yes.

393
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
The investment deadline
is just around the corner,

394
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,070
so I need to hurry
and sell the Daewoon Building now.

395
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,470
But what if it goes wrong?

396
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,820
My gosh. What is this all about?

397
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,420
He's selling the Daewoon Building?

398
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,560
Gyu Tae, you need to calm down
and think this over.

399
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,730
This is not something
you should take lightly.

400
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,940
Can't you just believe Dae Sik?

401
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
- Hey, over here.
- Oh, no.

402
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,580
Hey! Don't do that!

403
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,980
- Oh, yes.
- Nice shot!

404
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
Nice.

405
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,580
Hey, come on.

406
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,220
I heard you, so get up. Come on.

407
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,160
- What?
- Get up.

408
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,930
You can work here.

409
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,930
What?

410
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,330
What is this?

411
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,300
Oh, I thought of you
when I was at the market earlier.

412
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,570
I bought some fish for you too.
Take it and eat it at home.

413
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,510
Here, your pay advance.

414
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,550
I gave you some extra as a bonus,
so take it.

415
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,550
Congratulations.

416
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,050
(Jackpot Chicken)

417
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,050
Oh, right.

418
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,850
About the three million dollars.

419
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,750
I heard from Mi Ja that you said
you'd help me out with it.

420
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,990
Yes, have you given it some thought?

421
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,640
Come on!

422
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Hey!

423
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,730
Oh, Mu Chul.

424
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,960
I had a consultation with a lawyer today.

425
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,470
I think we may be able
to get the lottery money back.

426
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,340
Even if you did give it to him,
we can still get half of it back.

427
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,540
It's not 100 percent guaranteed, though.
We'll have to sue them...

428
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,510
- and win the case.
- Honey.

429
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,010
You know, that money...

430
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,850
Let's just put it behind us.

431
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,620
What do you mean?

432
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,450
I want to...

433
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,120
believe Dae Sik.

434
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,130
What?

435
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,200
Are you saying
you'll just give up on that money?

436
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
(Good Luck!)

437
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,860
Did you ever...

438
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,160
want a little brother or sister?

439
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,730
- Hey!
- Does your mother not approve...

440
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,400
of your sister dating my brother?

441
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,970
Your mother doesn't like it.
Why would my mom be any different?

442
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,110
- Mom.
- Is Seo Woo here?

443
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,370
Seo Woo isn't here.
