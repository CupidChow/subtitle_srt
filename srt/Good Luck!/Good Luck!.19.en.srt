1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,170
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,190
What? Mu Chul was scammed?

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,460
Then were those people really creditors?

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,830
"Those people?" Who?

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,700
Some strangers were looking for him
in front of the house yesterday.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,300
They called him a fraud.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,040
Really? They must've been the creditors.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,140
Oh, right.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,440
What were you doing there, by the way?

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,610
You got all jumpy when you saw me
as if you'd seen a ghost.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,810
What?

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,350
I was on my way back from the market...

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,180
Hey! You suddenly jumped out,

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,620
so I was startled. That's all.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Is that so?

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,660
Then what's that?

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,020
What?

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,560
You held them in your arms
as if they were treasures or something.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,830
I believe...

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,260
I briefly saw the word "VIP"
written on them.

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,530
Oh, these?

22
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,730
Someone gave me these as a gift.

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,500
It says "VIP" on them?

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,270
I didn't know.

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,840
Anyway, these are nothing.

26
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,180
Is that so?

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,010
Oh, right. Did you know?

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,080
Mu Chul is leaving for Hong Kong today.

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,650
What? Why would Mu Chul suddenly go
to Hong Kong?

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,390
I don't know the details either.

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,120
I guess he's planning to stay there...

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,960
until that fraud is caught.

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,490
He must be leaving the country
to avoid the creditors.

34
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,870
Mu Chul won't lose
all his money and assets, will he?

35
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,800
Hey, the most useless thing you can do...

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,300
is to worry about Mu Chul
running out of money.

37
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,270
Hey, he says his accounts are seized,

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,680
but I bet he already hid
plenty of money someplace safe.

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,810
Then what about his buildings?

40
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,980
There's no way the creditors
wouldn't go after his buildings.

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,250
What? Oh, I'm sure
he already figured something out.

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,520
As if Mu Chul is the type to take losses.

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,290
That's true. He could transfer
the ownership to someone else.

44
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,990
There must be many ways around it.

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,500
Do you know what time
his flight is supposed to depart today?

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,370
At 4 p.m. Why? Do you want to go there
to say goodbye in person?

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
What?

48
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,810
Why would I? I'm not losing my mind, man.

49
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,440
Anyway, all right. I'm off.

(Number One Real Estate)

51
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,790
Why does he keep talking nonsense today?

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,860
Oh, what's the matter?

53
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,260
What?

54
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,860
Well, you see... Mu Chul is...

55
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,730
What? What about the chicken?

56
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,700
Where's the chicken you bought?

57
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,400
You went out to get chicken.

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Chicken?

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,780
Oh, right. I fell down on my way back,
so I had to throw it all away.

60
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,850
What? My gosh. What a waste.

61
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,920
What about the gochujang?

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,050
You said you'd stop by the store
and pick it up.

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,390
Oh, that's right. I'll pick it up later.

64
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,820
Goodness. Where's your mind at?

65
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,060
Leave it. I'll pick it up
since I have to step out anyway.

66
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,830
Where are you going, honey?

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
I'm going to see Mi Ja.

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,860
I haven't had a chance to drop off
those side dishes I made,

69
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,070
so I want to go and check in on her.

70
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,770
And I want to ask her what's going on.

71
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,340
Those suspicious-looking people
came to the house the other day, you know.

72
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,140
You don't need to check in on her.

73
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,380
What? What do you mean?

74
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,440
That family...

75
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,680
They're going to Hong Kong today.

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Hong Kong?

- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

79
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,200
Gosh, I could've caught him
if I'd only had some more time.

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,030
I was so close.

81
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,930
You were close to catching someone?
Who do you mean?

82
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,640
Do you mean that conman?

83
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,110
It's someone else.

84
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,410
An even more evil guy than that conman.

85
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,980
The devil in human form!

86
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,120
But Mom, do we really have to go?

87
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
- My gosh.
- You.

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,120
Don't go if you don't want to.

89
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,890
It would be your loss.

90
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,460
Honey, how could you say that?

91
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,530
Don't you even feel bad for us?

92
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,230
Why should I feel bad for you?

93
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm the one
who's suffering the most right now!

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My goodness.

95
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,330
Don't worry.

96
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,100
We'll be there and back really soon.

97
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Hey, haven't you heard from your brother?

98
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,310
No.

99
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,010

Gosh, will they be all right
to go without me?

103
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,390
Whatever.
I make such good money these days.

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,160
I can't go and give all of this up.

105
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
I'm here!

106
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,430
What's this?

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,900
Where did everything go?

108
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,570
My crypto mining machine.

109
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,810
Hey, Jung Min. What's up?

113
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,710
Hey, did you perhaps invest money
in Young Soo's business?

114
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,950
Yes, but how did you know about that?

115
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,390
What?

116
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,190
He said they were leaving
on the 4 p.m. flight.

117
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,430

Why do you keep staring at the clock?

121
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,740
Right. By this time,
they should be long gone.

122

Honey.

123
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,240

129
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,290

Why is he going to Hong Kong,
all of a sudden?

I'm not sure about the details either.

they were leaving on the 4 p.m. flight.

Oh, my. Sir, you haven't paid.

Hey, you have to pay before you leave!

get on that plane!

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,280
- Hey, look!
- No, my money!

181
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,320
- It's money!
- That's my money!

182
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,650
- Money!
- Oh, no! My money!

183
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,180
- Money!
- No, that's mine.

184
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,620
Hey!

185
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,820
Honey!

186
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,320
- Look at all that money!
- Hey! Catch them!

187
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,330
Wait right there!

188
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,700
Hey, that money is like
my own blood, sweat, and tears!

189
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,800
My money... Hey, you thieves!

190
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,300
Mom, are you okay?

191
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,570
What do we do? What if Dad was caught?

192
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,310
First, try calling Tae Ha.

193
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,810
He could've gone to the airport.

194
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,980
We can't let him run into those people.

195
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
(Cryptocurrency Investment Contract)

196
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
(Song Young Soo, 500 dollars)

197
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,290
I want to file a report about a scam.

198
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,720
We'll take a look for now.

199
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,730
No, but I even have a photo.

200
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,990
I even have a photo of us together.

201
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,830
You've seen someone
who looks like this, right?

202
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
- Goodness.
- If you take a closer look...

203
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,170
- I told you. I don't know.
- This person also lives near here...

204
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,130
- I don't know.
- Please just take a closer look.

205
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,310
Just give up.

206
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,850
At least ten other people
we knew from school...

207
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,550
were also scammed, so it's not just you.

208
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,450
He made people feel at ease by giving them
three percent of the profits each day.

209
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,890
But then,
he must've run off with everything else.

210
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,420
No way.

211
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,360
That money meant so much to me.

212
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,430
How could he...

213
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,530
How could he do this to me?

214
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,770
No. I'm sure this isn't true.

215
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,470
Hello? Young Soo?

216
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,810
Tae Ha. Where are you right now?
Are you at the airport, perhaps?

217
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,220
What's this? Did he hang up?

218
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,020
Why? What did he say?

219
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,190
I don't know.
He just hung up without a word.

220
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,130
What? Gosh, this kid.

221
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,590
Why is he worrying me so much?

222
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,600
Even if he doesn't go to Hong Kong,

223
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,530
he still has to stay in touch.

224
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,670
I can't believe Seo Woo.

225
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,710
What? Going to Hong Kong out of the blue?

226
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,980
I'm sure she's going to meet another guy.

227
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,550
She must've had two plans
at the same time, just like me.

228
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,520
Thanks to her,
I can't even go on this trip.

229
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,880
I'm going to have to pay
a cancellation fee.

230
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,350
I can't believe I'm blowing 500 dollars.

231
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,250
That's a good thing.
You should just break up with her.

232
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
What?

233
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,330
Why date a girl
you can't even spend 500 dollars on?

234
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,660
It would be better to just break up.

235
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,600
Hey.

236
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,660
It would still be a shame
to end things now.

237
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,830
To be honest, I am a little angry,

238
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,440
but it's not like
I've gone all the way with her.

239
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,240
This is actually a good thing.

240
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,740
Once she gets back,
my wedding will be over.

241
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,610
Then, it'll be easier to see her.

242
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,050
Is that the time already?

243
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,580
I have a date with Jung Ah.

244
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Bye.

245
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,200
Oh, dear. I feel like I'm about to die.

246
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,170
Mom, I can't feel my legs.

247
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,170
I can't take another step.

248
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,380
Tae Ha.

249
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,780
You don't think something happened
to Tae Ha too, do you?

250
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,210
Mom, is Tae Ha a little kid?

251
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,550
He'll take care of himself.

252
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,050
By the way, Mom,
is it all right for us to stay here?

253
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,390
What if those people come back?

254
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,690
Don't worry.

255
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,860
The most obvious place is
the best hiding place.

256
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,060
We're in here with the door locked.

257
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,230
What can they do?

258
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,030
Oh, whatever.

259
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,770
I'm going to stay here,
whether we live or die.

260
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,300
I'm not going anywhere.

261
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,000
That's fine for us,

262
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,540
but what happened to Dad?

263
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,410
You don't think he was caught, do you?

264
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,310
So what if he does?
Just let him get caught.

265
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,510
- What?
- I mean, what could happen?

266
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,420
I'm sure they'll just threaten him
to give them money.

267
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,050
Come on, Mom.
You don't know what you're saying.

268
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,990
These days, creditors will hire thugs...

269
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,520
to steal your organs, pull out your teeth,

270
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,690
or bury you alive and stuff.

271
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,590
Really?

272
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,100
Haven't you seen it on the news?

273
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,830
The scariest people in the world
are the ones coming to get their money.

274
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,800
Gosh, what if something really bad
happens to Dad?

275
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Oh, no.

276
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,470
Goodness.

277
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
What did you say?

278
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,910
Then, were those people actual creditors?

279
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,380
But how could Mr. Han get scammed?

280
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,080
So, from now on, don't go around...

281
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,290
talking about Mu Chul.

282
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,450
All right.

283
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,160
You don't think those guys
went all the way to the airport, do you?

284
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm sure they did,

285
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,500
seeing how they even came
to our restaurant.

286
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,630
Do you think so?

287
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,800
Oh, whatever.

288
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,740
It's not like I said that knowingly.

289
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,610
Good grief.

290
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Why are you home already?

291
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,820
Did you only have one job interview today?

292
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Well...

293
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,660
I was supposed to have another,

294
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
but it got canceled.

295
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,600
By the way, honey,

296
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,970
about that fortune teller...

297
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,470
Why do you think
Mom didn't tell me about it?

298
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,010
The fortune teller?

299
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,940
Why do you ask, all of a sudden?

300
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,280
I went over to Mom's place earlier
and asked her...

301
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,250
why she never told me
about coming here to get it.

302
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,980
Did you have a chance
to take a good look at it?

303
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,990
She said
something important was written on it.

304
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,920
Really? I'm not sure.

305
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,660
I don't know about other things,

306
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,460
but I do know it was a lottery ticket.

307
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
A lottery ticket?

308
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,890
You didn't know?

309
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,530
It was a lottery ticket
folded into a fortune teller.

310
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,130
At first, I didn't know either.

311
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,030
I opened it up and saw
that it was a lottery ticket.

312
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,740
Was it perhaps a winning lottery ticket?

313
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,640
Was that why she came
and took it without telling me?

314
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,510
Come on. No.

315
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,180
I wondered that too,
so I checked the numbers.

316
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,810
Your mother said
it was bought a month ago.

317
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,010
Really?

318
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,610
Right.

319
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,120
Mom would've told me
had she won the lottery.

320
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,990
I went on about
how much I'm struggling now.

321
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,260
If she won and never told me,
she shouldn't even call herself my parent.

322
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,990
Oh, right.

323
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,690
Do you know how much the prize money was?

324
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,060
How much?

325
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,600
Over 30 million dollars.

326
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,530
Did you say 30 million?

327
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,340
Maybe I should buy some lottery tickets
instead of doing this.

328
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,370
Why would you buy a lottery ticket?

329
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,940
You already won.

330
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,440
Is once not enough?

331
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,150
Me? I won the lottery? When?

332
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,350
Your forever cutie-pie, Heo Gwang Sik.

333
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,790
Meeting me was like
winning the lottery for you, you know?

334
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,160
First prize.

335
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,460
More like a dud!

336
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,830
That hurt.

337
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Hold on.

338
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,300
My eyes are stinging.

339
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,400
(Jackpot Chicken)

340
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Honey.

341
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
About Mi Jin.

342
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,080
She came by our house earlier.

343
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,480
She must be struggling financially.
She's doing a side job.

344
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,180
So, I want to help her out
even if it's not a lot of money.

345
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,050
Can you think of a way?

346
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,990
Why should we help her?

347
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,390
It's not like she and her husband
are both bedridden.

348
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,820
They're both young,

349
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,790
and they can totally work.
Why should we help them?

350
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,360
Just leave them be.

351
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,700
You can say that
because you didn't see Mi Jin today.

352
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,470
She must've been under a lot of stress.

353
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,400
She has lost so much weight.

354
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,440
It made me so upset.

355
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,610
What she's going through now is nothing.

356
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,340
Think about when we were younger.

357
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,440
Our situation was way worse,

358
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,210
but we're doing fine now.

359
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,610
My goodness.

360
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,680
Do you even know how I felt back then?

361
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,190
Less than 20 days after Ah Jin was born,

362
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,490
your business went bankrupt.

363
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,420
I had to work at a grocery store
when I hadn't even fully recovered.

364
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,730
Do you know
how much I cried inside back then?

365
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,900
Not because my body was in pain.

366
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,500
I was worried
my children might have to starve.

367
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,700
I cried myself to sleep every night.

368
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,930
Do you even know that?

369
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,810
Right.

370
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,470
If you knew that,

371
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,280
you wouldn't be able to say
we shouldn't move.

372
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,550
You can say that because you know nothing.

373
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,310
You don't know anything.

374
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,550
My goodness.
Why would you bring that up now?

375
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,290
In any case, we shouldn't help them now.

376
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,290
When they've hit rock bottom
and can't possibly go any lower,

377
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,030
we can help them then.
It still won't be late.

378
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,630
If we start giving them money
because we feel bad,

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
they'll keep expecting it,
and we can't handle that.

380
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,330
Do you understand?

381
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,070
All right.

382
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,200
That's fine.

383
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,370
But about the moving issue,
I will not back down.

384
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,240
No matter what happens,

385
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
I must move away from here.

386
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,580
Just know that.

387
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,650
Okay?

388
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,650
(The Best Fried Chicken)

389
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,650
What?

390
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,630
Min Yong's surgery
and hospitalization charges...

391
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,160
have been paid in full.

392
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,960
Yes, thank you. Have a good day.

393
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,830
(56,490 dollars, Paid)

394
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,410
Min Yong, how does it feel to be home?

395
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,640
- Isn't it nice to be home?
- It's just our home.

396
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Here.

397
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,550
I was in the car for a while,

398
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,910
so I feel queasy.

399
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,680
Be careful.

400
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,990
What? Who's here at this hour?

401
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,530
Hey, what brings you here
at this time of day?

402
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,770
Where is Min Yong? Is he in his room?

403
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,540
I made some porridge.

404
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,240
What? Porridge?

405
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,010
I was reminded of Min Yong
while making pumpkin porridge.

406
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,010
I remembered you said
he'd be coming home today,

407
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,010
so I brought some.

408
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,010
I brought some side dishes too.

409
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,180
I made them while cooking the porridge.

410
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,550
My, I love pumpkin porridge.

411
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,980
You do?
Then you should have some too, Jin Tae.

412
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,490
There isn't very much food.
Gyu Tae, you don't get to have any.

413
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,390
I never even said I wanted it.
You're so mean.

414
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,430
Thanks for these, Geum Ok.

415
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,090
My pleasure. Enjoy, Jin Tae.

416
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,200
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

417
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,530
All right, bye.

418
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,000
My gosh. We get to enjoy these things
thanks to Geum Ok.

419
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,140
Let me try these.

420
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,840
Gyu Tae, do you want some too?

421
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,980
Forget it!

422
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
I know she's a bad cook,
so how good could they be?

423
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,550
You can eat them all.

424
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,150
Hello?

425
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,820
Hey, I hear Young Soo is leaving
for Switzerland shortly.

426
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,820
His flight leaves at 6 p.m. today.

427
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,620
What? Who said that?

428
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,290
Are you sure?

429
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,230
Yes, go to the airport now.

430
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,040
Young Soo.

431
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,710
Young Soo.

432
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Young Soo!

433
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,650
Young Soo!

434
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,650
Are you all right?

435
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,690
(Switzerland, Boarding)

436
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,680
Why can't I reach him?

437
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,910
Did he get caught?

438
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,180
This man, seriously!

439
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,980
After leaving like that,
he should at least...

440
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,990
call me to let me know
whether or not he's alive.

441
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,690
Mom, let's eat something.

442
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,360
I'm going to faint at this rate.

443
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,660
Open the fridge
and find yourself something to eat.

444
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,660
Don't be like this. Just try calling him.

445
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,460
What?

446
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,030
Dad. Aren't you waiting for Dad?

447
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,570
I am not waiting for him.

448
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,470
But seriously, what happened to Dad?

449
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,010
If he wasn't caught by the creditors...

450
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
No way.

451
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,110
Did he ditch us?

452
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,710
What are you talking about?

453
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,150
Otherwise, why wouldn't he call us?

454
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,090
Don't you remember what Dad said?

455
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,720
He said he'd go to Hong Kong alone
even if we decided not to go.

456
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,260
We were on the move together
and got caught,

457
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,460
so maybe he thought
it'd be better to go alone...

458
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,060
and just left the country.

459
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,230
No, no way.

460
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,630
He knows we're penniless
and that we're completely relying on him.

461
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,130
There's no way he'd just leave like that.

462
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,570
If he really did that,

463
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,110
I will teach him a lesson.

464
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,090
(Closing Sale, We Are Closing)

465
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,360
That jerk.

466
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,430
Does he know
what I had to do to earn that money?

467
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,340
How dare he run off with my money?

468
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,810
Darn it.

469
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,110
Hello, ma'am.

470
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,210
I texted you about the remaining portion
of the purchase price.

471
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,480
Did you get my text?

472
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,980
Please give me a call when you get this.

473
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,090
I wonder if Mu Chul was able to leave
without any issues.

474
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
Anyway,

475
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,230
once the ownership is transferred,

476
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,360
I'll get money
deposited into my account...

477
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
every time one of his buildings gets sold.

478
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,630
How much would that all be?

479
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,970
Mu Chul is in Hong Kong,

480
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,410
so I can't take the cash to him.

481
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,910
Yes.

482
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,810
Then...

483
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,440
why don't I just...

484
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,250
No, I can't do that again.

485
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Yes.

486
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,050
Now, I have enough money
to pay for Min Yong's medication too.

487
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,750
I shouldn't get greedy. Don't be greedy.

488
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,390
Hey, Mu Chul. Did you arrive safely?

489
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,030
I'm still in Korea.

490
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,000
What do you mean you're still in Korea?

491
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,700
My battery is running low,

492
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,400
so I can't talk long.
Listen carefully, okay?

493
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,710
Have you perhaps...

494
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,740
sold more buildings?

495
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,210
No, not yet. Why do you ask?

496
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,410
Gyu Tae.

497
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,550
Do you have some money?

498
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,520
What? Why, all of a sudden?

499
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,620
You took that money yesterday.

500
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,690
That money...

501
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,320
They took all of it.

502
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
What?

503
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,760
Who took the money?

504
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,660
The creditors, who else?

505
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,200
If you have money, let me borrow some.

506
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,240
I'll be sure to pay you back later.

507
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Hey.

508
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,810
I have no money.

509
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Right.

510
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,350
You barely managed
to pay for your son's surgery.

511
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,620
Oh, what's going on
with the remaining amount?

512
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,490
I haven't heard from her yet.
I'm still waiting to hear from her.

513
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,790
Should I ask her myself?

514
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
What?

515
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,800
If the building owner calls
and asks about it,

516
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,200
she might be more understanding
about the situation.

517
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,700
No!

518
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,200
I'll ask her.

519
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,300
If the owner calls,

520
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,170
she'll think there's something wrong
with the building.

521
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,240
Oh, dear.

522
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,640
Okay, all right.

523
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,610
If you hear back from her,

524
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,210
let me know.

525
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
What in the world?

526
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,590
Why is he asking to borrow money from me?

527
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,090
He knows that I don't have money.

528
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,090
Hang on.

529
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,490
Was he testing me
because he knows about something?

530
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,530
No, he's not one to do that.

531
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,500
He wouldn't just sit and watch
if he knew something.

532
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,170
By the way, this feels so uncomfortable.

533
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,150
Gosh, those dogged punks.

534
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,550
Was it not enough that they took my money?

535
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,780
Why are they back here?

536
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
This won't do.

537
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,450
I can't take this anymore.

538
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,720
Whose name is this house under?

539
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,560
What? The house?

540
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,360
Isn't it under that jerk
Han Mu Chul's name?

541
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,430
Let's look into it
and take care of this house soon too.

542
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,040
Goodness, those jerks.
How dare they try to take my house too?

543
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,470
But then, what about us?

544
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,570
Where will we live?

545
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,010
Hang on.

546
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,450
The house is in my name.

547
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,080
Shoot, what do I do?

548
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,390
Darn it.

549
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,600
(Wife)

550
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,410
What is this? It's ringing,

551
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,920
so why isn't he picking up?

552
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,620
He won't text me back...

553
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,050
or answer my calls.

554
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,460
Right.

555
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,160
There's no way he'd be so hard to reach
if everything was fine.

556
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,100
He would've at least called once
because he'd be worried about his family.

557
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,260
I'm sure something happened to him.

558
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Oh, no.

559
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,370
Hello? Is this the police...

560
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,800
Is that him?

561
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,170
Is that you, honey?

562
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
Is Dad home?

563
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Tae Ha?

564
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,650
Where were you all this time?

565
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,150
What?

566
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,250
Didn't you hear me?

567
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
What's wrong with him?

568
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,690
He's acting like he's all that.

569
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,400
He must not even think
it's weird that we're here.

570
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,200
What about Dad? Hasn't he called?

571
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,470
No.

572
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,170
How inconsiderate.

573
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,210
How can he not call us even once?

574
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,610
Isn't he worried about us at all?

575
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,880
My goodness.

576
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,950
What? Who is it?

577
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,550
Be quiet.

578
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,180
- Is someone here?
- Hush.

579
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,950
Honey.

580
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,720
- Dad.
- Honey.

581
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,430
Honey, are you okay?

582
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,890
What's wrong, Dad?

583
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,700
What's wrong? What is it?

584
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,100
What... Hey.

585
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,940
What on earth happened?

586
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,810
Didn't you see that I called?

587
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
I did.

588
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,010
And yet, you didn't bother
to call me back once?

589
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,050
I wasn't able to.

590
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,580
Even if that was the case,
you could've at least texted me!

591
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,290
Didn't you think about how worried
your family might be after you took off?

592
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
No.

593
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,420
I couldn't.

594
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,290
You couldn't?

595
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,430
How are you so confident?

596
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,300
Even when you have an affair,

597
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,330
get scammed,

598
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,770
and put your family through this ordeal,

599
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,570
how can you be so shameless
that you don't even apologize to us?

600
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,210
I have something to say to you.

601
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,680
Forget it. I have nothing to say.

602
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Here.

603
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,850
What is this?

604
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,960
(Confirmation of Intent
of Consensual Divorce)

605
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,130
"Confirmation of Intent..."

606
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,270
"of Consensual Divorce?"

607
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Are you asking me...

608
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,640
for a divorce right now?

609
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,260
(Good Luck!)

610
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,460
Can you give me back
my 30,000 dollars soon?

611
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,130
- Why?
- I want to lease this place.

612
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,170
- You saw Tae Hyung?
- What?

613
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,570
He was with a woman.

614
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,740
Once the building is sold,

615
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,710
there will be no issues.

616
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,840
I can't believe
I own the Daewoon Building.

617
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,040
