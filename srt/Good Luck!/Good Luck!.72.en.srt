00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,510
(Episode 72)

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,620
Honey.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,990
Do you really want half of that money?

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,100
All right.

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,830
Then let's split the money.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,330
Do you mean it?

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,740
But that doesn't mean
I agree to the divorce.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,040
I'm just giving it to you
so you can spend it however you like.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,370
I will never divorce you.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,080
I'll find a way to give you the money
with as little loss as possible.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,380
So, feel free
to do whatever you like with the money.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,350
I don't care what you do with it.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Hey, Dae Sik.

14
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,580
Gyu Tae, I'll buy it.

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,550
What?

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,280
The Daewoon Building.

17
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,720
I will buy it.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,690
I made a promise to my father...

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,690
that I'd get back the plot...

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,890
where our house used to stand.

21
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,230
Yes, you made the right decision.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,970
You should seize this opportunity
and buy it. If you miss it,

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,540
you might not get another chance.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,140
I'll call the current owner tomorrow
and tell him to stop by.

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,380
Okay, sounds good.

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,850
Dae Sik...

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,850
made a huge decision.

28
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,350
Will the Daewoon Building
get sold at last?

29
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,620
The Daewoon Building is...

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,990
the first building I've ever built.

31
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,960
I must protect it, no matter what.

32
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,130
It's fine.

33
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,740
Dae Sik's buying it. He's no stranger.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,140
And I can just pay him back
all at once later, including the money...

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,480
from the building sale.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,180
There will be no problem.

37
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,850
Hello.

38
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Oh, hi.

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,850
Aren't you Seok Jin?

40
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,220
Yes.

41
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,490
I see.

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,860
So,

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,600
how old are you?

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm 30.

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,630
You're 30?

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,440
Goodness. The age gap is pretty big.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,310
- Pardon?
- Oh, nothing.

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Hey.

49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,210
Did you go to college?

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,480
Yes. I earned my master's degree
from Stanford University in the US.

51
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,850
Isn't that a really good school?

52
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,520
Oh, my. You must've done great in school.

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
So, what do you do?

54
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,360
I did hear you were running
some kind of shopping mall.

55
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,430
Yes, I run an online shopping mall
called Farm to Market.

56
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,500
Is it doing well?
What's your average monthly sales?

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,700
- Pardon?
- Do you drink?

58
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,140
Do you smoke? I hope you don't gamble.

59
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,280
No, I...

60
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,380
Goodness. What am I saying?

61
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,620
Sorry about that.
You must've been taken aback.

62
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,450
No, please don't worry.

63
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,520
I've lost some of my memory,

64
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,260
so I've developed a habit
of asking a lot of questions.

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,330
Then, good night.

66
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,800
- Good night.
- Oh, let me take that.

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,300
- What?
- I'll take yours out too.

68
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,830
Would you do that for me?
All right, thank you.

69
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,540
- Good night.
- Night.

70
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,450
Honey.

71
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,050
My gosh.

72
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,320
You know,
I ran into Seok Jin out front just now.

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,420
He didn't seem all that bad.

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,320
What does that mean?

75
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,630
Wouldn't you say
he has a lot more to offer than Seo Woo?

76
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,560
He has more to offer than Seo Woo?

77
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,670
Well, I also think
our daughter is the best in the world,

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,140
but let's be honest.

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,870
She's kind of pretty, but other than that,
she doesn't have much to offer.

80
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,710
Seok Jin went to a good school
and has a great personality.

81
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,320
On top of that, he's tall and handsome...

82
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Forget it!

83
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,450
I don't like him
because he is Hye Sook's son!

84
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,090
All right. I'm just saying.

85
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,630
Oh, right.

86
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,630
I went to the Yisan Building today.

87
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,730
The Yisan Building?

88
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,140
Did you remember something?

89
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,540
No, it's not that.

90
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,410
I happened to see the building
while making a delivery.

91
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,210
The twisted donuts I brought home earlier.

92
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,110
That shop was in that building.

93
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,420
Oh, I see.

94
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,150
Did any memories come back to you
while you were there?

95
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
No.

96
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,890
Right. Near the building,

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,160
I ran into a guy
who I think was the one who conned me.

98
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,960
Who's that?

99
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,800
Jang Tae Poong.

100
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,870
I'm not entirely sure,

101
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,840
but I had a headache the moment I saw him.

102
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,310
Whenever I remember something,

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,380
my head starts to hurt.

104
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,610
This won't do.

105
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,010
Honey, you should walk around with me
starting tomorrow.

106
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,080
What? Where?

107
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,090
Anywhere and everywhere
you might have memories of.

108
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,460
Who knows? If I explain things to you,

109
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,560
you might remember something.

110
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,960
Thank you, Mi Ja.

111
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,670
Indeed, you're the best.

112
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,510
What? Dad said
he'd share the money with you?

113
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,510
Yes.

114
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,010
We've decided
to split the winnings in half,

115
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,950
so you guys don't have to worry.

116
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,320
Then, what about the divorce?
Will you go through with it?

117
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,050
Since you've figured out the money issue,

118
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,860
I thought you might forgive Dad now.

119
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,760
Is money the issue right now?

120
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,530
Obviously, they should split the money.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,360
What's important is how Mom feels.

122
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,900
She felt so betrayed.

123
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,900
Would she want to live with Dad?

124
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,070
I agree.

125
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,370
You might not know this as a man,

126
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,280
but this isn't something
that can be resolved so easily.

127
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,940
So what? Do you want them to split up?

128
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm sure Mom is upset,
but I hope Mom and Dad...

129
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,920
sort things out about now.

130
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Not me.

131
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,950
- Mi Jin.
- We're all grown up now.

132
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,690
I don't think it's so bad...

133
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,060
for Mom to live the rest of her life
in comfort on her own.

134
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,930
What about you, Ah Jin?

135
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,930
I don't know.

136
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,500
I get how Mom feels,

137
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,170
but I'm not really sure
how I feel about them getting divorced.

138
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,570
Both Mom and Dad are my precious parents.

139
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,580
I also feel bad
to think about how Dad might be hurt.

140
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,440
What do you think, Mom?

141
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,150
My thoughts haven't changed.

142
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,890
I haven't changed my mind
about wanting to divorce your dad.

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,660
So, that's that.

144
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Really?

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,640
Father said he'd give Mother money?

146
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,010
Then, will Mother give you some money too?

147
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,510
Give me money?

148
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,650
I mean, Mother wanted to give you money.

149
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,020
So, I thought maybe she'd give you some
from the money she receives.

150
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,490
Is that what you're concerned about?

151
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,990
My parents are talking
about getting divorced.

152
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,630
Is that what matters right now?

153
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,960
I know,
but we should think about our future too.

154
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,100
Gosh, I can't even talk to you.

155
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
But...

156
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,070
Hey.

157
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm going on a trip for a few days.

158
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,480
I'm going to get some fresh air.

159
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,120
I figured I should let you know.

160
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,950
Okay, go ahead.

161
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,620
By the way, I was thinking...

162
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,590
of buying the Daewoon Building.

163
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,130
Gyu Tae was saying that
the Daewoon Building was up for sale.

164
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,130
Do what you want.

165
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,330
It's your money anyway.

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,370
I don't care what you do with it.

167
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,570
You can't get the wrong idea...

168
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,710
just because I gave you money.

169
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,140
I could never split up with you.

170
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,040
You're the one
who shouldn't get the wrong idea.

171
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,480
My mind won't change
just because I accept that money.

172
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,330
Oh, Tae Ha. Do you feel better now?

173
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,330
Yes, I feel better
after having some porridge.

174
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,440
- I see.
- Porridge? You didn't have any.

175
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,770
I made you some,
but you left without eating it.

176
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,170
It's something else.

177
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,140
Thank you for the meal.

178
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,680
And where do you think you're going?

179
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,610
Where else? I'm going to work.

She got a job
as the model for his company.

182
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,360
Oh, that must've been
why you guys looked so close last night.

Last night?

184
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,890
I saw them on my way home yesterday.

185

Seo Woo was with Seok Jin
outside the house.

186

By the way,
how did you get a job at that company?

187

Why are you working so hard?

193
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,820
Did you become mature from being sick?

194
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,190
You should just get ready to cook.

195
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Did you make the rice?

196
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,730

Why are there so many customers?

Right? What's going on?

210
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,390
They must've come here after watching
Manli's video on YouTube, just like us.

212
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,730
Wait, by Manli, do you mean
the YouTuber with 500,000 subscribers?

213
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,730
Yes, that's right.

214

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,690
I happened to stumble upon
this Korean restaurant.

Oh, I remember this person.
Was she a YouTuber?

228

to keep a restaurant to herself,

Yes, that one.

had a crush on your wife back then?

that Mi Ja was your first love,

268

since it's all in the past.

Forget it. Don't tell him.

358
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,890
He'll be jealous if he hears it.

359
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,730
Why bother telling him?
It's not good news for him anyway.

360
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,190
You think so?

361
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,430
Well, anyway... Hey.

362
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,430
Are you ready to sign the contract?

363
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,070
Yes. When will the current owner be here?

364
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,270
He'll be here soon.

365
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,340
Right. You got my text
about the security deposit, right?

366
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,580
Yes. But I have to send...

367
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,050
the security deposit to your bank account?

368
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,050
Yes, that's what
the current owner wants to do.

369
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,950
We'll take care of everything.

370
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,920
All you have to do is sign the contract.

371
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,190
All right. I'll go to the bank
and come back on time.

372
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,830
Sounds good. Don't be late.

373
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,390
- I won't.
- Don't be late.

374
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,730
See you.

375
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,700
(Number One Real Estate)

376
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,740
Yes, it's me.

377
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,280
You know you have to come
to my office today, right?

378
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,810
- She's good.
- I know.

379
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,180
- She's really good.
- She is.

380
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,380
Nice. This will look very nice.

381
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,380
It's so cute.

382
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,420
Seo Woo is pretty good.

383
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,320
Right? It's the first time I've seen
this side of her too. It's refreshing.

384
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,190
So, about Seo Woo.

385
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,730
You said she lived next door
before you moved.

386
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,360
So how is she still
your next-door neighbor?

387
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,600
Did your families swap houses?

388
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,370
Yes. There was a situation,
and that's what ended up happening.

389
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,500
Does that mean Seo Woo's family
is renting from your family now?

390
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,040
You told me before that
the family next door owned the house.

391
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,280
You know we're meeting with our friends
from the US for lunch, right?

392
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Yes, I know.

393
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,390
Seo Woo should come with us.

394
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,220
- Seo Woo?
- All right, this is the last one.

395
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

396
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,030
- Well done.
- Thank you.

397
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,760
- You're so good.
- Really?

398
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,860
- Thank you.
- Well done.

399
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,060
- Gosh, thanks.
- You did a great job.

400
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,370
- Really?
- Yes.

401
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,470
- Was there anything you found stressful?
- No.

402
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,770
My gosh, Seok Jin. I thought
you were always buried in your studies.

403
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,940
Where did you meet
such a beautiful girlfriend?

404
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,810
Don't you remember?
Our professor always said...

405
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,850
we had to study hard
if we wanted to date beautiful women.

406
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,820
Oh, is that right?

407
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,190
Yes, sir.

408
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,690
Now?

409
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,560
Okay, sure.

410
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,640
I'm sorry. Something's come up,
so I have to go.

411
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,140
Don't worry. We'll enjoy this meal
with your girlfriend.

412
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
You're okay with that, right?

413
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,010
Yes, of course.

414
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
You should get going.

415
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,650
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll be off, then.

416
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,650
All right.

417
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
Hye Jin, I heard your beauty company...

418
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,990
bought a building in Samseong-dong.

419
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,630
I hear the K-beauty craze
is taking the world by storm.

420
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,630
Congratulations.

421
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
Thanks.

422
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,100
Right, So Yeon.
Didn't you say your company went public...

423
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,300
- and expanded into China?
- That's right.

424
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,100
We're throwing a party
to celebrate it at a hotel next week.

425
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,340
- You guys should come too.
- Sure.

426
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,470
You too, Seo Woo.

427
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,710
Right. What do you do, Seo Woo?

428
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,010
Pardon?

429
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,950
Oh, she's our model for our ads.

430
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,420
She started working for us today.

431
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,620
- I see.
- I see.

432
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,090
How did you and Seok Jin start going out?

433
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,430
We got close
because we live next door to each other.

434
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,430
You're next-door neighbors?

435
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,430
That's cool.

436
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,030
I don't even know
who lives next door to me.

437
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,970
That's normal
when you live in an apartment building.

438
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,870
They live in a house.

439
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,000
There's only one front gate,
and the families share the house.

440
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,640
I see. Does that mean...

441
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,840
one of them owns the house?

442
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,310
Is that how it works?

443
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,810
Is that how it works?

444
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,380
Yes, that's right.

445
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,450
My family is renting
from Seok Jin's family.

446
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,690
- Oh, really?
- Is that so?

447
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,920
All this interest
must be making her uncomfortable.

448
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,490
Let's talk about something else.

449
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,230
Ye Won, are you and Seok Jin compatible?

450
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
As business partners.

451
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,530
Yes, I like it.
We have great synergy between us.

452
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,100
I think we make good partners.

453
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,970
Of course. You were best friends.

454
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,440
It's only natural
that you work so well together.

455
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,870
I feel bad saying this
in front of Seo Woo,

456
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,650
but I totally thought
she and Seok Jin were a couple at first.

457
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,780
They were always together,
eating and studying side by side.

458
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
That's right.

459
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,820
Come to think of it,
you two lived in the same house.

460
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,320
You lived on the 2nd floor,
and Seok Jin on the 3rd floor.

461
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,530
Yes. We saw each other every day, all day.

462
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,600
Both at school and at home.

463
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,360
Those were the good days.

464
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,040
(Wonhaeng)

465
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,070
What do you think? Do you remember?

466
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
No.

467
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,410
This building was mine too?

468
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
My gosh.

469
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,250
You saw eight buildings you used to own,

470
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,920
but don't remember any of them.

471
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,790
Should we...

472
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,290
sit down somewhere and catch our breath?

473
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,270
Cheers.

474
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,710
Oh, my.

475
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,610
This must be stressful for you.

476
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,880
My memory isn't coming back to me.
I'm sorry.

477
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,050
You're the one under a lot of stress.
I'm fine.

478
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,850
A big part of your life just vanished.

479
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,760
It must be so hard.

480
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,030
My gosh. I can't even imagine...

481
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,460
what that must be like.

482
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,570
Even if I never regain my lost memories,

483
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,500
just the fact that you're by my side...

484
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,670
makes me so grateful. It's enough for me.

485
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
I feel the same way.

486
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,050
I'm much happier
than back when we had a lot of money.

487
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,920
Just knowing
you're healthy and by my side...

488
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,390
makes me so grateful. I'm truly grateful.

489
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,990
This place...

490
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,730
It looks familiar for some reason.

491
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,670
This place?

492
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,900
What?

493
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,170
Have I been here before?

494
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Really?

495
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,410
What? You forgot?

496
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,610
Gosh, you punk.
How can you do business like that?

497
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,980
Oh, dear. I seriously can't believe this.

498
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,120
Well...

499
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Tomorrow,

500
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,630
bring the contract and the money to me.

501
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,930
In cash. Bring it to me! Got it?

502
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,040
Why, you fool... Let go!

503
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,170
Unbelievable.

504
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,670
Yes!

505
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,680
I just remembered something.

506
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,410
What is it?

507
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,050
Someone tried to stop me,

508
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,750
but I kicked him away without hesitation.

509
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,750
Who was that person?

510
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,360
It was a guy. It was a brief moment,

511
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,430
but I was being really cruel.

512
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,960
Could it be that conman, Jang Tae Poong?

513
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,330
Was it him?

514
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,300
That's right. I'm on my way now.

515
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,140
I told you, didn't I?
That real estate office.

516
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,680
Oh, it's the building owner.
Excuse me, sir...

517
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Why else?

518
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,050
I'm the owner of a building.
A fake landlord.

519
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,420
The realtor there...

520
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,820
asked me to pretend to be the landlord.
If I help him sell the building,

521
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,560
he will pay me for it.

522
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,900
I've been a paid stand-in for years,

523
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,300
but I've never had a request like this.

524
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,370
Hang on.
I think the name of that building was...

525
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,410
the Daewoon Building.

526
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,810
Anyway, I'm on my way
to sign the contract now.

527
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,880
Yes, you can't even imagine
the vicarious satisfaction.

528
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,950
All right. That must be why
everyone wants to become a building owner.

529
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,920
(Daewoon)

530
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,430
(Real Estate Sales Contract)

531
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,630
Yes, Mr. Jang.

532
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,830
Yes, I think
I'll be able to sell the building soon.

533
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,070
Yes, there's someone
who wants to buy the building.

534
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,500
Right, I was meaning to sell it soon,
so this is great.

535
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,110
Okay, I'll be in touch
as soon as I get the money.

536
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,380
Hey, Dae Sik. You're here.

537
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,920
You punk.

538
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,160
Hey, what's wrong with you?

539
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,290
Stand still.

540
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,130
You won't listen? You punk.

541
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,340
What do you think you're doing?

542
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,610
Why did you do it?

543
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Why?

544
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,540
(Thank you to Manli Park Min Jeong
for her special appearance.)

545
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,880
(Good Luck!)

546
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,710
I owe you so much.

547
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,310
Then, you should pay me back now.

548
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,020
Let's go eat together.

549
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,720
- Nice!
- I'm sorry, but this is our first date.

550
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,760
Something is going on between them.

551
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,830
What could it be?

552
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,630
