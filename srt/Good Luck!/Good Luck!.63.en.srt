when filming with children.)

00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,780
(Episode 63)

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,110
Who is that person?

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,750
His name is Jang Tae Poong.
He's a nasty guy.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,720
Jang Tae Poong?

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,820
My gosh. Don't even get me started.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,790
That jerk even scammed my customers.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,860
I suffered heavy losses because of him.

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,430
But I heard your cousin
and Jang Tae Poong were in on it together.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,660
You didn't know?

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,970
What?

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,240
Do you happen to know
where that man is now?

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,670
I thought you were seeing
Choi Gyu Tae today.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,770
He's so annoying.

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,310
Why do I have to go to
a high school kid's birthday party?

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
You said Choi Gyu Tae sent you money.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,250
Can't we call it quits now?

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,890
(Jang Tae Poong has sent you
50,000 dollars.)

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,660
Fifty thousand dollars?

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,660
What is this?

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,600
Are you telling me
to take the 50,000 dollars and get lost?

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,270
That's just your first payout.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,300
A bigger payout is coming,

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,970
so don't do anything rash.
Just stay focused.

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,210
What? "First payout?"

26
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,240
So, we're not done?

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,810
I'm going to send
some of the money he sent...

28
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,110
back to him, calling it profit.

29
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,780
First, I'll put his mind at ease...

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,290
and lure him
into investing everything he has.

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,090
Just wait.

32
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,090
We're going to make a fortune,
all thanks to me.

33
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,760
It's him.

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,300
Yes, Mr. Choi.

35
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,800
I was actually just thinking about you.

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,670
What's up?

37
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,240
What? Now?

38
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,150
(Flower Wagon Bar)

39
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,350
We have no idea where he is now.

40
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,760
He ran off with so much money.
Why would he show up?

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,890
I bet he's holed up somewhere
where no one knows who he is.

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,530
Please find him.

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,500
That jerk ran off with the money
for my daughter's tuition...

44
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,410
and my husband's severance pay. All of it!

45
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,010
We're sorry.
We are trying to track him down.

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,040
We'll do our best to find him
as soon as possible.

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,510
Yes, please find him.

48
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,510
My gosh.

49
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,890
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

50
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,990
Who are you looking for?

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,060
His name is Jang Tae Poong.

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,190
He has a history of fraud.

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,430
Jang Tae Poong?

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,070
That is the name of the guy
we're trying to track down.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,410
Hold on.

56
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,540
Aren't you Han Mu Chul?

57
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,410
You know, Jang's accomplice.

58
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,550
Come on, honey.
That man died a while ago...

59
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,250
That's strange.

60
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,720
He does look so much like him.

61
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,590
No way. There's no way he's Han Mu Chul.

62
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,930
Hold on. Let me check.

63
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,330
Hey!

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Hey, wait.

65
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,430
Hey!

68
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,810
still remember me.

69
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,280
Oh, boy. What should I do now?

71
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,800
Where are you going?

72
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,330
I'm meeting someone. What about you?

73
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Me?

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,130
Oh, I have a blind date.
I told you earlier.

75
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
My gosh.

Hey, you. Yes, I'm on my way now.

78
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,850
Right.

79
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,180
He'll get there right on time too?

80
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,050
Okay, I'll be there.

81
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,620
Hey, you...

82
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Forget it.

83
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,300
Suit yourself. Do whatever you want.

84
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,610
Hey, sorry, Min Yong.
I was just talking to someone.

85
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,080
By the way, what's going on?

Hey, Min Yong.

89
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,740
How many of your friends are coming?

90
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,000
Will this be enough?

91
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,970
Sorry, Uncle.

92
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,080
Actually, I only invited one friend.

93
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,810
What? One?

94
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,350
It's my best friend.

95
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,020
Gosh, had I known,
I would've prepared less stuff.

96
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,390
I'm curious, though.
Who is Min Yong's best friend?

97
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,190
Hey, Gyu Tae.

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,430
Oh, you came together.

99

Who is that woman?

100

Just someone.

101
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,730
Min Yong, say hello. This is Mrs. Taylor.

102
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,470
So, you're Min Yong.

103
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,270
It's nice to meet you.

104
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,880
My son is rather shy.

105
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,680
He takes after me,
so he just freezes up...

106
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,410
when he sees a beautiful woman.

107
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,750
By the way,

108
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,650
why aren't your friends here?
Why is it just us?

109
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,590
Oh, Min Yong says
his best friend is coming later.

110
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,890
What? His best friend?

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,490
Oh, my friend is here.

112
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Over here.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,270
Oh, my.

114
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,770
What is he doing here?

115
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,780
Gosh, and that woman is here too.

116
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,180
(Happy 17th birthday to Choi Min Yong.)

117
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,910
- His birthday?
- Why is she here?

118
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,080
Did you invite her?

119
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,820
No, I didn't.

120
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,220
I invited her.

121
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,450
What?

122
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,090
Min Yong.

123
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,490
Thanks for coming.

124
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,960
Was it your birthday today?

125
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,230
Then, you should've told me.

126
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

127
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,740
Let me introduce her to you.

128
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,900
This is my best friend,

129
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,410
Ms. Hwang Geum Ok.

This is my favorite person in the world,
and I respect her more than anyone.

131
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,120
Hello.

132
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,450
I guess we all know each other already.

133
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,220
I thought you were going on a blind date.
Why did you come here?

134
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
Didn't you come to the wrong address?

135
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,490
The thing is...

136
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,430
Dad, don't be like that. She's my guest.

137
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,030
I invited her.

138
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,200
Oh, is that so?

139
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,370
Was Min Yong the person
you were going to meet earlier?

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,040
Goodness, you should've said so!

141
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,870
Then, we could've come together.

142
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,110
Oh, dear.

143
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,680
Aren't you open for business today either?

144
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,220
No, we're not open.
We're not done with the renovations yet.

145
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,560
I see. Did Ah Jin go somewhere?

146
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,400
She said she was going straight home
after running some errands.

147
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Why?

148
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,200
Is that so? Then, it's fine.

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Excuse me.

150
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,640
Oh, Mr. Choi.

151
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,510
Hey, Ah Jin...

152
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,450
Is that really you, Ah Jin?

153
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,320
You look so pretty.
I barely recognized you.

154
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,020
Come on.

155
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,620
I thought you were going straight home
after running some errands.

156
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,690
I guess you came back.

157
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,220
Who said I was going straight home?

158
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,700
Just call me Dong Min now, not Mr. Choi.

159
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,130
Okay, then, Dong Min.

160
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,770
By the way,

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,340
about your first love. Is that really me?

162
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,040
That's what you said yesterday.

163
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,110
Stop bringing that up. It's embarrassing.

164
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Okay.

165
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,120
But do you have a boyfriend right now?

166
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,890
No, I don't.

167
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,420
What about you?

168
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,490
Do you have a girlfriend?

169
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,060
Me? Well...

170
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,890
It's a secret.

171
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,500
What's that? I told you honestly.

172
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,530
What? A secret?

173
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,270
What a jerk.

174
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,440
I should get to work now.

175
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,940
There's a lot to prepare
before we can open for business.

176
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,310
Okay, I have to get going too.
I'll see you again tomorrow.

177
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,380
Bye, Dong Min.

178
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,350
Okay.
Hey, you look really pretty today. Bye.

179
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,890
Gosh, how shameless.

180
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,490
What are you talking about?
Who's shameless?

181
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,290
You didn't know that guy has a girlfriend,
did you?

182
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,800
A girlfriend?

183
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,360
I overheard him
talking on the phone twice.

184
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,370
He was calling her "sweetie" and all that.

185
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,740
Then, I guess he does.

186
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,410
Doesn't that bother you at all?

187
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
What about it?

188
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,010
Just peel all the onions by today.

189
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,020
Do you get it now?
That's the kind of guy your first love is.

190
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,390
Hey, Ye Won.

191
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Did you meet him?

192
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,230
No, not yet.

193
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,560
But who is this person I'm meeting today?

194
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,670
Just meet with him.

195
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,870
He's an important person
in terms of our business expansion.

196
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
Excuse me.

197
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,410
Are you CEO Kim Seok Jin?

198
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,650
Yes, that's me.

199
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,320
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Seok Jin,
the CEO of Farm to Market.

200
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
So,

201
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,790
you want your business to become...

202
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,460
a top-tier e-commerce company
like Shopping Farm?

203
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,930
Yes, sir. As of now,
we only sell food products,

204
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,470
but we'll expand our product line...

205
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,470
in order to become a distribution company
that delivers all kinds of items...

206
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,840
one would need for everyday life.

207
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,410
Aren't you getting too ahead of yourself?

208
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,180
You only started recently.

209
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,780
I believe one can't carve out new markets
by following paths that already exist.

210
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,020
One must boldly undertake adventures
that others do not...

211
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,690
for new paths to open up.

212
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,420
Did you come here knowing who I am?

213
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,290
No, sir. I haven't heard anything
besides the fact that you're...

214
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,760
the CEO of a logistics company.

215
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,930
I see.

216
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,140
Here.

217
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,570
(K.Win Logis, CEO Park Ji Hwan)

218
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,910
The CEO of K.Win Logis?

219
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,750
That's right.

220
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,520
But, K.Win is...

221
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,790
one of the top three companies
in the nation.

222
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,090
But how did you come to know
about our company?

223
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,360
I hear you and Ms. Park Ye Won
are co-owners.

224
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,330
Yes, that's right.

225
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,100
I was curious how you knew Ms. Park.

226
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,730
Dad.

227
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,570
Ye Won.

228
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,210
Did you have a good talk with Seok Jin?

229
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,710
You weren't too hard on him, were you?

230
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,350
Of course, I should be meticulous
when it comes to business.

231
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,220
What is going on?

232
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,850
My dad is the CEO of K.Win Logis.

233
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,690
She just told me to meet with you,
so I didn't expect much,

234
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,560
but I can see that my Ye Won is working
with a very reliable business partner.

235
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,670
Right. A young entrepreneur
should be bold like you.

236
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,740
You left quite an impression on me today,
Seok Jin.

237
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,210
Thank you, sir.

238
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,350
Then, I'll head in first.
You guys can take your time.

239
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,950
Okay. Bye, Dad.

240
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,450
Goodbye, sir.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,070
Hey, Park Ye Won.

242
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,900
Sorry, you must've been taken by surprise.

243
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,610
I was going to tell you sooner,
but I couldn't find the right time.

244
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,710
But still, how could you lie to me
about something like this?

245
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,680
I didn't lie to you.

246
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,750
At first, I studied abroad
without any help from my parents too.

247
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,220
What you saw is exactly who I am.

248
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,450
Are you mad at me?

249
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,290
I'm not mad,

250
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,060
just surprised.

251
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,330
The Park Ye Won who had ramyeon with me
for quick meals...

252
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,500
and cried because
we didn't get any investments was...

253
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,900
the daughter of the CEO of K.Win Logis?

254
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,900
That's why I'm telling you now,
so you won't be surprised anymore.

255
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,140
Should I get down on my knees
or something?

256
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,010
Will you stop being mad
if I kneel down and beg?

257
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,610
What are you saying?
Why would you kneel down?

258
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,180
Then, just let this one go. Okay?

259
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,310
Come on, Seok Jin.

260
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,590
So, that brat Mi Ja got divorced?

261
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,760
And yet,
she didn't say a word about it to me?

262
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,590
Oh, hello.

263
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,860
Hi.

264
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,800
I guess you did some laundry.

265
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Here, I'll carry it for you.

266
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,030
- No, it's fine. I'll do it.
- Goodness.

267
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,870
- Give it here. I'll carry it for you.
- Gosh, I said I'd do it myself.

268
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,710
- Come on, I'll help...
- Hey, why are you doing this? My gosh!

269
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,470
Good grief!

270
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,680
Gosh, I can't believe this.
What am I going to do with this laundry?

271
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,880
Oh, I'm sorry. It's my fault. I'll do it.

272
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,920
Goodness, I said I'd do it. Leave it.

273
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,450
My gosh.

274
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,460
Goodness. I'll have to wash these again.

275
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,190
I've always said I didn't like her.

276
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,630
She really has a knack
for doing things that annoy me.

277
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,570
Seriously, she's never any help.

278
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,270
Goodness! What will I do?
This is so annoying.

279
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,480
I want to win Mother's favor.

280
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,110
Why do I keep causing trouble instead?

281
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,820
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

282
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,990
I got you this for your birthday.

283
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,950
I got you a pair of sneakers last time,

284
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,290
so I bought some clothes
for you this time.

285
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,060
I hope you like them.

286
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,600
Just thank her and take the gift.

287
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,330
Thank you.

288
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,140
Lucky you, Min Yong.
You got a birthday gift.

289
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,980
She's someone your father cares about,
so be nice to her.

290
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,540
Who knows? You might be
calling her "Mom" before long.

291
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,050
My gosh. You're putting him on the spot.

292
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,820
Please don't do that.

293
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,550
Also,

294
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,990
I've received many gifts from Mr. Choi,

295
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,260
so this is nothing.

296
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,730
To tell you the truth,

297
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,560
this was...

298
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,500
also a gift from Mr. Choi.

299
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,800
Oh, that's beautiful.

300
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,300
My gosh. You got her such a nice gift.

301
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,170
You have a good eye, Gyu Tae!

302
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,170
Oh, yes.

303
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,910
Well, I should get going.

304
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,610
I've left the cafe empty for too long.

305
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,350
What? You're leaving already?

306
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,720
I'm sorry, Min Yong.

307
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,490
I'll call you later.

308
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,320
Wait, but...

309
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,260
She should've left right away.

310
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,300
What a way to ruin the occasion.
What is this?

311
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,300
Eat up, Mr. Choi.

312
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,040
Yes. Let's eat.

313
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,610
Hey, Mu Chul.

314
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,180
How did it go?

315
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,280
Well, I went to the bar you mentioned...

316
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,950
- and found out about this guy.
- Okay.

317
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,790
But then, I went to the police station
and ran into some of the creditors.

318
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,560
- What? Creditors?
- That's right.

319
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,360
They recognized me, so I ran out of there.

320
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,860
I didn't know what it'd be like
when I just heard about it,

321
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,660
but seeing how they recognized me,

322
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm honestly shocked.

323
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Hold on.

324
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,770
I guess I went to that bar
to meet Jang Tae Poong,

325
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,770
but what about you?

326
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Why did you go there?

327
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
Me?

328
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,980
Well, what happened was...

329
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,850
You called me there.

330
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,350
I did?

331
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,020
But why?

332
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Here.

333
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,930
Take it.

334
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
What is this?

335
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,200
So,

336
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,400
if this is actually a winning ticket,

337
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,570
you have to split it evenly with me.

338
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
All right?

339
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

340
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,280
It was so long ago that
I don't really remember what happened.

341
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,080
Really?

342
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,420
Well, there's nothing
we can do about that.

343
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,820
I may not remember what happened,

344
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,850
but I'll do my best
to help you with everything else.

345
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,360
So, don't hesitate to let me know
if you need my help with anything.

346
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,890
Okay, thanks.

347
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Oh, boy.

348
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
My gosh.

351
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,450
Honey, just forget about it.

352
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,280
I shouldn't have brought this up.

353
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,290
No, you're totally right.

354
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,060
What? Honey, where are you going?

355
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,560
You're home.

357
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,730
Yes. Where is Ji Woo?

She's playing in the room.

359
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,270
Mom, Dad.
We want to talk to you about something.

360
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,410
What is it? Take a seat and tell us.

361
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,640
Why? Is something the matter?

362
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,120
Well, about the 500,000 dollars
you mentioned.

363
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,690
We thought about it,
and we don't think we can accept it.

364
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,360
What? Are you saying
you guys don't want the money,

365
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
like Ah Jin?

366
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,860
No, it's not that.

367
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,860
Can't I also get five million dollars,
like Seok Jin?

368
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,130
What? Five million dollars?

369
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,940
Five million?
What on earth are you talking about?

370
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,670
First, give us five million dollars.

371
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,340
Then we'll pay back 4.5 million,
like Seok Jin is doing.

372
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,710
How in the world will you guys
pay back 4.5 million dollars?

373
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,710
Why do you suddenly need
five million dollars?

374
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,110
Did you cause more trouble?

375
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,410
No, it's not that.

376
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,150
The thing is,
Gwang Sik wants to start his own business.

377
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,390
Business? That idea you told me about?
With edible insects or whatever.

378
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,760
No, not that.
This is guaranteed to do very well.

379
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,030
It's a restaurant
that specializes in Hanwoo beef.

380
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,270
A friend of mine started this business
and is making a killing now.

381
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,070
Please have a look at this.

382
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,180
You see, I didn't know, but it looks like
he has prepared a lot for it.

383
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,510
He told me his plan,
and I really think it'll do well.

384
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,880
Please trust me
and invest in his business. Please?

385
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,050
No.

386
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,650
Running a business isn't for everyone.

387
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,390
A lot of people jump in blindly
and lose everything.

388
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,030
Stop wasting time daydreaming
and get a proper job.

389
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,100
Father, could you please...

390
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,430
read my business proposal just once?

391
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,330
I said, no.

392
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,100
Starting a business is
definitely out of the question.

393
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,440
Why can't he do it? Seok Jin is doing it.

394
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,040
Gwang Sik's case is different
from Seok Jin's.

395
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,810
Seok Jin specialized in management
and also studied abroad.

396
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,450
Even for someone like him,
running a business isn't easy.

397
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,650
How's Gwang Sik going to start
and run his own business?

398
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,920
- We're home.
- We're home.

399
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,560
Having a good educational background
doesn't guarantee success.

400
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,500
Who knows? Gwang Sik might be
more business-savvy than he is.

401
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,470
Why won't you even give him a chance
and just keep saying no?

402
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,000
Everyone has their own strengths.

403
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,540
You should never bite off
more than you can chew.

404
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,510
Jumping into it recklessly
won't do you any good.

405
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,540
And you, Gwang Sik.

406
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,380
Even if she said you should do this,
you should've stopped her.

407
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,450
Did you egg her on?

408
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,650
- No...
- Why are you blaming him?

409
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,150
He won't run the business by himself.

410
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,560
We'll do it together.
We'll be business partners.

411
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,190
What? Business partners?

412
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,790
Listen, Mi Jin.

413
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,930
Do you think
money can solve every problem?

414
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,400
Come to your senses, please.

415
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,110
We want to pull ourselves together
and do this!

416
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,810
If we get enough support like Seok Jin,
we can do it too.

417
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,680
Don't belittle us.

418
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,610
What? Who belittled you?

419
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,550
Hey, why are you being like this?
You know that is not what he meant.

420
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,280
This is my first time asking you for help.

421
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,490
I've always put
Seok Jin and Ah Jin first...

422
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,120
and never got my turn, so I gave up.

423
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,190
This is my first time
claiming what I rightfully deserve.

424
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
Is it that hard to give it to me?

425
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,200
Is it that difficult for you?

426
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,800
This time, I will not back down.

427
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,740
I must get five million dollars from you,
just like Seok Jin did.

428
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,810
This conversation is over.

429
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Wait, honey.

430
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,410
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,660
My gosh, I'm starving.

432
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,690
I haven't eaten anything all day,
and now I'm feeling dizzy.

433
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,230
Mi Ja.

434
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,630
Shall I make some bibimbap for you?

435
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,080
You know, I make mean bibimbap.

436
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,840
All right.

437
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,250
Give me a minute.

438
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,350
Let me mix this to perfection.

439
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,190
A drizzle of sesame oil.

440
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,860
What's wrong with me?

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What would you like?

442
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,540
I'll take some nice plums.

443
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,450
Oh, you're here.

444
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,150
Yes.

445
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,020
Here, have a seat.

446
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,690
I was just about to head inside.

447
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,390
Wait, about Mu Chul...

448
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,520
Is he all better now?

449
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,030
Yes, I think so.

450
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,390
Are you worried about him?

451
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,200
Gosh, no.

452
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,570
Are you worried about something, Dae Sik?

453
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
I just have a lot on my mind.

454
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,170
If you're worried about him,

455
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,010
why don't you visit him at his new place?
I'll give you the address.

456
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,910
No, I'm not going there.

457
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,950
If I go there, I'll end up getting hurt.

458
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
What?

459
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,990
What do you mean you'll get hurt?

460
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,790
I have...

461
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,160
this jinx...

462
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,890
of being betrayed by the ones I like.

463
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,460
Do you remember? Back in high school.

464
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,200
I sent you a note asking you out,

465
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,500
but you blew me off.

466
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,810
That was the beginning.

467
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,810
The beginning of my jinx.

468
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,150
Am I too early?

469
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,950
Dae Sik...

470
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,330
What are you doing here?

471
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,800
Dae Sik said to give you this.

472
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,000
Dae Sik?

473
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Yes.

474
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,270
Lee Mi Ja.

475
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,540
You're not my type.

476
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,710
So, don't ask to see me again.

477
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
I don't like you.

478
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,890
Back then,

479
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,020
I thought you liked me too.

480
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,330
You never said that you liked me,

481
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,660
but I thought we had
some kind of connection.

482
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,460
Well, anyway,

483
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,900
that's when this jinx started.

484
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,710
I think you have the wrong idea.

485
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,040
I never sent you a note.

486
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,510
Pardon? What do you mean...

487
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,180
Actually,
I went to that spot that day too.

488
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,390
I was waiting for you,
but you didn't show up,

489
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,720
so I was about to go home.

490
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,620
Then, I received a note too.

491
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,590
A note?

492
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Why isn't she here yet?

493
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,200
I came right on time.

494
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Mu Chul.

495
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,010
I just ran into Mi Ja.
She told me to give this to you.

496
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
She did?

497
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,650
Yes.

498
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,790
Were you waiting for me? Sorry.

499
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,860
I was going to ask you something,
but I took care of it.

500
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,460
Just in case you get the wrong idea
about why I asked to see you,

501
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,030
I like someone else.

502
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
So, don't be mistaken.

503
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Bye.

504
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,370
I sent you a note like that?

505
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,210
That's not true.

506
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,740
I never even wrote such a note.

507
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,450
I doubt that. I'm certain I got it.

508
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,860
Mi Ja is as pretty as a plum.

509
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,070
I miss her.

510
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,770
I don't know how it happened,

511
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,840
but what's certain is...

512
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,080
that we were both there...

513
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,250
and that we waited for each other.

514
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Oh, boy.

515
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
Goodness me.

516
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,530
I never knew.

517
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,130
All this time,

518
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,040
I thought I had been rejected by you.

519
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,840
Same here.

520
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,210
I thought you had turned me down too.

521
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,900
(Good Luck!)

522
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,440
Do you really intend
to get that money from Dad?

523
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,580
Just because I have no money
and I'm mooching off our parents,

524
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,780
do you think
I'd try to take your money too?

525
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,180
You're so mean.

526
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,480
I hate you. I'll teach you a lesson.

527
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
- My gosh.
- Hey.

528
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,190
It's Choi Gyu Tae.

529
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,460
Hey!

530
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,390
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
