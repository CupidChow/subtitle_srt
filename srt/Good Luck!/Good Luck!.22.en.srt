1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,310
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,550
You mean, my husband is dead?

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,750
Yes.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,920
No.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Pardon?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,320
What makes you say this is my husband's?

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,130
It's all burnt.
I can't even tell what this is.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,190
Take this back.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,830
This cell phone was found at the scene.

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,200
It's your husband's phone, isn't it?

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,510
- Mom.
- Mom.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Ma'am?

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,310
- Mom.
- Mom, are you all right?

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,450
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Get up, Mom!

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,620
- Mom, snap out of it. Mom!
- Hey, Tae Ha!

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,720
Mom.

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,050
Hey, Seo Woo. Here.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,160
Yes.

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,530
- Oh, Mom.
- Yes.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,300
Mom, are you all right?

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,600
What happened?

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,070
Mom, you fainted. Don't you remember?

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,470
- Detective, wait!
- Mom!

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,910
- Detective.
- Mom.

25
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,210
- My husband.
- Mom, please.

26
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,840
- Please let me see the body.
- Gosh, Mom.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,510
Until I see his dead body
with my own eyes,

28
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,150
I refuse to believe that he is dead!

29
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,220
All right.

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,620
But before that,

31
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,890
if the body does belong
to Mr. Han Mu Chul,

32
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,260
do you know
why he went to the construction site?

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,930
I'm not sure.

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,470
My husband used to work
at construction sites many years ago,

35
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,840
but he has no reason to go to one now.

36
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,170
So I'm sure
that dead man isn't my husband.

37
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,980
Then why did you say to me that
your husband wouldn't be coming home?

38
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,940
That was...

39
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,680
You said that earlier.

40
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,520
You told me never to come back
because he wouldn't be coming home.

41
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,590
Well, that was...

42
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,760
The truth is,
our family fought the day before.

43
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,530
He left the house after that.

44
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,730
May I ask what you fought about?

45
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,970
Really?

46
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,740
What do we do?

47
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,340
Would you like to see him now?

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Yes.

49
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,580
What do we do now?

50
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,580
I don't believe this.

51
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,120
What are we going to do now?

52
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,060
- No...
- My goodness.

53
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260
- Mom.
- My gosh.

54
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,330
The body is severely burned,
so we can't analyze the fingerprints.

55
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,230
Please check the body and confirm it's him
to proceed with his funeral.

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,240
I know this will be hard,
but we need you to check the body.

57
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,410
But what if the man in that room...

58
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,510
isn't my husband?

59
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,510
Then what will happen?

60
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,610
Then we'll have to find out...

61
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,880
why your husband's belongings
were found there.

62
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,620
If we suspect foul play,

63
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,420
we'll have to run some DNA tests too.

64
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
However, the circumstances tell me
that isn't the case.

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,290
Pardon? What do you mean?

66
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,530
We know Mr. Han Mu Chul
was being investigated for fraud.

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,930
He might've felt pressured,
knowing that...

68
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,730
the prosecution's investigation
was about to begin.

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
What...

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,470
What you said just now...

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,640
Do you mean that he took his own life?

72
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,550
We can't rule out that possibility.

73
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,880
My goodness.

74
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,420
My dad would never do such a thing.

75
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,790
You think he took his own life
because he couldn't even handle that much?

76
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,520
He's not that weak.

77
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,460
But you said he fought with his family
the day before.

78
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,660
(Chapel of Rest)

79
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,060
A family problem
on top of financial trouble...

80
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,860
is enough to make
even a strong man crumble.

81
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,430
Also,

82
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,500
it's possible he wanted
to clear his debt through his death.

83
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,970
Who'd like to go inside and check?

84
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,740
I can't do it.

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,380
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

86
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,720
It's hard for even most men
to see a burnt body.

87
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Let your son do it.

88
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,090
He's my husband.

89
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,530
I know him better than anyone.

90
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,630
I'll do it.

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,630
All right. Then please come with me.

92
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,740
Mom, are you sure you can do this?

93
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,640
Just let Tae Ha do it.

94
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,540
Will you be all right, Mom?

95
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,150
(Chapel of Rest)

96
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,300
Are you ready?

97
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,950
Are you all right?

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,520
If it's too hard for you, take your time.

99
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,370
No, that's...

100
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,810
I cannot confirm anything
with a body in that state.

101
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,410
I know you said it was burned,

102
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,750
but he's burned so badly.

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
That man...

104
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,660
isn't my husband.

105
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,130
This.

106
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,930
Do you recognize it?

107
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,580
(Dad)

108
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,220
Ma'am.

109
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,660
No, this can't be...

110
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,900
- Mom!
- Mom!

111
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,040
- Mom!
- Mom!

112
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,110
Mom.

113
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,410
No!

114
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,010
I'll check.

115
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,350
No! Don't! Please, no...

116
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,790
What?

117
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,160
So, those men
who came to your restaurant...

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,490
were creditors chasing Mr. Han?

119
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,490
Yes, apparently.

120
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,900
My goodness. What is going on?

121
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,730
The rich and mighty Mr. Han
has been accused of fraud?

122
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,640
Speaking of which,

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,810
have you seen him recently?

124
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,780
No. I've actually been meaning to ask you.

125
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,210
There was an error on my water bill,

126
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,880
so I called him, but he didn't answer.

127
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,050
I tried calling him a few times
and texted him too...

128
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,520
but haven't heard from him.

129
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Didn't he run off
to get away from creditors?

130
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,960
That's what I think too.

131
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,990
But it looks like
his family is staying at home.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,060
Really?

133
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,770
That is odd.

134
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,570
They would've left together.
Why did he leave alone?

135
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,640
(Police)

136
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,810
What? Isn't that Mi Ja over there?

137
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,450
It is.

138
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,750
But why is she coming home
in a police car?

139
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,390
Hey, wait.

140
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,930
Excuse me.

141
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,130
How can I help you?

142
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,060
Hello, thank you for your hard work.

143
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,470
Could I ask you a question?

144
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,740
The people who just got out
of the police car.

145
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,770
Is something going on with them
by any chance?

146
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,840
Why do you ask that?

147
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,910
Well, the thing is,
I live in the same building as them.

148
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,920
I saw a police car here
a few days ago too.

149
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,690
So, I was just asking in case
something was going on with that family.

150
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,490
Did the couple perhaps...

151
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,860
have a big fight or something?

152
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,200
It wasn't a fight.

153
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,600
There has been a fatal accident.

154
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,870
What?

155
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,440
A fatal accident?

156
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,070
But then...

157
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,780
Do you mean someone has died?

158
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,050
Hey, Mom.

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,220
What's wrong, Mom? Did something happen?

160
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,530
The kids asked you a question.
Didn't you hear them?

161
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,530
Honey.

162
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,800
Mr. Han is dead.

163
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
What?

164
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,140
What do you mean by that, Mom?
Mr. Han is dead?

165
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,170
Wait, what are you saying out of the blue?

166
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,140
Why would Mu Chul suddenly die?

167
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,580
I just ran into a police officer outside.

168
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,080
That's what he told me.

169
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
What?

170
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
Yes, I'll see you there.

171
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,120
Gyu Tae!

172
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,460
Gosh, Gyu Tae.

173
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,090
Hey, why are you calling my name
for the whole neighborhood to hear?

174
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,360
People might think
I'm your long-lost brother or something.

175
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,260
So why didn't you answer your phone?

176
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,430
I was calling someone. What's going on?

177
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,900
Gyu Tae, something big happened.
The thing is...

178
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,240
- Yes?
- My gosh.

179
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,570
I can't believe it yet either.

180
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,240
What on earth is going on?

181
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,210
So what is it?

182
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,310
Why are you talking to yourself
and making me stand here?

183
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,950
So, Gyu Tae, don't be too shocked.

184
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,750
So, the thing is...

185
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,850
Mu Chul is...

186
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,890
He's dead.

187
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,420
What?

188
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,090
Hey, get out of the way. This isn't funny.

189
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,960
No. I'm not joking. It's true!

190
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,730
Okay, fine.
But it's still not funny. Move aside.

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,170
Hey, also!

192
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,640
Aren't you old enough
not to pull pranks like this?

193
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,910
You think I'm a joke, don't you?

194
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,480
Ever since we were younger,
you always pulled pranks like this on me,

195
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,040
but not on anyone else!

196
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,480
Out of my way.
I have to go and meet a client.

197
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,980
I'm not joking!

198
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,750
I just heard everything from the police.

199
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,190
- The police? Why were the police here?
- Why else?

200
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,660
That's because a man is dead.

201
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,530
Mu Chul is dead.

202
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,090
He's really dead!

203
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,060
He's no longer with us, you fool.

204
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,100
What?

205
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,330
Hey.

206
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,270
Mu Chul!

207
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,040
Han Mu Chul!

208
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,410
Mu Chul...

209
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
Tae Ha.

210
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,140
I just heard something strange.

211
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,950
Your dad...

212
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,650
I heard that your dad died.

213
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,750
Is that really true?

214
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,850
Tae Ha.

215
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,360
Tae Ha.

216
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,360
We misheard something, didn't we?

217
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,730
He isn't really dead, is he?

218
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
He is.

219
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,030
My husband...

220
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,070
is dead.

221
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,240
But why, all of a sudden...

222
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Was there...

223
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,680
an accident or something?

224
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,280
I don't know about that either.

225
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,950
Anyway, what's certain is...

226
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,620
that my husband is...

227
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,620
no longer with us anymore.

228
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,930
I've confirmed his body myself.

229
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,860
Now that you know, please leave us.

230
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,370
Hey, Tae Ha.

231
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,240
What happened?

232
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,110
How could something like this happen?

233
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,640
How could something like this happen?

234
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,210
I'm not really sure either.

235
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,950
The police said...

236
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,690
that Dad might've taken his own life.

237
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,790
What? Then...

238
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,520
you mean Mu Chul committed suicide?

239
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,230
Things must've been so stressful
since he was being chased by creditors.

240
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,770
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,380
Honey.

242
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,250
What did they say, honey?

243
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Is it true?

244
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,120
Dad.

245
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,700
You punk. How dare you feign ignorance?

246
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,100
Hey, are you running away? Darn you.

247
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,070
That jerk.

248
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,420
Hey, Han Mu Chul.

249
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,730
You mean jerk.

250
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,940
Man, you can't just leave like this...

251
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,240
after putting me through all that.

252
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,640
I was going to get revenge on you
after I made lots of money.

253
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,810
My goodness.

254
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,920
You fool. Darn you!

255
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,390
My gosh!

256
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,760
Oh, dear...

257
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,170
You punk. You've always had
a nasty way with words.

258
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,370
How dare you try to rip me off...

259
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,640
and treat me like a beggar?

260
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,110
If you have money, let me borrow some.

261
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,250
I'll be sure to pay you back later.

262
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,250
Hey.

263
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,280
I have no money.

264
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,110
I should've been nice to him.

265
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you the head mourner?

266
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,330
Did you bring a photo of your father?

267
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,800
A photo?

268
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,170
Well, we need a photo to put in the frame,

269
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,010
so we texted you about bringing one.

270
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,270
Did you not see it?

271
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,920
How come I don't have
a single decent photo of him?

272
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,590
Han Tae Ha,
what have you been doing all this time?

273
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,190
You don't even have a photo of your dad.

274
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,970
If you wanted to be treated as an elder,

275
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,940
you should behave like one!

276
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
You brat!

277
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,370
You're here.

278
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,510
Yes, things must be hard on you.

279
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,240
I don't know what to say.

280
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,410
How could something like this happen?

281
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,380
Thank you for coming.

282
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,920
Yes, don't worry.

283
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,790
We'll stay by your side and help you out.

284
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,930
If you run into any difficulties,

285
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,860
let us know anytime.

286
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,630
You too, Tae Ha.

287
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,870
Yes, thank you.

288
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,140
Mi Ja.

289
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
What on earth is going on?

290
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,610
How could something so shocking happen?

291
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Are you okay?

292
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,780
It must be so tough.

293
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,950
Goodness, hey.

294
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,420
Look how gaunt you look.

295
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,790
Why did you come so early?

296
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,960
You could've come later.

297
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,530
I came to help out.

298
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,030
Mi Ja.

299
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,130
I'm so sorry for your loss.

300
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,900
How could something like this happen?

301
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,510
Hye Sook and I are going to
close our businesses for a few days,

302
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,680
so just let us take care of things
if this is too hard for you.

303
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,080
This isn't a big deal,
so don't make such a fuss.

304
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,750
I'm fine, so you two...

305
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,280
can go and do what you need to do.

306
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,990
Or stay for some food
since you're here anyway.

307
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,390
But...

308
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,870
By any chance,
do you have any pictures of my dad?

309
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
Isn't it...

310
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,950
that photo?

311
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,620
The one we took together...

312
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,990
while climbing Mount Seorak.

313
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,460
To put it more accurately,

314
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,800
the two of us didn't want to go,

315
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,330
but Mu Chul dragged us there...

316
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,030
and forced us
to take the picture with him.

317
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,970
Yes, that's right.

318
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,710
Thank goodness
we at least had that picture.

319
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
Hey, loser.

320
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,950
I hear you live with just your grandma.

321
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,690
Do you not have parents?

322
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,790
Even so, you need to bring me money.

323
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,730
You punk. I will teach you a lesson!

324
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,730
Let him go!

325
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Kim Dae Sik.

326
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,740
What brings you here?

327
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,610
I heard someone was harassing
the transfer student.

328
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,740
Hey, no one is being harassed here.

329
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,150
Hey, country bumpkin.

330
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,050
You tell him.

331
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Well, it's...

332
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
Darn...

333
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,690
Get up.

334
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Why, you...

335
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,230
Darn you.

336
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Darn it.

337
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,010
- Come at me, all of you!
- What are you waiting for?

338
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,450
- Darn you!
- Hey!

339
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,960
Hey, are you all right?

340
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,230
- Hey, are you hurt? Let me see.
- Bring it on!

341
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,700
Here, it's just a sprain.

342
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,200
- Hey, run!
- Don't move.

343
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,390
Let me introduce myself properly.

344
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,920
I'm Kim Dae Sik.

345
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
And this is Choi Gyu Tae.

346
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,690
Gyu Tae and I live with just our dads.

347
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,730
So, you live with your grandma?

348
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
Yes.

349
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,330
If anyone provokes you from now on,
tell them...

350
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,230
you're friends with Kim Dae Sik,
the best fighter at Cheonha High.

351
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,570
Then no one will mess with you.

352
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,070
Hey, your hand.

353
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,150
Let's go.

354
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,120
Kim Dae Sik! Wait up!

355
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,060
Han Mu Chul, call him.

356
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,390
Wait up.

357
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,290
What's with that mousy voice?

358
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,500
He can't hear you like that.

359
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,560
Say it louder.

360
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,430
Wait up.

361
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,800
Wait up!

362
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,070
Wait up!

363
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,470
What?

364
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,640
Where am I?

365
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,780
Goodness. What?

366
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,050
Oh, gosh.

367
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,250
What? What on earth happened?

368
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,160
Gosh, it stinks.

369
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,260
Hold on. What? My wallet.

370
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,830
What? Oh, no.

371
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,970
My phone.

372
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,940
Darn it.

373
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,270
What on earth happened?

374
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,110
My goodness.

375
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,280
(The Best in Daeseong-dong,

(No Visitor Parking, Same Day Loans)

377
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Hey.

378
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,990
Get up.

379
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,600
This is my spot.

380
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,070
I told you to get up!

381
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Let's see.

382
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,120
(Han Mu Chul)

383
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,150
Han Mu Chul.

384
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Nice.

385
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,290
Goodness.

386
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,790
Darn it.

387
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,130
It smells awful.

388
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,830
Oh, boy.

389
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,800
Shoot.

390
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,210
Where am I right now? Goodness me.

391
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,670
I don't even have my phone.

392
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,780
This is so frustrating, seriously.

393
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,680
Darn it. Oh, no.

394
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,250
Don't block the road!

395
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Darn you.

396
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,150
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.

397
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,420
Can I borrow your phone for a moment?

398
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
- I don't have one.
- No.

399
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,420
- Pardon?
- What is that smell?

400
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,330
Who doesn't have a cell phone these days?

401
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,660
Goodness.

402
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,330
Like this?

403
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,130
Hello, excuse me.

404
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,670
I'm sorry to bother you.
May I borrow your phone for a moment?

405
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,340
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you.

406
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,310
No, don't.

407
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,680
- Let's go.
- You want to go?

408
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,880
He stinks.

409
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,250
My goodness.

410
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,950
I do smell really bad.

411
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,790
I'm starving.

412
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,730
Gosh, my legs.

413
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,340
Oh, my. I've finally made it back
to my neighborhood.

414
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,410
Oh, boy.

415
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
No.

416
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,210
I shouldn't flop down here.

417
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
I should go home,

418
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,180
wash up, and get some sleep.

419
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,320
So, just get out.

420
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,590
Get out of my life, please!

421
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,390
Right, I'm not going home.

422
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
I won't go home!

423
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,200
I'm hungry.

424
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,440
I should eat something first.

425
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Yes, I know.

426
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,080
Those people. Aren't they my tenants?

427
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,650
Life is so unpredictable.

428
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,920
I can't believe that jerk died overnight,
just like that.

429
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,460
- Goodness.
- I know, right?

430
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,790
They say
those who get badmouthed a lot live long.

431
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,790
I thought he'd live until he went senile.

432
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,160
Did they say Yieum Funeral Home?

433
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,860
Why? Are you going to go there?

434
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,270
I should. It's his funeral, you know.

435
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,070
Funeral?

436
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,270
Oh, Yieum Funeral Home is pretty close.

437
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,870
Should I go there and have some free food?

438
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,580
But whose funeral are they talking about?

439
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,010
I need to know the name of the person
to go and eat there.

440
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,080
If you want to attend his funeral,
go alone.

441
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I'm not going.

442
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,850
Why would I go to that jerk
Han Mu Chul's funeral?

443
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,920
What?

444
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,060
Han Mu Chul?

445
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,930
Why are they saying my name?

446
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,660
Woman, seriously.

447
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,060
I get that you hated him,
but you shouldn't be like this.

448
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,400
He's dead, so the least you can do
is attend his funeral.

449
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,200
Darn it. That guy, Han Mu Chul,

450
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,470
is bothering me even in death.

451
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,310
- Goodness, what a jerk.
- What? Death?

452
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,350
Me?

453
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,880
What?

454
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,430
(Good Luck!)

455
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,830
I have to pay
the building acquisition tax...

456
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,500
and sell the building soon.

457
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,000
They think I died...

458
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,970
and even held a funeral for me?

459
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,100
How could she not even shed a tear...

460
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,040
when her husband died?

461
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,070
I should go and say I'm alive...

462
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,370
- Tae Ha.
- before it's too late.

463
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,740
You're not my husband anymore.

464
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,810
