00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,240
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,210
(Episode 50)

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,980
What?

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,750
He left his phone here.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,190
Geum Ok?

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,360
Hey, Geum Ok.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,130
This is Mu Chul.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,040
Wait, why are you answering the phone?

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,710
Oh, Dae Sik just got up
to go to the bathroom.

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,510
Should I let him know that you called?

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,910
Well, no. Can't you just hurry over here?

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,780
I'm headed to your house now.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,790
What? My house?

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,790
Hye Sook, wake up. Come on, Hye Sook.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,160
- Hey, Mu Chul.
- Yes, what happened?

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,400
- What? Hye Sook?
- Gosh, Hye Sook.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,760
Mu Chul,
hurry up and take Hye Sook with you.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,070
I'm so exhausted.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,070
But... You mean me?

20
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,570
Yes.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
Gosh, Hye Sook.

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,710
Where did this guy go?

23
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,660
Hello.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,890
Oh, my.

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,030
Goodness.

26
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,290
Oh, thank you.

27
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,630
It's fine. I'll do it.

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,360
No, it's okay.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,870
Just leave it. I'll take care of it.

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,070
- Gosh, it's fine. Just leave it.
- My goodness.

31
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,470
Oh, my goodness.

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,370
Hey!

33
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,580
Why are you holding Mi Ja's hand?

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
My gosh!

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,850
Hey! Dae Sik...

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
You!

37
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,250
But this isn't...
No, don't get the wrong idea.

38
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,890
My gosh.

39
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,960
Hey!

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,820
You can't just throw her
on the ground like that!

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,830
Oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,230
Step aside!

43
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,400
- Let me help you.
- Get up. Come on.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,530
- She's heavy.
- Hey, hands off! Let go.

45
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,970
Come on, honey.

46
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,640
Why did you drink so much, woman?

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
My goodness.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,410
Oh, please!

49
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,640
Let me take care of that.

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,660
My gosh. What happened to Mom?
Did she drink?

51
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,800
- Open the door, Ah Jin.
- Okay.

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
My goodness.

53
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,940
Mom, are you all right?

54
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,140
Goodness. How much did she drink?

55
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,080
She's okay. You should go to bed.

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
All right.

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,890
What was this woman thinking,
drinking until she dropped?

58
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,360
And to top it all off,
she got home in another man's arms.

59
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,990
- Oh, dear.
- Mi Jin.

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,870
Mom's sorry.

61
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm so sorry.

62
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,980
What on earth happened?

63
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
What?

64
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,620
What happened that
you brought Hye Sook home?

65
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,290
Did Hye Sook call you
to come and pick her up?

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,690
No! Geum Ok called Dae Sik.

67
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,460
But Dae Sik was in the bathroom,

68
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,860
and Geum Ok said it was urgent,

69
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,930
so I went and brought her home.

70
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,470
Even so, how could she come home
in someone else's...

71
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,940
Unbelievable!

72
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,350
Is she mad at me?

73
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,190
I can't believe this.

74
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,390
What is Geum Ok's problem?

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,690
Why did she make my husband go there?

76
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,100
Does she think she can boss him around
because he's not her husband?

77
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,670
Did I call him my husband?

78
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,150
Dae Sik...

79
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,050
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,790
If it hadn't been for me,

81
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,660
you...

82
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,700
wouldn't have lost your mom like that.

83
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,430
Dad.

84
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,570
It's all my fault.

85
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,110
Never...

86
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,410
end up like me.

87
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,180
Never forget this.

88
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,850
Giving money...

89
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,160
can make you lose people.

90
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,630
Never...

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,000
give money...

92
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,470
to those close to you.

93
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,900
Do you understand?

94
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,400
(Kim Dae Sik)

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,490
Dad, you're still up?

96
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,330
Hey, you're home.

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Should I pour you one too?

98
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,830
No, I have to go to work early tomorrow.

99
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,610
Well...

100
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,810
About the five million dollars.

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,580
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,380
The business is doing well now,

103
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,120
so I should be able
to pay you back within a year.

104
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,250
All right.

105
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,890
Let's think about that later.

106
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Seok Jin.

107
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,130
You were...

108
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,130
really disappointed in me, weren't you?

109
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,900
Right, I'm sure you were.

110
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,140
If I had helped you guys out earlier,
this wouldn't have happened.

111
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
But...

112
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,650
I don't really know
what's going on either.

113
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,780
I really don't know...

114
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,090
what's going on with everything.

115
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,790
Honey, are you sick?

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Honey.

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Honey, you're burning up.

118
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,970
Honey.

119
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,340
Honey, are you okay?

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Honey.

121
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,110
Honey, do you want some water?

122
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,750
Honey.

123
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,880
Honey, take some medicine, okay?

124
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,280
- Take some medicine first.
- Wait.

125
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,590
Hey, she should have some porridge first.

126
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,860
She shouldn't take pills
on an empty stomach.

127
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,990
Mi Jin, have some porridge.

128
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,690
- Eat some porridge and take the medicine.
- Mom, I'll do it.

129
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,860
Give me that. I'll do it.

130
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,330
Oh, dear.

131
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,530
Honey.

132
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,550
Dad.

133
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,310
Is Mom really sick?

134
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,850
- Yes.
- I want to be with Mom.

135
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,490
No, just stay here, Ji Woo.

136
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,890
You might get sick too.

137
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,660
But I want to be by Mom's side.

138
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,730
Goodness, this is all my fault.

139
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,470
If only I hadn't been scammed
like a fool...

140
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Oh, dear.

141
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Gosh, my stomach.

142
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,860
Oh, what happened?

143
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,360
How did I get home yesterday?

144
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,530
Just have some soup.
Ah Jin made dried pollack soup.

145
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,040
No, I don't want any.

146
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,510
Oh, my head.

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,690
Hey, are you going to work?

148
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,360
Yes, I'll be going.

149
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
Ah Jin.

150
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,230
Never mind. I'll see you later.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

152
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,290
Ta-da. Let's have some coffee
before we open up.

153
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,290
Here, have some.

154
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,930
How is it?
Doesn't that totally lift your mood?

155
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,370
Yes, it tastes good.

156
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,600
Right? Doesn't it?

157
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,370
By the way,
is something going on with you?

158
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,010
You're so quiet today.

159
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,580
I was just wondering
why money matters so much.

160
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,350
What? Money, all of a sudden?

161
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,020
I wanted money to make my dream come true,

162
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,450
but if money...

163
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,290
gave my loved ones a hard time,

164
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,290
I think it wouldn't really matter
that much.

165
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,460
Hey, still,
it's much better to have money.

166
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,960
It's a hundred or a thousand times nicer
to have it than not.

167
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,100
So, were you happy?

168
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,170
Your family had a lot of money.

169
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,500
Were you happier back then?

170
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,010
Well, not exactly, but...

171
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,680
Money scares me.

172
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,780
It makes people fight and hurts them.

173
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,450
Before, I wanted to have a lot of money,

174
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,750
but now I'm a little scared.

175
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,280
Hey! Dae Sik...

176
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,910
You!

177
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,580
But this isn't...
No, don't get the wrong idea.

178
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,950
- My gosh.
- Hey!

179
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,590
Hey, man.

180
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Who told you it was okay to answer
other people's phones like that?

181
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,530
- I'll do it.
- No, it's okay.

182
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,070
Just leave it. I'll take care of it.

183
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,270
- Gosh, it's fine. Just leave it.
- My goodness.

184
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,670
Oh, my goodness.

185
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Hey!

186
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,680
Why are you holding Mi Ja's hand?

187
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,010
My gosh!

188
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,450
You've always been like this
since way back when.

189
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,320
Don't you remember?

190
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,420
During high school, you came to my house,
and without my permission,

191
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,060
you wore my shoes out
and totally ruined the soles, you punk.

192
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,730
My gosh.

193
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,860
And what about you?

194
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,000
You must think that it's good manners
to be nice to just any woman,

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,540
but that'll land you in deep waters.

196
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,740
Hey.

197
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,710
Why do you care if another guy's wife
is carrying a heavy trash bag or not?

198
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,580
Why would you hold her hand like that?

199
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,550
Oh, right.

200
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,690
Back in the day, you duked it out
with the top dog at Jeil High School...

201
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,920
because you carried
his girlfriend's bag for her.

202
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,760
And what does that have to do
with anything?

203
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,100
You were the one who brought up
your shoes from high school.

204
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,530
Gosh, you punk.

205
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,070
Goodness, forget it.

206
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,770
What would I talk about with you?

207
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,640
- Goodness.
- Darn it! Why, this...

208
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,250
- Why isn't this working?
- Hey! The pieces are flying everywhere!

209
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,950
Oh, whatever. I'll do it however I want.

210
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,620
I have some good news.

211
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,590
That company's PR team is hiring.

212
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,890
I told them about you,
like your age and everything,

213
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,960
but they said it was fine.
They want you to visit the office.

214
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,090
- The office?
- Yes.

215
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,530
Then, this must be a clerical position.

216
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,530
I guess so.

217
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,200
I could totally do clerical work.

218
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,040
Gosh, thank you so much, Gyeong Sim.
How can I...

219
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,440
I'll treat you to something huge
when I get my first paycheck.

220
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,480
- Thank you so much.
- Forget it.

221
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,750
I'll really do a good job. I can do this.

222
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,780
Gosh, my stomach.

223
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,450
Oh, my.

224
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,190
Are you going somewhere?

225
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,420
I haven't seen you this dressed up
in a while.

226
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,060
I guess you're finally getting over
your hangover,

227
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,030
seeing how you're standing up straight.

228
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,500
Did you see me when I was a bit drunk too?

229
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,440
"A bit drunk?"

230
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,140
Hey, how could you drink
until you black out?

231
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,180
Do you know how many people
have suffered because of you?

232
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,110
Suffer? What do you mean by that?

233
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,480
Get your head on straight.

234
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,280
Think and act your age.

235
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,190
Don't go around being a nasty drunk
all over the place!

236
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,490
What? "A nasty drunk?"

237
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,460
Nasty!

238
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,530
Why, that little...

239
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
My goodness.

240
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,030
What?

241
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,270
Hey, Gwang Sik.

242
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,910
Mother, did Mi Jin perhaps
drop by your place yesterday?

243
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,610
What?

244
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,380
Why?

245
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,410
I don't know what this is about,

246
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,850
but ever since she got back,

247
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,490
she's been very ill.

248
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,690
She was groaning all night with a fever.

249
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,690
She's still sick in bed now.

250
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,030
What?

251
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,100
Honey, your mother is here.

252
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,170
Mi Jin. It's Mom.

253
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,710
Mi Jin.

254
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,310
Why are you sick?

255
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,050
If anyone should get sick,
it should be me.

256
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,250
You said you'd never see me again, right?

257
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,430
You may be able to do that,

258
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,200
but I can't live without seeing you.

259
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,670
So, get better soon. Get better...

260
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,170
and hate me as much as you want.

261
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,700
Okay?

262
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,250
Here.

263
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,660
It's porridge.

264
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,120
I didn't have time to make it myself,

265
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,830
so I bought it on my way here.

266
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,160
And I happened to see a red ginseng shop,
so I bought this.

267
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,770
It's for you, Ms. Park.

268
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,500
You got this for me?
You didn't have to do this.

269
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,470
Please...

270
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,070
take good care of Mi Jin.

271
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,010
Make sure she takes her medicine on time.

272
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,180
If she doesn't get better soon,
take her to the hospital.

273
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,350
Okay?

274
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,950
Yes, don't worry.

275
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,090
All right, then.

276
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Mother.

277
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,400
Bye, Ms. Lee.

278
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,270
So, Mi Jin fell ill
after she visited her family?

279
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,270
Yes, I think so. I'm not too sure, though.

280
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,970
I think something happened
with my mother-in-law.

281
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,510
What could it be?

282
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,290
Well, she's cute and honest.

283
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,960
She's more innocent than she seems,
and she has so much charm.

284
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,000
You're the first person
I've talked to about my family.

285
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,440
I have to say,
you're different from other girls.

286
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,670
I feel comfortable when I'm with you,

287
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,380
and I feel like
I can really be myself around you.

288
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,650
Did Seo Woo get home safely yesterday?

289
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,590
Yes, you must've been surprised.
I didn't think she'd drop by so late.

290
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,490
I think it's normal for her
to be out and about late at night.

291
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,630
It's normal for her? What do you mean?

292
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,500
I've been debating
whether or not to tell you this,

293
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,030
but you should know.

294
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,470
The day we met with the client
at the bar in Boseong-dong,

295
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,770
I saw Seo Woo.

296
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,040
At the hostess bar?

297
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,910
I got there before you did, you know.

298
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,910
I saw Seo Woo
walking out of one of the rooms there.

299
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,420
I'm sure you were mistaken.
Why would Seo Woo go there?

300
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,750
At first, I wasn't sure either.

301
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,590
But then, someone called Seo Woo's name.

302
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,690
And it was her.

303
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,120
Why did she go there?

304
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,690
Was she meeting her friends or something?

305
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,900
I'm sorry,

306
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,070
but she wasn't dressed like a customer.

307
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,200
What do you mean?

308
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,140
I saw her talking to the hostess manager.

309
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,470
In my eyes,

310
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,740
Seo Woo looked like one of the girls
who work there, not a customer.

311
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,810
What?

312
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,890
Seok Jin!

313
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,790
Hey, you're here.

314
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,360
What's going on? Is this a date?

315
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,970
Seo Woo.

316
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,440
I want to ask you something,

317
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,770
but I hope it doesn't offend you.

318
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,340
What is it? Did something happen?

319
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,280
I debated
whether or not I should bring this up,

320
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,690
but I think I should ask you directly
and find out.

321
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,190
What is it? You're scaring me.

322
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Have you been...

323
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,530
to a hostess bar in Boseong-dong,

324
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,730
by chance?

325
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
What?

326
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,870
By the way,
did you go to Boseong-dong yesterday?

327
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,910
What?

328
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,210
I think I saw you there.

329
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,550
But it was pretty late at night,

330
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,320
so I was wondering if I was mistaken.

331
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,020
Did you go there by chance?

332
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,790
Did Ye Won tell you that?

333
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,830
That's not important.
Have you been to that place?

334
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,530
Yes, I have.

335
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,830
But that place...

336
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,730
Why did you go there?

337
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,070
Forget it. Let's drop this.

338
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,610
Drop what?

339
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,350
Do you suspect
that I work there or something?

340
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,120
That's right. I went there.

341
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,560
I asked a friend of mine
to help me find a part-time job.

342
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,320
She lied to me that it was a modeling gig
and called me to that place.

343
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,460
That's why I went there.

344
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
What?

345
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,330
Your friend lied to you?

346
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,030
Ye Won told you this, didn't she?

347
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,900
Then why won't you say so?

348
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,600
Why are you trying to sound me out
just based on what she told you?

349
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,140
Don't tell me...

350
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,480
you actually thought
I might be working there.

351
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,610
No, it's not that.

352
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,380
You know what? Right now,

353
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,520
I feel even more miserable
than when I realized at that bar...

354
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,950
that I had been lied to.

355
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,460
How could you, of all people,
suspect me like that?

356
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,030
Seo Woo.

357
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,400
Seo Woo!

358
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,880
Gosh, I'm sorry.
The traffic was pretty bad.

359
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,380
Welcome, Mr. Choi.
We're just getting started anyway.

360
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
I see.

361
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,450
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

362
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,420
Please take a seat.

363
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,220
Is he your secretary?

364
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,760
Oh, yes. He is my secretary and driver.

365
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,860
Yes.

366
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,260
Wait outside.

367
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,530
Yes, sir.

368
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,540
All right. Let's eat.

369
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,080
I don't believe we've met before.

370
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,150
What is your name?

371
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,720
Oh, yes.

372
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,990
Here.

373
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
I see.

374
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,530
J Jang Holdings?

375
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,430
You are CEO Jang Dong Gun.

376
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,630
Oh, I'm...

377
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,200
I'm Choi Gyu Tae.

378
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,940
(Gold Investment Group,
President Choi Gyu Tae)

379
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,540
Gold Investment Group?

380
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,310
Nice to meet you, Mr. Choi.

381
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,220
Yes, it's a pleasure to meet you.

382
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,050
Ms. Hwang.

383
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,690
Oh, ma'am. What brings you by?

384
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,960
You see, I noticed something strange.

385
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,830
It's about this building,
the Daewoon Building.

386
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,930
Mr. Choi, the realtor,
is listed as the owner.

387
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,600
Mr. Choi? You mean, Gyu Tae?

388
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
That's right.

389
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,310
My husband happened to check
the building's property deed.

390
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,850
The owner's name was Choi Gyu Tae.

391
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,950
Isn't it...

392
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,750
the name of the realtor
who owns Number One Real Estate?

393
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,790
Yes, it is.

394
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
That's odd.

395
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,860
Why is Gyu Tae's name on the deed?

396
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,830
(Number One Real Estate)

397
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,030
What?

398
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,170
What?

399
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,970
He's never here these days.

400
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,480
It's really strange.

401
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,450
I'm on my break now,

402
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,780
so I'm going to step out.

403
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,550
Where are you going?

404
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm going downtown
to get Mi Ja's birthday gift.

405
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
Whatever. Suit yourself.

406
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,400
By the way, is Hye Sook not coming today?

407
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,330
Oh, right.

408
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,100
Is she still hungover?

409
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,140
See you later.

410
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,010
(Jackpot Chicken)

411
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,450
Hello, here...

412
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Wait, please...

413
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,130
Hello, here.

414
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,240
What is this?

415
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,270
My gosh.

416
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,410
Thank you.

417
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,610
- Why are you blocking my way?
- Oh, no!

418
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,030
I knew you'd do this.

419
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,990
Didn't you beg me to hire you?

420
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
What were you doing?

421
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,870
Well, please don't get the wrong idea.

422
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,670
Are you out of your mind?
Why would you chuck these in the trash?

423
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,640
Do you know how much these cost per page?

424
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,080
I'm sorry.

425
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,580
But you see,

426
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,620
I don't think I can do this.
I had no idea this was part of the job.

427
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,620
I came in because I thought
this was a desk job.

428
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,220
Lady.

429
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,120
Wake up and smell the roses.

430
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,190
Who would be crazy enough to hire
a woman who's nearly 60 for a desk job?

431
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Whatever.

432
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
Just pay for these and go.

433
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,230
Pardon?

434
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,700
Pay for the flyers you thew away
in the trash before you go!

435
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,370
Okay, I'll pay you back.

436
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,740
But I don't have the money right now.

437
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,880
I'll call you once I get home.

438
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,420
Where do you think you're going?

439
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,850
Wait, what are you doing?

440
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,590
- Are you trying to run away?
- Look over there.

441
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,260
Didn't you hear me say to pay for these?

442
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,830
- What's going on?
- Oh, okay.

443
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,700
I'll pay you when I get home.

444
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,630
So, please just let me go home for now.

445
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,230
- What's going on?
- Is she in trouble?

446
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,570
- I'm not sure.
- I wonder what it's about.

447
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,140
Why, this woman...

448
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,010
- Save me!
- Hey!

449
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,280
Hey, did you see that?

450
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,810
He just knocked that guy out.

451
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,450
- Don't you dare...
- Who is that man?

452
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,150
lay a hand on my woman!

453
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,750
Mu Chul?

454
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,550
(Good Luck!)

455
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,260
When you manage my schedule,

456
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,260
make sure to include
Min Yong's hospital appointments.

457
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,290
Don't forget.

458
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,660
If you're my boyfriend,
you should consider my feelings first!

459
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,130
Why are you trying to make me understand
what she's going through?

460
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,230
Let's just end things
if you're going to keep acting this way.

461
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,070
I won't let it slide...

462
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,770
if you make Mi Jin cry.

463
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,880
