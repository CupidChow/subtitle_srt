1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,110
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,080
This way, sir.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,580
Gosh, he's a very important client.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,790
My goodness. The branch manager
is greeting that man in person.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,250
He must have a lot of money.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,060
Sir.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,190
Yes.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,060
Hello.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,630
Wait, isn't that...

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,870
Dae Sik?

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,100
I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,710
- Sure.
- Yes.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,310
Gyu Tae. That man is...

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,180
Mr. Kim from Jackpot Chicken, isn't he?

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,790
Your friend.

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,990
(Jackpot Chicken)

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,960
(Jackpot Chicken)

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,360
Why do they keep giving me these things?
It makes me uncomfortable.

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,700
My goodness.

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,100
Welcome.

21
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,740
Hello.

22
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,470
My gosh.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,940
Oh, yes.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Hello.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,480
What brings you by?

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,780
If you're not busy now,

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,050
could we go to my place together?

28
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,290
What? Your place?

29
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,060
Hey, that friend of yours we saw earlier.

30
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,930
Isn't he the one
who runs the fried chicken joint?

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,700
Why did the branch manager
take him to his office?

32
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,670
Right?

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,970
I'm curious too.

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,350
What? Isn't that Dae Sik?

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,650
That's right. I saw him
in front of the VIP room that time too.

36
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,790
What?

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Let's hurry.

38
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,350
Oh, okay.

39
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,600
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,000
- You can go.
- Okay, see you later.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,540
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

42
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,170
I guess you had to go somewhere.

43
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,840
Yes, I had to take care of something.

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,010
Hey, it looked like...

45
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,780
you stepped out earlier.
You're back already?

46
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,080
Did you have to meet someone?

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
What?

48
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,890
Yes, a friend of mine. Why?

49
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,650
Oh, a friend?

50
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,520
Mr. Choi, is that your car?

51
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,990
Yes, it's my car.

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,590
I bought it recently.

53
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,660
Anyway, where are you two headed?

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Well...

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,200
Mu Chul is hurt.
He's bedridden at home now.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,200
Mu Chul is hurt? What happened?

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,870
I'll fill you in later.

58
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,570
Let's go and see him now. Let's go.

59
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,570
Okay.

60
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,950
Mu Chul. Come on in.

61
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,150
- Your friends are here.
- Oh, okay.

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,320
- Have a seat.
- Sure.

63
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,850
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

64
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,660
Oh, boy.

65
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,290
I'm sorry. I can't get up now.

66
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,490
Hey, what on earth happened?

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,430
Goodness.
This looks more serious than I thought.

68
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,430
Hey, you can't even sit up?

69
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,070
No, I slipped and fell while cleaning.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,100
I hurt my back and arm.

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,470
Did you see a doctor?

72
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,940
Right.

73
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,240
You can't go to the hospital.

74
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,150
Who knows?
He might be able to receive treatment.

75
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,880
Let's go. Staying in bed won't help.
We'll take you to the hospital.

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,620
I already went to the hospital.

77
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,320
What? You did?

78
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,330
What did the doctor say?

79
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,490
A police officer showed up,

80
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,630
so I came home
without receiving treatment.

81
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,400
Even without the police showing up,

82
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,400
I wouldn't have been treated
because I'm listed...

83
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,770
as deceased in the system.

84
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,440
That said,

85
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,470
I want to cancel...

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,910
my death registration.

87
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,340
What? You want to cancel
your death registration?

88
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,310
Yes.

89
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,250
I wish to restore my identity...

90
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,120
and make a fresh start.

91
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,420
I want to face Mi Ja and the kids...

92
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,560
with confidence
as a responsible husband and father.

93
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,290
Guys,

94
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,690
please help me out.

95
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,100
Then you may have to repay your debt.

96
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,070
I will pay it off.

97
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,140
Even if it takes ten years... No.

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,170
Even if it takes a hundred years,
I will pay it all off.

99
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,780
My name, Han Mu Chul.

100
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,610
I will reclaim my name.

101
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,590
What can I do to reclaim my identity?

102
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,820
Can you guys look into it for me? Please?

103
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,190
Oh, dear.

104
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,070
That punk.

105
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,940
Not being able to get treatment
at the hospital must have really hurt him.

106
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,310
Right, you said all of Mu Chul's buildings
except for the Daewoon Building...

107
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,180
have been auctioned off.

108
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,950
Not all of them.

109
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,950
Only eight of them.
Another building got sold.

110
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,050
Another one got sold?
Besides the Daewoon Building?

111
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,790
Which one?

112
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,120
Is that important?

113
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,690
Anyway, eight buildings formerly owned
by him were put up for auction.

114
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,890
I'll look into it.

115
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,930
All right, find out as much as you can.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hey.

117
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,970
You said
you went to meet a friend earlier.

118
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,180
Yes. What about it?

119
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,650
Do you meet your friends at the bank?

120
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,050
In the VIP lounge, at that?

121
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,790
What on earth are you talking about?
How random.

122
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,290
I saw you there!

123
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,130
The branch manager said
you were an important client...

124
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,290
and took you to his office.

125
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,560
What was that about?

126
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,570
You're hiding something, aren't you?

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,010
Let's go to my restaurant.
We'll talk there.

128
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,870
What? Hey, just talk here.

129
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,740
Why are you an important client?

130
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,210
Hey, Kim Dae Sik!

131
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,180
Hey, Dae Sik!

132
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,580
Let's just talk here! Hey.

133
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
My gosh.

134
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,120
(Jackpot Chicken)

135
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,260
What? You...

136
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,690
won the lottery?

137
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,660
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

138
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,500
How much did you win?

139
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
A million dollars?

140
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,710
Two million?

141
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Five million?

142
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,410
No way.

143
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,750
It can't be ten million dollars, right?

144
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,660
Is it 10 million dollars?
Did you really win 10 million?

145
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,690
No.

146
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,460
Of course, it isn't.

147
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,160
Gosh, I thought you had won
ten million dollars. I was so surprised!

148
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,700
After taxes,
it's a little over 23 million dollars.

149
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,070
Right. After taxes, 23 million...

150
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,110
What?

151
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,410
What did you just say?

152
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,610
What? How much?
Did you just say 23 million dollars?

153
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,620
To be honest, I bought my house
with the lottery winnings too.

154
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,420
It wasn't an inheritance from my dad.

155
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,490
My gosh!

156
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,630
Hey. Oh, my.

157
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,030
You were surprised, weren't you?

158
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,630
Hey! This is beyond surprising.

159
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,400
How could you keep
something this huge from me?

160
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,070
Gosh, 23 million!

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,740
Twenty-three million!

162
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,810
Hang on a minute. Anyway,

163
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,420
it's a bit late, but first things first.
Congratulations.

164
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,250
Right. Thanks.

165
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,520
Then, are you saying...

166
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,530
you have 23 million dollars
in the bank right now?

167
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,100
No, not that much.

168
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,740
I bought the house
and used some of it on other things.

169
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,200
Anyway, you must still have
over ten million dollars.

170
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,770
Well, sure.

171
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,280
Gyu Tae, don't tell anyone...

172
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,250
that I won the lottery.

173
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,720
No one knows about this
outside of my family.

174
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,290
I'm really trying to keep this...

175
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,490
a secret for life.

176
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
A secret?

177
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
If...

178
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,130
this information gets out,

179
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,500
I'm going to suspect you.

180
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,860
Hey, are you threatening me right now?

181
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,700
Come on. It's not a threat.
I'm just asking you to be careful.

182
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,210
Hey, putting that aside,

183
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,010
where did you buy that lottery ticket?

184
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,250
- What?
- I'm going to buy one too.

185
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,020
You know how it is.
There are lottery stores...

186
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,020
that always sell the winning tickets.

187
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,450
Tell me. Where did you buy it?

188
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,850
That place is...

189
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,760
Where is it?

190
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,790
- Why?
- I don't know. It's been too long.

191
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,960
Come on, man! You're so mean!

192
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Hey, I bet you're not telling me...

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,270
in case I buy a ticket from there
and win too.

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,370
Forget it. It's fine!

195
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,710
I don't need to win the lottery.
I have plenty of money anyway.

196
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,410
Oh, right.

197
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,250
I hear you're making
lots of money these days.

198
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,120
How on earth are you making so much?

199
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,450
It's a secret.

200
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,350
Hey, you won't tell me anything.

201
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,050
Why should I tell you?

202
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,390
You should keep in mind
that I'm almost as rich as you are.

203
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,390
If you knew about my wealth,

204
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,260
you'd be so surprised.

205
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,970
All right.

206
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,570
I'm glad that you're successful too.

207
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,740
Gyu Tae, here.

208
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,780
Congratulations to you too.

209
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,920
Punk, why is he so laid-back?

210
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,420
Is it because he has lots of money?

211
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,690
My gosh. I'm flabbergasted.

212
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,020
How could something like this happen?

213
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,060
Dae Sik used to fret about...

214
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,730
closing his restaurant
because he didn't have 100,000 dollars.

215
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,960
But now, he's a multimillionaire?

216
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,330
Don't leave me hanging, man.

217
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
All right.

218
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,580
Please choose an item.

219
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,990
Is it because she's a good listener?

220
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,790
Strangely,
I end up telling her all sorts of stuff.

221
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,530
Please check your order.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,240
What? It's that manager guy.

223
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
Hey, my love.

224
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,410
Have you been doing well?

225
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
"My love?"

226
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,110
You weren't there when I went home.

227
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,120
Did you go somewhere?

228
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,360
Yes. I miss you too, sweetie.

229
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,490
Okay, see you in a bit. Bye.

230
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,030
I've got you now. You punk.

231
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,230
Hey, you're the part-timer
at Buddumak, right?

232
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,570
Are you here to buy coffee?

233
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,440
You must have a girlfriend.

234
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,740
Well, yes.

235
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,210
Did you hear me?

236
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,910
You should watch out.

237
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Pardon?

238
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,810
I have my eyes on you.

239
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,290
What's up with that guy?
Why would he have his eyes on me?

240
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,500
What? Choi Gyu Tae showed interest
in the investment?

241
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,910
Yes, I think he'll fall for it soon.

242
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,740
Indeed.

243
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,210
My flirting must've done the trick.

244
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,610
Right now, Choi Gyu Tae...

245
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,810
bought land to invest
in the Baeheung new town development.

246
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,120
Don't ever let your guard down...

247
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,890
until we take all of that money from him.

248
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,520
All right.

249
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,190
Then, I'll be done with this gig too.

250
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,160
Don't be so upset, Eun Hee.

251
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
Gyu Tae must be busy these days.
He's hardly in his office.

252
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,370
Well, being busy
just sounds like an excuse.

253
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,110
Don't you think he just doesn't like me?

254
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,580
Hey, don't say that.

255
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,510
I'll ask Gyu Tae when I see him.

256
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,780
Don't worry too much.

257
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,480
Bye. I'll call you later.

258
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,690
Is he really not interested in her?

259
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,220
Well, Gyu Tae could feel that way.

260
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,760
It's not like he should date just anyone
because he's an older man.

261
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,860
Come to think of it,

262
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,370
he might seem like
he'd be interested in any woman,

263
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,200
but he doesn't really let anyone
into his heart.

264
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,370
How funny.

265
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,770
Does he think he's such a virtuous man?
It doesn't suit him at all.

266
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,680
What? The lottery?

267
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,220
So, you mean
Mr. Kim is a multimillionaire now?

268
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,150
Oh, right.
Dae Sik told me not to tell anyone.

269
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,620
You can't tell anyone about this, okay?

270
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,690
No way.

271
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,460
How could something like that happen?

272
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Min Yong.

273
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,730
What? Why isn't he home yet?

274
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
What?

275
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,340
Hey, Min Yong. You're home.

276
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,640
- Why are these in here?
- Yes.

277
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Hey.

278
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,920
Did you throw these out?

279
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Yes.

280
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Hey.

281
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,060
I told you these were important.

282
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,230
Why would you throw these out?

283
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,530
I don't wear stuff like this anymore.

284
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,300
So don't bring me those things.

285
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,530
You.

286
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,740
Is this how you treat things
that your father buys for you?

287
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,370
Hey.

288
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,080
Are you looking away
when your father is speaking to you?

289
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,310
Turn and face me.

290
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,050
I said to look at me!

291
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,250
Gyu Tae, what is it?

292
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
You punk.

293
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,850
I've been patient with you
for a long time.

294
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,160
Do you think you're all that?
How dare you look down on your elders?

295
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,790
Gyu Tae, please calm down.
Min Yong, hurry up and apologize!

296
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,900
You. Do you know what these shoes mean?

297
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,740
Do you know who bought these for you?

298
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,340
You should be grateful
for that person's generosity.

299
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,670
What kind of behavior is this?

300
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,010
Why should I be grateful for that stuff?

301
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,210
What?

302
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,550
Do you care more...

303
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,610
about that person's generosity
than what I'm going through?

304
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,380
Who is that person, anyway?

305
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,050
Oh, it must be a woman.

306
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,820
Was that why?

307
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,260
And who is it this time?

308
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,060
Is she prettier than Mom?

309
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,800
Figures. You don't date ugly women.

310
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,300
Is she young?

311
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,740
How great is this woman
that you can't even see straight?

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,040
You punk.

313
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,010
- Is that all you have to say?
- Please, Gyu Tae. Restrain yourself.

314
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,510
Hey, Min Yong! What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and apologize to your dad!

315
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,610
Why should I?

316
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,350
What did I do wrong?

317
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,420
What have you done for me?

318
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,350
Who cares if you bought me
a lousy pair of shoes?

319
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,690
If you like women so much,

320
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,590
go and live with them, not me!

321
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
You punk!

322
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,390
- Min Yong, are you okay?
- Why are you hitting me?

323
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,590
- Gyu Tae.
- Why did you hit me?

324
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,260
- You shouldn't hit the kid!
- Why did you hit me?

325
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,130
- Why, you punk! I really ought to...
- I was just saying it like it is!

326
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,130
- Don't you have any manners?
- I didn't say anything wrong!

327
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,770
- Min Yong, hurry up and apologize!
- Why should I?

328
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,970
- How dare you?
- Why should I?

329
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,140
- Hey.
- What did I do wrong?

330
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,510
- How dare you behave so rudely?
- I didn't do anything wrong!

331
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,240
- You brat!
- What did I do wrong?

332
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,110
- Gyu Tae, calm down. Gyu Tae!
- Why, you... How dare you!

333
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,450
- Calm down, Gyu Tae.
- Unbelievable!

334
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,080
- Let go!
- Calm down, Gyu Tae!

335
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,620
- Hey, Min Yong!
- Hey! Stop right there!

336
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,290
- Gyu Tae, please...
- Hey!

337
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Min Yong, is that you?

338
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,530
Min Yong, what's wrong?

339
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,070
Min Yong.

340
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,780
Who did this to you?

341
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,010
Stop crying and tell me!

342
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,620
Hey, Min Yong.

343
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,250
My goodness.

344
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,330
Here, have some water.

345
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,090
Here, get up.

346
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,830
You need to pull yourself together.

347
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,330
Oh, dear.

348
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,840
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

349
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,940
I'm so embarrassed
that I can't even face you.

350
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,450
Don't be. We recently
almost had everything seized too,

351
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,380
so I understand how you feel.

352
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,620
What are you going to do now?

353
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,220
You can't stay here.

354
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,270
So? You're not coming home today?

355
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
No, I'm on my way to Naju now.

356
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,340
All right, then.

357
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,570
Drive safe. I hope everything goes well.

358
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,050
Is Seok Jin away on a business trip?

359
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,950
Yes, he has to go to Naju
because of a contract.

360
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,120
Seok Jin isn't here, and Mom's gone too.

361
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,320
The house will feel empty tonight.

362
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,830
What? Mom!

363
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,830
I missed you!

364
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,430
Are you back for good?

365
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,800
Come on in.

366
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
What?

367
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,610
Hey, Mi Jin. What's going on?

368
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,010
Oh, hello.

369
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,180
My gosh.

370
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,650
Goodness, Ms. Park.

371
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,420
Hello.

372
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,550
Hello.

373
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,090
Well...

374
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,690
What brings you here?

375
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:56,540
(Seoul, Naju)

376
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,280
(Seongoh Express Bus)

377
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,650
(Seoul, Naju)

378
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,190
I don't see anyone around.

379
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,860
I can't let him be alone with Ye Won.

380
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
What?

381
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,630
Hello?

382
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,740
Where are you now?
Why aren't you home yet?

383
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,940
Hey, Mom.

384
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,670
You know my friend, Mi Sun, right?

385
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,140
Her dad passed away unexpectedly.

386
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,610
I'm at his funeral now.

387
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,280
Really? Where's the funeral taking place?

388
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,710
What?

389
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,650
I'm in Naju now.

390
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,850
Naju?

391
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,220
Naju in South Jeolla Province?

392
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,890
Are you out of your mind?

393
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,590
Don't worry.
I'm with Young Joo and Eun Hye now.

394
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,130
Do you mean
you're not coming home tonight?

395
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,800
Forget it. Get on the bus right now
and come home.

396
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,070
I can't do that.
I already came all the way here.

397
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,170
Don't worry about me. Just go to bed.

398
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,570
Bye.

399
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,510
Hey, Seo Woo!

400
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,340
I can't believe this girl.

401
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,640
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

402
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,580
- Please leave a message...
- Unbelievable.

403
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,850
Hey, Ye Won.

404
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,150
Have you arrived?

405
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,550
It must've been boring to go there alone.

406
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,020
No, it wasn't too bad.

407
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,490
I'm heading to the place
where I'll be staying tonight.

408
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,060
How did it go?

409
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,360
I finalized the contract.
Now, we just need your meeting to go well.

410
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,170
Yes, you can count on me.
I'll bring you some good news tomorrow.

411
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,970
Okay, you have to.

412
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,880
My gosh. The map says to go this way.

413
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,850
Why is it so dark here?

414
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,120
So?

415
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,590
You mean your house has been red-tagged?

416
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
I'm too embarrassed
to even face you right now.

417
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,930
Ms. Lee insisted
that I come here with her,

418
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,640
so I did, despite feeling humiliated.

419
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,140
You should sleep here tonight.

420
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,680
We can talk tomorrow.

421
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,680
Seok Jin is away on a business trip,
so his room is empty.

422
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,280
You can sleep in his room today.

423
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,220
Please come with me, Ms. Park.
Let me bring you some fresh sheets.

424
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,460
You can sleep in my room with me, Mi Jin.

425
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,300
Oh, boy.

426
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,520
What were you thinking,
bringing Ms. Park here?

427
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,380
You should've taken her
to a hotel or something.

428
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,290
She kindly let me stay with her,

429
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,120
so I want to help her out
to return the favor.

430
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,560
So, don't you dare make her feel bad.

431
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,060
Why would I make her feel bad?

432
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,470
Take care of her so she feels comfortable
while staying with us.

433
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,070
Oh, get me a glass of water
on your way back.

434
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,710
Aren't you coming back
after you give her those?

435
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,710
No, I'm not coming back here.

436
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,780
I'm going to sleep in Ah Jin's room too.

437
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
What?

438
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,920
You seem to be getting the wrong idea.

439
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,420
I'm not back
because I'm no longer mad at you.

440
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,220
I only came back with them
because I felt so bad for them.

441
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,990
So don't even think
I'm going to sleep in this room with you.

442
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,970
Suit yourself.

443
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,870
It's nice to have
the whole room to myself.

444
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,110
What did you
and your friends talk about earlier?

445
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,310
Oh, that.

446
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,980
I asked them to help me
revoke my death registration.

447
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,920
Then what about your debt?

448
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,060
If you revoke your death registration,

449
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,390
you'll have to pay off your debt.

450
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,730
Yes, I should pay it off.

451
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,800
At this moment,

452
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,430
getting my identity back
matters more than any debt I owe.

453
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,630
Who knows?

454
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,000
It could help me regain my memory.

455
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
What?

456
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,640
Will you sleep in a different room?

457
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,880
Then should I sleep here?

458
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,250
Call me over if you need something.

459
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,790
My gosh.

460
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,020
I can't even drink water
or go to the bathroom on my own.

461
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,730
What should I do?

462
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,630
Is he out of his mind?
Why would I sleep next to him?

463
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,200
Dream on.

464
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,340
Where is this girl?
She won't even answer her phone.

465
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,540
My goodness.

466
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,750
My gosh.

467
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,650
It must've really hurt.
On this handsome face...

468
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,220
Gosh, even I'm so upset.

469
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,860
Do you want something to eat?

470
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
No.

471
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,790
All right. Just get some rest.

472
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll be outside.

473
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Call me over if you need anything, okay?

474
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,950
He's not picking up.

475
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,180
Shouldn't we call the police?

476
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,380
Forget it. I don't care
whether or not that brat comes home.

477
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,850
My gosh.
Where did he go this late at night?

478
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,990
Oh, boy.

479
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,190
Hey, what's up?

480
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,030
Hey, Gyu Tae. Min Yong is at my place now.

481
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,400
Why is Min Yong there?

482
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,340
Hey, I'm coming now. Keep him there.

483
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,970
No, don't come.

484
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,010
Just let him sleep here tonight.
You can pick him up tomorrow.

485
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,410
No, I'm coming now to get him.

486
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,910
Keep him there, okay?

487
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,620
I will teach this punk
a serious lesson today.

488
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,650
- Hey, hurry up and start the car.
- Okay.

489
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,820
- I was so worried.
- I don't want to go home.

490
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,320
- Hey, come on.
- You punk.

491
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,690
Who said you could just up and leave
like that? What is this?

492
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,660
My gosh. I told you not to come.
Why are you here?

493
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,370
I told you he could stay with me.

494
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,170
When you're in the wrong,
you must apologize.

495
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,400
How dare you just up and leave?

496
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,140
- Hey, seriously.
- What?

497
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,470
- That brat.
- Hey, Min Yong.

498
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,470
- Hey!
- Min Yong.

499
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,340
- Min Yong!
- Min Yong!

500
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,340
My goodness.

501
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,150
My gosh.

502
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,690
Did you put ointment on his wound?

503
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Wasn't his face swollen?

504
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,160
He's always had such delicate skin...

505
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,390
since he was little.

506
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,070
Goodness, look at you.
So, you were worried sick too.

507
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,300
"Dad's sorry.
I was really worried about you."

508
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,670
You could've just said that.

509
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,510
Why did you have to yell at him like that?

510
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,810
Geum Ok. I'm parched.

511
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,280
Can I have a glass of water?

512
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
Well...

513
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,550
How about a drink instead of water?

514
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,390
I'm upset too.

515
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,670
Mi Ja.

516
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,570
Mi Ja!

517
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,380
Oh, dear.

518
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,510
Mi Ja!

519
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,020
Mi Ja!

520
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,360
Mi Ja!

521
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,030
Mi Ja!

522
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,400
Gosh, that hurts.

523
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,440
Mi Ja!

524
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,710
Mi Ja!

525
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
What?

526
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,390
Mi Ja!

527
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,390
What do you need?

528
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,130
My back!

529
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
Oh, no!

530
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,230
Gosh, what do I do?

531
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,610
(Good Luck!)

532
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,480
I followed you...

533
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,180
- to the pear orchard in Naju.
- Han Seo Woo!

534
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,050
I don't know where I am.

535
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,820
I'm so scared, Seok Jin.

536
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,790
They say no good
comes from raising a child.

537
