1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,470
What's wrong?

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,480
(Episode 74)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,210
(Jackpot Chicken)

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,210
What?

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,110
Are you okay?

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,020
I know.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,190
I know I was wrong.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,650
No matter how urgently I needed money
for the hospital,

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,460
I shouldn't have done that.

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,490
But what can I do about it now?

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,100
I'll live in repentance
for the rest of my life.

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,730
So, please, turn a blind eye this once.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,000
It wouldn't be bad for you
to own the Daewoon Building either.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Mu Chul.

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,280
Yes. What is it?

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,920
Say it!

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,150
I can totally understand you guys,

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
so just tell me.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
It's...

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,700
(Number One Real Estate, 669 Chicken)

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,610
(The Best Fried Chicken)

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,510
(669 Chicken)

23
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,930
What?

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,470
Mr. Choi is dating
that woman from the bar?

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,910
Why on earth
is he dating someone like her?

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,880
Hey, did you tell him
what I told you the other day?

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,510
Yes. I told him,

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,650
but he wasn't really listening.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,390
Oh, dear. He should date someone decent.

30
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,090
Why would he date someone like her?

31
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,090
You need to convince him not to date her.

32
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,090
Forget it.
It's no longer any of my business.

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,760
I don't care who he dates anymore.

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,030
Right, my friend says...

35
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,570
there are no overseas travel packages
that depart immediately.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,740
How about going somewhere
along the East Sea or the West Sea?

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,410
Yes, it'd be nice to see the ocean.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,680
I should just go somewhere close.

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,820
But why do you suddenly want to go away?

40
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,420
The truth is,

41
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,390
I want to get a divorce.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,660
What? Divorce?

43
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,800
Oh, hey.

44
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,400
Were you visiting Hye Sook?

45
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,440
Yes. Hi, Mi Ja. Are you going somewhere?

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,740
Yes, I'm just stepping out.

47
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,310
I was going to drop by
Cafe Dandelion to see you.

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
To see me?

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Why?

50
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,150
That night,

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,550
when Hye Sook got drunk,

52
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,890
I angrily asked you whether you had called
my husband to come and pick her up.

53
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,690
I lashed out at you, you know.

54
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,730
I felt so bad about that.

55
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,330
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,630
No, don't be.

57
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,170
At first, I was kind of upset,

58
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,270
but Gyu Tae comforted me,
so it was all right.

59
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,810
Gyu Tae? You mean, Mr. Choi?

60
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,910
I see.

61
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,740
You seem really close to Mr. Choi.

62
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,510
It would be nice
if things worked out between you two.

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,220
Right, what's going on
with you and Mu Chul?

64
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,150
Well, we're back together.

65
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,920
- Really?
- Yes.

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,790
I'm so happy for you.

67
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,990
My gosh. You're happily back together
with your husband, but...

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,330
Oh, you must know about
Hye Sook wanting to get a divorce.

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,670
Yes. It must be really hard
for Hye Sook right now.

70
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,670
She wants to go away alone.

71
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,010
Alone?

72
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,480
She says she wants to just take off
and go somewhere.

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,910
She wants to go somewhere
where nobody knows her...

74
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,010
so she can clear her head.

75
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,180
Oh, boy.
Anyway, she seemed really upset and sad.

76
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,260
I put them by the entrance.

77
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,460
Just keep them separate and organize them.

78
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,360
- Got it.
- Should we add more smoke?

79
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,660
Yes, for the mood...

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
One second.

81
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,100
You said you and Seok Jin
had been friends for 20 years, right?

82
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,870
Yes, what about it?

83
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,440
Even if you had been friends for 40 years,
not 20,

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,680
I can't let you cross the line
with my boyfriend.

85
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,480
So, watch yourself.

86
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,350
Cross the line?

87
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,280
If you're a friend, just act like one.

88
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,690
Don't try to hint at something more.

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,660
For this, we need more...

90
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,020
I'm stepping out for a meeting.

91
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,390
- Sure.
- Okay. See you.

92
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,230
- See you later.
- Get back safely.

93
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,830
It would be nice to have more flowers.

94
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,170
Hello, Mother.

95
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,170
My gosh, yes. What brings you by?

96
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,570
Is that really you, Ye Won?

97
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,110
You've gotten so much prettier.

98
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,240
Thank you.

99
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,350
I had a meeting nearby
and thought of you, so I stopped by.

100
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,910
I see. It's so good to see you. Sit here.

101
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,020
Okay.

102
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,290
One of my clients gave me this.
It's dried bracken fern.

103
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,490
It's dried bracken fern from Jeju Island,
so it's tender and delicious.

104
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,030
My gosh. It's such a rare delicacy.

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,300
Thank you. We'll enjoy this.

106
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,470
It's my pleasure.

107
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,200
You always sent me side dishes
and other things through Seok Jin...

108
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,670
when we were studying in the US.

109
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,570
I was always so grateful to you.

110
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,480
I felt sorry
when I heard you were there alone,

111
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,210
struggling with your studies
and living by yourself,

112
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,850
so I sent some food for you guys to share.

113
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,410
So, how are your parents doing?

114
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,350
They're doing well.

115
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,520
Your parents must be so happy
when they see you.

116
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,820
You're pretty, friendly,

117
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,130
smart, and independent.

118
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,290
You're like every parent's dream daughter.

119
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,700
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

120
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,300
Do you have a boyfriend, Ye Won?

121
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,670
No, not yet.

122
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,670
My goodness.

123
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,110
Are men blind these days?

124
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,240
How could they leave
such a great catch like you all alone?

125
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,810
Both you and Seok Jin.

126
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,050
You're too busy with work to even date.

127
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,110
That's not good.

128
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,350
Seok Jin isn't dating anyone?

129
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,620
You know how he is.

130
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,820
When I ask him, he just says
he's not interested in dating.

131
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,460
Gosh, I'm so forgetful.

132
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,020
One moment. Let me make some tea.

133
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,030
Okay.

134
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,600
Are you heading out
to go to Seok Jin's office?

135
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,100
- Yes, see you later.
- Wait.

136
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,370
- Sit here.
- Why?

137
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,370
You.

138
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,880
I was just mad at you for dating Seok Jin,

139
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,310
so maybe you don't realize
how serious this is.

140
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,420
You and Seok Jin can never be together.

141
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,620
What? Why can't we be together?

142
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,820
Your dad, Seok Jin's parents,
and I go way back,

143
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,260
and there's some unresolved issue
from the past.

144
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,730
That's why things are still a bit awkward
between the four of us.

145
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,060
An issue from the past?

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,770
No way. Did you date Seok Jin's dad?

147
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,800
Shut it!

148
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
In any case, both his mother and I...

149
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,240
are against you two dating,

150
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,470
so give up now.

151
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,780
Mom. You know I've dated many guys, right?

152
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,820
Of course, I know.
You had a different boyfriend...

153
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
for every day of the week.

154
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,850
But in the past, I never felt like...

155
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,320
I needed to be a better person
for my boyfriend.

156
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,860
I always wanted to receive more...

157
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,930
and never once thought about
doing something for the other person.

158
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,530
This time, it's different.

159
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,170
I really want to become a decent person.

160
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,440
I want Seok Jin to think...

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,470
I'm amazing and wonderful
when he looks at me.

162
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,010
I want him to think that about me.

163
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,110
That's how much I like Seok Jin, Mom.

164
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,850
So, please try to understand me, Mom.

165
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,920
Can't you just accept
that we love each other?

166
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,630
I'm begging you.

167
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,430
Get back safely.
I had a great time today, thanks to you.

168
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,430
I did too.

169
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,540
Thanks for everything today, Mother.
I had so much fun, thanks to you.

170
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,710
Visit anytime. You're always welcome here.

171
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,510
Okay, I will.

172
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,680
Hey, Seo Woo. Are you going to work now?

173
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,620
Oh, yes. Hello.

174
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,890
Oh, hi.

175
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,560
Then, are you going back to work now?

176
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,890
Yes, I am.

177
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,790
Mother, we should meet outside next time.

178
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,530
I'll treat you to something delicious.

179
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
There's a great pasta restaurant
near the office.

180
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,240
Okay, let's go there for sure.
Also, thank you for the gift today.

181
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
- You're welcome.
- Oh, my.

182
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,620
Oh, Mr. Choi.

183
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,150
What brings you to this neighborhood?

184
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,490
Hey, Mr. Kim.

185
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,090
- I was just passing through.
- I see.

186
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,320
What are you doing out here?

187
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,890
Oh, this is my friend's lottery store.

188
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,090
You know Mr. Choi, don't you?

189
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,900
Of course, I do. It's been a while.

190
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,330
Yes, hello.

191
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,270
So, how is business these days?

192
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,270
You know how it is.

193
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,670
You're doing well these days, aren't you?

194
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,340
Ever since someone won the lottery
after buying a ticket here,

195
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,210
people have been lining up.

196
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,780
You know about this, right?
The 35.7 million dollar winner.

197
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,480
That ticket was sold at my store.

198
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,190
Gosh, but some people have all the luck.

199
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,720
How did that lottery ticket end up there?

200
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Why? Who won?

201
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,060
It's this guy who came by now and then
and always chose the same numbers.

202
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,700
He said he was the owner
of the Daewoon Building.

203
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,070
- The Daewoon Building?
- Yes.

204
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,070
Hang on. If it's the Daewoon Building,

205
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,170
you must be talking about Mr. Han Mu Chul.

206
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,080
Gosh, it can't be. After Mr. Han died,

207
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,510
his family was totally ruined.

208
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,350
If he had won the lottery,
there's no way they'd be living like that.

209
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,610
What are you saying?

210
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,020
He bought it from my store.
Of course, I'd know.

211
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,890
After I saw those numbers win,

212
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,920
I thought to myself,

213
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,990
"What a lucky man.
How could he even win the lottery?"

214
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,460
What?

215
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,800
Dae Sik won the lottery
with numbers that matched...

216
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,970
the construction completion date?

217
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,370
- Yes.
- So,

218
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,870
you've always bought lottery tickets
with those numbers,

219
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,280
but Dae Sik was the one who won?

220
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,350
Well, there was only one winner.

221
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,420
I must've forgotten...

222
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,880
to buy a lottery ticket back then.

223
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,790
Wait. Then, does this mean
that lottery ticket belonged to Mu Chul?

224
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,930
You...

225
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,930
won the lottery?

226
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,900
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

227
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,670
How much did you win?

228
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
A million dollars?

229
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
Two million?

230
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,350
Five million?

231
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
No way.

232
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,990
It can't be ten million dollars, right?

233
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,290
Is it ten million dollars?

234
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,930
Did you really win ten million?

235
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,800
- No.
- Of course, it isn't.

236
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,400
Gosh, I thought you had won
ten million dollars. I was so surprised!

237
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,010
After taxes,
it's a little over 23 million dollars.

238
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,410
Right. After taxes, 23 million...

239
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,310
What?

240
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,710
What did you just say?

241
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,980
What? How much?

242
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,920
Did you just say 23 million dollars?

243
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Gyu Tae.

244
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,190
That being said,

245
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,990
Mu Chul still owes three million dollars,
you know.

246
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,030
Should we just go ahead
and pay it all off?

247
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,960
- Three million?
- You told me a while back...

248
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,500
that he was still
three million dollars in debt.

249
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,070
Looking back, I realized...

250
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,870
he helped me out a lot in the past,

251
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,540
even though I used to think
he was always walking all over me.

252
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,810
Then,

253
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,410
did Mr. Han lose that lottery ticket?

254
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,680
I heard that someone claimed the winnings,
so that could be true.

255
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,990
Gosh, I don't know
if someone found it or something,

256
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,090
- but that person totally hit the jackpot.
- Oh, my.

257
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,490
Oh, Mr. Choi. Where are you going?

258
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,330
Dae Sik.

259
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,700
Goodness, are you okay?

260
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,970
Sorry.
You must've been taken aback earlier.

261
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,340
No, that could happen.

262
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,710
Oh, I'm going to go see Gyu Tae.

263
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,980
Gyu Tae? Why?

264
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,180
I'm going to give him
some puffed rice cakes.

265
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,990
I bought some for him too.

266
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,650
I saw him yesterday,

267
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,060
and his face was a mess
like he had been beaten up by someone.

268
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,060
I don't feel so good.

269
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,860
You know, Gyu Tae...

270
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,630
You may not know about it,

271
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,740
but he has taken good care of me.

272
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,870
He found a place for me
when I was kicked out of the house,

273
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,340
and he bought me all of the furnishings
and appliances. Also,

274
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,750
he's been giving me money every month too.

275
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,650
- Money?
- Yes.

276
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,120
I went to ask him
to let me work at his office before,

277
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,390
but he said he didn't need my help.

278
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,720
He just said I should use the money
and think of it as a paycheck.

279
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,360
He gives me an emergency fund
behind Mi Ja's back.

280
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,070
Goodness, there's an endless list
of things I'm grateful for.

281
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,310

Actually, I had something to tell Gyu Tae,
but I forgot.

285
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,650
I'll go and see him first.

Then, why do you get to keep
all of that money?

You should've given
at least half of the money to Mu Chul.

I don't know what this is about,

353
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,320
but come on, guys. Let's talk it out.

354
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,530
You're not kids. Why are you doing this?

355
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,000
All right, let go of each other.

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,660
- My gosh!
- Let go! Oh, boy.

(Number One Real Estate)

358
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,400
Calm down.

359
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,210
Tell me.

360
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,580
How did you end up
in a fistfight at this age?

361
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,890
I don't know what the problem is,

362
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,760
but I'll be honest.

363
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,690
I'm hurt.

364
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,170
The three of us...

365
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,470
never kept any secrets
from each other before.

366
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
You, Gyu Tae.

367
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,410
You went to the go-go club
using the allowance your dad gave you.

368
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,680
And you, Dae Sik!

369
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,880
You got caught fighting the top fighter
from the next neighborhood...

370
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,780
and had to run ten laps
around the track at school.

371
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,480
And...

372
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,190
we even knew about
the boils on each other's bottoms.

373
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
These days,

374
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,260
I feel like you guys
have been excluding me.

375
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,700
Right, I lost my memory...

376
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,940
and don't remember anything
we went through together,

377
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,470
so what can you even say to me?

378
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,040
I've told you everything,

379
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,250
but I can tell you don't feel
the same way about me, and that...

380
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,550
really hurts.

381
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,490
Oh, boy.

382
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,190
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

383
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,770
Just pretend you never heard any of it.

Hey, Mu Chul.

388
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,470
Were you very hurt earlier?

389
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,810
I'm just upset.

390
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
It's fine, though.

391
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,280
Don't worry about it.

392
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,050
I understand we can't share everything...

393
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,920
just because we're friends.

394
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,590
I must have expected too much,

395
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,090
based only on my old memories.

(Sorry, Closed Early

or we'll lose all the customers
who come to eat here.

401
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,800
I know. What should we do?

402
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,730
First, we need
to automate the waiting system...

403
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,030
to avoid any confusion...

404
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,370
and plan our ingredient purchases
more carefully.

405
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,370
You're buying more ingredients than usual,
but it still isn't enough, right?

406
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,870
Yes.

407
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,380
First, give me the recent sales reports...

408
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,680
so I can analyze them.

409
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,380
Okay, sure.

410
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,090
- Well done.
- Thank you.

411
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,460
- Good work!
- Thank you.

412
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,630
Let's wrap up now.

413
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,760
Good work.

414
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,060
Can we talk?

415
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
What's up?

416
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,280
Please refrain from visiting
Seok Jin's place from now on.

417
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,220
Sorry?

418
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,450
I told you not to cross the line.

419
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,550
I wouldn't want to visit...

420
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,420
a guy friend who has a girlfriend...

421
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,290
because I don't want
any misunderstandings.

422
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,590
You're really mean, Seo Woo.

423
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,360
How could you try
to get rid of something...

424
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,430
that's the most important thing
in Seok Jin's life...

425
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,140
just because you don't like it?

426
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,510
The most important thing
in Seok Jin's life?

427
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,210
Do you mean you are
the most important person in his life?

428
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,480
His life can't be explained
without me in it.

429
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,480
And I'm the person
who knows him better than anyone else.

430
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
What?

431
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,260
I'm the one who knows Seok Jin best.

432
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,090
Is that so? Then tell me.

433
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,530
When was the time
Seok Jin struggled the most in life?

434
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,730
And when was the happiest time
in his life so far?

435
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,830
What did he study in college,

436
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,040
and what efforts
did he put into launching his business?

437
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,980
You only know
a tiny fraction of Seok Jin's life,

438
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,950
while we've spent most of it together.

439
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,680
You've only just gotten to know him,

440
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,480
and now you're saying,
"That's my spot. Go away."

441
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,280
Who'd accept that?

442
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,020
From now on,
don't tell me what I can or can't do.

443
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,520
It offends me.

444
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,340
You're all packed up already?

445
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,350
Mom, have you decided on your destination?

446
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,950
Yes, she's going to the West Sea.

447
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,210
I see.

448
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,280
- Dad, you're home.
- You're home.

449
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,090
Mom's leaving for her trip tomorrow.

450
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,260
Honey, let's talk.

451
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
What's going on?

452
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
No idea.

453
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
What?

454
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,740
Mr. Choi found out
about the lottery ticket?

455
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,020
He keeps asking
if I stole the lottery ticket.

456
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,450
I don't know what to do now.

457
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,250
Just tell him the truth.
You've done nothing wrong.

458
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,660
I already told him.

459
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,160
But I'm more worried about Mu Chul.

460
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,960
He still has no idea
he gave me that lottery ticket.

461
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,170
If he finds out later,
he'll feel so betrayed.

462
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,440
If you want to sever all ties
with your family, go ahead and tell him.

463
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,140
- What?
- What if Mr. Han says...

464
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,810
the lottery ticket was his
and demands half of the prize?

465
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,280
What will you do, then?

466
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,650
"I never agreed to give you
half of the prize,"

467
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,520
"so the money is all mine."
Can you say that to him?

468
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,390
You already promised...

469
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,160
to give me half of that money.

470
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,020
You also promised to give
500,000 dollars to each of our children.

471
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,760
Seok Jin has already received
4.5 million dollars.

472
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,530
Do you think you can go back on your word
and undo all of this?

473
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,400
Mu Chul may not ask for that money.

474
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,600
Mu Chul has changed
from how he used to be.

475
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,070
You never know.

476
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,740
You offered them three million,
even though they never asked.

477
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,250
I don't even need to ask what you'd do
if he were to ask for that money.

478
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,420
Decide whatever you want.

479
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,650
If all you care about is
keeping your promise...

480
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,890
to your friends and not to your family,

481
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,990
go ahead and tell him that.

482
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Seriously?

483
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,270
Mr. Choi and Mr. Kim grabbed each other
by the collar and fought?

484
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,280
That's right.

485
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,910
It was like back in high school.

486
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,380
They tussled with each other like this.

487
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,010
My gosh, but why?

488
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,850
They won't tell me, so I don't know.

489
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,890
So, that hurt your feelings again?

490
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,290
Yes.

491
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,290
I know I shouldn't let it get to me,

492
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
but I couldn't help but feel hurt.

493
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,600
Of course, it's hurtful.

494
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,430
You thought they were your best friends,

495
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,200
but they're keeping you in the dark.

496
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,000
I'd be hurt too.

497
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,600
I should have held back and said nothing.

498
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,100
My goodness.

499
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Mi Ja.

500
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,780
I want them to reconcile.

501
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,580
Got any good ideas?

502
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,450
You want to help them?

503
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,990
Yes, this is really upsetting for me.

504
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,620
When any 2 of the 3 of us
fought in the past,

505
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,590
one of us would step in to help reconcile,

506
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,260
and we'd make up,
even if it was done reluctantly.

507
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,930
I don't think that will work anymore.

508
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,700
What should you do?

509
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
Right!

510
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,450
(Mu Chul's wife)

511
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,200
Oh, hello?

512
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,570
- Mu Chul.
- Dae Sik.

513
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Oh, boy.

514
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,810
Let's go.

515
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,210
Hold on.

516
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,250
Hey, Gyu Tae.

517
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,070
(Good Luck!)

518
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,570
Mom must be having so much fun.

519
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,780
She's having a blast.

520
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,680
We should have sent her on a trip sooner.

521
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,010
Hey, wait a second.

522
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,580
I don't think I can keep hiking.

523
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,920
Fine, then. Leave!

524
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,190
I'll spend some quality time
with Mu Chul...

525
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,890
and talk about stuff
I haven't been able to tell him.
