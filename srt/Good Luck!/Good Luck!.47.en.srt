1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,110
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,580
- Hey, Gyu Tae.
- Hey.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,350
Dae Sik.
What brings you here at this hour?

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,450
Let me sleep here for the night.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,490
What?

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,690
Why would you sleep here?
You have your own house.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,290
I have my reasons.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,060
- Move aside.
- Why should I move aside? My gosh.

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,960
- Give me that.
- Give you what?

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,160
Hey, but... Why...

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,230
Come on, I need a pillow, don't I?

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,230
Wait, but...

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,900
But that's...

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,570
- My gosh, ouch.
- Goodness.

15
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,710
- Hey, that's...
- Oh, my.

16
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,110
- Did you get into a fight with Hye Sook?
- Hey!

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,910
Come on, man.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,210
- Why are you interrogating me like this?
- Hey.

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,820
- Let go. Right now.
- But...

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Hey, that's...

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,390
Oh, my.

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,620
Hey, Dae Sik.

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,290
You can't just barge in here
without even calling me first!

24
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,490
Man, you're too chatty today.

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,290
Do you have some kind of treasure
hidden around here?

26
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,730
Get going already.
I'll lock up. What's your problem?

27
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,330
But why...

28
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,540
Seriously! Why did you have to come here,
of all places?

29
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,970
Oh, this is a nice cushion.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,140
Oh, boy.

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,850
So? How are you liking school these days?

32
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,650
I just go to school because I have to.

33
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,820
What about you?
Is it nice to lounge around at home?

34
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,220
Lounge around? As if!

35
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,190
I'm your dad's driver now.
Like a chauffeur.

36
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,390
A chauffeur?
Why does Dad need a chauffeur?

37
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,360
Do you want to know what your dad does?

38
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,560
He's incredibly...
Oh, Gyu Tae. You're home.

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,260
- You're home.
- Yes.

40
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,830
Right, should I...

41
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,840
just tell him to sleep at our house?

42
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,570
What? Sleep at our house? Who?

43
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,570
No.

44
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,310
He wouldn't come even if I told him to.
My gosh.

45
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,980
No.

46
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,780
What should I do?

47
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,550
Hang on.

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Let me see.

49
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,190
Dae Sik.

50
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,820
Dae Sik.

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,470
(Gyu Tae)

52
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,180
Why isn't he picking up?

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
No way.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,780
He's not going through all of my stuff,
is he?

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,220
That cushion...
Did I close the zipper all the way?

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,360
Where's Dad?

57
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,330
No way. Has he not come home yet?

58
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,730
Did the two of you fight?

59
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,210
It seems like they fought.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Why hasn't Dad come home yet?

61
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,620
So,

62
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,480
when you said
you wanted to start a business,

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,320
Mother put up her savings
and the house as collateral...

64
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,590
and handed all that money over
to that pyramid scheme?

65
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,800
Mother cherished this house so much,

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,860
saying that her late husband bought it.

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,200
She told us over and over
that we couldn't sell this house...

68
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,800
even after she passed away.

69
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,310
So, how could she blow this house?

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,910
I'm really...

72
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,210
I'm too ashamed to face you.

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,320
How much did she lose, exactly?

74
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,220
There's 150,000 dollars in loans
with the house used as collateral.

75
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,820
And is there more?

76
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,090
Mom used her emergency fund...

77
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,860
and borrowed money from my aunts.

78
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,300
She said
it was about 50,000 dollars in total.

79
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,140
What? Then, it's 200,000 dollars combined?

80
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,280
Honey, are you okay?

81
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,810
Honey.

82
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,010
Then,
if we can't pay back the loan interest,

83
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,850
will we get kicked out of this house?

84
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,620
Please say something!

85
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,990
Please.

86
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,290
Give me an answer!

87
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,300
What are we going to do now?

88
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,400
Mom, get up.

89
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,810
I said, get up!

90
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,980
We don't have time for this.
We need to come up with a plan!

91
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,550
My money...

92
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,120
My precious money.

93
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,520
Really, Mom. Why are you doing this?

94
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,920
What if I get divorced over this?
Will you take responsibility for that?

95
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,830
Seriously, how could you
put this house up as collateral?

96
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,630
Did I do this for my own sake?

97
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,300
I did all of this for you!

98
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,400
Did I ask you to do this?

99
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,110
Did I ask you to put the house up
as collateral and do all that?

100
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,470
Mom, this is your problem.

101
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,380
You don't even know what's good for me,

102
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,250
but you just go ahead and stir up trouble!

103
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,950
What did you say?

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
You shouldn't have done anything
if you didn't know.

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,990
Why would an old lady like you...

106
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,090
invest such big money
without knowing anything?

107
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,760
You didn't even know
what kind of business it was!

108
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,420
You mean jerk!

109
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,300
Is that all you have to say?
Who do you think I was doing this for?

110
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,800
Seriously, because of you,

111
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm embarrassed to death.

112
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,740
I'm foolish enough on my own.
Why did you have to do this too?

113
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,210
Honey, please hold in your anger.

114
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,750
Mom says she's sorry too.
She didn't know it was a scam.

115
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,350
I'll tell you everything.
Come with me, and we'll talk. Honey?

116
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,990
What did you just say to Mother?

117
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,190
What?

118
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,630
Do you think Mother wanted to be scammed?

119
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,930
You're a parent yourself.
How could you speak so harshly?

120
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,470
- Honey.
- You know,

121
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,440
I was the firstborn daughter
of a poor family,

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,040
and I lived my whole life
letting my younger siblings have my share,

123
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,480
but I never once thought
that it was unfair.

124
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,580
Why? Because we're family.

125
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,250
Family is supposed
to help each other out...

126
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,680
when things are tough.

127
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,490
Don't you know what it feels like
to want to do everything for your child?

128
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,090
What good will it do to point fingers now?

129
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,760
It won't change anything,
so why would you hurt Mother like this?

130
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,400
Is that really the best you can do?
Are you that immature?

131
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,330
Well, I was...

132
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,930
Sure.

133
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm upset too.

134
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,210
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,810
It's like being kicked when you're down.

136
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,110
I wonder how something like this
could happen to us.

137
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,850
It's like
my heart is being torn to shreds.

138
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,650
But...

139
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,590
Mother is the one
who feels the worst right now.

140
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,450
So, just stop this.

141
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
Mother.

142
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,060
Don't worry.

143
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,500
I'll come up with the money somehow.

144
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,100
I doubt the four of us
will end up on the streets.

145
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,170
So,

146
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,570
you should take care of your health first,
Mother.

147
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,210
I've said my piece,
so I'll leave you to rest.

148
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,520
All right, then. Let's get to work.

149
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,890
- Let's work hard, everyone.
- Let's work hard, everyone.

150
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,490
So, will you be able to do this?

151
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,590
It may look easy, but this is hard work.

152
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,960
Don't worry, sir.

153
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,000
I did some hard labor when I was younger.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,200
Well, that was then. But now...

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,110
Well, all right.

156
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,170
I'll do my best.

157
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,220
What? This man...

158
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,430
What time is it now?

159
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,350
Was the door open the whole time?

160
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,450
No, let me see.

161
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,220
Hey, Kim Dae Sik! Get up now!

162
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,630
- Hurry up, man!
- My goodness.

163
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,700
Hey, punk! Get up now and go home!

164
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,330
Hang on. What time is it?

165
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,900
Hey, give me that cushion.
Let me sleep a bit more.

166
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,570
- Give me that.
- No. I don't know what happened,

167
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,240
but you shouldn't stay out
all night like this.

168
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,110
Your wife will worry.

169
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,380
Hurry up and go home. Here are your shoes.

170
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,180
- Goodness.
- Oh, boy.

171
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,910
- Hey, bring a longer cushion next time.
- What?

172
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,980
I thought my back was going to break.

173
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,450
- My gosh.
- Go home, okay?

174
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,750
- All right. I'm going.
- Okay.

175
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,490
Dae Sik!

176
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,860
You shouldn't stay out all night, okay?

177
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,590
Okay, I heard you.

(Number One Real Estate)

179
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,940
Goodness, my heart.

180
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,570
Wait. Are they...

181
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,580
Here they are. Right here.

182
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,080
Gosh, I should hide these somewhere safe.

183
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,920
I'm sleepy
from tossing and turning all night.

184

(Number One Real Estate)

185
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,830
That jerk...

186
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Dad.

187
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Dad.

188
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,310
If Dad just got home,

189
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,950
does that mean
he stayed out all night last night?

190
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,380
I think so.

191
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,380
Dad didn't come home last night?

192
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,050
Why in the world did he do that?

193
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,490
Seok Jin,
can you guess what this is about?

194
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,360
Honey, where did you sleep last night?

195
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,370
Tell me.

196
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,100
Where did you sleep?

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Still, how could you stay out all night?

198
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,910
Aren't you going overboard?

199
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Fine. I used that money.

200
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,780
But does all that money belong to you?

201
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,350
Is there nothing for me?

202
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,890
How could you treat me like this...

203
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,030
just because I used some of that money?

204
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,470
I have nothing to say to you,
so don't talk to me.

205
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,050
- Oh, my.
- Where did you have to go so early?

206
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,460
Well, I went for a jog around
the neighborhood to get some exercise.

207
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Hold on. I'll make breakfast.

208
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,930
Right, I should wash up first.

209
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,040
Here's your allowance.
Use it to buy what you need.

210
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,610
Are you really giving me this money?

211
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,480
Yes. It's not much, so spend it wisely.

212
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,420
Thank you.

213
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,750
Here's yours, Tae Ha.

214
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,020
What? Me too?

215
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,330
You're working hard to pay off your debt,
so you must be broke.

216
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,090
Use this for whatever you need.

217
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,960
No, I don't need it.
Keep the money for yourself, Dad.

218
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,870
Why? Take this.

219
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,040
No, I'm making money now too.
It's really fine.

220
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,210
- But why?
- It's because you used to...

221
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,780
nag Tae Ha about money all the time.

222
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,550
You yelled at him for being unemployed
and told him to move out.

223
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,950
Honestly, I don't want
to accept the money either,

224
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,550
but I kind of have no choice
since I really need money now.

225
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,760
Well, I see. All right.

226
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,360
I'll keep this, so just let me know
when and if you need it.

227
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,000
My goodness. I'm suddenly...

228
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,500
thirsty.

229
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,950
You can try all you want,
but you won't win them over.

230
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,290
Just because you give them some money
and try to win their favor now,

231
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,560
it doesn't mean you can change
how the kids feel about you.

232
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,360
You can't even call that an effort,

233
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,470
especially considering
what you did in the past.

234
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,940
Right.

235
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,840
So, I'm reflecting...

236
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,310
on the mistakes I've made.

237
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,980
But this time, I'm going to really try.

238
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,050
Then, they'll come around, right?

239
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,510
Do as you please.

240
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,520
You're moving out soon, anyway.

(Jackpot Chicken)

242
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,930
How could he say that?

243
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,340
It's not like
I spent that money on myself.

244
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,740
How could he treat me like this?

245
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,410
Dae Sik!

246
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,610
What?

247
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,210
You're here.

248
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,410
Yes, hello.

249
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
What?

250
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,390
Dae Sik looked upset yesterday too.

251
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,820
Did you two fight?

252
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,170
Oh, dear.

253
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,340
Life is...

254
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,440
really tough,

255
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,210
isn't it?

256
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,450
When I was young,

257
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,850
I dreamed of having a happy family,

258
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,090
but my family truly hates me now.
Even Mi Ja despises me.

259
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,460
According to Gyu Tae,

260
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,860
few married couples...

261
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,470
remain together at our age.

262
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,070
That's true.

263
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,110
It's not easy for two complete strangers
to meet and spend decades living together.

264
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,180
My goodness.

265
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,350
But you know, Hye Sook, you...

266
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,010
Oh, no.

267
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,980
Sorry, I called you like that
without thinking.

268
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,350
Gosh, no worries.

269
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,220
You don't remember
anything after high school,

270
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,660
so I get it.

271
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,360
Anyway, you...

272
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,660
never showed any interest in Dae Sik
back in high school,

273
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,700
so I had no idea
you two would end up getting married.

274
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,770
So, I figured...

275
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,170
you two must have truly fallen
for each other...

276
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
during the times I don't remember.

277
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,720
I must say,

278
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,520
you deserve better than Dae Sik.

279
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Me?

280
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,290
I'll be honest. You were always
more easygoing than he was.

281
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,960
That punk...

282
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,830
is actually petty-minded.

283
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,570
He acts all generous and understanding,

284
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,070
but he sulks over the smallest things.

285
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,940
He's exhausting to be around.

286
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,950
My gosh. Who would've thought?

287
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,680
You're actually making me laugh.

288
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,750
What? Are you...

289
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,190
trying to say that
I used to have a nasty temper?

290
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,190
Gosh, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.

291
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,390
It's all good.

292
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,330
I know everything,

293
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,200
including how everyone
used to call me Salt Pincher.

294
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,040
I want to be reborn
as the real Han Mu Chul,

295
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,740
so I'm really trying now.

296
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,210
I trust that you can do it.

297
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,210
Seeing you now,

298
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,680
I think you can definitely do it.

299
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,680
You're almost like
a different person already.

300
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,090
I trust that
you can go back to your old self.

301
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,230
You can do it.

302
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,640
It's so good.

303
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,100
Greens taste best
when they're seasoned by hand.

304
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,670
Seasoned by hand, my foot.

305
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,480
They taste good
because they were prepped properly.

306
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,350
Are you trying to take credit
just because you prepped these?

307
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,820
Hey, I deserve a compliment,

308
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,180
and you're saying
I'm just trying to take credit?

309
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,950
A compliment?

310
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,690
You just left them here,

311
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,060
but I rinsed and prepped them on my own.
You really don't know that?

312
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,290
You want a compliment for that?

313
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,160
Does it really matter who does it?

314
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Oh, okay. Fine.

315
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,660
So, you don't care who does it.

316
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,800
Then I'll just stick to my own tasks
from now on.

317
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,040
Even if the stew boils over
and the spicy pork burns,

318
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,340
it has nothing to do with me.
I'll just stick to my own tasks...

319
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,440
and mind my own business. Are we good now?

320
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,880
What? What's with him today?

321
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,710
She should learn to be grateful.

322
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,550
I'll never help you again.

323
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,450
Hello.

324
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,290
Is the female employee not in today?

325
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,890
The female employee? Why?

326
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,460
I'm craving her cooking.

327
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,630
When will she be back?

328
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,360
I'll come back when she's here.

329
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,900
They're not even difficult dishes to make.

330
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,640
Pardon?

331
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,670
Nothing. Go ahead and order.
She's in the kitchen.

332
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
Oh, really?

333
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,440
Do you mind telling her
to come out for a moment?

334
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,750
Are you here to order
the Chef's Special or something?

335
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,310
Why are you asking for her?

336
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,780
Mr. Choi!

337
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
Hello, Ah Jin.

338
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,580
You're here.

339
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,950
I thought you might not come today.

340
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,390
I didn't eat your food yesterday,
so I couldn't miss out again today.

341
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,130
I ran here
as soon as my lunch break started.

342
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,460
I'm glad you're here.

343
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,660
Your office must be pretty close.

344
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,000
It's actually not that close.

345
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,800
- The market where we met.
- Yes.

346
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,870
I visit that market often,

347
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,340
but I think I'll be coming here
more often from now on.

348
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,340
Oh, now you know that I'm not homeless.

349
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,870
So, I'll pay full price for everything
from now on.

350
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,810
"Homeless?"

351
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,010
He's that homeless guy?

352
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,750
I'm not planning
to give you a discount anyway.

353
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,620
And no freebies for you.
I hope it doesn't make you sad.

354
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Of course, it's fine.

355
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,020
Anyway, what shall I have today?

356
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,560
Can you recommend your signature dish?

357
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,890
Sure thing.

358
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,390
- Have a seat here.
- Okay.

359
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,730
Would you like to take a look?

360
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,740
Oh, my.

361
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,640
Everything looks delicious.

362
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
You all heard that, right?

363
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,780
Submit your proposal for the event.

364
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
- Sure.
- Will do.

365
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,510
Hello!

366
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Hey, Seo Woo.

367
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,480
Hello, Seo Woo.

368
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,020
I got coffee for everyone,
but I didn't know you were in a meeting.

369
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,890
Should I just put these here?

370
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,520
No, the meeting's over now.

371
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,020
I see. Here, have some coffee.

372
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

373
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,090
By the way,

374
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,160
what's your relationship with Mr. Kim?

375
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,470
Pardon? Oh, me?

376
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,010
She's my girlfriend.

377
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,910
Really?

378
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,780
I knew it.
No wonder she's been visiting so often.

379
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,750
You two look so cute together.

380
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,250
Right? Yes, totally.

381
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,850
- And your girlfriend is so pretty.
- Yes.

382
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,690
- Mr. Kim has still got it.
- I know.

383
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,660
I'm the lucky one...

384
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,790
for landing such a hot guy
as my sweetheart.

385
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,130
She called him "sweetheart."

386
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,860
- She said "sweetheart."
- Oh, my.

387
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,270
- "Sweetheart," really?
- My goodness. "Sweetheart."

388
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,800
All right. That's enough, everyone.

389
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,670
Let's get some work done now, okay?

390
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

391
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,240
Thanks for the coffee, Seo Woo.
I'll enjoy this.

392
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,210
It's nothing. Enjoy your coffee, Ye Won.

393
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,850
Thanks.

394
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,880
"Girlfriend?"

395
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Hey, you.

396
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,830
A part-time job? Sure.

397
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,400
Where and what time?

398
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,330
Mom.

399
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Mi Jin. What brings you here?

400
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,810
(Jackpot Chicken)

401
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,280
I have a favor to ask you guys.

402
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,320
A favor? What is it?

403
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,950
Actually,

404
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,490
my mother-in-law
fell for a pyramid scheme.

405
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,030
She must've taken out a loan
with the house as collateral.

406
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,530
But she lost all that money,

407
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,500
so we're about to lose the house now.

408
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,900
Are you serious?

409
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,910
So, the thing is,

410
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,740
can't you guys lend me...

411
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,880
some of that inheritance from Grandpa?

412
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,650
Gwang Sik and I will work hard
and pay you guys back for sure.

413
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,590
I don't have anyone else to ask
but you guys right now.

414
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,560
Please help me out just this once.

415
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,230
Mom.

416
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,230
How much money did she lose?

417
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,270
It's 200,000 dollars in total,

418
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,140
but you can just lend me
as much as you can.

419
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,410
We won't lose the house right away
as long as we pay the interest.

420
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,640
Can you lend me the money?

421
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,520
I'm sorry, Mi Jin.

422
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,690
We...

423
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,420
don't have money.

424
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,030
Did you use up...

425
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,830
all of Grandpa's inheritance while moving?

426
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
That's right.

427
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,900
Mom.

428
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,010
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,780
Just a little bit is fine too.

430
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,450
We really don't have any money.

431
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,880
Mom, you know the situation we're in.

432
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,390
Mom!

433
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,360
We don't have any.

434
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,330
Why do you keep asking us?

435
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,270
Where is Gwang Sik?

436
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,870
What is he up to
that you're out asking to borrow money?

437
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,440
What kind of man makes his wife cry
because of money?

438
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,240
Does he not care about
the heartache you're going through?

439
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,040
Where is Gwang Sik and what is he doing?

440
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
From now on,

441
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,090
don't talk to me about money ever again.

442
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,690
If you do,

443
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
you're no longer my daughter.

444
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,900
I'm sorry.

445
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,480
Oh, hello.

446
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,120
Yes, hi.

447
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,590
Where are you coming from?

448
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,590
I went to the grocery store.

449
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,290
I see.

450
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,560
I came to meet with Mr. Jang,

451
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,330
but he's not in his office again.

452
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,670
Have you seen Mr. Jang recently
by any chance?

453
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,370
What?

454
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,170
Who is Mr. Jang?

455
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,480
Oh, I guess you don't know.

456
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,940
Mr. Jang?

457
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,250
Is that someone I know?

458
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,920
Well, I'm not sure.

459
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,390
Goodbye, then.

460
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Bye.

461
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,330
How can he be so calm
after hearing Mr. Jang's name?

462
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,830
That guy...

463
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,340
must not remember a thing. I'm sure of it.

464
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,710
I'm home.

465
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,910
Hey, you're here.

466
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,650
What's this?
Why did you make seaweed soup?

467
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,050
Is it someone's birthday?

468
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,450
What birthday? I just made it.

469
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,660
Oh, right. Mom, it's your birthday soon.

470
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
My birthday?

471
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
Is it that time of the year already?

472
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,490
Her birthday?

473
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,930
That's great. Mom, let's go out for dinner
for your birthday. It's on me.

474
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,570
How about we have Dad join us?

475
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,510
Do whatever you want.
I don't care whether he comes or not.

476
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,740
So, Mom...

477
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,780
Are you still mad at Dad...

478
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,180
because of when he cheated on you
back then?

479
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,390
Forget it.
I don't want to talk about that.

480
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,690
Cheated?

481
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,700
I cheated...

482
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,470
on Mi Ja?

483
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,260
Honey, aren't you being too harsh?

484
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,670
Our daughter told us
she was in a difficult situation.

485
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,870
How could you be so coldhearted?

486
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,940
Honey,
can you even call yourself a father?

487
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,810
Seriously, honey.

488
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,280
I never thought
you'd take things this far.

489
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,380
If you were going to be like this,

490
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,090
why didn't you keep
that lottery ticket a secret?

491
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,020
What did you tell me
when we won the lottery?

492
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,920
"Our struggles are over.
Our happiness begins now."

493
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,430
You told me to do everything I wanted to.

494
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,730
The lottery?

495
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,530
So,

496
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,930
how could you do this to me
just because I used five million dollars?

497
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Mom.

498
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,270
What's this I'm hearing about
five million dollars and a lottery ticket?

499
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,930
(Good Luck!)

500
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,060
Why do you look so listless?

501
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,500
Are you not feeling well?

502
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,070
What kind of person is Seo Woo?

503
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,370
She's more innocent than she seems,
and she has so much charm.

504
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,040
Don't trust people too much.

505
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,940
What does your mom like?

506
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,010
One time,

507
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,040
you did bring Mom a dress
for her birthday.

508
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
And?

509
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,510
