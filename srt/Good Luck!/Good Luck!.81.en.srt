1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,610
So,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,050
you mean you're the current owner
of the Daewoon Building?

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,350
Then, the money you've been spending
all this time...

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,720
was Mu Chul's money?

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,660
How could you do such a thing?

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,490
Even if you had to pay
Min Yong's hospital bills urgently!

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,200
Well, you can go and tell him now.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,140
Go to Mu Chul and tell him the truth!

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,410
You don't have to worry.
I'll take care of it.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,180
Take care of what?

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,540
If that were possible,
things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,980
Don't you have a conscience?

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,180
How could you do such a thing
and pretend not to know about it?

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,280
What? A conscience?

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,920
That's right, a conscience.

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,090
You're behaving like this now...

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,960
because you don't have anyone
to tell you stuff like this.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,130
But still,

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,430
how could you trick your friend?

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,960
Have you always been this pathetic?

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,700
I get it, so just leave.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,870
Promise me you'll tell him now
before it's too late. Please?

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,380
If you don't, I'm really going
to be disappointed in you.

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,510
I only told you
since you said you knew everything.

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,250
I didn't tell you this
to get an earful from you.

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,790
Also, my head already hurts enough
without you adding to it.

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,020
Gosh, please just go. Leave!

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,360
Gyu Tae.

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,590
Please say it.

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,860
I'm begging you. Please?

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
What is wrong with you?

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,400
Let go of me!

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,830
Gyu Tae!

34
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,800
I said, let go of me!

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,970
Oh, what...

36
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,870
Hey, are you okay?

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,810
So, why did you have to provoke me?

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,520
Oh, no. Are you hurt?

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Hey.

40
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,730
Why...

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,160
Hey, wait.

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,370
(Number One Real Estate, 669 Chicken)

43
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
What?

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,290
He really decided to give up that money?

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,760
It's not a small amount.
It's a lot of money.

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,560
Does it really make sense
to let them keep every last penny?

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,660
No, it makes no sense.

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,530
I will never allow that to happen.

49
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,110
Dad, are you really not going
to get that money?

50
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,510
I mean the lottery winnings.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,410
No. That's what I've decided.

52
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,320
Well, I get that you feel awkward
since he's your friend,

53
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,190
but this isn't an issue
you can just put aside.

54
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,890
This is your money.
It's right for you to get it back.

55
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,720
I gave it to Dae Sik,
so that's the end of it.

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,890
We don't know if you gave it to him,
if he took it from you,

57
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,530
or if he even stole it from you.

58
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,970
Hey, no way.
He's not someone who'd do such a thing.

59
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,270
Wake up, Han Seo Woo!

60
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,740
The important thing is that
Dad bought the lottery ticket.

61
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,610
So, is it right for us
to simply believe Mr. Dae Sik's word...

62
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,480
and give up that money?

63
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,050
That's right.

64
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,980
I was the one
who bought that lottery ticket,

65
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,490
but if I start to question
why that ended up in Dae Sik's hands...

66
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,260
and why I didn't get it back,

67
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,590
our friendship will be over forever.

68
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
I also...

69
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,130
wish I could have that money.

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,340
With that money,
our family could live just fine.

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,240
When I think about
why I gave that to Dae Sik,

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,280
I regret it so much
and think it's a huge shame!

73
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,580
But I have no memory of that.

74
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,880
What more can I do?

75
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,190
All I can do is...

76
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,420
just trust my friend.

77
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,990
I know you're disappointed,

78
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,600
but I hope you can go along
with my decision.

79
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,190
No matter what you say,

80
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,720
I will get that money back for sure.

81
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,760
I'm going to get all of that money back,
even if it's just out of spite...

82
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
because he lied about it this whole time.

83
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,730
He must've thought so little of us
to have done that.

84
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,470
I could never forgive him.

85
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,040
Must you really do that?

86
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,340
From now on,
don't interfere with whatever I do...

87
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,980
regarding that money.

88
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
By the way,

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,210
please introduce me
to the lawyer you met with.

90
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,780
The lawyer?

91
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm going to ask him
how to get my identity back.

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,160
That's what I mean.
Knowing how makes no difference.

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,790
You can get your identity back
without any worries...

94
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,430
as long as we have the money
to repay your debt.

95
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,360
If the creditors find out you're alive
and come barging in,

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
what will you do then?

97
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,570
I'll deal with that myself.

98
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,270
What do you mean,
you'll deal with it yourself?

99
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,840
I'm so upset that I might go insane!

100
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,570
Aren't you going to tell me?

101
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,940
I will.

102
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,550
Come with me later.

103
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,550
No.

104
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,950
I'll go by myself.

105
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Hye Sook.

106
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,130
You said you wanted a divorce.

107
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,810
All right. Let's get divorced.

108
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,840
Mom, Dad has something to say.

109
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,950
Hye Sook.

110
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,460
You said you wanted half of the winnings,
didn't you?

111
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,930
I'll give it to you
when you find your own place.

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,770
You guys,

113
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,340
I will never give you
more than 500,000 dollars.

114
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,270
Then,

115
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,970
what about the rest of the money?

116
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,910
Are you perhaps thinking of
giving it to that family?

117
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,010
I'll deal with that myself.

118
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,180
If I give you half,
the other half is mine.

119
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,320
I'll use my money however I see fit,
so don't try to interfere.

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,030
Those of you who want to take
your 500,000 dollars, go ahead.

121
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,300
If you don't want it, don't accept it.

122
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,960
Be sure...

123
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,270
not to say another word about the money.

124
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,990
Seriously, why is Dad doing this?

125
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,590
Seok Jin, you should say something.

126
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,690
Talk Dad out of it.

127
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,690
How can I say anything
when he's so adamant?

128
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,460
I mean, it's not like that money is ours.

129
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,460
He's right.

130
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,000
How he uses that money isn't up to us.

131
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,470
Then, do you want to just watch our money
go over to another family?

132
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,110
He could just give the money to Mom.
It makes no sense to give it away!

133
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,680
I will never watch that happen.

134
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,150
I can't let it happen,
at least for Mom's sake!

135
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,990
You can't come today either?

136
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,460
We're not shooting today anyway.

137
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,160
After what I heard
from your mom yesterday,

138
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,570
how could I go back there?

139
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,800
Okay, I'll call you back.

140
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,970
Is that perhaps Seo Woo?

141
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,710
You know about that?

142
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,210
Yes, I heard that you were dating Seo Woo.

143
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,920
You didn't even tell me.
I was so surprised.

144
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,820
Sorry. It just happened.

145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,660
Anyway, Mom detests that whole family.
Will you be okay?

146
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,920
Dating Seo Woo, I mean.

147
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,130
She's already yelling at me to break up.

148
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,660
Does Mom know too?

149
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,460
This must be hard on you.

150
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,330
Oh, right. I hear you're seeing Dong Min.

151
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Yes.

152
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,340
I hope things go well for you.
He's a good friend.

153
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,380
Yes, Dong Min is a good guy.

154
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,210
He's a good person.

155
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,150
You sound like
you're talking about someone distant.

156
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,020
Are you sure
you're talking about your boyfriend?

157
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,480
Oh, did I sound like that?

158
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,390
It's still awkward
to call him my boyfriend.

159
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,690
I'm sure you'll get used to it.

160
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,590
Let's go. You're going to work too, right?

161
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
You're here early.

162
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,770
Hey, you're here.

163
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,000
Is your mother okay?

164
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,970
After she left that day, I was concerned.

165
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,810
She must've been really upset.

166
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,910
I'd be lying if I said she was fine.

167
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,750
She's just carrying on.

168
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,520
I don't know
how things ended up like this.

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,020
I hope things get sorted out nicely.

170
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,690
What do you mean by "sorted out nicely?"

171
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,090
Pardon?

172
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm just curious
what you consider a solution.

173
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,460
Well, I'm not sure either.

174
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,830
I'll just leave it up to the elders.

175
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,060
I can't seem to do that.

176
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,830
I can't accept my dad's decision.

177
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,440
So, I keep thinking about it.

178
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,140
Let's stop talking about this.
We'll only end up feeling hurt.

179
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,680
I'll go and take out the trash.

180
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,950
(Jackpot Chicken)

181
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,860
Hey, you're here.

182
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,390
Hey, give me that. I'll do it.

183
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,530
Gosh, who cares who does it?

184
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,230
Mu Chul, have a seat for a second.

185
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,860
Okay.

186
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,970
About what you said
regarding the lottery ticket.

187
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,910
Thank you so much.

188
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,780
I thought about it,

189
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,920
and I don't think it would be right
for me to keep the money.

190
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,590
Actually, my wife and I
are going through a divorce.

191
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,120
We split the lottery winnings in half.

192
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,030
I want to give you...

193
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,090
my half of the money.

194
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,130
I'd only feel at ease if I did that.

195
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,640
Also,

196
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,440
you don't have to keep working here
if you're uncomfortable with seeing me.

197
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,680
Gosh, no. I should still work.

198
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,410
Also,

199
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,010
about the money...

200
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,980
I'll give it some thought.

201
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,190
Okay. I understand.

202
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Gyu Tae.

203
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,960
Did you come to work?

204
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,400
You sure are strong.

205
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,070
How can you come to work
after such a huge ordeal?

206
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,300
Dae Sik says he'll give me money.
What should I do?

207
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,310
Money?

208
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,610
We said we'd forget about everything.

209
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,740
It would be weird to accept the money now.

210
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,980
Just take it. He must feel bad about it.

211
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,610
Saving face doesn't matter.

212
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,180
Gosh, it's not about saving face.

213
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,890
Ever since that incident,

214
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,220
it's a little uncomfortable
to see Dae Sik.

215
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,690
I tell myself that I shouldn't,

216
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,560
but I keep remembering that he lied to me,

217
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,830
so it's just not the same as before.

218
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,730
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

219
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,040
You know,

220
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,310
I was deeply hurt.

221
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,180
I declared out loud
that I'd choose our friendship,

222
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,340
but deep inside my heart,

223
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,380
I must still resent Dae Sik.

224
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,890
What about you?

225
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,590
You won't do that, will you?

226
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,020
What? Oh, I won't.

227
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,900
Since I was burned by that jerk,
Dae Sik...

228
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,730
You wouldn't have done that.

229
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,970
You're the only person I can trust now.

230
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,040
I keep thinking that.

231
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,740
In this moment of feeling
so devastated and lonely,

232
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,550
I'm truly grateful you're here for me.

233
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,390
Let's never let each other down.

234
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,230
If there's ever anything
that might cause a misunderstanding,

235
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,230
let's talk about it in advance, okay?

236
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes, all right.

237
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,370
But then again, I know it'll all be fine
if I just take my own advice.

238
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,380
Oh, right.

239
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,940
I'm meeting with a lawyer today.

240
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,210
A lawyer? Why?

241
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,080
I want to see if there's a way
to revoke my death registration.

242
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,150
I see, all right.

243

(Number One Real Estate, 669 Chicken)

244
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,960
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

245
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,090
Well...

246
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,970
- What's your question?
- Never mind.

(Lee Jung Hwan Law Firm)

250
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
Right there.

251
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,850
Oh, Mom. Did you go house hunting?

252
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,390
Did you see any places you liked?

253
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,260
I saw a few.

254
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,300
What are you planning to do?
Are you going to stay here?

255
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,100
Honestly, I just want to get
the 500,000 dollars and go home,

256
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,640
but I can't leave. I'm too anxious
Dad might hand over the rest of the money.

257
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,870
What about you, Mom?

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,240
Will you move out right away?

259
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,010
I should,

260
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,080
but I just feel really uneasy about it.

261
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,510
I know. Once you move out,
no one will be able to stop Dad.

262
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,520
But I never imagined
Dad would agree to a divorce.

263
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,250
You felt the same way, didn't you?

264
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,760
Do you regret deciding to get divorced?

265
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,000
No, not at all.

266
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,570
I really can't live with him anymore.

267
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,700
Even on the day
Mi Ja came here and caused a scene,

268
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,870
your dad stepped out with her
and had a lengthy chat.

269
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,680
What? What did the two of them talk about?

270
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,780
That's beside the point.

271
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,380
Just think about how I felt
watching them do that.

272
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,420
Living here
and seeing that over and over again...

273
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,690
will send me to an early grave.

274
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,660
Mi Jin, you're married too,
so you know how it is.

275
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,090
In marriage, trust is everything.

276
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,430
Even the smallest crack...

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,670
can make it crumble like a sandcastle.

278
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,700
I definitely know that.
I'm staying with Gwang Sik...

279
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,770
because at least
he doesn't have any women problems.

280
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,340
If he ever had women problems,
I'd divorce him right away.

281
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,910
When other women talked about how...

282
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,510
they couldn't stand
to see their husbands eat,

283
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,910
I was always like,
"How could they be so mean?"

284
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,780
But I totally get it now.

285
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,450
Even just seeing your dad from behind...

286
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
makes my blood boil.

287
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,520
How could I look at his face
and live with him when I feel this way?

288
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,590
We shouldn't do that to each other.

289
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,330
Gosh, I'm so upset.

290
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,200
This is all that lady's fault.

291
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,210
Hey, lady.

292
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,950
You lashed out at us
and made a scene at our place.

293
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,880
Shouldn't you at least apologize?

294
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
What?

295
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,420
What do you think gives you the right
to do what you did at our place?

296
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Do you know
how stunned my whole family was?

297
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,930
You need to apologize to my mom right now.

298
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,430
Why should I apologize
when I did nothing wrong?

299
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,030
Your mom owes me an apology.

300
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,100
If you take something from someone,

301
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,370
you should apologize and return it.

302
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,770
Gosh, how shameless.

303
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,970
What? "Shameless?"

304
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,280
What do you mean we took it?
My dad received it from Mr. Han.

305
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,210
How am I supposed to believe that?
Goodness, forget it.

306
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,920
Anyway, why are you getting so worked up
when this is none of your business?

307
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,480
You're no longer part of this family.

308
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,050
What on earth are you talking about?
I am their eldest daughter.

309
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,490
You're married, and that makes you
a member of your husband's family.

310
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,730
Why? Do you suddenly care
about your parents...

311
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,600
just because they have some money now?

312
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,260
What did you say?

313
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,630
I mean,
why are you still staying with them?

314
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,100
Oh, I see. You're trying to extort money.

315
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,940
I bet that's why you're being
so unreasonable right now.

316
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,570
Ms. Lee!

317
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,010
What? What's your problem?

318
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,110
Hey, Mi Jin. What's wrong? What is it now?

319
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,650
Mom.

320
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,580
Do you know what this lady just said?

321
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,050
She said I was staying here
to extort money from you.

322
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,750
What?

323
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,260
Hey, Lee Mi Ja. Have you lost your mind?

324
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,230
Have you completely lost it?

325
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,160
If that's not the case, just say so.
Why get so worked up about it?

326
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,900
Like mother, like daughter.

327
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,930
You're lashing out without even knowing
the full story, just like your mom.

328
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,440
Hey! Are you done talking?

329
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,770
No, I'm not done!

330
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,270
Do not provoke me again.

331
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,710
I don't know when and how I might explode.

332
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,740
Don't you dare
mess with my daughter again.

333
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,780
You can take it out on me,
but if you mess with my daughter,

334
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,980
I'll make sure you pay for it!

335
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,720
Same here! You can take it out on me,

336
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,490
but if you mess with my mom,
you'll pay for it.

337
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,120
Also, we refuse
to give the lottery money to you,

338
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,990
so don't harass us about it again.

339
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,290
If you do, you'll regret it!

340
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,860
Unbelievable.

341
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,330
Good grief. What a joke.

342
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,770
Good job today.
Thanks to you, the meeting went well.

343
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,140
You did a great job too.

344
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,610
You must be hungry.
You haven't even had dinner yet.

345
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,410
How about we have some udon?

346
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Shall we?

347
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
One moment.

348
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,050
(My Love, Seok Jin)

349
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Hi, Seok Jin.

350
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,930
Hey, Seo Woo.
Ye Won and I just got out of the meeting,

351
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,460
but we haven't had dinner yet,
so we're going to grab some food together.

352
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,270
Oh, really?

353
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,400
You don't need my permission to do that.
Of course, you should eat.

354
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,710
You must be starving. Enjoy your dinner.

355
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,610
All right. I'll call you later.

356
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,520
Let's go.

357
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,580
Okay.

358
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,430
Why are you drinking on an empty stomach?

359
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,670
You'll get an upset stomach.

360
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
Seok Jin.

361
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,340
If I had returned to Korea sooner,

362
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,110
what would've happened?

363
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,010
What?

364
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,580
As you know, my plan was to return sooner,

365
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,550
but it got delayed
because I had to take care of my dad...

366
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,690
after his cancer surgery.

367
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,930
Yes, I know. You went through a lot.

368
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,060
No, you had it harder.

369
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,770
When you were stressed out
after losing that investment,

370
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,680
if the person by your side...

371
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,210
had been me instead of Seo Woo,

372
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,550
if I had comforted you,

373
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,680
what would've happened?

374
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,760
What do you mean, what would've happened?

375
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,190
I'm just asking.

376
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,560
I suddenly got curious.

377
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Let's eat.

378
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,340
What? Geum Ok knows
about the Daewoon Building now?

379
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,110
So? What did she say?

380
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,540
She urged me to tell Mu Chul
as soon as possible.

381
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,880
After Dae Sik, even Geum Ok knows now.

382
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,080
Two people know about it already.

383
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,950
Don't you think
the word is bound to get out?

384
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,090
Why not just tell him?

385
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,390
I told you.

386
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,760
That's not everything.
There's something else.

387
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,430
And you can't tell me what that is?

388
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,770
Hey, Mr. Kim. It's me.

389
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,240
What? Someone's interested
in the building?

390
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,910
Great. Then I'd like to
meet that person tomorrow.

391
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,780
I'll pay you a handsome commission.

392
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,650
Someone's interested
in buying the Daewoon Building?

393
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,380
I want to sell it.

394
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,120
Then I'll give the money to Mu Chul
and leave the country.

395
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,860
Leave the country?

396
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,020
But why, all of a sudden...

397
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,930
I really can't bring myself
to tell the truth.

398
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,200
I'll give the money to Mu Chul
to compensate him for everything.

399
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,100
Then I'll leave this place
and go somewhere where no one knows me.

400
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,970
As for Dae Sik and Geum Ok,

401
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,170
if I beg them, they will listen to me.

402
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,880
So, I'll ask them
to please keep the truth buried.

403
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,660
My baby.

404
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,930
You must've been really scared earlier.

405
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,000
Your dad...

406
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,870
isn't a bad person.

407
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,800
I'm sure he had some kind of reason
that I don't know about.

408
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,710
So,

409
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,910
don't misjudge your dad.

410
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,280
Okay?

411
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,430
Are you okay?

412
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,530
Why did you drink so much anyway?

413
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,270
Sorry, but can you take me home?

414
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,740
Okay, let's go.

415
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,740
- Aren't you going to call Seo Woo?
- What?

416
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,350
You have to report to her
that you're leaving now.

417
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,310
Report?

418
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,190
Oh, I only told her
in case she was worried.

419
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,450
I can call her when I get home.

420
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,220
Didn't Seo Woo say anything else to you?

421
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,290
Anything else? Like what?

422
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,300
Seo Woo just seemed to get the wrong idea
about you and me sometimes,

423
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,070
so I told her not to since it makes it
hard for us to work together.

424
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,440
The wrong idea?

425
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,140
Since we spend so much time together,

426
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,780
I could see why she thought that way.

427
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,680
That's why I'm trying my best
to be careful...

428
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,920
and asked you to be careful too.

429
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Then, let's go.

430
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,670
What is it?

431
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,770
Forget it. I'll go alone.

432
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Will you be okay?

433
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Ye Won.

434
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,210
Let's go together.
I'll call a taxi for you.

435
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,480
Let go of me.

436
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,980
You might hurt yourself.

437
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,080
Just go, okay?

438
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,520
All right. I'll go.

439
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,740
I like you.

440
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,170
What?

441
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,240
I have feelings for you.

442
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,650
Even before Seo Woo. I liked you first.

443
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,530
Ye Won.

444
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,870
Mu Chul, stop cleaning and go home.

445
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,340
- Okay.
- By the way,

446
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,870
did you meet with the lawyer?

447
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,370
- Yes.
- What did he say?

448
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,580
He told me a few different ways,
but I'll discuss it with Gyu Tae.

449
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,210
With Gyu Tae?

450
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,310
(Jackpot Chicken)

451
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,880
Well, I just thought...

452
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,550
he'd know a lot about that sort of thing.

453
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,250
Okay, then.

454
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,330
Didn't Gyu Tae say anything else
by any chance?

455
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,590
Oh, like what?

456
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,160
It's nothing.

457
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,200
You should go now. I'll clean up the rest.

458
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,370
Okay. Bye.

459
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,370
Bye.

460
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,170
What's up with that?

461
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,260
Mr. Han Mu Chul?

462
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,330
Are you Mr. Han Mu Chul?

463
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,970
What is this about?

464
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,040
Police.

465
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,270
(Civil Servant ID Card)

466
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,540
I'm sorry, but could I see your ID?

467
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,910
Well...

468
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,750
We've had a report
about your false death registration.

469
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,150
You are Mr. Han Mu Chul, aren't you?

470
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,820
(Good Luck!)

471
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,130
What did you talk about with Ye Won?

472
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,060
I'm sorry,

473
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,070
but there's someone I like.

474
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Seok Jin is dating Seo Woo from next door?

475
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,840
Mom, you should stop him.

476
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,310
I've already told him to break up.

477
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,210
May I see what that conman,
Jang Tae Poong, looks like?

478
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,950
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
