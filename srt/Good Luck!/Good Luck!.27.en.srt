1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,070
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,580
By the way, this man...

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,450
Is he alive?

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,080
Why isn't he moving at all?

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,180
Sir.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
Sir?

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,160
Oh, he's breathing.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
- What?
- My gosh.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Goodness.

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,820
Oh, that...

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,520
That man. Who is he?

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,790
He's my relative. A distant relative.

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,650
Then why is he here?

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,860
Is he ill or something?

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,920
He hurt his head
and lost his consciousness.

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,090
What you saw was just a reflex.

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,800
It happens occasionally.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,630
I see.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
We'll just leave the rice here, then.

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,400
Take care.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,040
All right, thank you.

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,470
Have a good day.

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,550
You. Can you hear me?

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,050
Wake up already.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,620
How amusing is this dream you're having...

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,190
that you still won't wake up?

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Oh, boy.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,640
Oh, my. This soup is so delicious.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,080
- Did you use anchovy broth for this?
- Yes.

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,880
The two of you will go straight
to the restaurant after breakfast, right?

31
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,650
Then let's head out together.

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,380
I'm not going straight to the restaurant.
I have to stop by somewhere.

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,050
I have to stop by somewhere too,

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,360
so tell your dad
to go straight to the restaurant.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
What?

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,530
Dad, Mom says
she has to stop by somewhere.

37
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,670
She wants you
to go straight to the restaurant.

38
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,100
Tell her I can't.
I must take care of something important.

39
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,740
What?

40
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,640
Mom, Dad says he has to
take care of something important.

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,310
As if what I have to do isn't important.

42
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,310
Then he should've given me a heads-up.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,350
Tell him that.

44
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,490
Dad, you heard that, right?

45
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,690
I'm done. Thanks for the food.

46
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,020
I'm done too.

47
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,370
Dear me.

48
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,350
Goodness.

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
Seriously!

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,230
Does he think I'll be scared
if he grimaces like that?

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,130
Unbelievable.

52
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,910
Hey, Gwang Sik. Where are you?

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
Can we meet?

54
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,190
(Pro Delivery Services)

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
You're that deliveryman.

56
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,730
Hello. You must live around here.

57
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,560
Yes, I run a cafe in this building.

58
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,060
Are you here to deliver something?

59
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,070
No, I'm...

60
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,470
I hope you weren't offended
by what I said the other day.

61
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,440
Of course, I know how hard it is
to work as a deliveryman.

62
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,810
But it'd just be nice...

63
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,680
if you could try thinking
from the business owners' perspective.

64
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,310
You could give us a call
if you're running late.

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,050
You understand what I mean, right?

66
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,050
Yes.

67
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,720
Hey, Hye Sook.

68
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,490
This delivery guy is here again.

69
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,990
Since I met him again,

70
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,690
I told him in a way that he'd understand,

71
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,030
so that won't happen again.

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,370
Hey, Gwang Sik.

73
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,530
What? "Gwang Sik?"

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,170
You're here, Mother.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,110
"Mother?"

76
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,710
No way. Don't tell me...

77
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,810
Say hi. This is my son-in-law.

78
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,710
You met her the other day.

79
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,680
Let me introduce myself properly.

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,750
I'm Heo Gwang Sik, the son-in-law
of Jackpot Chicken's owners.

81
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,960
Hello.

82
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,520
Nice to meet you.

83
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,330
So?

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,870
I mean, everyone has a job.

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,110
Why is it so hard for you to get a job?

86
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,510
I'm not sure either.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,780
I didn't get any of the jobs
I interviewed for.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,350
So, what can I do?

89
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,650
What is it that you truly want to do?

90
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,980
Pardon?

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,150
You're struggling to get a job,
but that's secondary.

92
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,950
There must be something you want to do.

93
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,560
Do you not have any aspirations?

94
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,960
Of course, I do.

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,630
I want to start
my own business eventually.

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,370
Business? What kind of business?

97
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,870
Well...

98
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,200
A shop that sells tteokbokki.

99
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Tteokbokki?

100
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,770
It won't cost a lot
to start a tteokbokki place.

101
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,440
Like the super spicy tteokbokki...

102
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,150
or the soupy tteokbokki
that are popular these days?

103
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,350
No, not those.

104
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,920
Mother, you know
about edible insects, right?

105
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,050
Edible insects?

106
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,160
Yes, what about it?

107
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,990
Fusion food is very trendy these days.

108
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,860
As you know, tteokbokki is
every Korean's favorite comfort food,

109
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,500
so I thought it'd be interesting
to combine it with edible insects,

110
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,600
the food of the future.

111
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,440
What? Insects with tteokbokki?

112
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,840
Yes. Mother, you won't be eating
uncooked insects.

113
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,010
They'll be deep-fried.

114
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,080
Like crispy fritters.
They won't look or taste weird at all.

115
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,920
If you put them
on tteokbokki as a topping...

116
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,790
You know those places that sell
tteokbokki with deep-fried bits on top.

117
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,350
It'll look just like that.

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,190
Don't even dream of starting
such an absurd business.

119
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,490
Just get a full-time job.

120
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,300
Tteokbokki with insects? Nonsense.

121
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,800
Go. I have to work.

122
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
You want me to leave already?

123
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,040
I was going to stay
and have your fried chicken.

124
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,540
Mother, since I've already brought it up,

125
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,340
why don't I get a few insects
from my acquaintance...

126
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,580
so you can try cooking them
in your deep fryer?

127
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,440
That's enough.
Aren't you leaving? Get out!

128
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,250
- Okay.
- Go, get out!

129
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,250
Goodness.

130
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,050
I'm so upset! My gosh.

131
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,720
It's me, Mom.

132
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,620
It's me, Dad.

133
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,930
How have you been?

134
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,130
Dad, I'm doing very well, thanks to you.

135
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,970
Dad, do you remember?

136
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,140
The neighborhood where we lived together
when I was young.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,910
Everything else has changed,

138
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,580
but that neighborhood
hasn't changed at all.

139
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,050
Grandpa told me...

140
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,780
you grew up in that neighborhood, Dad.

141
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,050
So, I want to...

142
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,590
buy the house where I live now.

143
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,490
In the past,

144
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,800
I never once dreamed of owning a home
because I had no money.

145
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,160
But I won the lottery,

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,840
so I want to spend a big chunk of money.

147
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,210
Dad, you will help me again, right?

148
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,860
Excuse me, hello.

149
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,890
I believe we've never met before.

150
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,460
What are you doing here?

151
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,400
Well... Sir.

152
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,700
Do you know
who owns the plot of land here?

153
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,770
Why do you ask?

154
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,510
Are you perhaps a realtor?

155
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,510
Gosh, no. I'm not a realtor.

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,940
I'm interested in this plot of land.

157
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,920
I guess you own quite a bit of land too.

158
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,720
Gosh, no. I don't own any land.

159
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,890
Just a building.

160
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,890
A building?

161
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,420
Do you really have a building in Baeheung?

162
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,630
Not in Baeheung.

163
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,530
A little farther up north in...
My goodness.

164
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,230
Well, it's in Seoul.

165
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,530
Seoul?

166
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,070
Gosh, if you own a building in Seoul,

167
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,540
you must be a rich man.

168
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,840
Oh, please. A rich man?

169
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,540
I'm just a middle-class guy.

170
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,710
What on earth happened yesterday?

171
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,290
I remember drinking by myself
at the tent bar.

172
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,790
If there were a hole
big enough for me to fit into,

173
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,130
I wish I could go in there...

174
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,860
and just die.

175
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,130
You're pretty.

176
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,110
You're pretty just the way you are,
Seo Woo.

177
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,780
So, don't say that.

178
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,180
What was that? Was it a dream?

179
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,990
Whatever it was, it felt great.

180
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,160
Did you sleep well? Is your stomach okay?

181
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,760
Why would you ask me that?

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What?

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,970
Are we close enough
to exchange morning greetings?

184
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,370
I told you, didn't I?
I'm really mad at you.

185
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,380
Then, shouldn't you be saying
something other than...

186
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,410
a simple greeting?

187
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,650
Do you not remember
how I apologized to you?

188
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Apologize?

189
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,220
This guy told me he was sorry?

190
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,690
Of course, I remember.
I wasn't drunk, you know.

191
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,960
Can't you tell by how I got home
just fine on my own after I met you?

192
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,560
I'm just saying that...

193
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,830
this incident isn't something
you can wash away with a single apology.

194
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Okay.

195
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,200
I was going to tell you again
when we were both clear-headed.

196
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,800
So, I'll tell you now.

197
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,870
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
about Tae Hyung beforehand.

198
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
I mean it.

199
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,480
All right.
Let's say I accept your apology for now.

200
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,980
But I'm not sure
if my anger will go away or not.

201
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,290
When does Tae Hyung come back to Korea?

202
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,490
What? Why do you ask?

203
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,190
That's none of your business,

204
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,230
but you know when he gets back, don't you?

205
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,800
It's me.

206
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,040
Hey, boss.

207
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,010
You know those scary-looking guys
who came to the restaurant yesterday?

208
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,240
Yes, I was just about to ask you.

209
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,780
Who on earth were they?

210
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,150
Could they maybe be loan sharks?

211
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,120
What? Loan sharks?

212
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,550
I overheard that guy, Han Tae Ha,
talking on the phone a few times.

213
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,120
He was saying something like
paying back interest and whatnot.

214
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
Do you think they came here
because he didn't pay them?

215
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,330
Gosh, that punk.

216
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,400
I heard he blew all the money
he invested in that business.

217
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,160
Did he borrow money from loan sharks too?

218
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,700
What did you just say?

219
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,540
He blew the money he invested?

220
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,870
Oh, right. Tae Ha told me not to tell you.

221
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,610
He told you not to tell me?

222
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,180
You can't let on that
you heard it from me, okay?

223
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,080
Okay, so go ahead and tell me.

224
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,420
What exactly did he blow?

225
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,450
Well, he was going to do business
with a guy he knew from school.

226
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,220
He borrowed money from here and there
and made an investment.

227
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,430
But apparently, that guy
took all the money and fled overseas.

228
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,900
What did you say?

229
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,330
- Darn it.
- What? Hey...

230
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
- Come here!
- Han Tae Ha!

231
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
What?

232
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,440
- Darn you.
- Let go of him!

233
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,350
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

234
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,580
I won't let it slide.

235
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,490
You're that girl
from the restaurant yesterday, aren't you?

236
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,960
Get over here, you...

237
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,690
- Hey! Run!
- Gosh, get them!

238
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,930
- Stop right there!
- You!

239
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,930
Stop right there!

240
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,160
Hey! Stop!

241
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,130
Where do you think you're going?

242
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Hey, we have to go.

243
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,170
You're the one who saved me.

244
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,910
Do you want me
to get caught again so easily?

245
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,280
Do you really not know why I saved you?

246
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,450
Well, I'm sure you were being
a friendly neighbor...

247
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,150
as someone with a strong sense of justice
who couldn't pass by a guy in danger.

248
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,750
Wasn't it like that?

249
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,090
By the way,
you're speaking casually with me again.

250
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,090
Sense of justice, my foot.

251
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,460
If those guys drag you away,

252
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,230
who will pay me back?

253
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,670
What? Money?

254
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,340
Do you think I don't know that you blew
my 30,000 dollars while doing business?

255
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,770
But how do you know...

256
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,970
Tell me the truth.

257
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,470
You were going to take that watch...

258
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,180
and pay those people back, weren't you?

259
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,710
And what? Have me thrown in jail?

260
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,120
Hey, how about I have you thrown in jail?

261
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,520
How dare you blow my money...

262
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,450
and raise your voice at me as well?

263
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,520
Hey, give me back my money this instant.

264
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,460
Give me back my 30,000 dollars, you jerk!

265
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,830
My mom must've been so upset
to have done that!

266
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,270
Her daughter is struggling so much.

267
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,710
What kind of mom
would just sit back and watch?

268
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,180
Had I known this would happen,
I should've just listened to my mom.

269
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,020
I shouldn't have married you...

270
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,950
when my mom was opposed to it!

271
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,220
- Oh, dear.
- Come on.

272
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,530
Get out!

273
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,230
Grandma, what are you doing there?

274
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,000
- Go away!
- What?

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,070
Stop it.

276
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,830
It's nothing.

277
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,830
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,170
Stop it.

279
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,410
Seriously, I can't stand you.

280
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,980
I'm so embarrassed that I might just die!

281
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,310
Hey, come on.

282
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,150
My goodness.

283
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,690
Should I cancel my savings plan
and help them out?

284
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,560
No.

285
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,730
Back when Mi Jin asked me
to lend her money,

286
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,060
I said I didn't have any.

287
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,030
I shouldn't give her this money now.

288
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,900
Gosh, what am I to do?

289
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,610
I'm here to ask about a loan.

290
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,040
Yes, is there one in particular
that you looked into?

291
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,650
No.

292
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,480
(Nara Bank,
Cashier's Check: 95,321.55 dollars)

293
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,620
Here you go, sir.

294
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,950
Thank you.

295
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Are you participating
in a real estate auction by chance?

296
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,230
How did you know that?

297
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,400
Oh, when people ask for a Cashier's Check
for a very specific amount,

298
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,670
they're usually making a bidding
in an auction.

299
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,930
I don't know about anywhere else,

300
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,230
but that is the case in our VIP room.

301
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,400
I see.

302
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,710
I hope your bidding is successful.

303
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,770
Thank you.

304
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,980
Then, do you have a source of income?

305
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,350
No, I don't. I'm just a housewife.

306
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,220
In that case, do you have any assets
that you could borrow against?

307
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,920
Something like your own home
or a building in your name.

308
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,960
No, I don't.

309
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm sorry. In that case, it'll be hard
for you to get a loan from our bank.

310
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
A loan?

311
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,470
Yes, I understand.

312
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,090
What's this?

313
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,560
(Seoul Southern District Court,

314
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,500

(Han Mu Chul, Case Number 7709, Creditors)

316
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,130
What... This is our house.

317
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,670
I'm home.

318
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,740
Tae Ha. What is this?

319
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,710

Hey, here you are.

322
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,450
Hey, Mom. What's this?

323
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,220
Is our house being auctioned off?

324
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,930
What? Then, is that for real?

325
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,560
What will we do now?

326
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,000
Where will we live
if this place gets auctioned off?

327
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,100
What about the buildings?
We still have Dad's buildings, don't we?

328
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,770
They seized all of those too.

329
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,940
What? Then what will we do now?

330
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,140
Don't we have anything?

331
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,310
Wait, Mom. Are you sure?

332
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,980
Did all of Dad's buildings get seized?
Every single one?

333
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Yes.

334
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,750
You guys have to figure out a way
to make it in this world too.

335
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,790
No way.

336
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,460
How could Dad just go and die
after getting into this mess?

337
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,830
How are we supposed to live?

338
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,200
How could he just die all by himself?

339
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,900
Darn it. He never did anything for us
when he was alive.

340
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,570
How could he do this to us even in death?

341
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,840
What is all this?

342
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,410
Everything is a huge mess because of Dad.

343
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,540
Who does Dad think he is?

344
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,650
Who is he to put me in this misery?

345
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,380
Gosh, seriously.

346
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,690
What will we do, Mom? Do something.

347
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,360
Darn it. I'm so angry.

348
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,570
Hey, honey.

349
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,840
I want to talk to you about something.

350
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
Okay, talk.

351
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,210
Look at me so we can talk.

352
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,150
Are you going to keep avoiding me
like that?

353
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,050
Are you going to help Mi Jin?

354
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,490
Or,

355
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,360
will you help Ah Jin
start her own restaurant?

356
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,330
Tell me.

357
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,730
How do you plan to help our children?

358
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,670
It's not about that.

359
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,400
Then I have nothing to talk to you about.

360
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,410
Fine, forget it!

361
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,770
- Oh, good day.
- Hello.

362
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,080
Where can I get a bidding ticket?

363
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,680
Oh, over here.

364
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,450
I see. Thank you.

365
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,950
(Landlord Choi Gyu Tae,
Tenant Han Jae Joo)

366
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,290
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

367
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,490
Thanks to you, I can now open my shop
in the Daewoon Building.

368
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,930
Oh, please. Don't mention it.

369
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,200
I told you I could help you out
if you were interested in this building.

370
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,670
I think I met you because Lady Luck
was smiling on me that day.

371
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,440
Oh, right.

372
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,370
Here. It's nothing big. Please take this.

373
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,140
Hey! You didn't have to do this.
My goodness.

374
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,710
It's red ginseng.

375
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,750
- Thanks for this.
- My pleasure.

376
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,420
By the way, the power of attorney...

377
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,620
had your name on it.

378
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,190
You and the owner of the building
must be very close,

379
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,720
seeing how he entrusted you
with a building like this.

380
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,130
Well, I wouldn't say we're that close,
but anyway...

381
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,360
He's overseas now and can't visit often,

382
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,970
so just tell me
if there's anything you need.

383
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,800
I have to collect rent for him
and send it to him,

384
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,870
so remember that.

385
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,140
- Okay, got it.
- Good.

386
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,410
Thank you in advance for your help.

387
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,180
All right. You'll send me
the security deposit straight away, right?

388
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,980
Is he not here yet?

389
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,520
Gyu Tae, you're here.

390
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,290
Hi. Did you take a look?

391
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,760
- What?
- I told you to take a look.

392
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,820
Is there one you like?

393
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,230
What? Why look?
It's not like I'm going to get a car here.

394
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,160
Anyway, why did you want to meet here?

395
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,430
Hey, take your time and browse around.

396
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,230
Let's buy a car since we're here anyway.

397
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,300
Here?

398
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
But they only sell new cars.

399
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,840
I wanted to get a used car.

400
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,410
Come on. Just pick something.
I'll buy you a new car.

401
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,480
What? Goodness.
The cars here are very expensive.

402
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,710
Gyu Tae, let's go.

403
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,350
A friend of mine is a used car dealer.

404
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,450
He said he'd give me a good deal.

405
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,480
Come on.

406
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,980
Just pick one, okay?

407
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,220
The truth is, I sold a building.

408
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,720
It was an expensive one,
so I got a nice commission.

409
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,160
So, don't worry. Just pick a model.

410
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,390
But still...

411
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,360
- Goodness. Come on.
- No, wait!

412
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,230
Next, it's Case Number 7709.

413
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,500
Haengbok-ro 7, Sujeong-gu, Seoul.
It's a house.

414
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,870
The property's appraised value
is one million dollars.

415
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,010
All bidders, please come forward.

416
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,720
Case Number 7709.

417
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,120
There are five bidders in total.

418
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,160
I will now announce
the highest bidder for Case Number 7709.

419
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,260
(Bidder's Receipt)

420
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,570
Oh, my!

421
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,400
A fully loaded brand-new 2025 model?

422
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,410
Gyu Tae, is this car really mine now?

423
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,280
Yes. Drive safe, always. Okay?

424
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,740
Sure thing! Thanks, Gyu Tae.

425
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,650
Oh, right. Do you know anyone...

426
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,420
who knows a lot about investing?

427
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,150
I do know an investment expert.

428
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,090
You do? That's great.
Introduce us next time.

429
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,090
You want me to introduce you?

430
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,290
- Here. Let's go for a drive.
- Oh, my!

431
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,290
My gosh.

432
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,260
(Court)

433
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,800
Case Number 7709. The highest bid...

434
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,970
was 953,215.50 dollars.

435
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,970
Mr. Kim Dae Sik.

436
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,810
Me?

437
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,180
Is it really me?

438
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Dad.

439
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,490
Mom.

440
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,990
(Bidder's Receipt)

441
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,240
This car drives so smoothly.

442
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,410
Does it? Do you like it?

443
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,040
Oh, my. It's so smooth.

444
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,310
My gosh!

445
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,080
- Grandma.
- What?

446
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,410
- Grandma.
- Oh, no. Mu Chul!

447
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,780
My gosh, Mu Chul. What happened?

448
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,450
Mu Chul. Oh, no.

449
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,150
Sit up.

450
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,160
My goodness.

451
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,690
- Grandma.
- Yes, my sweetheart.

452
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,800
Are you all right?

453
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,500
Grandma, I'm sorry.

454
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,770
I'm sorry, Grandma.

455
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,170
Gosh, you silly goose.

456
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,340
If you do this,

457
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,940
your parents up above
will be so heartbroken.

458
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,650
Don't cry.

459
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,090
Oh, no. Mu Chul. Open your eyes!

460
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,490
Mu Chul, open your eyes.

461
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,230
Mu Chul. It's me, your grandma.

462
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,730
Open your eyes, please!

463
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,660
Can someone please save my grandson?

464
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,800
Oh, no. Mu Chul.

465
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,200
Open your eyes, Mu Chul!

466
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Grandma...

467
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,520
Grandma.

468
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,690
Grandma.

469
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,070
What?

470
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,370
What...

471
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,040
(Good Luck!)

472
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,440
Do you know when Jung Ah will be back
from her honeymoon?

473
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,810
Can we meet now?

474
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,440
Here. Gentlemen like you
who exude luxury...

475
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,250
should wear pure gold
as it suits you best.

476
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,710
But he has no money.

477
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,580
I went to a department store
and bought furniture.

478
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Good.

479
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,390
- Oh, you're selling octopus.
- It's finally starting to feel real.

480
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,190
- Here.
- I, Lee Hye Sook,

481
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,090
can live it up, at last.

482
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,390
Mom, wake up.

483
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,490
Mom!

484
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,800
