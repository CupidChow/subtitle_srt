1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,070
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,560
Even if my letter never reaches you,

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,030
I hope you find out how I feel about you.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,100
To my shining first love, L.

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,700
So, this "L" was Lee Mi Ja?

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,940
Not me, Lee Hye Sook?

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,610
(Episode 68)

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,910
Mi Ja.

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,020
I really regret what happened.

10
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,990
When Hye Sook asked me out,
I said yes in a fit of anger.

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,220
I really am a fool.

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,290
Why did I make that choice?

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,800
I guess I can't turn things back now,
can I?

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,830
Would I really be able to forget you?

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,700
Can I forget you and go on with my life?

16
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,610
Honey.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,250
Who was your first love?

18
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,910
Oh, come on.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,620
Who else would it be? You know it too.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,140
The three million dollars...

21
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,110
What if I took care of that for you?

22
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,980
I get that they're friends,

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,090
but how will he help us out...

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,620
with three million dollars?

25
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,430
Anyway, I wonder if Mu Chul
is meeting with Mr. Kim.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,970
(Number One Real Estate)

27
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,240
The construction completion date numbers
were the winning lottery numbers.

28
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,740
And the person who won...

29
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,840
was Dae Sik.

30
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,710
Oh, dear.

31
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,950
Mu Chul, what are you doing there?

32
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,630
What?

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,900
Dae Sik won the lottery
with numbers that matched...

34
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,230
the construction completion date?

35
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,500
- Yes.
- So,

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,040
you've always bought lottery tickets
with those numbers,

37
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,440
but Dae Sik was the one who won?

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,480
Well, there was only one winner.

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,610
I must've forgotten...

40
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,020
to buy a lottery ticket back then.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,850
That's strange.

42
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,320
How could something like this happen?

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,620
But was this building
so important to me...

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,690
that I would buy lottery tickets...

45
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,560
with those numbers every week?

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,030
Oh, yes, of course.

47
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,700
The Daewoon Building was
the first building you built in your life.

48
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,270
I see.

49
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,640
Gosh, but how did I end up
losing this precious building...

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,040
in a foreclosure?

51
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,640
My goodness.

52
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,910
Oh, right. Then, is the current owner...

53
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,250
someone I don't know?

54
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,850
Of course. You wouldn't know.

55
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,790
Anyway, you guys have both made it.

56
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,800
Dae Sik won the lottery,

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,230
and you've become rich.

58
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,030
I'm not that rich.

59
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,900
By the way, I heard you told Dae Sik...

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,400
you wanted to clear your remaining debt
of three million dollars.

61
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,810
Yes.

62
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,910
Dae Sik told my wife that he'd take care
of the three million dollars.

63
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,050
Well, I am grateful,

64
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,420
but it's such a huge amount of money.

65
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,520
I don't think I can accept it.

66
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,490
Just wait.

67
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll give you that money.

68
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,990
- You will?
- Not now,

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
but since you've been...

70
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,970
living like this for a while,
hang in there a little longer.

71
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,300
I will take care of it in one go.

72
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,700
If this investment is a success,

73
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,840
I will give you back
the Daewoon Building...

74
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,280
and all of your money.
So, just hang tight, man.

75
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,380
I'm so grateful...

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
to you and Dae Sik.

77
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,490
I am really...

78
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,290
a lucky guy.

79
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,590
Where else would I find...

80
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,030
such good friends like you?

81
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,030
So, you will only take 500,000 dollars?

82
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,130
Yes.

83
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,370
I mean, if you give me more,
I'd be happy...

84
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,210
But I'd be glad
with just 500,000 dollars too.

85
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,040
I should be grateful for that. Yes.

86
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,410
Gwang Sik.

87
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,650
Do you remember...

88
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,050
when you first came to see me
to ask to marry Mi Jin?

89
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,420
When I was opposed to the idea,
saying you were too old...

90
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,520
and that you didn't seem diligent enough,

91
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,420
what did you say to me
as you kneeled before me?

92
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,930
That you'd take responsibility for Mi Jin,
no matter what happens.

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,430
Didn't you say that you'd never make
Mi Jin shed a single tear?

94
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,170
Yes, sir.

95
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,700
Now, what do you think?

96
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,700
Are you keeping your promise?

97
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,640
I may seem heartless in your eyes,

98
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,940
but all parents feel the same way.

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,050
You may not know
since you only have one child,

100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
but to me,

101
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,690
Mi Jin is my first love who taught me
what it's like to have a child.

102
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,260
That's why I cry tears of blood
if Mi Jin cries.

103
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,260
That's how I truly feel.

104
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,900
(Jackpot Chicken)

105
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,070
I hope you and Mi Jin work hard
and rely on each other...

106
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,940
to get back on your feet
by your own efforts.

107
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,440
You two are still young and healthy.
Whatever you choose to do,

108
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,970
I doubt you'll go hungry.

109
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,250
Some might say 500,000 dollars
is a lot of money,

110
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,210
while others might say it's not that much.

111
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,250
You should consider this
your final opportunity and work hard.

112
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,320
Keep in mind.

113
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,720
If you ever make Mi Jin cry again,

114
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,990
I really won't sit back and watch.

115
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,860
Do you understand me?

116
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,770
Yes, sir.

117
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,170
(Daewoon Building)

118
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Then,

119
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,670
I'll be going.

120
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,070
Okay, see you.

121
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,580
You scared me.

122
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,250
I thought you were going on vacation.
What are you doing here?

123
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,660
(Jackpot Chicken)

124
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,730
What?
You got back together with your wife?

125
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,230
Yes.

126
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,570
From now on,

127
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,930
we'll be living together.

128
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,170
I'm glad to hear it.
You went through so much heartache.

129
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,270
Congratulations.

130
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,810
Oh, right.

131
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,710
About the three million dollars.

132
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,380
I heard from Mi Ja that you said
you'd help me out with it.

133
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,850
Yes, have you given it some thought?

134
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,850
Gosh, I am grateful for the thought,

135
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,860
but it's a huge amount of money.

136
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,620
I don't think I can accept it.

137
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,260
I only suggested it
because I could afford to.

138
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,590
Don't feel too pressured.

139
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,060
Yes. I know.

140
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,330
What? Know what?

141
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,700
I know that you have a lot of money.

142
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,970
You won the lottery, didn't you?

143
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,910
My gosh.

144
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,450
Hey, but how did you find out about that?

145
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,550
I overheard your son-in-law
talking about it.

146
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,860
The winning numbers...

147
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,520
The Daewoon Building's completion date.

148
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,630
I always used to buy lottery tickets
with those numbers.

149
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,900
Did you buy a lottery ticket
with those numbers too?

150
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,030
Should I tell you the truth now?

151
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,800
That you gave me that lottery ticket?

152
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,880
No, was that what those numbers meant?

153
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
What?

154
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,180
You didn't know?

155
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,150
Of course not. I didn't know.

156
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,850
That's so fascinating.

157
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,890
I just bought a lottery ticket
with automated random numbers.

158
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,060
I never imagined that was
the Daewoon Building's completion date.

159
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,290
I always used to buy lottery tickets
with those numbers.

160
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,330
I couldn't believe I lost that chance.

161
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,230
Honestly,
I was really jealous at first, but...

162
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,940
it wasn't anyone else who won. It was you.

163
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,540
I'm rather glad.

164
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,680
Congratulations, Dae Sik. Truly.

165
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,880
Right. Thanks.

166
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Seok Jin, I'm done for the day.

167
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,460
Where should we meet?

168
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,060
I'm sorry. Something suddenly came up.
I don't think I can come.

169
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,400
What is it about?

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,330
It's something at work.

171
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,530
You should head home first. I'll call you.

172
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay, bye.

173
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,040
I wanted to see him.

174
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,380
He'll get off work soon.

175
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,150
Should I just see him in person
for a second?

176
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,390
Good work, everyone.

177
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,990
Are you two going somewhere together?

178
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,160
Yes, we have somewhere to go.
See you tomorrow.

179
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,560
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

180
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,860
- Good work today.
- Bye.

181
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,400
Oh, hello.

182
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

183
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,730
We haven't seen you in a while.

184
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,840
Yes. Where is Seok Jin?

185
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,070
He just went that way with Ms. Park.

186
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,110
They said they were going somewhere today.

187
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,440
Is that right?
Where did they go by themselves?

188
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,310
I'm not sure.

189
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,810
By the way, have you seen Ms. Park lately?

190
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,820
Yes. Why?

191
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,420
Weren't you surprised?

192
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,890
I mean, she changed her style and hair,

193
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,460
and now she looks like
a whole different person.

194
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,860
Isn't it fascinating?

195
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,660
You know what surprised me more?

196
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,030
The fact that her father owns K.Win Logis.

197
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,860
What? What do you mean?

198
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,430
K.Win Logis?
You mean, the courier company I know?

199
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,310
So, you and Ye Won have been friends
since you were young. Is that right?

200
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,040
Yes. We went
to elementary school together.

201
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,950
After that,
we saw each other from time to time,

202
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,880
and then reconnected
at our college in the US.

203
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,980
I see.

204
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,250
You probably thought
she was a poor student.

205
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,520
Oh, yes.

206
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,560
She's extremely stubborn.

207
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,590
No one can stop her
once she sets her mind to doing something.

208
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,430
We kept offering her help,

209
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,170
but it seemed like
she wanted to struggle on her own.

210
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,270
Mom. Do you have to bad-mouth me
in front of Seok Jin like that?

211
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,840
I was pretty flustered
when I first found out,

212
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,640
but now I think
it was so typical of Ye Won.

213
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,840
It was typical of Ye Won?
What do you mean?

214
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,350
Back in school,
she was always so independent...

215
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,450
and never afraid
to take on new challenges.

216
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,220
I learned a lot from her.

217
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,190
Knowing her,
I understand why she did that.

218
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,820
Oh, really?

219
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Anyway, thank you
for thinking so highly of our daughter.

220
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,030
You must've heard that K.Win Logis...

221
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,530
would be collaborating
with Farm to Market.

222
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,170
Yes, I don't know how to thank you enough.

223
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,500
You don't need to thank me.

224
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,170
I'm a businessman, you see.

225
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,810
I never get involved in things
that won't earn me money.

226
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,480
I made the decision
after calculating my potential profits,

227
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,280
so you don't need to be so touched.

228
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,180
Okay, then. I will do my best.

229
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Try this.

230
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,090
It's my mom's specialty.

231
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,790
Oh, sure.

232
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,730
It's delicious.

233
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,100
You're an amazing cook.

234
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,860
Really? Thank you.

235
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,970
This is the first time
Ye Won brought a boyfriend home,

236
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,110
so I prepared a special meal for you.

237
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,140
Pardon? Oh, well...

238
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,180
Mom, we're just friends.

239
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,250
You already know that.

240
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,450
That's how all couples begin.

241
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,550
If my daughter brought home
a competent young man like you...

242
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,350
as her future husband,

243
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,120
I would have nothing more to wish for.

244
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,890
What do you say, honey?

245
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,260
That would make my day.

246
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,660
What do you think of Ye Won?

247
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,000
As a woman, not just as a friend.

248
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,800
You two, seriously.

249
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,300
Stop it.
You're making Seok Jin uncomfortable.

250
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,880
Sorry. My parents can be
a little mischievous like that.

251
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,510
Don't mind them. Just eat.

252
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,640
All right.

253
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,680
- Dig in.
- Enjoy the food.

254
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,280
Thank you.

255
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,560
See you tomorrow.

256
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,460
Oh, right.

257
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,030
What is it?

258
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,800
Can you watch the restaurant alone
for a few hours tomorrow?

259
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,170
Tomorrow? Sure, I can.

260
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,900
But why? Is something going on?

261
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,570
I told Dong Min that I'd accompany him
to his company event tomorrow.

262
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,810
Hey, why would you go there?

263
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,080
Also, company events
aren't open to non-employees.

264
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,950
I thought so too,

265
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,520
but he said
we could attend together as a couple.

266
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
As a couple?

267
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,350
Anyway, hold down the fort while I'm gone.
Good night.

268
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,940
I'm home, and you won't even say hi to me?

269
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,140
Don't you have something to say to me?

270
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,340
If this is about the lottery winnings,
I don't want to hear it.

271
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,710
Gwang Sik agreed
to accept just 500,000 dollars.

272
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,490
What is this?

273
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,960
Goodness. I still had this?

274
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,230
Throw it out.

275
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,070
Are you upset because of that letter?

276
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,900
Because of something
that happened over 30 years ago...

277
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,810
that I don't even remember?

278
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,570
What if it's still ongoing?

279
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,540
- What?
- Honey.

280
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,880
You offered
three million dollars to Mi Ja.

281
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,120
You're letting her live here rent-free.

282
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,390
And you send 5,000 dollars
to her account every month.

283
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,790
Now, you want to give her three million
as if that's not enough?

284
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,930
You know, I was going to tell you.

285
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,230
Mu Chul...

286
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,330
now knows that we won the lottery.

287
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,240
He congratulated me,

288
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,040
not realizing
he gave me the lottery ticket.

289
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,580
I couldn't bring myself
to tell him that he gave me the ticket.

290
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,850
Legally, I have no obligation
to give her any money.

291
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,350
You remember, right?

292
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,720
When we were getting married,

293
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,450
we almost had to give up
on signing for our matrimonial home,

294
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,820
but thanks to Mu Chul's help,
we were still able to sign the contract.

295
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,560
Back then, he just told me
he dipped into his savings to help me,

296
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,360
but he did way more than that.

297
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,530
He gave me his security deposit
by moving out of his apartment...

298
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,240
and moving into housing
at the construction site where he worked.

299
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,980
Mu Chul's remaining debt is
around three million dollars.

300
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,110
I want to help him.

301
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,050
So, can't you please understand me, honey?

302
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,280
You are asking me to understand again?

303
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,550
I won't say a word
once I give them the money.

304
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,690
I'll only think about our family.
So, please...

305
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,360
Let's help him just this once, okay?

306
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,060
How could you...

307
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,560
keep saying that to me?

308
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,300
For 40 years.

309
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,900
For 40 long years, I believed...

310
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,740
that I was your first love.

311
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,710
I thought,
"He chose me over the great Lee Mi Ja."

312
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,910
I told you
that was the only thing I had...

313
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,820
to be proud of when I had nothing.

314
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,720
You remember that, right?

315
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,620
But it turns out...

316
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,490
Lee Mi Ja was your first love,

317
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,120
and you...

318
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,260
only chose me out of anger.

319
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,430
I just found out about all of this now,
so how do you think I feel?

320
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,800
Fine, I get it. The past is the past.

321
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
But...

322
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,440
you never gave three million
to your wife or kids,

323
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,540
and you want to give it to Mi Ja?

324
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,120
You know everything
I've had to put up with...

325
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,320
because of money over the years.
You know all about it,

326
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,620
yet you're asking me to understand?

327
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,260
How could you say that?

328
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,190
How?

329
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,350
So, that means...

330
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,380
Hye Sook's family was the one...

331
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,780
who won the lottery?

332
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,150
Yes, apparently.

333
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,620
My gosh. I knew it.

334
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,430
I wondered how he was going to
take care of such a large amount of money.

335
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Hold on.

336
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,630
How did he win the lottery
with those exact numbers?

337
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,670
Honey.

338
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,070
Did you buy that lottery ticket
and give it to Mr. Kim?

339
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,540
Gosh, no.

340
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,110
He said he let the machine
pick the numbers automatically.

341
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,990
I guess I didn't buy
any lottery tickets that week.

342
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,530
Why did you not buy
any lottery tickets that week?

343
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,560
Honey.

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,200
Take your time and try to recall.

345
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,340
There were so many properties
in your name before.

346
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,310
I think you must have done something
to protect them before you died.

347
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,640
I mean, knowing you,

348
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,540
there's no way you would've lost
everything you had, just like that.

349
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,580
How many properties did I have?

350
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,990
You had ten buildings in your name alone.

351
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,420
Ten buildings?

352
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,060
But you got scammed.

353
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,330
You said you'd sell them through Mr. Choi.

354
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,430
I know one of them got sold.

355
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,430
You said the money was sent
to Mr. Choi's bank account.

356
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,140
To Gyu Tae's account?

357
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,540
The creditors seized
all your bank accounts.

358
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,610
You said you had no choice
but to have the money sent to his account.

359
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,780
I see.

360
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,550
I guess Gyu Tae was the only one
I could really trust.

361
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,220
So,

362
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,220
I asked Mr. Choi about it
after your funeral.

363
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,020
I already gave Mu Chul that money.

364
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,830
What? What do you mean?

365
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,930
When?

366
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,470
Well, he asked me to withdraw the money,

367
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,630
so I gave him the full amount in cash.

368
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,740
He said he would take it with him
to Hong Kong.

369
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,770
Then, did he lose all that money
to those jerks?

370
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,110
Mr. Choi told me...

371
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,320
you had all that money taken away too.

372
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,250
Goodness. I see.

373
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,150
If you'd had that money,

374
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,290
things wouldn't have been so hard for you
after my funeral.

375
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,330
Honey,
do you really not remember anything?

376
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,700
Is there anything you remember
about listing those buildings for sale?

377
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,070
No, nothing.

378
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,870
I'm truly grateful to Gyu Tae
for so many things.

379
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,110
Also, Gyu Tae said he would...

380
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,540
pay off the three million dollars
for me instead of Dae Sik.

381
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,320
How does Mr. Choi have that kind of money?

382
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,420
Well, I did see him
in a really nice car that one time.

383
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,360
Does he make truckloads of money
these days?

384
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,830
It's more about the heart than the money.

385
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,230
These days, having Dae Sik
and Gyu Tae by my side...

386
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,100
makes me feel so reassured and grateful.

387
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
It gives me so much strength.

388
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,670
Well, that is true, but...

389
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,510
By any chance,

390
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,720
do you have any assets
that you could put up as collateral?

391
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,890
The Daewoon Building is...

392
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,390
the first building I've ever built.

393
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,460
I must protect it, no matter what.

394
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,040
Thank you.

395
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,770
- Oh, how adorable.
- Good job.

396
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,610
Oh, look.

397
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,680
What?

398
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,950
- Jin Tae.
- Yes?

399
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,280
There's a gold mine
that anyone can see is a treasure trove.

400
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,420
It's right before my eyes,
but I don't have a pickax.

401
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,890
But then, if you see
someone else's pickax in front of you,

402
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,030
would it be right...

403
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,530
to steal it and mine that gold first?

404
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,430
Do you have to mine it immediately?

405
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
Can't you do that
after you go and buy a pickax?

406
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,070
No, there's no time,
and I don't have money for a pickax.

407
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,570
Then, you should mine it.

408
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,340
You would feel bad
about stealing the pickax,

409
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,880
but if you mine enough gold,
you could buy a new pickax for them.

410
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,110
Right. That should be okay, right?

411
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,720
By the way, why do you suddenly ask?

412
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,380
Are you going to a gold mine?

413
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,520
Min Yong.

414
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,250
Geum Ok?

415
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,720
I'll get the door.

416
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,230
- You're here.
- Hey, Min Yong.

417
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,740
What brings you here this late?

418
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,410
I told you to call me.
I was going to bring over side dishes.

419
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,770
You said you would.

420
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,080
Oh, right. So, you came to bring us food?

421
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,150
Here. Pan-fried anchovies
and spicy dried squid strips.

422
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,610
I made a few other dishes too.

423
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,080
Thank you.
I'll go and put these in the fridge.

424
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Okay.

425
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,720
You should have some tea
since you're here.

426
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,050
I'll bring you a cup of tea.

427
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,220
Oh, it's fine. I don't need tea.

428
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,690
Goodness, hang on a minute.
I'll bring it right out.

429
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
But...

430
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,700
Hey, stay here for a minute.
I'll go inside and get changed.

431
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Okay.

432
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,280
It's pretty tidy
for a house with only men living here.

433
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
What?

434
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,650
("All the Techniques for Love")

435
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,720
"All the Techniques for Love?"

436
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,230
Is he even reading books
for his relationship now?

437
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,030
Oh, what's this?

438
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,100
Property tax?

439
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,970
How much is this? One, two, three, four...

440
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,570
Why is he paying so much
for property taxes?

441
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,710
I can't believe Seok Jin.

442
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,650
He told me it was something for work.

443
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,090
How could he go somewhere
with just Ye Won?

444
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,600
Why aren't you worth a glance?

445
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,910
What about you is lacking
in comparison to Mi Ja?

446
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,710
You were my first love,

447
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,580
and you're the coolest woman in the world.

448
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,010
Compared to Mi Ja,
you're a thousand times better.

449
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,720
From now on, don't you ever say
something like that again. Got it?

450
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,850
I'm such a happy woman.

451
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,620
Honey.

452
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,320
Thank you for loving me.

453
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,160
I love you too.

454
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,530
I love you, honey.

455
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,370
I love you, Kim Dae Sik!

456
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,840
Goodness.

457
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,740
What a sight this is.

458
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,470
Honey.

459
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,240
- Oh, hey.
- What are you doing out here?

460
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,150
I'm paying nothing.

461
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,080
Mr. Kim told me
we didn't have to pay anything.

462
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
I'm living here rent-free.

463
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,220
You didn't know?

464
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,420
The three million dollars...

465
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,220
What if I took care of that for you?

466
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,870
Hey, Seok Jin.

467
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,700
Have you seen your mom?

468
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,040
I haven't. Is she not in your room?

469
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,450
Oh, honey.

470
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,120
Where are we going?

471
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,020
Just come along.

472
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,990
We have somewhere to go.

473
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,720
- All right. Let's go.
- What?

474
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,790
You said you didn't remember
how to use an ATM, right?

475
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,930
You can practice with me.

476
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,360
An ATM?

477
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,300
- Hello, sir. How may I help you?
- What?

478
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,530
- Yes.
- Mi Ja, it's Gyu Tae.

479
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,500
Well, I'm trying to take out a loan
with a building as collateral.

480
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,470
Oh, it is him.

481
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,910
The building is worth
about ten million dollars.

482
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,210
How much could I get in loans?

483
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,820
- Ten million dollars?
- Then, shall we talk upstairs?

484
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,080
Yes, sure. Let's do that.

485
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,160
Mr. Choi owns a building
worth ten million dollars?

486
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,340
But it turns out...

487
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,210
Lee Mi Ja was your first love,

488
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,770
and you...

489
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,910
only chose me out of anger.

490
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,350
I just found out about all of this now,
so how do you think I feel?

491
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,520
You never gave three million
to your wife or kids,

492
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,820
and you want to give it to Mi Ja?

(Jackpot Chicken)

494
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,270
Hey, where did you go
at the crack of dawn? I was worried.

495
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,210
Hey, honey.

496
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,210
I was wrong.

497
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,510
Gosh, how could I even think
to lend someone...

498
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,980
such a huge sum of money...

499
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,280
without even discussing it with you?

500
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,350
I must've been out of my mind
for a minute.

501
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,890
Please forgive me.

502
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
What's this?

(Application for Divorce

504
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Let's...

505
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
get divorced.

506
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,130
(Good Luck!)

507
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,590
I told you before.

508
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,430
Please don't visit the office
whenever you please.

509
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,170
I heard you were looking for a model.

510
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,700
So, I came in for an audition.

511
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,970
I want to be
in a serious relationship with you.

512
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,610
I hate the very idea of you.
I hate you so much!

513
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,680
So, please get out of my face! Get lost!

514
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,450
You mean witch.
