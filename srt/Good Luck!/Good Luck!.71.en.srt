00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,880
What? This must be a popular restaurant.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,750
Twisted donuts?

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,420
I should buy some for Mi Ja.

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,260
(Yisan)

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,800
The Yisan Building?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,000
Do you remember the Yisan Building?

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,370
Yisan Building?

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,300
It was your building that was sold.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,510
That building is called
the Yisan Building.

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,050
(Yisan)

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,520
My gosh.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,730
If this building
and the Daewoon Building were mine,

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,060
I must've been...

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,100
really rich.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,930
I've heard a lot about you from Mr. Choi.

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,740
I heard...

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,910
that you were interested
in buying the Daewoon Building.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,640
Yes, that's right. This was where
my childhood home used to be.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,350
I'm quite attached to the place.

23
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,320
Then, why don't you just buy it now?

24
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,590
I'll be going abroad again soon.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,090
Pardon?

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,620
Well, the thing is...

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,190
Say yes.

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,060
When are you leaving the country again?

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm leaving tomorrow evening.

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,440
As for me,
I'm fine with selling it to someone else,

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,140
but you seem pretty attached to the place.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,640
As the saying goes,
you should strike while the iron is hot.

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,410
You seem like you've made up your mind,

34
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,350
so you should just go ahead and buy it.

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,120
My goodness.

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,290
Sorry for jumping straight to the point
without even having a proper conversation,

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,390
especially since we just met.

38
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,160
Anyway, please give it some thought
and let me know.

39
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,800
- Yes.
- I'm busy, so I should get going.

40
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,930
Yes.

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,370
- Have a good day.
- You too.

42
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,670
- Have a good day, sir.
- I'll be off, then.

43
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,800
All right.

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,680
What's there to worry about?

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,580
The owner is here.
You should just purchase the building.

46
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,550
If I tell my wife
I'm buying the Daewoon Building now,

47
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,220
she's going to flip out.

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,450
She's already hounding me for a divorce.

49
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,820
Then just go ahead
and give her half of the lottery prize.

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,890
She told you to do whatever you want
with the rest of the money.

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,590
What if she really divorces me
and leaves me?

52
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,100
Will you take responsibility for it?

53
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,730
Hey, she can't get a divorce
unless you agree to it.

54
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,000
What can she do?

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,330
As soon as she has that money,

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,440
she'll stop going on about divorce.

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,170
Hye Sook says she wants a divorce...

58
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,380
because she's fed up with you
being such a cheapskate.

59
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,480
Just be generous
and give her half of the money.

60
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,550
Then she'll be like,
"Oh, I was wrong about this man."

61
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,750
"I should stay with him forever."

62
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,920
Her resentment will melt away instantly.

(Jackpot Chicken)

64
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,040
Hey, something came up.

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,370
You're at that cafe, right?

66
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,750
What?

67
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,150
Who is that man?

68
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,580
Why am I getting this headache
all of a sudden?

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,360
His name is Jang Tae Poong.
He's a nasty guy.

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
What?

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Jang Tae Poong!

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,140
Jang Tae Poong?

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
(Taxi, Vacant)

74
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,900
Shoot. Wait!

75
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,850
So? Choi Gyu Tae said he'd sell a building
and send you more money?

76
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,850
That's right.

77
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,580
I thought he'd just take out a loan,

78
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,680
but he's selling a building
to send more money. It's good for us.

79
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Hold on.

80
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,390
He must be talking about
the Daewoon Building.

81
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
It's the only building in his name.

82
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
That's right.

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,000
If he sells it,
we'll get at least ten million dollars.

84
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,270
Ten million?

85
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,140
By the way,
Han Mu Chul used to own that building.

86
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,740
So, how did Choi become the owner?

87
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,810
Did Han sell it to him?

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,650
In the past, Han told me...

89
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,380
that the Daewoon Building
meant a lot to him...

90
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,950
and that he'd never sell it
even if he had to sell everything else.

91
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,750
Then what?

92
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,490
He didn't sell it?

93
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,190
I'm sure he did,

94
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,590
but probably just for show.

95
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:22,890
Just for show?

96
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,630
I bet he just transferred ownership...

97
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,930
to Choi Gyu Tae to keep the building
from being auctioned off.

98
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,200
Then came the twist no one expected.
Han died.

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,610
Then Choi Gyu Tae took over the building?

100
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,710
- Bingo.
- My gosh.

101
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,250
I didn't think he was that kind of person.

102
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,720
Choi Gyu Tae is scary.

103
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,220
He took over his friend's building?

104
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,120
He's worse than you.

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,990
People are all the same.

106
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,920
Do you think you'd be any different?

107
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,490
In that situation,

108
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,230
who wouldn't get greedy?

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,700
Yes, Mr. Jang.

110
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,630
The building is about to be sold.

111
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,240
Oh, it has to be decided by this week?

112
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,780
Yes, got it.
Please give me a little more time.

113
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,010
Well, thank you for everything today.

114
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,220
The agency will pay you.

115
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
And...

116
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,550
Here, take this.

117
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,220
Oh, what is this?

118
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,630
You cannot tell anyone
about what happened earlier.

119
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,900
You must keep it to yourself.
Do you understand?

120
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,030
Yes, I understand.

121
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,130
- Great.
- Thank you.

(Number One Real Estate)

123
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,770
Gyu Tae!

124
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,740
Hey, why are you here again?

125
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,810
Hey, you know what?

126
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,210
Hey, if you're going to go on
about my property taxes, just stop.

127
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,520
Also, why do I have to
report my properties to you?

128
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,250
You're not my wife.

129
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,260
No, it's not about that.

130
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,320
I saw that woman, Mrs. Taylor.

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,860
She was going somewhere with another man.

132
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,330
A man?

133
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,670
Yes, he had big eyes
and kind of looked like a weasel.

134
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,100
Anyway, is she two-timing you?

135
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,410
Goodness. Is bad-mouthing Mrs. Taylor
your hobby or what?

136
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,970
Cut out the crazy nonsense!

137
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm telling you the truth.
They seemed really close.

138
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,820
They were whispering
to each other about some investment.

139
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Investment?

140
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,290
It must've been Mr. Jang.

141
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,850
Mr. Jang? Who's that?

142
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,390
None of your business!

143
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,160
Who is Mr. Jang? Tell me.

144
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,360
Hey, do you have to
keep bothering me like this?

145
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,970
Fine! I'm not curious anymore.

146
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,770
What? Hey.

147
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Hwang Geum Ok!

(Number One Real Estate)

149
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,810
I only told him because I was worried.

150
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,740
I'll never give him any side dishes again.

151
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,850
Gosh, what time is it now?

152
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,290
Is Ah Jin managing okay by herself?

153
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,290
I feel dizzy.

154
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,270
Hey, Tae Ha. Are you all right?

155
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,970
I made some porridge for you.
Sit down and have some.

156
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,280
No, I'm stepping out.

157
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,080
Where are you going?
You're not feeling well.

158
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,950
Hey!

159
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,950
Hey, Ah Jin.

160
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,860
What? Dong Min. Why are you here again?

161
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,290
Me? I'm off today,
but I have nothing to do.

162
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,690
So, I came to see you.

163
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,300
What's with the porridge?
Do you want to add it to the menu?

164
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,030
No, someone's sick.

165
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,570
I had some leftover ingredients,
so I made this porridge.

166
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,540
Someone's sick? You mean, me?

167
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,940
Oh, Mr. Han. Are you all right?

168
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
Aren't you busy?

169
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,720
It was busy earlier, but it died down.

170
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,350
You should rest at home. Why are you here?

171
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,890
You said you were sick.

172
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,960
I just thought...

173
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,420
it would be hard for you
to work on your own.

174
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,790
Is there anything I can help with?

175
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,800
- Gosh, what was that?
- Oh, my. Are you okay?

176
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,900
How will you work in this condition?

177
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,800
Have you eaten anything?

178
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,340
No. Maybe that's why I feel dizzy.

179
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,810
Hang on a minute.
I'll give you some porridge.

180
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Porridge?

181
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,750
I made some with the leftover ingredients
for bibimbap.

182
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,950
Oh, right. Have you eaten, Dong Min?
Do you want some porridge too?

183
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,550
No, I'm fine.

184
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,360
Did you really make this?

185
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,060
Because of me?

186
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,290
Why do you keep asking?

187
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,860
The food will get cold. Come on.

188
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,860
The three million dollars
that I mentioned.

189
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,090
I never intended to accept it,
so don't worry.

190
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,330
Three million dollars?

191
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,360
Your husband said he'd give it to me
on his own. My husband and I...

192
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,500
never thought about accepting it.

193
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,100
I'm just telling you
in case you get the wrong idea.

194
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,410
Mom, what did she just say?

195
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,010
Three million dollars?

196
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,320
Is it true that Dad is giving Ms. Mi Ja
three million dollars?

197
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,390
Tell me.

198
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,920
Did Dad really say that to Ms. Mi Ja?

199
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Dae Sik.

200
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,070
- I'm back.
- Hey, you're here.

201
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,630
- Did you deliver the order?
- Yes.

202
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,630
I think...

203
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,440
I saw that guy.

204
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,770
That guy?

205
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,040
Jang Tae Poong, the guy who conned me.

206
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,680
I saw a man on the street,
and I got a splitting headache.

207
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,850
You know how I get headaches...

208
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,720
when my memory is
about to come back, right?

209
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,050
Yes, I know.

210
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,090
I had a feeling that man was him,
so I chased after him,

211
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,090
but I lost sight of him.

212
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,490
Goodness, that's a shame.

213
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,060
I felt that way
when I saw some guy before too.

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Anyway,

215
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,870
my subconscious must remember that man.

216
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,940
I don't know who he is,
but I hope you find him soon.

217
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,380
Yes.

218
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,880
Oh, right.

219
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,010
Yesterday,

220
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,650
Hye Sook and Mi Ja...

221
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,250
had a fight.

222
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,690
They fought? But why?

223
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,990
I'm not exactly sure,

224
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,290
but according to Mi Ja, Hye Sook...

225
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,730
has been really on edge lately.

226
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,200
Is something going on between you two?

227
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,410
I'm going out for a minute.
Watch the restaurant for me.

228
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,410
What?

229
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,740
My gosh.

230
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,740
Maybe I should move away.

231
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,050
Hye Sook makes me so uncomfortable
that I can't stand to live here.

232
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,320
Was I too mean?

233
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,220
Oh, whatever!
Why did she have to suspect me?

234
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,800
Oh, that's right.

235
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,430
Hey, Seo Woo!

236
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,240
Just wait until this brat gets home.
I won't let her off the hook.

237
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,150
Okay, then.
Let's vote for a model we each like.

238
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,180
I vote for Seo Hye Mi.

239
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,980
Then, I vote for Han Seo Woo.

240
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,350
Oh, me too.
My vote goes to Han Seo Woo as well.

241
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,890
Oh, dear. I vote for Han Seo Woo too.

242
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,860
We're all on the same page.

243
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,230
Well, except for Ms. Park.

244
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,030
I don't think Seo Woo's image
is right for our company.

245
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,400
Pardon? In what way?

246
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,970
Our shopping mall aspires
to have a clean and fresh image.

247
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,770
Seo Woo's image is more bubbly and cute.

248
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I don't know.

249
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,780
I think that's what gives her
an unexpected charm.

250
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,110
Produce can feel pretty static,

251
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,720
so a bubbly model like Seo Woo...

252
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,250
might be able to give
our shopping mall a boost of energy.

253
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,850
I agree.

254
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,330
Also, didn't Seo Woo do the best
during the audition itself?

255
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,930
That's how I felt.

256
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,390
She was the best of the bunch.

257
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,670
So, have you decided on a model?

258
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,070
Yes, we came to a decision
based on majority rule, but...

259
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,240
Why? Is there a problem?

260
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,870
No, there's no problem.

261
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,440
It's been decided.

262
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Hello?

263
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,850
Really?

264
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,320
Oh, thank you! Yes!

265
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,150
I'll be right there.

266
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,620
Okay.

267
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,360
I can't believe I got the job.

268
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,470
Thank you so much for choosing me.

269
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,800
I will do my absolute best
for Farm to Market.

270
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,770
Gosh, we should be thanking you instead.

271
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,270
You're the face of Farm to Market.
It pumps me up for some reason.

272
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,710
Thank you. I'll work really hard.

273
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,780
I hope we work well together.

274
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,120
Same here.

275
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,290
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

276
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,750
Let's work well together, Ms. Model.

277
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,160
Come on.

278
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,820
(Number One Real Estate)

279
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,230
Has Dae Sik made up his mind?

280
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,430
Dae Sik.

281
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,570
Hey, Gyu Tae.

282
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,370
Come in.

283
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Hey, did Dae Sik go somewhere?

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,040
He went out for some fresh air.
Why? Do you have something to tell him?

285
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,080
No, it's nothing.

286
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,280
By the way,
is everything okay with you these days?

287
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,610
You know me. Same old, same old.

288
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,920
Oh, right.

289
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,050
Earlier, I was out on a delivery,

290
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,150
and I saw the Yisan Building.

291
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,850
Yisan Building?

292
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,560
Yes. Why are you so surprised?

293
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,630
It's nothing.

294
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,060
Okay. Anyway, what did you do there?

295
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,100
I bought some twisted donuts
to give to Mi Ja.

296
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Do you want some too?

297
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,030
No, I'm okay.

298
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,240
How is your memory lately?

299
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,340
Do you remember things bit by bit?

300
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,210
Well, just barely.

301
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,010
They come and go.

302
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,420
Goodness. Oh, right. Mi Ja told me...

303
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,750
that you helped me out a lot...

304
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,090
and sold the Yisan Building for me...

305
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,320
when I was conned.

306
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,760
Yes, I did.

307
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,960
Thanks.

308
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,400
My gosh.

309
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,800
If not for you, who else
could I have asked for such a favor?

310
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,600
Thank you so much. Really.

311
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,140
I'll repay the kindness...

312
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,910
that you and Dae Sik showed me, okay?

313
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,310
Really.

314
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,550
Okay.

315
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,790
I told you to just go home.
Why are you being so stubborn?

316
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,560
It's fine. I'm better now.

317
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,760
Also, thanks for the porridge earlier.

318
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,530
Oh, that?

319
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
It's no big deal.

320
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,970
If you're done, shall we get going?

321
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,200
- Should I turn out the lights?
- Sure, go ahead.

322
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Oh, boy.

323
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,120
I'm so proud of you, Seo Woo.

324
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,960
You got the job without my help.

325
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,490
Thanks.

326
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,200
But I'm sad that I can't see you
from my room these days.

327
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,670
When are your sister
and her husband leaving?

328
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,300
I don't know either.

329
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,900
Hey, Seo Woo.

330
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,570
Oh, boy.

331
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Hello.

332
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,310
Oh, hello.

333
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,680
Why are you with him?

334
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,750
Oh, we met out here.

335
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,380
Hi, Ah Jin.

336
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,290
Hi. How have you been?

337
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,290
Good.

338
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,590
Let's go inside.

339
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,420
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

340
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,620
I'll go inside first.

341
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Hey, Han Seo Woo.

342
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,300
(Kim Dae Sik)

343
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,970
What? Why?

344
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,700
You've been acting
kind of suspicious lately.

345
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,940
What do you mean?

346
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
You.

347
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,370
You're getting more pocket money
from Dad, aren't you?

348
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,210
What? Pocket money?

349
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,310
I mean, you're always going out
and coming home late.

350
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,910
How would you do that
when you don't have any money?

351
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,150
You're getting more money
by whining to Dad, aren't you?

352
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,420
Be honest. If not, I'm going to tell Mom.

353
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,490
Do whatever you want.

354
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,230
I'm home.

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,570
You two. We need to talk.

356
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
What?

357
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,840
Dad said he'd give Ms. Mi Ja
three million dollars?

358
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,450
Do you think that makes any sense?

359
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,550
He said he could only give us
500,000 dollars each,

360
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,880
but he wants to give a total stranger
three million dollars.

361
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
Does that even make sense to you?

362
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
No, it doesn't.

363
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,960
But why would he offer her so much money?

364
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,230
Isn't it obvious?

365
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,730
Because she is Dad's first love.

366
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,200
Is that really the reason?

367
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,130
No way.

368
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,300
Whatever.
I can't let this slide this time.

369
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,380
I have to get to the bottom of this,
for Mom's sake.

370
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Dad.

371
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,520
You guys.
Why are you all coming out of there?

372
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,260
Can we talk?

373
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,290
- What is it?
- Is it true...

374
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,190
that you offered Ms. Mi Ja
three million dollars?

375
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,060
How could you do that?

376
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,630
You ignored me heartlessly
when I begged you for help.

377
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,570
How could you offer so much money
to someone who's practically a stranger?

378
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,280
Did you do that...

379
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,910
because that lady is your first love?

380
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,750
- What?
- Even if she is your first love,

381
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,520
that's a huge amount of money.

382
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,450
If I were Mom,

383
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,490
I'd be beyond upset.
I'd feel completely betrayed.

384
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,090
Of course, we feel betrayed too.

385
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,490
I also think this is wrong.

386
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,100
It's one thing for us to be upset,
but when you think about Mom,

387
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,760
you really crossed the line this time.

388
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Okay, so?

389
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,440
Are you guys questioning me right now?

390
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,410
Yes, I wanted to give her that money.

391
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,210
But is it your money?

392
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,850
I received that money
when I won the lottery.

393
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,980
I'm trying to spend my own money.
Who are you to step in?

394
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,720
Yes, you're right. It's not our money.

395
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,990
But it's not just your money.
It's Mom's money too!

396
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,790
I get that
you didn't earn the money by working,

397
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,690
but isn't it only right
that you share it with Mom?

398
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,800
Dad.

399
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,330
It's not about the amount.

400
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,400
What matters is who you were trying
to give the money to.

401
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,500
You know how upset
Mom has been over the lottery money.

402
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,310
I can't believe
you tried to give her that money.

403
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,010
That's enough, you guys.

404
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,350
This is something
your dad and I need to sort out.

405
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,320
You guys shouldn't get involved.

406
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,120
So, drop it now. All of you.

407
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,070
My gosh. You scared me.

408
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,610
Where were you?

409
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,310
Mom, I got a job.

410
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,580
A job? Where?

411
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,880
At Seok Jin's company.
I'm their model now.

412
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm starting tomorrow.

413
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,920
Why did you hit me?

414
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,990
Be honest with me.

415
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,790
You're dating Seok Jin, aren't you?

416
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,530
What? No, what do you mean I'm dating him?

417
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,470
Mom, why do you have this?

418
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,230
Why does it have to be Seok Jin,
of all people?

419
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,200
Why? What's wrong with Seok Jin?

420
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,040
He's much more capable
and a better person than I am.

421
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,140
So what if he's so great?
You two can't be together.

422
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,880
My gosh, I can't believe this.
Do you have to do this to me?

423
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,510
Why do you keep hitting me?

424
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,250
- Honey.
- He's such a wonderful person.

425
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,350
Why can't we be together?

426
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,920
- Gosh, honey.
- Unbelievable!

427
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,520
Why are you hitting Seo Woo?

428
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,120
You, listen carefully.

429
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,990
I will never approve of Hye Sook's son.

430
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,560
Even if his father
were the president of this country,

431
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,530
I still wouldn't approve of him,
so give up now.

432
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,800
- Do you understand?
- My gosh, honey!

433
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,700
No! I refuse to break up with him.

434
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,370
Just tell me to die!

435
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,770
- What did you say? Stop right there!
- Seo Woo!

436
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,740
- Honey, stop.
- You brat! Stop right there!

437
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,910
- You little... Let go!
- Calm down, okay?

438
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,970
Let go!

439
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,480
What? So, you mean...

440
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,510
Seo Woo is dating Dae Sik's son?

441
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,750
Yes, she is!

442
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,190
Why? Why their son, of all guys?

443
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,020
Goodness. I should meet with Seok Jin.

444
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,820
Why?

445
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,860
Well, I've seen him a few times,

446
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,870
but we should sit down
and have a serious conversation.

447
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,670
Don't bother. They'll break up anyway.

448
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,110
I'll never approve of their relationship.
Not while I'm alive.

449
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,140
So, don't bother meeting him!

450
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
My goodness.

451
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,220
You're still here?

452
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,720
I went home and came back.

453
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,220
Are you leaving for the day?

454
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,320
(Jackpot Chicken)

455
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,330
Yes.

456
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,230
Hey, is something the matter?

457
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Gyu Tae.

458
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,600
Why does it feel like
I've been living my life all wrong?

459
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:59,140
My wife and even all my kids
resent and criticize me for everything.

460
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,780
I've never felt so distanced
from my own family.

461
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,250
Hey, it all started
after you won the lottery, right?

462
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,020
It happens to everyone
when they suddenly...

463
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,060
come into a lot of money.

464
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,800
They all think I'm doing
whatever I want with the lottery winnings,

465
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,730
but that's not true.
Money really scares me.

466
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,500
I thought I should own a home
since I'm getting older,

467
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,610
and I want to help my friend
clear his debt. That's all.

468
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,910
But now, I feel like I'm the biggest jerk.

469
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,710
Don't worry about that.

470
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,650
You should spend money
on yourself and your family.

471
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,490
This shows how different you and I are.

472
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,430
Now that I have money,

473
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,000
my heart keeps pounding,
and my head spins.

474
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,470
It feels like the money will disappear
if I don't spend it,

475
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,370
and I just want to make more,
so I can't sit still.

476
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,970
Is that so?

477
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,510
Even I feel this way.

478
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,010
Think about
how your family must be feeling.

479
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,510
Especially your wife.

480
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,650
There's so much money right before her,
but she can't even spend it.

481
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,920
Honestly, I feel so bad for her.

482
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,850
Honey.

483
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,220
Do you really want half of that money?

484
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,290
All right.

485
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,090
Then let's split the money.

486
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,500
Do you mean it?

487
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,970
But that doesn't mean
I agree to the divorce.

488
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
I'm just giving it to you
so you can spend it however you like.

489
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,600
I will never divorce you.

490
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,270
I'll find a way to give you the money
with as little loss as possible.

491
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,550
So, feel free
to do whatever you like with the money.

492
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,610
I don't care what you do with it.

493
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,100
Hey, Dae Sik.

494
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,770
Gyu Tae, I'll buy it.

495
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,710
What?

496
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,510
The Daewoon Building.

497
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
I will buy it.

498
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,360
(Good Luck!)

499
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,360
Oh, that woman looks familiar.

500
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,300
I almost got caught.

501
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,740
Hey, why is it so packed?

502
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,100
No idea. What is going on?

503
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,770
- You know,
- Really?

504
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,940
- I ran into Seok Jin out front.
- Good night.

505
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,280
He didn't seem all that bad.

506
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,350
What does that mean?

507
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
