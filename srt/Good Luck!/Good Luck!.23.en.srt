1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,810
What?

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,940
Han Mu Chul?

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,810
Why are they saying my name?

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,510
Woman, seriously.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,750
I get that you hated him,
but you shouldn't be like this.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,920
He's dead, so the least you can do
is attend his funeral.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,420
Darn it. That guy, Han Mu Chul,

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,760
is bothering me even in death.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,230
- Goodness, what a jerk.
- What? Death?

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,130
Me?

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,600
Then, you should go alone.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,100
I will never go there.

13
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,570
Come on.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,300
Bye, then.

15
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,310
Hey, wait up.

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,560
My goodness. How could she be like that?

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,930
I mean Mi Ja.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,060
How could she not even shed a tear...

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,000
when her husband died?

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,300
Forget about shedding tears.
She's actually smiling right now.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,470
I'm sure she's not smiling on the inside.

22
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,240
Her heart must be all torn up.

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,480
She's all torn up
with a full face of makeup on?

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,310
My goodness.

25
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,210
Who wears red lipstick to a funeral?

26
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,780
I've held a funeral for my husband too,

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,180
but that's so not right.

28
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,820
Hang on. Did Mu Chul and Mi Ja
have a bad relationship when he was alive?

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,530
They'd bicker every now and then,

30
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,230
but I don't think things were this bad.

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,260
I doubt they had a good relationship.

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,570
- Oh, right.
- What?

33
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,570
Why not?

34
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,240
Well, you know...

35
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,770
A married couple can't only have
happy moments when they're our age.

36
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,940
Every couple has their ups and downs.

37
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,580
Still, he was her husband
for several decades.

38
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,220
I honestly don't get it.

39
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,190
She seems way too coldhearted.

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Do you know
what people were saying earlier?

41
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,230
That the wife didn't seem sad at all.

42
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,330
They were wondering
if she had wanted her husband dead.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,200
People sure do say all kinds of nonsense.

44
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,270
Something could've happened
between them that we don't know about.

45
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,740
How could they say such things?

46
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,810
Let's mind our own business.

47
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,210
By the way, it looks like
there will be lots of leftover food.

48
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
What do we do?

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,140
Oh, dear.

50
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,700
Thanks, Tae Hyung.

51
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,470
I didn't tell you
in case it made you worry,

52
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,000
but you came anyway.

53
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,040
Of course, I should come.

54
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,940
It was your father of all people
who passed away.

55
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,710
I had to put everything aside
and come here.

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Seok Jin.

57
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,650
Mom.

58
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,210
Thanks, Seok Jin.

59
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,280
You must be busy too,
but you came all this way.

60
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,090
It's fine. Dad's friend passed away.
Of course, I should be here.

61
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,690
Is there anything I can help with?

62
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,090
No, we're fine.

63
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,530
By the way, who is this?

64
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,660
Hello, I'm Kim Tae Hyung.

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm Seok Jin's friend from high school.

66
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,300
Goodness, so you're Tae Hyung.

67
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,570
Thank you, Tae Hyung.

68
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,270
You don't know how grateful I am
that you helped Seok Jin out.

69
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,570
Don't mention it.

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,780
I'm more grateful for Seok Jin.

71
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,150
Goodness, you speak so nicely too.

72
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,180
You should come over
to our place sometime.

73
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,550
I'll make you some good food.

74
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,150
Okay, thank you.

75
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,220
By the way,
how are the three of you here together?

76
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,760
Tae Hyung, do you know Seo Woo as well?

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,220
Can you guys wait for me outside?

78
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,060
I'll be right out after I talk to my mom.

79
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,490
Oh, okay.

80
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,700
Then, I'll see you later.

81
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Okay, bye. See you next time.

82
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,700
Bye.

83
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,310
I didn't know I'd see Seok Jin's mom here.

84
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,940
She didn't have to be so grateful, though.

85
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
It was kind of overbearing.

86
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Oh, that?

87
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,650
My dad invested in Seok Jin's business.

88
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,050
He was having a hard time
since he didn't have an investor,

89
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,320
so I introduced them.

90
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,220
Oh, I see.

91
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,030
Gosh, but that punk has gotten
a little irritable lately.

92
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,600
Has he forgotten that he's doing business
all thanks to me?

93
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,170
By the way,

94
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,800
you don't look so great.

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,540
Oh, I couldn't eat for a few days...

96
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,170
or get any sleep. I guess that's why.

97
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Things are really tough, aren't they?

98
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
Cheer up, kid.

99
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,650
I didn't even know
you were going through so much...

100
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,220
and only got angry with you
for not going on that trip.

101
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,690
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,760
It's okay.

103
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,460
Are we leaving right away?

104
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,660
Oh, yes.

105
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
I'll be going.

106
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,930
Okay. Bye.

107
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,410
Hello?

108
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,980
Hey, why aren't you keeping your promise?

109
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,850
You should've sent me the money already.

110
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,020
I'm sorry. I have a family emergency
to take care of.

111
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,950
That's your problem.

112
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,190
You should still send over
the money on time!

113
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,220
Is this it?

114
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,460
Hey, isn't that Tae Ha?

115
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,960
Well, I don't mean
that I won't pay you back.

116
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,030
Goodness, it's not like that. I'm sorry.

117
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,470
Who is he talking to
that he's so apologetic?

118
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,440
Pardon? Interest?

119
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,580
If you run off with my money,
I will kill you.

120
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,310
Of course, I'll pay you back.
Why would I run off with your money?

121
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,450
How could you say such an awful thing?

122
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
Right, I'm sorry. Well, it's...

123
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,190
Right now, I have... I'm so sorry.

124
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,330
Don't worry. Yes.

125
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,530
Once everything is over,
I'll send you the money right away.

126
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,860
Yes, goodbye.

127
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,470
No, it's not... Just a moment.

128
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,440
Hey, Jin Tae. I have some urgent business
and have to get going.

129
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,110
I don't think I can be here with you.
Is that all right?

130
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,370
I'm sorry. Be sure to stay for a meal.
You too.

131
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,510
- Okay.
- But...

132
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,880
Hey, is there something going on
between you two?

133
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,220
No.

134
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Is that right?

135
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,190
So, why do I think
it seems like he's avoiding us?

136
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,560
Right?

137
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,190
It seems that way to you too, doesn't it?

138
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,190
Let's go inside for now.

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,300
(Ieum Funeral Hall)

140
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,820
(The late Han Mu Chul, age 61)

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,220
My gosh, my name is actually there.

142
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,160
(Wife: Lee Mi Ja,
Son: Han Tae Ha, Daughter: Han Seo Woo)

143
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,220
What in the world...

144
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,030
My goodness.

145
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
But how...

146
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,910
Hey, you should go and eat.

147
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,350
You might collapse at this rate.

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I'm fine.

149
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,050
You're not fine at all.

150
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,650
Stop being stubborn and listen to me.

151
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,190
Come on. Eat a few bites...

152
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,390
I said I was fine.

153
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,100
My goodness.

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,530
Why is she letting her pride
get in the way?

155
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,230
This isn't the time or place for that.

156
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,940
Hye Sook, we have visitors.

157
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,240
Oh, okay.

158
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,330
Gosh, what is going on?

159
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,170
They think I died...

160
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,130
and even held a funeral for me?

161
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,500
How did I end up a dead man?

162
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,540
This won't do. I should go
and say I'm alive before it's too late.

163
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,810
I'm alive and kicking.
Are they trying to curse me?

164
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,980
Wait.

165
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,120
This might actually be for the better.

166
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,220
If people think I'm dead,

167
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,520
the creditors won't be able
to keep asking for money.

168
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,460
The police said I might go to jail.

169
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,400
But if I'm dead, it'll all be over.

170
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,000
This is a sign from on high.

171
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,870
It's a blessing from above...

172
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,740
to save me, Han Mu Chul.

173
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,110
Indeed, a lucky man
can do anything he wants.

174
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,480
Oh, my.

175
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,220
I should let my family know
that I'm still alive, though.

176
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,860
How do I tell them?

177
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,670
(The late Han Mu Chul, age 61)

178
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,140
What? A funeral?

179
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,910
He was your dad's friend?
Then shouldn't you go too?

180
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,980
Why would I go there?

181
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,550
I mean, if he were your dad's friend,

182
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,120
you must've known him too.

183
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,380
I did know him,

184
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,090
but my whole family hated him,
to be honest.

185
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,160
Even my dad
didn't like him that much either.

186
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Why not?

187
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,890
They were friends. Why didn't he like him?

188
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,260
You know, the building
where my parents' restaurant is in.

189
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,230
He owns the Daewoon Building,

190
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,630
and he's the landlord of my parents' home.

191
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,270
He was that guy.

192
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,140
Oh, that stingy, mean jerk?

193
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,640
He was the man who died?

194
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,280
Yes. He asked my parents to pay
100,000 more for their security deposit...

195
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,340
and made them decide
to close down their restaurant.

196
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,210
Why should I go to his funeral?

197
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,420
Gosh, but he had so much money.

198
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,880
Why was he such a scrooge?

199
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,420
If I had that much money,
I'd be so generous.

200
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,590
If I become rich,

201
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,230
I'll donate lots of money...

202
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,930
and help out neighbors in need.

203
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,500
That's how I'll live.

204
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,600
I'll give back all my wealth
to society when I die.

205
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,540
Give back your wealth, my foot.

206
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,470
You can say that stuff
after you actually become rich.

207
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,310
Hey, can't I even talk about it?

208
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Aren't you going out today?

209
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,910
Don't tell me that you were fired
from your part-time job too.

210
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,450
Come on. What are you talking about?

211
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,220
I was just about to head out now, anyway.

212
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,790
Don't you dare get fired
from that job too.

213
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,790
- Just wait and see what happens then.
- Yes, ma'am.

214
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,960
Hey, are you riding
that scooter or whatever...

215
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,330
and doing deliveries today too?

216
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,600
Yes, I'm about to leave.

217
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,770
Can you not do that?

218
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,430
I mean, there are plenty of other jobs.

219
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,270
Why do you have to make deliveries?

220
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,000
What's wrong with making deliveries?

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
That's all he can do at this point.

222
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,040
Also, they pay a lot of money.

223
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,480
You're normally afraid of things
with wheels on them.

224
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,480
Aren't you afraid of scooters too?

225
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,450
Mom. Do you think I'm still a kid?
I'll be back.

226
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,620
Hey!

227
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,890
See you.

228
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,890
Bye.

229
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,560
Oh, my! Are you making
spicy marinated crab, Mother?

230
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,500
Wait, is it because
I was losing my appetite?

231
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,170
I can just eat anything we have at home.

232
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,380
I'll put this in the refrigerator.

233
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,380
Give it to Gwang Sik when he gets home.

234
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,780
He goes crazy for crab.

235
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,850
I'm sure he'll like it.

236
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,620
Do you mean these are all for him?

237
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,220
You said you shouldn't have
salty and spicy foods.

238
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,090
Eat lots of bland foods...

239
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,730
and do the laundry.
I'm going inside to rest.

240
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,040
I can't believe this.

241
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,410
(Special Room 1)

242
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,620
Why isn't anyone coming
to pay their respects?

243
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,160
And I don't see
a single wreath here for me.

244
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,690
Didn't they let people know about it?

245
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,630
Han Mu Chul is dead.

246
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,460
Lots of people should come...

247
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,100
so they can pay lots of condolence money.

248
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,370
My goodness.

249
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,870
It's not like I can call people
and tell them I'm dead.

250
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,140
Darn it.

251
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,940
By the way,
why don't I see my family around?

252
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,750
Are they even here?

253
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,850
This won't do.
I should look for them myself.

254
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,590
Hey, Hye Sook.

255
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,430
I'll go.

256
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,900
Hello, are you here alone?

257
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,500
Excuse me.

258
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,180
How did you know Mr. Han?

259
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,550
Oh, gosh. Right.

260
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,890
Enjoy your food.

261
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
My goodness.

262
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,560
- Oh, my.
- What's wrong, Hye Sook?

263
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,830
I nearly died.

264
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,730
Why? Who is that guy?

265
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
I don't know.

266
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,200
Maybe he's a beggar
who was just passing by.

267
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,970
I nearly died from the stench
when I got close to him.

268
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,470
But I don't want to be mean
and just turn him away.

269
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,180
There aren't that many guests here anyway.

270
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
I just let him be
so he could stay for a meal.

271
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,080
I could tell from the way he was dressed.

272
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,050
Goodness,
how could there be so few people here...

273
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,320
that even a beggar showed up?

274
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,990
Hye Sook, I've never seen a funeral
with so few guests before.

275
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,060
Mu Chul may have had a nasty temper,

276
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,660
but how can his funeral be this empty?

277
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,660
Goodness, how would I know?

278
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,670
Look at that.

279
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,440
Oh, my. He really must be a beggar.
I can't believe it.

280
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,340
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

281
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,410
Fine. Since I'm here,

282
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,410
let's just enjoy the meal. I'm starving.

283
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,350
By the way, my family...

284
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,590
will be so surprised
once they realize that I'm alive.

285
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,660
I bet they regretted so many things
after I died.

286
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,760
"I should've been nice to him
while he was alive."

287
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,760
Especially Lee Mi Ja.

288
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,630
Even if she says she was wrong...

289
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,060
and asks to live together again,
it won't do her any good.

290
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,230
I will never take her back.

291
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,970
Did you see Han Mu Chul's wife?

292
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,170
What kind of wife
doesn't shed a single tear...

293
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,740
when her husband just died?

294
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,440
I know.

295
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,210
I was surprised to see it too.

296
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,780
I mean, forget about the tears.

297
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,080
She didn't even look sad at all.

298
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,190
She was even laughing too.

299
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,360
- What?
- Do you think that's all?

300
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,520
Why, this woman...

301
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,730
- Her makeup was...
- I'm dead,

302
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,860
- and she's laughing?
- Who is she trying to look good to...

303
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,930
in the midst of all this?

304
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,170
With every spare minute,

305
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,140
she kept touching up her makeup.

306
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,200
What a messed-up family.

307
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,110
How could that family
not even bat an eye...

308
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,840
when the head of their household died?

309
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,110
I mean, it's not like I don't understand
where they're coming from.

310
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,750
He was so awful with us,

311
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,380
so I'm sure he was even worse
with his family.

312
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,720
To be honest, I wasn't going to come...

313
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,390
as I didn't want to pay condolence money,
but here I am.

314
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,760
So, did you pay some condolence money?

315
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,890
Why should I pay that?

316
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,100
Do you know
how much I spent on hospital bills...

317
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,600
because he stressed me
to the point of becoming ill?

318
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,830
Instead of paying condolence money,

319
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,270
I told him to repent and live well
in his afterlife.

320
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,170
What?

321
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,040
I should've done the same too.

322
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,010
When else would I get the chance
to say what I want to that jerk, right?

323
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,650
Why, those punks. They're trash-talking me
at my own funeral!

324
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,120
He was such a jerk.

325
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,290
Goodness gracious.

326
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,660
Darn it.

327
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,730
What do you know about my wife and me
to go on about us like that?

328
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,660
She may not seem like it,
but she must be sad on the inside.

329
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,300
We've lived together for years.

330
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,770
How could she be just fine?

331
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,100
You people don't know
what you're talking about.

332
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,350
Tae Ha.

333
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,420
Tae Ha. Hey...

334
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,320
- That jerk, Han Mu Chul! Here he is!
- Out of my way!

335
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,720
Hey, you! Does your father think
he can just die like that?

336
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,230
- Give me my money.
- We want our money.

337
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,930
Tell him to die after paying me back!

338
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,300
Don't do this here! Calm down!

339
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,230
Please don't do this here.
Let's talk outside.

340
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
- Let's talk outside, okay?
- Hey.

341
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,570
You're Han Mu Chul's son, aren't you?

342
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,840
Go and tell your dead father.

343
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,140
He should pay us back before he dies.

344
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,670
Han Mu Chul. Before you pay us back,

345
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,440
you can't die just because you want to.
Got it?

346
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,550
Those scumbags.

347
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,850
How dare they make a scene
at someone's funeral?

348
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,520
Forget about this.
Let's go and grab the money box.

349
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,120
- All right.
- What did you say?

350
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,360
What do you think you're doing?

351
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,190
(Condolence Money)

352
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,190
Let go of this.

353
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,560
- You let go.
- Let go of this!

354
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,230
- Oh, no.
- Why, you little...

355
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,030
- Oh, my!
- Tae Ha!

356
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,000
Why, I ought to teach those guys a lesson!

357
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,200
What do you think you're doing?

358
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,170
What are you doing?

359
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,910
Why are you causing a scene here?

360
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
Are you seriously asking us that?

361
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,480
Your husband died without our permission!

362
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,020
Even if he wanted to die,

363
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
he should've paid us back first!

364
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,390
My husband?

365
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,020
Who says that man is my husband?

366
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,890
You must be mistaken, but that man...

367
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,960
is not my husband anymore.

368
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,300
Don't make me laugh. Why not?

369
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,170
Did you get a fake divorce
so you wouldn't have to pay off his debt?

370
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,300
You don't believe me?

371
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,870
Then, let me show you.

372
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,970
Tae Ha! Go to the morgue right away
and bring your father's corpse here.

373
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
What?

374
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,740
My corpse?

375
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,310
These people say they don't believe me,

376
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,550
so I'll have to show them
in front of your dad...

377
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,820
that I have nothing to do with him now.

378
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Will that be enough?

379
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,060
Will you believe me
if I show you in front of his dead body?

380
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,030
I've erased the man called Han Mu Chul
from my life long ago.

381
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,900
If I tell him not to bother me
in death as well...

382
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
and that he should be grateful
that I even came to his funeral,

383
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,170
will you believe me then?

384
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,510
You people should tell him in person too.

385
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,810
Even if he dies,
he should pay you back first.

386
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,410
Stop bothering the wrong people...

387
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,510
and tell the man in person!

388
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,980
What are you doing? Bring his corpse here!

389
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,020
Mom, stop it.

390
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,560
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

391
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,130
Hey, how dare you come here?

392
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,130
Get out this instant.

393
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,400
- Didn't you hear me? Get out!
- Get out of here!

394
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,870
- Get out!
- Get out this instant!

395
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,040
- Hurry up and leave.
- Get out!

396
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,770
- Darn it!
- Away!

397
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,070
- Go!
- We'll be back.

398
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,980
- Got it?
- See you later.

399
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
Get lost!

400
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,010
You'll have to pay us back!

401
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,520
(Rest in peace,
from the CEO of Moon Hotel)

402
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,390
Honey, is that how you feel?

403
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,530
Do you hate me so much...

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,500
that you'd reject me
in front of my dead body?

405
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,440
Were we really...

406
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,240
in such a bad state?

407
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,490
Oh, dear.

408
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,940
Hye Sook, should we tell her
to go and get some rest?

409
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,210
Leave her be.

410
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,010
Out of the way!

411
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,280
Why, you punks...

412
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,410
How dare you?

413
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,220
I ought to just...

414
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,120
Why did he have to get scammed?

415
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,620
He's making us put up with so much
even after he's gone.

416
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,420
Do you remember that time?

417
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,230
When Mu Chul went to
Chang Hoon's funeral...

418
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,900
and made a huge scene
asking for his money back.

419
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,930
I'm sure he didn't know either...

420
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,800
that he'd pay for what he sowed
just like this.

421
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,700
Goodness.

422
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,770
I'm going to the restroom.

423
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,470
- All right.
- Okay.

424
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,830
Oh, right. The acquisition tax.

425
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,060
I have to pay
the building acquisition tax...

426
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,300
and sell the building soon.

427
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
I almost forgot.

428
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,170
I should hurry before they close.

429
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,910
Fine. Just go.

430
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,710
Go away, all of you.

431
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,980
Family or whatever.

432
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,350
I don't need any of them!

433
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,350
(Dad)

434
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
It's a lighter.

435
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,860
Your birthday gift.

436
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,660
Seo Woo and I saved our allowances
and bought it together.

437
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,060
Oh, kids.

438
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,400
Daddy quit smoking long ago.

439
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,670
Thanks.

440
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,310
Tae Ha.

441
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
Seo Woo.

442
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,020
So, just get out.

443
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,460
Get out of my life, please!

444
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,470
Okay.

445
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,240
All right.

446
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,840
So if I'm gone, you guys will be fine.

447
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,850
Do you mean that he took his own life?

448
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,020
We can't rule out that possibility.

449
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,090
I will just go someplace
where no one knows me...

450
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,100
and start fresh!

451
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,600
All the people I've known so far.

452
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,300
I will erase them completely from my life.

453
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,040
I, Han Mu Chul,

454
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,170
will live my second life!
Just wait and see!

455
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,380
I'll become even more successful...

456
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,710
and come back to show all of you!

457
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,490
(10 dollars)

458
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,990
Money.

459
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
It's money.

460
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,230
Right. Money is all that matters.

461
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,010
Money never turns its back on anyone.

462
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,380
I don't need anything else.

463
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,780
Money!

464
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,580
Only money...

465
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,790
will help me survive!

466
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,720
(10 dollars)

467
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
What...

468
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,090
My money.

469
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,960
(10 dollars)

470
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,700
Gosh, my money.

471
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,770
My money.

472
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,170
My money. Darn it.

473
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,870
Where did it go?

474
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,240
My money.

475
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
Goodness.

476
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Darn it.

477
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,680
Gosh, where did it go?

478
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,980
Oh, there it is.

479
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,960
No!

480
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,690
Oh, my!

481
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,990
(Good Luck!)

482
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,290
Mu Chul's buildings...

483
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,230
are all being seized.

484
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,630
- What?
- What will Mi Ja do now?

485
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,730
Her husband died, and she lost her money.

486
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,730
You pity me?

487
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,840
Are you taking pity on me right now?

488
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,910
No way. I'm a landlord.

489
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,710
Right. The Yisan Building.

490
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,110
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
