Jang Tae Poong is a swindler?

so I'm on my way there now.

Yes.

I guess they're throwing the party
somewhere around here.

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,880
Yes, but I can't find the place.

99
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,050
Anyway, I'm off.

- Why?

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,060

Hey, what are you doing?

104
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,260
Let go!

105
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,830

you could grab my wrist like that?

108

115

What? What do you mean?

116
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,220
Stop seeing Tae Hyung.

117
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,690
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

118
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,760
The other day,
you said he didn't answer your calls.

119

120

00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,600
Aren't you...

122
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,740
his friend?

123
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,110
Why would you talk about your friend
in that manner?

124
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,680
He is my friend,
but what's wrong is wrong.

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
Does Tae Hyung know...

126
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,910
that this is what you think of him?

127
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,350
I appreciate your concern,

128
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,280
but I'll deal with it
since it is my problem.

129
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,850
And from now on, don't talk to me
about Tae Hyung in that manner.

130

don't cross the line.

It's not like that.

138

139
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,560
Me? I just had some business nearby.

140
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,000
What brings you here?

141
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,870
Are you playing hooky
because Jin Tae isn't around?

142
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,400
Playing hooky? As if.

143
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
It's the restaurant's break time.

144
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,010
So, your dream is
to open up that restaurant, right?

145
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,720
No. Not that restaurant.

146
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,190
I mean, I couldn't wish for anything more
if I had a restaurant like that.

147
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,520
It's about the right size.

148
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,290
And it doesn't look that expensive either.

149
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,490
Is that it? What will you do
in that tiny little space?

150
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,230
Why is your dream so modest?

151
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,130
You know, you're supposed to dream big.

152
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,140
That way, you can achieve big success too.

153
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,800
You don't know anything, do you?

154
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,280
Why? Are you not happy about something?

155
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,680
By any chance,

156
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,720
have you been in touch with my boss?

157
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,180
Jin Tae? No, I haven't.

158
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,150
What could be going on?

159
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,490
He has never done this
for the past two years.

160
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,830
He always opened
and closed the restaurant himself.

161
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,100
Gosh, leave him be.

162
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,830
He must be going on a trip
with his girlfriend for a few days.

163
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
His girlfriend?

164
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,070
That's right.
He could've just acted like...

165
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,370
something was wrong
because he felt sorry for you.

166
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,040
Is that it?

167
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,410
Anyway, let's go and eat this.

168
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,680
It's on me.

169
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Come on.
It hasn't been that long since we ate.

170
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,450

172
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Not once.

174
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,190

175
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,230
Yes, you can.

176
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,430
Hey, coupons? That's so embarrassing.

177
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,900
Forget it. I'll just buy you one.

178
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,230
What's so embarrassing?

179
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,270
I got these by buying food
with my own money.

180
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,170
- I'll use these.
- Okay.

181
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,210
I'll take one too.

182
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,310
You're still young,
but you go crazy for free things.

183
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,810
They say you might go bald
if you love freebies so much.

184
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,880
You don't even have a pretty face.

185
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,620
What will you do
if you don't even have hair?

186
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,650
What did you say?

187
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,550
Here you go.

188
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,020
Thank you.

189
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,290
You want sauce on yours, right?

190
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,330
Of course. Lots of sauce.

191
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,800
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

192
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,170
Gosh, that's spicy.

193
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,880
Hey, what is this?

194
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,210
Watch what you say from now on.

195
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,350
If you talk about me going bald once more,

196
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,150
I'll show you who's boss.

197
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,320
Eat up.

198
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Why, you... Hey.

199
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Gosh, it's spicy.

200
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, dear.

201
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,600
My goodness. This can't be true.

202
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,910
Oh, dear. How could this be?

203
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,710
Goodness me.

204
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,710
Darn it.

205
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,320
The number you have dialed...

206
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,780
- is not in service.
- What?

207
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,550
- Please check the number and try again.
- Not in service?

208
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,060
Darn it, Jang Tae Poong! This punk!

209
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,660
My goodness. I can't believe this.

210
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,930
Jang Mi?

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
My gosh.

212
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,700
Let's meet up. I have something to say.

213
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,840
Forget it. I'm busy. Oh, right.

214
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,910
Hey, are you still in touch with Mr. Jang?

215
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,950
Mr. Jang?

216
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,550
The last time I saw, you two seemed close.

217
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,020
Hasn't he called you?

218
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,590
No, he hasn't.

219
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,620
But why do you ask?

220
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
It's nothing.

221
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,460
Also,

222
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,360
don't call me from now on!

223
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,170
Hello? Mu Chul!

224
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,330
My gosh.

225
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,270
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave a message...

226
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,070
So, this is how it's going to be?

227
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,340
You give me no choice.

228
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,180
I'll just have to go to your house.

229
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,150
My gosh.

230
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,690
(Haengbok-ro 7, Sujeong-gu, Seoul.
This is your home address, right?)

231
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,690
What?

232
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,860
You're coming to my house?

233
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
No.

234
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,240
So, I looked into it,

235
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,940
and they said I could pay
for the surgery over several payments.

236
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,440
Would that be possible?

237
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,510
(Administration)

238
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,980
Do you mean paying for surgery
in installments?

239
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,580
Yes, that's right.

240
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,220
At this hospital, it must be paid in full
at the time of discharge.

242
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,350
It won't be for long.

243
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,450
I just need a few months.

244
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
Couldn't you make an exception?

245
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,060
It's the hospital's rules.

246
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,490
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,000
Then, once the surgery is over,

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,470
how many days will he have to stay here?

249
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,370
- Hey, Jin Tae.
- Gyu Tae.

250
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,580
Did you look into it?

251
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,080
No, I'm sorry.

252
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,550
Everyone must be having
a hard time these days.

253
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,950
There's nowhere to borrow money from.

254
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Is that so?

255
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,260
Hey, Mu Chul.

256
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,830
Come to my house this instant.

257
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,360
Oh, okay. I'll be right there.

258
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,370
Once you're in front of my house,
you'll see a young woman.

259
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,230
Grab her and send her away.

260
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,600
Her name is Jang Mi.

261
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,840
Jang Mi? Who's that?

262
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,540
You don't have to know that.

263
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,750
You can never let her come into my house.

264
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,680
Got it? Bye.

265
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,580
Hello? Mu Chul! Hey...

266
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,320
Was that Mr. Han?

267
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,660
Yes, he asked me to come to his house.

268
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,230
I mentioned Min Yong's hospital fees.

269
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,460
Did you? Then he must be willing
to lend you money.

270
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,000
All right. I'll be back soon...

271
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,740
Oh, hello? This is Number One Real Estate.

272
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,340
Oh, yes.

273
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,910
Someone's interested in the low-rise unit?

274
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,350
I'm sorry, but the homeowner...

275
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,880
just called and said
he decided not to sell it after all.

276
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,650
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,690
Does someone want to buy our place?

278
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,390
Yes, but rather than selling our place,

279
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,260
borrowing money from Mu Chul
would be a hundred times better.

280
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,360
- I'll be back. Okay.
- Okay, see you later, Gyu Tae.

281
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,770
Excuse me! One moment!

282
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
So,

283
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,640
are you perhaps Ms. Jang Mi?

284
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,010
Yes, but who are you?

285
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,220
Oh, hello.

286
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,790
I'm Mr. Han Mu Chul's friend.

287
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,690
- So?
- Oh, Mu Chul isn't home today.

288
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,060
I think you should just go home for now.

289
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,960
I don't care if he's home or not.

290
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,800
I didn't come to meet with him.

291
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,570
I came to meet his family.

292
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,300
No, wait. Why would you meet his family?

293
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,400
What are you doing?

294
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,740
If that's the reason,
I really can't let you through.

295
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,610
And who are you to stop me?

296
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,380
Mu Chul asked me to stop you
from coming to his house.

297
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,280
What did you say?

298
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,380
So, you're telling me...

299
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,020
that Mu Chul asked you
to stop me from coming?

300
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,760
Yes, so could you please...

301
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,260
Excuse me. One moment.
I don't know what this is about,

302
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,530
but can't you tell me about it?

303
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,630
Darn it!

304
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Do you see this?

305
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,440
What happened to your hair?

306
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,010
Han Mu Chul's wife did this to me.

307
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,980
What on earth did I do wrong?

308
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,080
While seeing Mr. Han,

309
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,710
I had to spend so much
on cab fare, coffee, and ramyeon!

310
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,850
I was the one who was ripped off!

311
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,550
That money
and the cost for hair loss treatment.

312
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,650
Before I get that, I will never leave!

313
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,590
Please, hold yourself back.
This puts me in a tough spot.

314
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,830
- Get out of the way!
- Please...

315
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,390
- No!
- Darn you.

316
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,960
- Then why don't you see how it feels too?
- What?

317
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,270
Who do you think you are?

318
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,670
How dare you stop me?

319
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,740
(Jackpot Chicken)

320
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,310
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

321
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,880
When will you go?

322
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,910
Once the customers leave.

323
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,320
You won't run into Mr. Han again,
will you?

324
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,020
Even if you do, you have to go this time.

325
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,590
I'm so anxious that we might lose it.

326
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,830
Don't worry. I'll be sure
to exchange it this time.

327
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,600
Thirty-five million. Let's go.

328
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Let's go.

329
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,530
- Can we get a soda, please?
- Of course.

330
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,330
No, I'll get it.

331
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,870
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

332
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Hey, Mu Chul.

333
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,350
What happened? Did she leave?

334
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,450
She made such a fuss,

335
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,950
so the police took her away.

336
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,850
Gosh, okay. Got it.

337
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,890
Hey, so...

338
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,760
Can I come to your house now?

339
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,260
What? My house? Why?

340
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,160
Well, you know...

341
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,730
The thing I asked you about
the other day...

342
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,300
- This fool.
- Hello? Mu Chul!

343
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,340
This punk. He won't even thank me.

344
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,310
Right.

345
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,880
He has a conscience too.

346
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,850
He has to lend me the money...

347
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,750
after everything I did.

348
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,250
Besides, it's like chump change for him.

349
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,850
Yes, I should just wait for now.

350
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,130
What? Divorce?

351
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,570
So, she said she would divorce you
if you couldn't find a job?

352
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,370
- That's right.
- Does she think...

353
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,570
her husband is a joke?

354
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,840
She must think you're a complete joke
to say something like that.

355
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,270
Gosh, I must do something about this.

356
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,180
Mom, please sit down.

357
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,880
Sit down and hear me out. Please?

358
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,920
Let's be honest. I have nothing to say
even if she says she wants to divorce me.

359
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,480
You also know...

360
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,150
that I haven't brought home
a single paycheck since the pandemic hit.

361
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,920
She's been single-handedly taking care
of the family's living expenses.

362
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,290
Even on those TV shows, they say
a spouse's lack of earning capacity...

363
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,030
can be a valid ground for divorce.

364
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,400
Mom, don't tell her I said any of this.

365
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,770
Please help me.

366
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,040
Help you, how?

367
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,910
I have a job interview after lunch,
so I have to go there.

368
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,740
Can you take Ji Woo to her academy?

369
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,780
I know it's my job to take Ji Woo there,

370
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,310
but Mi Jin might yell at me
if I bring this up. I'm scared.

371
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,420
Goodness gracious. You fool!

372
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,820
We should do our best to make sure
Mi Jin stays in a good mood...

373
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,660
so we can overcome this crisis wisely,
you know?

374
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,160
If you don't want to see
your only son go through a divorce,

375
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,890
you need to help me. Please?

376
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,160
Oh, dear.

377
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,530
I was going to prepare lunch.
Why did you do it, Mother?

378
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,970
You said your arm hurt.

379
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
You should take it easy for a while.

380
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,310
You were under a lot of stress
because of your job.

381
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,810
Yes, that sounds nice.

382
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,680
You haven't even taken a vacation
because you've been so busy working.

383
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,180
Let Mom take care of all the house chores.

384
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,450
You should rest up and recharge.

385
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,120
Yes, do that.

386
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,020
You must be so stressed out now.

387
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,620
I understand everything,

388
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,460
so don't worry about housework.

389
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,790
Just get some rest for a few days.

390
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,800
Seriously? Can I really do that?

391
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,500
Well, yes. But...

392
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,830
What are you saying, Grandma?

393
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,200
Are you saying she can do it or not?

394
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
You're confusing us.

395
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,210
I'll help you, Mother.

396
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,740
I appreciate you saying that, though.

397
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,140
- You want to help me?
- No, you don't need to help her.

398
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,380
Just rest up when she tells you to.

399
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,050
When else will you get a chance to rest?

400
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,050
But how could I?

401
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,290
Mother's arm has been hurting.

402
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,690
Come on. It's fine.

403
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,490
If her arm hurts,
I can give her a massage.

404
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,590
Seeing you doing housework now...

405
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,760
will break my heart.

406
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,600
So, do nothing
and just rest up like a princess...

407
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,670
for the time being. All right?

408
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,670
Goodness.

410
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,470
So, do you mean
someone opened a bank account...

411
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,340
in your name?

412
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,910
Yes! How many times do I have to tell you?

413
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,910
Let me check the security footage...

414
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,980
from the day when the account was created.

415
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,590
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we can't let you
view our security footage.

416
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,220
You will have to come back
with the police.

417
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,290
Police, my foot!

418
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,660
The police told me
to go and find evidence!

419
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,460
In any case, we can't show you
our security footage. I'm sorry.

420
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,670
My gosh. This is nuts.
I can't believe this.

421
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,440
Oh, dear.

422
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,810
As if running off with my money
wasn't enough,

423
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,410
he even stole my identity. This jerk.

424
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,850
- When I catch him...
- Mu Chul.

That woman, Jang Mi,
won't come here anymore, right?

428
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,390
My gosh.
What kind of woman is that strong?

429
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,420
She grabbed me by the hair
and wouldn't let it go.

430
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,030
Your buddy here
nearly lost all of his hair.

431
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,060
Okay.

432
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,660
So what?

433
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,060
Well...

434
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,670
About the money I mentioned last time.

435
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,070
Have you given it some thought?

436
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,940
Money?

437
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,340
Yes. I mean...

438
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,880
You said you'd think about it.

439
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,210
So?

because I can't pay for it.

became successful,

you can mooch off me?

461
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,130
You think I'm a pushover?

462
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,000
What?

463
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,730
Do you think I've worked so hard...

464
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,700
so punks like you
could take advantage of me?

465

how to take advantage of me.

will you stay latched onto me...

She came to the house to see him,

they've met outside in private.

536
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,810
You have a lot on your plate now.

537
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,980
Why would you worry about others?

538
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,720
Seriously, you're still as nosy as ever.

539
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Worry about myself?

540
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,850
What's there to worry?

541
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,790
You have to move.

542
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,820
Housing prices have gone up.

543
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,420
You can't afford to move
with what you have.

544
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,490
I bet you don't know this.

545
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,930
When you were signing
your lease for this place,

546
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,100
I asked my husband
to lower the rent for you...

547
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,870
- because you were struggling.
- What?

548
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,300
I don't know if you can afford
a single room with that money these days.

549
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,800
I'll talk to my husband.

550
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,910
Do you just want to stay here?

551
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,240
You can just close your restaurant,
you know.

552
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,310
Don't worry.

553
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,950
There are so many places
for us to move to right now.

554
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,080
We're trying to choose one.

555
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,220
What? You're trying to choose one?

556
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,690
Wherever we go, it'll be better than this.

557
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,790
I'll be honest. This old house...

558
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,520
I'm sick of living in a place like this.

559
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,420
It's worn down,

560
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,190
and there are security issues too.

561
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,890
Most importantly,

562
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,030
it's tacky.

563
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,730
What? Tacky?

564
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,340
She's one of the poorest people I know.

565
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,610
What's this nonsense she's spewing now?

566
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,680
All right.

567
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,510
I hope you choose a nice place.

568
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,610
I can't wait to see
how nice your new place is.

569
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,280
Make sure to invite me when you do move.

570
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,450
Sure thing.

571
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,490
Don't be surprised
when you see my new place.

572
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,790
- Oh, my.
- Unbelievable.

573
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,990
Why would I be surprised?

574
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,000
I guess I could be surprised
if your new place is really tiny.

575
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,500
My gosh!

576
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,130
- My money...
- The winner still hasn't come forward,

577
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,800
- My precious money.
- so the accumulated winnings are...

578
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,840
at an all-time high.

579
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,940
It's 35.7 million dollars.

580
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,580
Has the winner of this lucky draw
collected their winnings?

581
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,180
The winner of the 35.7 million dollars
still hasn't shown up.

582
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,650
Who could the lottery winner really be?
It's making us all curious.

583
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,650
The lottery?

584
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,490
The winning for this draw
is at a record high...

585
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,960
since it has been building up...

586
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,590
- Oh, my.
- for the past few weeks.

587
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,730
Oh, right!

588
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,700
I had that lottery ticket!

589
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,970
- Right.
- The winning numbers are in this order.

590
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,600
Let me see. What?

591
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Zero, two.

592
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,470
Two.

593
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,980
- Zero, three.
- Zero, three.

594
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,340
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

595
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,910
Sixteen.

596
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,150
- Sixteen.
- Nineteen and twenty.

597
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,350
- These are my numbers.
- Let me repeat that once more.

598
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,320
- Daewoon Building's date of completion!
- The winning numbers are...

599
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,290
as follows. Zero, two.

600
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,430
- Zero, three. Eleven.
- Hang on. How much is the prize?

601
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,460
Sixteen. Nineteen.

602
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,600
- And twenty.
- Let me count the zeroes. One, two...

603
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,600
If the winnings aren't collected
within the allotted time,

604
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,040
- the winner will lose the money.
- Thirty-five...

605
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,070
- million dollars!
- If you bought a lottery ticket...

606
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,840
- but haven't checked it yet,
- Nice! Yes!

607
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,150
- I suggest you check it now.
- Oh, my!

608
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,950
- You could be...
- Hang on. Where is this lottery ticket?

609
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,880
- the lucky winner yourself.
- Where is it? Where did I put it?

610
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,520
- For more details,
- Where is it? Is it here?

611
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,020
- please refer to our website.
- Hang on. Oh, right!

612
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,360
- Next up, it's the weather forecast.
- My wallet.

613
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
- All day tomorrow,
- Where is it?

614
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,760
- it'll be clear and warm.
- What?

615
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,730
- The high will be 24°C,
- I'm sure it was here.

616
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,030
- which is higher than the temperature...
- Right.

617
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,800
at the same time last year.

618
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,870
- Dae Sik! Darn it.
- As you enjoy outdoor activities...

619
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,710
I'm sorry. We're closed...

620
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,880
Hey, what brings you here?

621
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,990
Where is my lottery ticket?

622
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,620
The night you drove my car,

623
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,030
I gave you a lottery ticket.

624
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,630
You remember, don't you?

625
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,530
What are you talking about,
out of the blue?

626
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,730
A lottery ticket?

627
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,770
You.

628
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,240
You have my lottery ticket, don't you?

629
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,600
You do, don't you?

630
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,580
What?

631
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,150
What?

632
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,520
(Good Luck!)

633
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,520
I don't want you to date Tae Hyung.

634
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,960
We might have to split the winnings.

635
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,660
What are you talking about right now?

636
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,700
- Get out here!
- Han Mu Chul!

637
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,170
I'll put the buildings
under your name too.

638
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,200
Tell me, man.
That way, I'll be able to help you.

639
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
Hey, I won the...

640
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,610
You must've made a lot of money.

641
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
