00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,580
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
Oh, dear.

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,660
Right, if I just died,

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,000
my family...

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,900
would be able to get some insurance money.

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,870
Are you insane? You fool!

7
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,270
Are you asking to get killed?

8
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,760
You have gone insane, Kim Dae Sik.

9
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,490
You've lost your mind.

10
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,240
Why is it that the sky...

11
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,170
looks so beautiful today?

12
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,950
So, about that friend of yours.

13
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,450
Is he moving out?

14
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,650
Did you say his name was Kim Dae Sik?

15
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,090
I don't even know.

16
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,290
He grabs me by the collar
whenever he gets ticked off.

17
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,560
Whether he moves out or not, I don't care.

18
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,230
Now, I have...

19
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,000
a great friend like you,
who I can always count on.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,300
I have no time or energy to worry
about what that fool is going to do.

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,140
Right, agreed.

22
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,740
We're best friends now, you know.

23
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,740
- Right?
- Yes.

24
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,280
I'll be honest. It's totally fine with me
even if you decide...

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,550
not to invest in this.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,350
I just want you
to become even more successful.

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,950
That's why I suggested you invest in this.

28
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,960
I see.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
What?

30
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,360
Hey, I haven't finished going through it.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,400
This thing isn't even important.

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,430
Our friendship is what matters.

33
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,900
I came here to see you, brother.

34
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,500
I didn't come here to talk about this.

35
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,570
Well, but...

36
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,610
- Bring in the girls.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,080
- Let's drink.
- Okay, all right.

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Give me.

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Oh, that's good.

40
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,460
Yes, here. Cheers!

41
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
Cheers!

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,610
Jang Mi, go and sit next to Mr. Han.

43
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,110
Okay.

44
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,610
Hi, honey.

45
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,610
I'm Jang Mi.

46
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,180
What's your name?

47
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Hey, I prefer melon
because it's more expensive.

48
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,530
Oh, my. Thanks for the drinks today.

49
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,000
My pleasure.

50
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,170
You see, to achieve big things in life...

51
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,070
Mr. Han, have a safe trip home.

52
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,710
- All right.
- What?

53
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,780
Mr. Jang has lost his touch.

54
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,710
Why does he hang out with a penniless guy?

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,850
Penniless? Who?

56
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,950
Mr. Han Mu Chul?

57
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,820
I have never seen the likes of him.

58
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,590
When I tried to have some food,
he put it straight into his mouth.

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,160
I asked him to order a bottle of booze,
but he pretended not to hear me.

60
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,730
He's obviously penniless
with nothing to his name.

61
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,130
Why does Mr. Jang hang around that man?

62
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,400
Girl, you are
such a bad judge of character.

63
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,340
That man is...

64
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,140
so rich that you can't even count
how many buildings he owns in Seoul.

65
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,010
Why else
would that picky Mr. Jang treat him...

66
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,210
with such respect?

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,080
I put you in that room for your sake.

68
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,580
How could you ruin things like this?

69
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,080
What? Is he that rich?

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,080
You see, last time...

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,690
- I told you.
- Darling, I will see you out!

72
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,560
Oh, my.
Money sure makes a huge difference.

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,130
I bought it
on a 36-month installment plan,

74
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,460
so he won't notice.

75
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,540
Goodness, look how smooth my skin is.

76
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,470
You're home.

77
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,410
Where were you at this hour?

78
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,710
None of your business.

79
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,380
Honey.

80
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,360
Don't you notice anything different
about me?

81
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,630
Why are you staring so intently?

82
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,860
You're making me blush.

83
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,570
Don't you see anything different?

84
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
You have lettuce in your teeth.

85
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,610
I like that attitude.

86
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,310
Save it and eat it later.

87
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,310
My goodness. Are you teasing me?

88
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,290
You don't know anything about romance.

89
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,230
Darling, did you get home safely?

90
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,900
"Darling?"

91
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I had fun today.

92
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,570
I know this may seem too forward,

93
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,270
but I already miss you, darling.

94
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,440
- Then, let's meet again. Good night.
- What in the world...

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,410
Jang Mi, the rose that blooms at night.

96
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,150
Gosh, Jang Mi... What is going on?

97
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,990
Oh, gosh.

98
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,160
Hey, Dae Sik.
What brings you here at this hour?

99
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Are you heading home?

100
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,070
If not, let's grab a drink.

101
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,170
A hundred thousand dollars?

102
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,040
That jerk, Mu Chul,
has literally gone insane.

103
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,270
I mean, how could he ask
for a 100,000-dollar increase at once?

104
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,610
Then, will he increase
our security deposits too?

105
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,150
We're in the same building.

106
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,980
There's no way he'll only increase it
for one unit.

107
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,690
Gyu Tae,
didn't he mention anything to you?

108
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,060
No, he didn't.

109
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,920
Gosh, that's weird.

110
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,160
Anyway, why has that guy changed so much?

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,500
I know all about how close
you guys used to be.

112
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,530
Honestly, back in school,

113
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,470
Mu Chul had the least to offer.

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,840
They say you never know
what might happen in life,

115
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
but how could he do this to you guys
because he made a bit of money?

116
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,310
Hey, Geum Ok.

117
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,310
Don't you ever...

118
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,350
mention meeting with us today
in front of Mu Chul. Got it?

119
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,050
What? Gyu Tae.

120
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,720
Do you think I'm a fool?

121
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,990
I don't talk to Mu Chul these days either.

122
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,290
He's not the friendly Han Mu Chul
from way back when.

123
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,360
He's our landlord.

124
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,860
He's a difficult person for me too.

125
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,630
By the way,
what do we do about poor Dae Sik?

126
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,170
Dae Sik, this squid is on the house.

127
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,670
Eat this and cheer up, okay?

128
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,980
Hey! You can stop eating, Gyu Tae.

129
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,410
Forget it.
I won't eat it even if you beg me.

130
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,390
That jerk, Mu Chul.

131
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,990
He thinks of his friends as pushovers.

132
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,260
Do you know what I did today?

133
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,930
I washed that jerk's car for him.

134
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,760
And with my own two hands too.

135
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
What?

136
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,770
Man, I told you
not to do that kind of stuff.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,170
If you do it once,

138
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,240
he keeps making a habit of it.

139
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,670
Then,

140
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,240
he even pays you less
than the set commission, doesn't he?

141
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,010
But what can I do?

142
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,410
I have to make a living somehow
in this bad economy.

143
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,050
Don't you remember?

144
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,050
When Mu Chul first transferred
to our school,

145
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,420
he was being bullied.

146
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,320
You and I saved him.

147
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,790
The trio and all that.

148
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,230
He was all about friendship back then.

149
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,860
That mean jerk.

150
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,230
What use is it to talk about the past?

151
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,800
We're still the underdogs,

152
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,240
and he's the boss.

153
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,270
That's true.

154
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,370
He is the boss.

155
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,310
And the big boss, at that.

156
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,280
Dae Sik.

157
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,280
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,080
I wish I could help,

159
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,350
but things are bad for me these days.

160
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,990
And my son, Min Yong,
is still in high school.

161
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,230
His academy fees and whatnot...

162
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,760
cost me an arm and a leg.

163
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,260
Forget it, man.

164
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,230
It's not like I don't know
about your situation.

165
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,970
Here, let's just drink.

166
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,340
Well...

167
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,170
Why don't you...

168
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,780
try asking Mu Chul once?

169
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,950
Hey, do you think I have no pride...

170
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,820
to grovel at his feet?

171
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm doing it to feed my family.

172
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,860
I mean,

173
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,930
what if you can't pay
the increased deposit...

174
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,130
and he asks you
to close up your restaurant?

175
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,330
If he does,

176
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
then I should.

177
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
What?

178
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,770
If you close up that restaurant,

179
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,170
you wouldn't have enough money
for a house,

180
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,910
let alone another business.

181
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,210
Housing prices
have gone up so much lately.

182
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,250
Also, Daewoon Building...

183
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,480
isn't just any old building to you.

184
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,790
You said the land
where Daewoon Building stands...

185
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,920
was the place...

186
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,420
where you used to live with your father.

187
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,230
That's why you turned down
every other space I showed you...

188
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,260
and made sure
to set up your restaurant here.

189
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,070
That's true.

190
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,310
I wanted to start in the place
where I have memories with my father.

191
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,080
That's why I made a point
of opening up the restaurant here.

192
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,910
Even by pleading...

193
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,080
with that punk, Mu Chul.

194
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,920
Goodness, but what can I do?

195
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,590
If you can't take the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

196
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,590
What else is there?

197
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,370
- Hey, I'll pour you a drink.
- No, it's fine.

198
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,540
(Jang Mi, the rose that blooms at night)

199
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,780
Is it perhaps spam?

200
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,020
Right, I can just check.

201
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,850
Let's see.

202
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Hello?

203
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,370
Hello?

204
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,340
Is this perhaps Jang Mi's phone?

205
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,380
What?

206
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,610
Jang Mi.

207
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,280
Rose. Don't you know her?

208
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,350
Gosh, what are you talking about?

209
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,920
Hello?

210
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,690
What's this? Did she hang up?

211
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
What?

212
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,690
I'm certain the text was from Jang Mi.

213
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,100
Oh, my dear Lady Lee.

214
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,400
What are you doing here?

215
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,110
You look extra beautiful
and radiant today.

216
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,210
My, I'm dazzled by your beauty.

217
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,640
People might take you
for a woman in her 20s.

218
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,780
Mom, how about I give you
a good old massage?

219
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,650
Your shoulders are so stiff.

220
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,020
Do you have frozen shoulders?

221
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,280
Let go. You're such a bother.

222
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,790
Come on, Mom.

223
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,720
Your son wants to give you a massage
since it's been a while,

224
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,820
but you think I'm a bother?

225
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,460
Mom.

226
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,360
Should I meet that girl again?

227
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,060
The one you set me up with.

228
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,030
That lady's daughter.

229
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,070
- Really?
- Yes.

230
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,640
Forget it.
You already left a bad first impression.

231
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,210
What good would it do to meet her now?

232
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
Mom, don't you know me?

233
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,180
If I dress up, I look pretty handsome.

234
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,750
You never know.
She might fall for my handsome face...

235
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,080
and say that she likes me.

236
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,680
So, why couldn't you be good
in the first place?

237
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,220
That girl is an only child,
so once she gets married,

238
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,050
all of her inheritance will be
in joint ownership...

239
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,260
with her future husband.

240
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,860
Instead of being nagged by your dad here,

241
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,660
you should just marry a rich girl...

242
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,230
and live large. How nice would that be?

243
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,030
Gosh, okay.

244
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,830
I'll meet up with her again.

245
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,870
- For real?
- Yes.

246
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,700
- Let me call...
- But...

247
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,300
I have a condition.

248
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,370
A condition?

249
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,240
Lend me some money.

250
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,040
But what?
Why do you need money, all of a sudden?

251
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,680
Did you get into some sort of trouble?

252
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,120
No, I'm not in any trouble.

253
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,550
I'm trying to start a business,

254
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,420
but I need just a little more money.

255
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,760
I'll be sure to pay you back
the principal plus interest.

256
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,760
Please lend me some.

257
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,860
I don't have any money.

258
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,060
You know I barely have enough
to run this household.

259
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,130
Gosh, whatever. I don't have money.

260
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,300
Come on, Mom.

261
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,470
Not our living expenses.
You have some money squirreled away.

262
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,510
A few dozen thousand.
No, just a few thousand dollars. Please?

263
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,210
Hey, I really have no money.

264
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,140
Whatever. Go to your room
if you're going to go on about this.

265
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,410
- What? Come on.
- Go to your room.

266
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,680
- Wait, Mom. Don't be like this.
- Goodness me.

267
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
- Hear me out. Wait!
- That's enough!

268
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,960
See you later, Mom!

269
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,970
Mom.

270
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,600
Oh, yes. I'll see you later.

271
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,070
- All right.
- Be careful.

272
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,110
Gosh, what should I do?

273
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,650
Oh, right. Where did I put it?

274
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,630
Darn it. How am I going to get the money?

275
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,570
Shoot.

276
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,770
Hey! Did you just trip me?

277
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,100
Oh, no. What's your foot doing here?

278
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,210
I was so focused on tying my shoelaces
that I didn't see your foot.

279
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,410
This is why you need to watch
where you're going.

280
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,850
Why, you little...

281
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,950
It hurts!

282
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,490
Oh, my bad. Sorry about that.

283
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620
Hey!

284
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
Darn it.

285
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,310
Hey, what brings you here?

286
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,650
Come on. Am I not allowed to visit you?

287
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,110
It's not that.

288
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,750
Anyway, why are you here?

289
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,690
Oh, this is bitter lettuce kimchi.

290
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,590
You always liked
my mom's bitter lettuce kimchi.

291
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,720
I made a fresh batch today...

292
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,460
and thought of you, so I brought you some.

293
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,930
I also brought you some pickled onions.

294
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,170
Oh, I see. Thanks for these.

295
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,670
Do you want a cup of tea?

296
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,510
Well, I'm good.

297
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,840
But I wanted to talk to you
about something.

298
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,140
You have a minute now, right?

299
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,720
What is she up to?

300
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,550
This is so unlike her.

301
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,320
So? Will you really take a gap year?

302
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,960
Because your dad told you to quit school?

303
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,830
I don't want to go to school anyway,
so it works out.

304
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,300
I want to try getting an audition
for modeling.

305
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,470
Yes, you really should get into modeling.

306
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,670
Oh, did you hear?

307
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,070
Tae Hyung is coming back to Korea.

308
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,640
What? Tae Hyung?

309
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,980
When? Does he have a girlfriend?

310
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,850
Why do you want to know that?

311
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,850
Are you interested in Tae Hyung?

312
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,050
What? Well...

313
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,650
He's hot.

314
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,690
He's stylish and has a lot of money.

315
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,490
I haven't told you girls,

316
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,290
but Tae Hyung and I...

317
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,530
have been exchanging private messages
on social media.

318
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,600
He told me...

319
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,570
he kept thinking of me even in France
for some reason.

320
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,470
Then why didn't you know
that he was coming back to Korea?

321
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,540
You said you'd been talking
on social media.

322
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,810
Well, that's...

323
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,540
As you know, I'm very busy.

324
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,710
Right, your boyfriends
must be keeping you busy.

325
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,350
Does Tae Hyung know...

326
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,420
that you have a different boyfriend
for each day of the week?

327
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,890
Oh, there he is.

328
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,250
Your Mr. Thursday.

329
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,720
My gosh.

330
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,360
Why is he here again?

331
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,030
Anyway, I should get going.

332
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,660
Tae Hyung might need me
to come and pick him up from the airport.

333
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,830
See you.

334
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,740
Hi, Tae Hyung. It's me, Seo Woo.

335
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,940
You remember me, right?

336
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,470
I was so happy when you wrote me back
in the past.

337
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,380
I heard you were coming back.

338
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,740
Is it true?

339
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,760
So, there's no way you can get
100,000 dollars for the security deposit.

340
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,990
Right. There's something else too,

341
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,830
but can you please try
to talk to him about that, at least?

342
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,430
He may not listen to others,

343
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,600
but he must listen to you.

344
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,900
Of course, he does.

345
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,570
My husband will even wake up...

346
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,770
in the middle of the night
to listen to me.

347
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,670
I knew it.

348
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,540
Your husband is all about money,

349
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,580
but he'd never cheat on you.

350
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,480
That's how
most single-minded men are like.

351
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,780
Should I say they're purehearted
and love only one woman...

352
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,120
for their entire life?

353
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,190
That's right.
He fell for me at first sight...

354
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,920
and has never once had eyes
for another woman.

355
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,160
Sometimes, he's such a nuisance to me...

356
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,160
that I think it might be nice
if he were having an affair.

357
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,070
My gosh. What a lucky woman you are.

358
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,170
Your husband makes good money...

359
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,300
and is faithful.

360
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,840
You're incredibly lucky.

361
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,370
Of course, you deserve nothing less,
Princess Lee Mi Ja.

362
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,680
Anyway, I'll try to talk
to my husband about it.

363
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,110
Thanks, Mi Ja.

364
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,350
What would I have done without you?

365
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,720
This is why they say
nothing beats a good friend.

366
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,860
Let's maintain our friendship
for many more years to come.

367
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,160
Friendship, my foot.

368
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,730
Is friendship like a first aid kit to you?

369
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,100
You only come to me when you need me.

370
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,730
Anyway, what did you use to season this?

371
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,470
What did I use?

372
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,270
Well, some salted shrimp
and just the usual stuff. Why?

373
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,340
I want to make cubed radish kimchi,
but I don't feel confident.

374
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,450
Do you have any of the seasoning left?

375
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,850
Yes, I have some left.

376
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,590
Hey, why don't I just make it for you
since I'm here anyway?

377
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,190
My gosh, really?

378
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,760
Then I'd be so grateful!

379
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,990
Oh, please. It's nothing hard.

380
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,460
The radish is here.

381
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,160
Here's some garlic.

382
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Mom.

383
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,500
My gosh, Seo Woo.

384
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,830
Hello.

385
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,240
You've gotten so much prettier.

386
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,800
Although, you were pretty
when you were little too.

387
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,810
How's school going...

388
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,340
Gosh, how rude.

389
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,510
She's just like her mother.

390
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,810
- Here's an apron you can use.
- Okay.

391
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,910
Thanks!

392
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,550
Gosh, why would she talk to me?
What a nuisance.

393
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,320
(Arriving at 2 p.m.!)

394
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,820
Today?

395
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,830
Wait, at 2 p.m.?

396
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,460
I don't have much time left.

397
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,270
(New Message)

398
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,900
I'm in front of your house.
I'll wait here.

399
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
What?

400
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,140
Today is Thursday. Why is he here again?

401
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,410
(Terminal 2)

402
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,250
Hey, I'm sorry.

403
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,590
I didn't know my friend
would come back so unexpectedly.

404
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,560
You came all the way to my place.
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,730
Don't worry about me.
Hurry up and go on in.

406
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,030
Okay, drive safe!

407
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,270
Mr. Friday.

408
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,840
I won't be seeing you for much longer.

409
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,140
(Arrivals)

410
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Hello?

411
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,850
Hey, Ye Won. I just arrived.

412
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,160
Have you told your family?

413
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Well...

414
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,860
No, I want to surprise them.

415
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,330
They don't know about the investment yet.

416
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,060
Your parents will be very happy
to see you.

417
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,030
Anyway, kudos to you
for pulling it off, Seok Jin.

418
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
I mean, the CEO of Farm to Market.

419
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,100
Thanks. Talk soon.

420
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
All right.

421
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,110
How long has it been?

422
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm sure he's still hot.

423
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,850
I'm nervous.

424
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,250
Wait, what is this here?

425
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,820
Shoot. My makeup looks flaky.

426
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Oh, no!

427
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Right.

428
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,670
What is this?

429
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,440
How could you spill that on me?

430
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,340
I went through hoops
to pick out this outfit.

431
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,580
Wait, it wasn't my fault.

432
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,780
Do you know who I'm meeting here?

433
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,310
Do you know how important it is
that I look good today?

434
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,650
Gosh, what am I going to do?

435
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,720
I don't want to know who you're meeting.

436
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Will you hear me out...

437
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,250
Oh, hey!

438
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,630
Tae Hyung!

439
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,870
Seo Woo?

440
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,840
Hey. You're Seo Woo, right?

441
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,400
Yes. It's me, Seo Woo.

442
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,610
Do you remember me?

443
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,870
Of course, I remember you.

444
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,840
What brings you here?

445
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Well...

446
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,610
I just dropped my friend off
at the airport...

447
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,850
and realized you'd be arriving shortly.

448
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,650
So I came here just in case...

449
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,690
and saw you coming out.

450
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,250
Really?

451
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,820
Hey, it's good to see you.

452
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,860
You haven't changed at all.

453
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
You haven't either.

454
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,300
You still look dashing.

455
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,830
One moment.

456
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,970
Sure.

457
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,570
Hey, Seok Jin.

458
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,170
Hey, Tae Hyung. I'm in Korea now.

459
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,170
Really?

460
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,940
Call me when you have some free time.

461
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,010
Let's grab a bite together.

462
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
All right.

463
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,810
Who was that?

464
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,720
My best friend.

465
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,550
Oh, do you want to grab a bite with me?

466
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,750
I slept through the flight, so I'm hungry.

467
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,620
Yes, sounds good.

468
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,230
I'm exhausted.

469
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,540
Where did you go?

470
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,440
Oh, I went home.

471
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,010
Is this for a delivery?

472
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
Wait.

473
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,010
What's wrong with your hand?

474
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,710
Oh, it's nothing.

475
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,750
Did you make kimchi?

476
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,820
I made some fresh kimchi.

477
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,690
Didn't you wear gloves?

478
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,960
How come your hands ended up
in this state?

479
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,330
I know. Mi Ja said
she was totally out of gloves, so...

480
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,530
Mi Ja?

481
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,500
Do you mean your friend?

482
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,130
I thought you went home.

483
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,040
Well, not our home. I went to Mi Ja's.

484
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,600
She asked me to come over,
so I had a cup of tea with her.

485
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,110
But why would you make fresh kimchi
when you went there for tea?

486
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,740
Tell me the truth.

487
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,210
Well, the thing is...

488
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,280
Actually, I went there to ask for a favor.

489
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,450
About not raising the security deposit.

490
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,190
What?

491
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,860
Who told you to ask that kind of favor?

492
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,820
My gosh!

493
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,830
Then what else could I do?

494
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,160
It's not like 100,000 dollars will drop
out of the sky.

495
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,760
Our family is about to get thrown out
onto the streets.

496
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,830
How could I just sit back and watch?

497
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,470
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

498
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,670
That mean wench.

499
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,180
I saw her working my mom to the bone
when I was little,

500
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,410
so I swore I would never let her
walk all over me too.

501
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,820
At first, she said
she just had some radishes,

502
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,250
but then she brought out
young radish greens and perilla leaves.

503
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,050
Do you know how much kimchi I made today?

504
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,690
I was working in an apron
in front of that brat.

505
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,000
It reminded me so much of my mom.

506
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,570
I thought,
"My mom must've suffered like this too."

507
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,140
And I felt so bad for my mom...

508
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,910
that this is all I've achieved in life.

509
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,550
Mr. Han!

510
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,650
- Bye.
- Mr. Han.

511
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,650
What?

512
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,720
Come and eat here often.

513
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,720
And you should eat this with your family.

514
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,160
Gosh, you don't have to give me that.

515
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,260
- How much is it?
- No, just take it.

516
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
- For free?
- Yes.

517
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,730
- Oh, it's free.
- Yes.

518
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,930
- You packed some pickled radishes, right?
- Yes.

519
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,360
- All right. I'll enjoy it.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,700
- Thank you.
- The chicken was cooked to perfection.

521
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,000
- Get home safe.
- Okay.

522
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,770
- Excuse me, Mr. Han.
- Yes?

523
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,570
The honey rice cakes
turned out so great today.

524
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,570
- Oh, my.
- You should have some.

525
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,610
- Your rice cakes are the best.
- Thank you, sir.

526
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,010
- I'll enjoy them.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,710
Goodness.

528
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,950
What?

529
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,380
Oh, this?

530
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,820
The restaurant owner made such a fuss
about giving me free food.

531
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,490
He has a great mindset
since he's a young business owner, indeed.

532
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,100
Your restaurant
never even gives out a free soda.

533
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,730
By the way,

534
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,340
did you think about it?

535
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,800
The security deposit.

536
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,810
Can you pay me the increased amount?

537
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,540
I can't pay you that.

538
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,180
I'm barely managing to pay
the monthly rent of 2,500 dollars.

539
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,210
How could I come up with 100,000 dollars?

540
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
I can't do it.

541
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,820
Oh, boy. Is that right?

542
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,020
That's too bad, then.

543
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,890
I'll talk to Gyu Tae...

544
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,060
and put the restaurant up for lease.

545
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,860
Is that all?

546
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,100
- What?
- Your friend says he doesn't have money,

547
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,340
and you don't even bother to ask
how he is...

548
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,370
or how his restaurant is going.

549
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,610
And what?

550
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,910
Put the restaurant up for lease?

551
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,950
Hey, don't you dare grab me
by the collar again, punk.

552
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,280
And what will you do
by glaring at me like that?

553
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Hey.

554
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,990
Han Mu Chul.

555
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
What?

556
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,530
You called my name. Spit it out already.

557
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,630
Save me.

558
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
If you kick us out, we have nowhere to go.

559
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,010
I'm about to go bankrupt right now.

560
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,580
Please help me out.

561
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
What?

562
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,110
(Good Luck!)

563
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,940
- The thing about friends is...
- Gosh, punk.

564
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,580
- that they need to be on similar levels.
- What is this?

565
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,410
Han Mu Chul!

566
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,450
A hundred thousand dollars?

567
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,780
We could at least bring it up
to Ji Woo's dad.

568
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,380
Don't you know about the new job?

569
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,090
- No.
- What's wrong?

570
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,550
Do you have any money?

571
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,990
If you lend me some money
you have lying around,

572
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,020
I'll double... No, I'll triple it for you.

573
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,160
You should invest in me.

574
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,660
