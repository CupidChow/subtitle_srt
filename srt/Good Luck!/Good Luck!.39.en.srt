00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,740
(Episode 39)

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,610
What did you just say?

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,080
What did you say?

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,880
You...

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,550
Why did you show up again...

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,820
in front of me?

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,190
What?

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,130
This is the Lee Mi Ja?

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,140
Oh, boy.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
My gosh.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,570
Wait, be careful.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,250
So, you are...

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,090
Lee Mi Ja?

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,760
The Lee Mi Ja I used to know?

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,400
I don't believe it.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,940
The Lee Mi Ja I used to know...

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,440
has aged this much?

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,410
My goodness.

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,050
What?

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,790
Hello.

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,990
By the way, who is she?

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,960
Oh, this is...

23
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm a friend of his.

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,270
Seok Jin and I have been best friends
since elementary school.

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,370
And who are you?

26
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,370
Sorry? I'm...

27
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,770
Oh, She's a friend who lives next door.

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,980
She's also my parents' friends' daughter.

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,480
Oh, really?

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,510
It's nice to meet you.

31
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,720
Seo Woo, why are you out here?

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,990
I thought you came home earlier.

33
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,990
I guess you went out again.

34
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,190
Earlier, I stopped by
to pick up some paperwork.

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,900
So, what are we?

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,530
What?

37
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,530
Do you remember that we kissed?

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,600
Yes, I remember.

39
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,270
Then how could you just introduce me
as your neighbor?

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,470
Your parents' friends' daughter?

41
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,580
Is that really all I am to you?

42
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,280
Then how else
should I have introduced you?

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
What?

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,650
Then what would you say
when introducing me?

45
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,920
I'll say you're the man I like.

46
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,460
I like you,

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,220
so that's what I'm going to say.

48
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,060
What about you? Do you not like me?

49
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,130
Why are you laughing?

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,100
Is this funny to you?

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,670
Were you just toying with me?

52
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,070
Did you kiss me to prank me?

53
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,880
Then undo the kiss!

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,810
That was my first kiss.

55
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,750
It was not a prank.

56
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,450
I...

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
like you too.

58
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,930
Really?

59
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,790
Do you really mean that?

60
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,830
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

61
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,670
I got the wrong idea.

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,410
Since when? When did you start liking me?

63
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,540
Well, is that important?

64
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,250
No. It's not important at all.

65
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,480
As you know,
I'm in a stressful situation now,

66
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,420
so I haven't been able to give you
the attention you deserve.

67
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,790
It's fine. Now, I know how you feel.

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,290
Bend down for a moment.

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,530
You're mine.

70
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,330
So, you can't go anywhere, okay?

71
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,740
Hurry up and give me your answer.

72
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,140
Okay, I won't go anywhere.

73
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,720
What?

74
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,820
Seok Jin moved out
of that office space? Why?

75
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,390
That I don't know.

76
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,830
The building manager said
the landlord told him to move out.

77
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,600
But I swear, he said
Tae Hyung owned that building.

78
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,030
I think my gut is right about this.

79
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,700
Why? What does your gut say?

80
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,240
I told you.

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,140
When Tae Hyung and Seo Woo
were arguing at Geum Ok's cafe,

82
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,010
Seok Jin stepped in.

83
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,410
I bet it had something to do with that.

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,310
Stop worrying for no reason.

85
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,450
We'll ask Seok Jin what's going on
when he gets home.

86
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,550
Anyway, about the money
in the bank account.

87
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,790
Now that Mu Chul is back,

88
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,560
we shouldn't leave the money
in that account.

89
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,190
Then what are we going to do?

90
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,960
I want to split the money
and keep some in your account.

91
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,170
But if it's a large sum,
you have to pay the gift tax...

92
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,770
even when sending money to your spouse.

93
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,070
So, I'm trying to figure out what to do.

94
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,170
Think carefully
and figure out the best solution.

95
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,040
I'm home.

96
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,150
- Hey.
- Hey, Seok Jin. Come and sit here.

97
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,850
What's going on?

98
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,590
I visited your office today,

99
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,630
but your office was gone.

100
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,560
What happened?

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,100
Just tell us what happened.

102
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,700
You didn't have to move your office...

103
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,400
just because
the opening got delayed a bit.

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
The truth is,

105
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,610
Tae Hyung's father decided
to withdraw his investment.

106
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,980
But why?

107
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,450
There was some misunderstanding
between Tae Hyung and me.

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,650
- His father found out and got angry.
- What?

109
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,120
He took back the investment because
you guys fought? That makes no sense.

110
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,590
What was the reason?

111
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,130
What exactly happened
with Tae Hyung that he got so mad?

112
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,270
Was it...

113
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,400
because of Seo Woo?

114
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,610
No. Why would you
suddenly bring up Seo Woo?

115
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,340
Geum Ok told me she saw you step in...

116
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,310
when Tae Hyung and Seo Woo were arguing.

117
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,750
No, that's a misunderstanding.

118
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,550
Have you tried talking
to Tae Hyung's father in person?

119
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,850
If it's a misunderstanding,
you can clear it up.

120
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,060
I talked to him, but it doesn't look like
he will change his mind.

121
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,030
So, I think I'm just going to give up.

122
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,870
Then what will happen now?

123
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,870
You worked so hard to launch the business.

124
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,100
Don't tell me
you're going to give up altogether.

125
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,170
I just need to secure funding,

126
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
but it's not easy.

127
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,440
Anyway, I'll take care of it.

128
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,510
I'm sorry for making you worry.

129
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Honey.

130
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,930
What do we do now?

131
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,040
Are you just going to watch Seok Jin
as he falls apart?

132
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,910
Honey, you have to help him this time.

133
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Just leaving him like this
would make no sense.

134
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,110
Let's just wait and see for now.

135
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,350
Wait and see? What do you mean?

136
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,750
Honey.

137
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,590
This is unacceptable. You can't do this.

138
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,990
It's not just any old thing.
This is about our child.

139
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,630
Out of all the money we have,
five million dollars?

140
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,960
We can live without that much.

141
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Honey.

142
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,300
I can't believe you.

143
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,600
Are you really going to be like this?

144
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,070
Why did you take that money
if this was how you were going to act?

145
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,710
If you were just going to keep
that money stashed away,

146
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,140
why did you take that money...

147
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,040
after making all that fuss
to hide it from Mr. Han?

148
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,280
Am I doing this for my own sake?

149
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,480
This is all for our family.

150
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,150
Don't you know that lottery winners
end up going bankrupt...

151
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,890
because they keep spending
their money bit by bit?

152
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,860
That's not the same as this.

153
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,860
Did I ask for something extravagant?

154
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,160
Is it so hard to help out our child?

155
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,930
I can't let you have your way this time.

156
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,940
You did whatever you wanted
with the house and all that.

157
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
This time,

158
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,070
do as I say.

159
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,180
Hey, but...

160
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
My gosh.

161
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,190
It's not just a few bucks.
This is five million dollars.

162
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,260
Goodness gracious.

163
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Oh, dear.

164
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,270
Mom, I'm home.

165
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,700
Oh, you're here too, Dad.

166
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
What happened to you?

167
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
And what's this suitcase?

168
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,510
Oh, this?

169
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,470
I'm moving back in.

170
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,610
- What?
- What?

171
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,580
But I thought you rented
a studio apartment or something.

172
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,280
I thought about it, and I realized
I was being a bad daughter.

173
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,980
Your daughter came back to Korea,
but you can't even see her often.

174
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,650
I mean, you saw me often in the US, Dad.

175
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,020
You little brat.

176
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,960
What are you trying to pull?

177
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Pardon?

178
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,760
Do you think I don't know that
you never act without a goal in mind?

179
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Tell me.

180
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,670
Tell me what reason you have
for strategically moving back in here.

181
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
What do you need?

182
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,240
You got me.

183
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,610
Hey. What?

184
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,610
Father.

185
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,280
Do you have any intentions to invest?

186
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,080
- Invest?
- Yes.

187
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,390
There's a really smart
and passionate businessman I know.

188
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,760
He's preparing to start
an incredible business.

189
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,030
How about you meet with him
and invest in his business?

190
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,430
So, it's a man?

191
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Is it a man?

192
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,940
Gosh, my stomach.

193
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,880
Hey, you're up.

194
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,190
I made some dried pollack soup.

195
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,260
Try it.

196
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,660
I'm fine. Take it away.

197
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,660
Come on. Don't do that.

198
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,760
Try it.

199
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,910
I'm going to...

200
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,540
find my own place.

201
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,650
I'm going to do everything I can
before I leave,

202
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,820
so tell me anything you need.

203
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,360
Then, enjoy your food.

204
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,810
Hello?

205
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,310
Hello, this is Nara Bank.
Is this Mr. Choi Gyu Tae?

206
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,850
Yes, that's right. Go ahead.

207
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,990
This weekend, we're hosting a banquet...

208
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,690
for our bank's VIP customers.

209
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,760
VIP?

210
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,060
It will be on the 10th floor
of Haengun Hotel at 6 p.m.

211
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,330
Please attend if you have the time, sir.

212
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,300
Yes, I'll see how things go.
I'll get back to you later.

213
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,970
Gosh, you scared me.

214
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,770
When did you get here?

215
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,070
Just now, sir.

216
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,580
If you're busy now, I'll come back...

217
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,240
No.

218
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,350
And how much longer
will you keep using honorifics with me?

219
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,480
Just speak casually now.

220
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,150
Oh, okay.

221
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,720
I was going to, but it just slipped out.

222
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Have a seat first.

223
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,590
Okay.

224
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Why are you here?

225
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,760
You know,

226
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,770
I think I'm going to have to move out.

227
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,600
I heard from Dae Sik.

228
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,970
Do you really have to do that?
You should try to talk things through.

229
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,770
I don't deserve that.

230
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,310
What?

231
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,380
The woman I married...

232
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,810
was the Lee Mi Ja
who used to live in our neighborhood.

233
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,780
Gosh, seriously.

234
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,120
Even as I was looking at her
with my own eyes,

235
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,590
I couldn't believe it.
I never even dreamt of it.

236
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,390
You know what?

237
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,660
Dae Sik's wife...

238
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,630
is Hye Sook.

239
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
What?

240
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,740
Lee Hye Sook, the one who used to live...

241
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,510
in Mi Ja's house?

242
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Yes, that's right.

243
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,580
My gosh. How could that...

244
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,810
Time sure is a scary thing.
I don't recognize anyone.

245
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,780
Goodness. To be honest,

246
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,220
I was so disappointed
after finding out Mi Ja was my wife.

247
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,690
What? Why?

248
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,690
There's that fantasy
that you hold deep in your heart...

249
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,470
about your first love.

250
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,900
But she's too old now.

251
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,610
Hey, 40 years have gone by.

252
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,840
Who wouldn't grow old?

253
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,210
Do you think you haven't aged?

254
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,310
Don't you look in the mirror?

255
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,720
That's why I'm too ashamed to face her.

256
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,490
I can't remember anything...

257
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,220
about how we got married
and the times we spent together.

258
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,460
How could I persuade her
to let me live there?

259
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,700
- I can't do that.
- Why can't you do it?

260
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,400
You'll get in big trouble
if you leave that house.

261
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,170
Just stay right there.

262
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,440
What? What do you mean? Why?

263
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,510
You know,

264
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,610
if those creditors find out
that you came back to life,

265
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,480
you'll have to repay
all of your debt again.

266
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
What?

267
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Really?

268
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,390
That's right. So, just try...

269
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,090
to stay in the house,
and don't do anything if you can.

270
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,260
Did I con people for lots of money?

271
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,700
No, before that, how did I live my life?

272
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,800
Did I become a fraud...

273
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,600
because I couldn't make ends meet?

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,770
Should I tell him the truth?

275
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,470
No, it's all in the past.
What's the point of knowing all that?

276
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,640
Why do you keep asking me questions?

277
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,680
You'll only be upset
if you know the truth.

278
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,150
Anyway, don't go anywhere.

279
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,480
Stay right at home. Got it?

280
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,450
If you really can't live there,
I'll find you a place to move to.

281
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,560
No.

282
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,020
How will I find a house
when I don't have any money?

283
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Forget it.

284
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,760
Hey, do you think
I'll make you pay for your own place?

285
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,730
I can do that much for you.

286
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
You've...

287
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,070
made it.

288
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,070
My gosh.

289
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,280
What?

290
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,610
You're...

291
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,810
a VIP customer at the bank.

292
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,050
I heard earlier.

293
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,850
Do you remember when we said...

294
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,320
that we'd help each other out
if one of us became rich?

295
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,160
Gosh, all three of us
used to be dirt poor.

296
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,430
I'm glad...

297
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
that you've made it.

298
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Oh, okay.

299
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,540
You're helping me out for now
because I have no other choice,

300
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,240
but I'll work hard...

301
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,250
and repay you for this kindness.

302
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,920
Hey, forget it.
You don't have to repay me.

303
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,250
No, my grandma said that you'd go bald...

304
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,650
if you liked freebies too much.
I'll repay you, for sure.

305
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,190
Punk.

306
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,890
I guess he really doesn't remember.

307
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,000
He doesn't even know
how much he used to like freebies.

308
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,600
Hey, you don't go bald
just for liking freebies.

309
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,330
This guy I know...

310
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,440
likes freebies so much that he'd rise
from the dead for something free.

311
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,370
And he has the most hair out of all of us.

312
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,610
Who's that?

313
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,610
You don't have to know.

314
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,040
Anyway,

315
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,250
you have to be careful. Okay?

316
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,250
Okay, I understand.

317
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,890
Thank you, Gyu Tae.

318
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,660
Hey, don't pull on me.

319
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,590
Oh, my.

320
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
My goodness.

321
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,700
Break time ended a while ago.
Why isn't he back yet?

322
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,200
Can you take our order?

323
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Sure.

324
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,410
(Buddumak Mentor)

325
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Shoot.

326
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,130
You see,

327
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,330
I was just going to take a quick nap,

328
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,430
but my alarm didn't go off.

329
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,900
Break time at the restaurant
isn't for napping.

330
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,700
It's for getting ready for the next shift.

331
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,670
It is there for us to rest.

332
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,210
Whether I nap or poop,
I am free to do what I want.

333
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,510
Then you should at least come back
on time.

334
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,680
Can you not think?

335
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,380
Goodness, I heard you.
Sorry. Are we good now?

336
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
What did you say?

337
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
Look.

338
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,120
I get that you're working here
because you have no other option,

339
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,460
but you are an employee here too.

340
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,790
How could you be so irresponsible?

341
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,230
I'm pretty sure my niece,
who's in kindergarten now,

342
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,300
is more mature than you.

343
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,970
What? Hey, look.

344
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,700
I'm sorry for being late,

345
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,800
but you're out of line.

346
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,640
If you don't want to hear these things,
just do better.

347
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,880
My gosh. It's not like
I gave you the job for my own sake.

348
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,610
You're not even grateful.

349
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
But then again,

350
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,080
I'm a fool
for hiring such a pathetic loser.

351
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,050
What? "Pathetic loser?"

352
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,420
Hey, forget it. I'm done.

353
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,960
I quit.

354
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,160
Do you think I can't get a job elsewhere?

355
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,900
Hey, Tae Ha.

356
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,340
You said you were going to work.
Why are you back already?

357
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,910
What is it?

358
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,040
Did something happen?

359
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,610
I quit.

360
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,010
Happy now?

361
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
What?

362
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,920
Wait, let's talk.

363
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,350
Why?

364
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,120
What happened?

365
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,560
No. Before that,

366
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,490
why did you borrow money from loan sharks?

367
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,230
Why?

368
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,800
Are you going to call me
a snobby show-off and a fool again?

369
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,300
- What?
- That's right!

370
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,670
That's me.

371
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,600
I'm incompetent, and I borrowed money...

372
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,640
just to blow it all.
I am such a pathetic fool,

373
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,540
so just leave me alone!

374
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
What?

375
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,320
I was just asking.

376
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,750
Where are you?

377
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,190
I just got home.

378
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,130
I'm on my way to meet with a client.

379
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,460
I see. Can I call you "honey?"

380
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,430
You should just talk casually to me too.

381
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,970
What?

382
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,240
Oh, shall I?

383
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,010
Can I see you if you have some time,

384
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,810
honey?

385
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,380
Sorry, I'm busy right now.
I'll call you back.

386
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,180
All right. Don't forget to call me.

387
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,360
Oh, hello.

388
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Hi.

389
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,330
Hey, Seo Woo.

390
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Yes?

391
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
My gosh.

392
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,300
Why are you two here together?

393
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,170
Is something going on?

394
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,980
Well, enjoy.

395
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,820
I'm going to cut right to the chase.

396
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,650
About Seok Jin's online shopping mall.

397
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,050
Do you know about
the investment being canceled?

398
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,990
Yes.

399
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,560
Then tell me.

400
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,030
What is going on?

401
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,260
What caused something like that to happen?

402
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,700
The thing is...

403
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,970
It's my fault.

404
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,540
What? It's your fault?

405
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
What did you do?

406
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,040
Tae Hyung and I were
kind of seeing each other.

407
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,110
I mean, I thought
we were falling for each other,

408
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,380
but it turned out
that he had been two-timing me...

409
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,720
when he was engaged to someone else.

410
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Okay, so?

411
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,150
What does Seok Jin have to do
with any of that?

412
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,730
I think he told Tae Hyung off
and said he shouldn't treat me like that.

413
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,100
Then Tae Hyung got angry and...

414
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,800
So, are you saying Seok Jin...

415
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,140
lost the investment
because he sided with you?

416
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,610
So? What did you say?

417
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,150
If things turned out like that
because of you,

418
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,150
you should sort things out
in any way you can.

419
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,120
Have you just been watching quietly
from the sidelines?

420
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,350
No, I did say something,

421
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,790
but it was already too late.

422
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,730
I can't believe this.

423
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,530
I'm sorry for causing all of this.

424
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,170
I need to hurry home. I'm off.

425
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,170
Hey, Hye Sook. Wait.

426
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,450
Ji Sook, I beg you. Please help me.

427
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,860
I can't even take out a loan.

428
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,990
No one would lend me money.

429
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,030
The money I'd put aside
for living expenses is now gone.

430
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,730
How am I going to feed my family now?

431
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,700
Help me just once more.

432
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,340
You know you're the only one
I can turn to for help.

433
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,910
When your move got canceled like that,

434
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,140
I wanted to send you some money
to help you out,

435
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,580
but my husband found out
that I'd been helping you,

436
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,350
and it upset him.

437
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm sorry, Mi Ja.

438
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,160
Okay. I'm sorry, Ji Sook. I have to go.

439
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,550
The family has no money at all.

440
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,480
What should I do?

441
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,860
This is all my fault.

442
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,630
If only I hadn't gotten myself into debt.

443
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,070
Hey.

444
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,510
Hey, what are you doing here?

445
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,510
Can't you let me work here again?

446
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,880
No, I can't do that. You need to leave.

447
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,050
Don't be like that.

448
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,720
Please let me work here
even just for a short while.

449
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,990
I really am dead broke now.

450
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,220
Hey, rumor has it that
you were in on it with Mr. Jang.

451
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,960
So, how can I let you work here?

452
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,360
Every single one of my customers
fell for that scam.

453
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,700
Clearly, they won't leave you alone!

454
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:53,100
I'm in the same situation.
Mr. Jang scammed me too.

455
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,440
Why won't you believe me?

456
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,740
I believe you,

457
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,910
which is why I'm talking to you
instead of pulling your hair out.

458
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,380
Whatever. Just leave.

459
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,750
Hurry up and leave. Go. Get out!

460
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,450
Darn it.

461
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,320
This is so annoying.

462
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,030
Mr. Jang, that jerk.
Just wait until I catch you.

463
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,030
Gosh, I can no longer work in this field
because of him.

464
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,130
How am I supposed to earn a living now?

465
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,630
Darn it. I'm in deep trouble.

466
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,540
I have to pay my credit card bill.
I have so many expenses.

467
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,480
My gosh.
Is there anyone I can mooch off of?

468
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,820
That's right. That guy.

469
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,420
What was his name?

470
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,020
Han Mu Chul.

471
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,830
He has a lot of money,

472
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,230
so I'm sure he's still doing fine
even if Mr. Jang scammed him.

473
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Hold on.

474
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,400
What was the name of his building?

475
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,940
(Cornerstone, Daewoon Building)

476
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,940
Yes, that's right. "Daewoon Building."

477
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,120
It's Mu Chul.

478
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,790
Yes.

479
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,090
It's possible he's still mad at me.

480
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,490
If I suddenly show up like this,

481
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,500
it might backfire on me.

482
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,500
Now, I know
he still lives in this neighborhood,

483
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,940
so this is enough for today.

484
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,670
(Wire transfer: 857,893.95 dollars,
Remaining balance: 22,743,184.50 dollars)

485
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,180
How much would I have left
if I gave Seok Jin five million dollars?

486
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,320
Gosh, I really don't want
to touch this money.

487
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,020
What?

488
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
What's wrong?

489
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,930
What?

490
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,060
It's nothing. Anyway, what brings you by?

491
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,470
I...

492
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,740
have a favor to ask.

493
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,570
A favor? What is it?

494
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,110
Let me work here.

495
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,910
What? You want to work here?

496
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,320
Gyu Tae said it was impossible
to cancel the death registration.

497
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,190
No one would hire me because I'm old,

498
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,020
so I can't get a job.

499
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,330
Even if I can get a job,
I'm scared of meeting people.

500
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,030
But if I work here,

501
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,070
I'll at least feel safe.
That's why I'm asking you.

502
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,130
Well, you see...

503
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,340
Dae Sik.

504
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,170
Hey, what are you doing?

505
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,980
If I don't work,
my family will starve to death.

506
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,350
I promise
I'll do my best and work very hard,

507
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,920
so please help me out here.

508
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,490
Please.

509
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,490
(Jackpot Chicken)

510
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Save me.

511
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,900
If you kick us out, we have nowhere to go.

512
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm about to go bankrupt right now.

513
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,070
Please help me out.

514
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,710
What?

515
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,910
(Jackpot Chicken)

516
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,260
I once imagined something like this.

517
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,490
I imagined this guy kneeling before me...

518
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,190
and desperately begging for my help.

519
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,100
And finally,

520
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,270
that day has come.

521
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,690
(Good Luck!)

522
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,060
Your mother found out
that the investment was canceled...

523
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,830
- because of me.
- What?

524
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,200
- My back.
- Boss.

525
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,260
Are you okay, Jin Tae?

526
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,760
You two, make up.

527
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,940
That fellow, Seok Jin,
seems to have some grand ideas.

528
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,570
Can't you please let me stay here
for the time being?

529
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,180
