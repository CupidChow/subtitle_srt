00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,770
We're a trio.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,880
The Cheonha High Trio.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,340
Have you forgotten?

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,710
Hey, man.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,520
Have mercy, Dae Sik.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,020
I was wrong.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,660
Just this once.

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,890
Just forgive me this once.
I'm begging you.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,160
Please, Dae Sik.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,970
Dae Sik.

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,370
Hey, Kim Dae Sik.

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,670
(Episode 5)

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,780
Kim Dae Sik!

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,420
What are you doing?
Are you just going to make me stand here?

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,320
I was going to head in,
but you told me to stop.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,020
You called my name,
so spit it out already.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,630
You fool. Are you messing with me now?

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,730
I want to punch you right now.

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,300
No, I shouldn't waste my energy like that.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,710
<i>Stay for a single drink</i>

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,780
<i>That's my last wish</i>

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,960
What is this?

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,900
Yes, I'm sure it was a spam message.

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,630
I mean,
she would at least know her own name.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,570
Right.

26
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,370
That cheapskate doesn't even want
to waste a single penny.

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,140
He's not capable of having an affair.

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,010
<i>- Stay for a single drink</i>
- Hey.

29
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,480
My gosh! You reek of alcohol.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,410
Why did you drink so much?

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,550
I had one drink with a friend of mine.

32
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,290
A friend? Who?
Kim from the chicken restaurant?

33
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,090
Or Choi, the realtor?

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,060
Come on. Do you think
those punks are the only friends I have?

35
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,430
It's someone you don't know.

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,360
My best friend.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,930
Your best friend?

38
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,080
Darling, did you see my lipstick
by any chance?

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,180
Lipstick?

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,850
What? Honey, what did you say?

41
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,850
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

42
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,750
(New Message)

43
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,760

(New Message)

45
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,460
Check your jacket pockets
and see if it's there.

46
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,030
(Check your jacket pockets
and see if it's there.)

47
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,240
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to get changed?

48
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,480
What? Are you worried
that I might not get changed?

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,180
Oh, right. About Hye Sook's restaurant.

50
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,850
I heard you told them you'd raise
the deposit by 100,000 dollars.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,850
They're not doing well financially.

52
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,690
Don't you think
100,000 dollars is a bit much?

53
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,420
I am doing it for a reason.

54
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,560
You stay out of it.

55
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,630
Why do you need 100,000 dollars?

56
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,690
Shush!

57
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,400
You talk too much.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,930
Where will you spend the 100,000 dollars?

59
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,040
- Why do you need 100,000 dollars?
- Goodness me.

60
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,270
Hey!

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Goodness.

62
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,970
He doesn't even want to waste a penny.

63
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,180
Where is he going to spend
that kind of money?

64
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,710
What is 100,000 dollars?

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,250
I'd never even see
that kind of money in my life,

66
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,290
but some people can give
or take it from others with just one word.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,860
Life's so unfair.

68
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,230
You're back.

69
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,100
Come and sit here.

70
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,100
You should have a drink too.

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,670
I came up with the money.

72
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,940
I wasn't going to say anything
in case you got angry,

73
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,110
but what else could I do?

74
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,250
We have to go on living somehow.

75
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,250
You know Sook In, right?
My friend from high school.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,590
It's not the full amount,

77
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,220
but she says she can lend us part of it.

78
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,860
If we pay back our debt with that,

79
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,260
we won't have our property seized,
at least.

80
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,900
- And the restaurant...
- I'm going to...

81
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,870
close up the restaurant.

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
What?

83
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,670
What are you talking about?

84
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,340
Close up the restaurant?

85
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,380
I'll talk to Gyu Tae tomorrow
and put the restaurant up for lease.

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,780
I'm just letting you know.

87
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
My goodness.

88
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,970
Honey, are you really going to
put the restaurant up for lease?

89
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,710
But what if we can't find
another restaurant with the money we have?

90
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,480
What will you do then?

91
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,080
Don't you worry.

92
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,950
I'll make sure to provide for you,
no matter how hard it gets.

93
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,720
After my mother passed away
when I was five years old,

94
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,020
do you know what my father told me?

95
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,020
"I should've been good to her
while she was around."

96
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,530
I thought to myself as I watched him
regret it every single day.

97
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,160
"When I get married,"

98
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,630
"I will be sure to treat my wife
like a princess."

99
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,600
You're always my number one in my heart.

100
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,110
The kids are old enough
to fend for themselves now.

101
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,810
Let them go about their own lives.

102
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,480
And even if I end up on the ground,

103
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,580
I'll make sure to provide for you.
Don't you worry.

104
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,710

I wish you success!

Oh, is this mine? I can't really see it.

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,700

Good morning, sir.

It's nothing big, but please accept this.

128
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,780
What are these knives for?

129
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,950
I heard your grandfather said this.

130
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,390
"Good meat comes
from the tip of a good blade."

131
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,790
From what I've heard, that's why...

132
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,790
you don't use a meat cutter
and do everything by hand.

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,290
I got these precious knives...

134
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,330
from a master artisan
whose family has been making knives...

135
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,400
for four generations.

136
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,840
How do you know
what my grandfather told me?

137
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,940
Until the branch in California
was remodeled,

138
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,340
I was a regular there.

139
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,380
California?

140
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,350
Yes, I studied there.

141
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,480
On the wall there,

142
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,480
I saw the phrase
your grandfather had said.

143
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,820
"Good meat comes
from the tip of a good blade."

144
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,860
My gosh.

145
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,160
Do you think
I'm going to fall for your trick...

146
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,260
just because you remembered a mere phrase?

147
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,030
I don't think...

148
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,900
it's just a mere phrase.

149
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,170
I heard your grandfather raised you...

150
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,170
instead of your parents
who had passed away.

151
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,710
I also grew up
under my grandfather's care...

152
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,510
instead of my busy parents.

153
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,710
So, I knew.

154
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,550
The phrase your grandfather had said...

155
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,520
must've meant a lot to you.

156
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,560
I heard it was your grandfather's goal...

157
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,200
to provide cheap but good quality meat
to as many people as possible.

158
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,240
Your grandfather's goal.

159
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,610
We, at Farm to Market,
will make it come true.

160
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,180
Through direct shipping,
not only the people who line up here,

161
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,580
but also those who live in the mountains
and remote areas...

162
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,150
will be able to taste your fresh meat.

163
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,220
Please consider it, sir.

164
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,920
All right. Have some coffee.

165
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,660
Congratulations, Seok Jin!

166
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,270
I still can't believe it.

167
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,200
I can't believe we got the contract
with Jung Meats.

168
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,500
How did you convince them?

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,310
They're the proud,
top butcher store chain in Korea.

170
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,110
It's just the beginning.

172
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
I'm sorry I left everything up to you.

173
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,080
Don't worry about things here.

174
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,850
You should just go home.

175
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,990
Aren't you working way too hard
as soon as you arrived in Korea?

176
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,590
You sure are a workaholic.

177
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,360
Your parents still don't know, do they?

178
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,690
No.

179
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,360
It's a surprise.
Of course, they can't know.

180
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,230
I'll go and see them
after I'm done with things here.

181
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,100
If we close the restaurant,

182
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,740
we'll have to move out of the house too.

183
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,800
How will we find the money to move?

184
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,480
Gosh, I'd have nothing more to wish for...

185
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,010
if I didn't have to worry
about money for once.

186
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,310
What's this?

187
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,250
What's this lottery ticket for?

188
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,190
He never buys lottery tickets.
Why did he get this?

189
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,890
Honey, give me your jacket. I'll wash it.

190
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,990
No, it's still clean.

191
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,230
I can wear it for a few more days.

192
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,060
You started your day early. Get some rest.

193
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,370
Where are you going now?

194
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,370
Well, sure. No wonder he's so down.

195
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,210
I feel the same way.

196
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,310
I'm sure it's worse for him.

197
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,640
(Lottery Ticket)

198
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,650
What?

199
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,350
You want to close your restaurant?

200
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,680
Did you talk to Mu Chul about it?

201
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,650
I told you to ask him for a favor.

202
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,660
Who knows? He might be generous.

203
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,660
Just help me find somewhere to move to.

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,330
Both for the restaurant and my house.

205
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, I'll try,

206
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,030
but it'll be hard to find
a restaurant space with what you have.

207
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,130
Housing prices
have gone up so much lately.

208
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,000
It can be a smaller space than now.

209
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,070
Okay. I'll look into it.

210
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,480
Should I try talking to Mu Chul?

211
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,780
That you're going to close
your restaurant?

212
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Darling.

213
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,860
This is it, right?

214
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,730
Yes, thank you for coming, darling.

215
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Where are you going?

216
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,740
I ordered for us. Have a seat.

217
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,970
Come on.

218
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,280
Goodness.

219
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,810
What?

220
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,680
Gosh, what is this?

221
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,580
Hey.

222
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,520
This isn't a bar.

223
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,920
This is a coffee shop.

224
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,060
Who cares? My gosh.

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,760
Here. Drink up, darling.

226
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,670
- Goodness.
- Oh, come on.

227
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,300
It's hot!

228
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,740
- Here!
- Oh, my!

229
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,640
Hey!

230
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,270
My gosh.

231
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,310
What's wrong, darling?

232
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,280
Do you feel uncomfortable?

233
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,550
Being alone with you...

234
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,260
at this hour
makes me feel all weird inside.

235
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,320
You know?

236
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,490
Wait. Hang on.

237
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,490
Wait, let go.

238
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,460
What's this?
This is easier than I thought.

239
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,870
Figures. If he doesn't fall for my beauty,

240
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,870
- he wouldn't be a man.
- Why are you doing this?

241
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,670
That will be 20 dollars.

242
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,080
You put too many jujubes
in the herbal tea.

243
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,380
They're all stuck in my teeth.

244
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,850
Goodness.

245
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,820
Darling! Where are you going?
You have to pay!

246
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,750
- Darn it.
- Excuse me.

247
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,090
You have to pay before you go.

248
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
What?

249
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,260
But he...

250
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,360
Darn it.

251
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Fine.

252
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,300
He came to return my lipstick today,

253
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,630
so maybe he thinks this is on me.

254
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,770
The tea wasn't even expensive.

255
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,910
I'll just consider this an investment.

256
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Honey!

257
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,510
Darling!

258
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,710
Wait, darling.

259
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,310
Hey.

260
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,020
You know,

261
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,720
the spot
where I spilled the tea earlier...

262
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,620
is still very sore.

263
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,990
I pour drinks for men,

264
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,660
but I'm very selective about
who I go on a tea date with.

265
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,560
For some reason,
I'm very attracted to you.

266
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,100
I guess this happened
because I was on edge.

267
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Is that so?

268
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,540
Then you should go to the hospital.

269
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,340
Right? I should, right?

270
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,040
Oh, my. Is this your car?

271
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,910
My gosh.

272
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,380
What a nice car!

273
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,650
My goodness. I'm sorry.

274
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,390
What? Honey! What are you doing there?

275
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,920
Take me to the hospital!

276
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,330
My gosh. Honey!

277
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,700
What a weirdo.

278
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Darn it.

279
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,210
Father, I'm here.

280
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,340
Have you been well?

281
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,310
I couldn't visit you often,

282
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,850
saying I was always busy.

283
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,990
I have decided...

284
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,090
to leave Daewoon Building.

285
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,090
I think I've been working hard,

286
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,430
but it's not easy.

287
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
It's...

288
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,600
where our old house used to be,

289
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,370
so I wanted to stay in the building
for as long as I could,

290
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,680
but I think it's time for me to leave.

291
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,820
I wanted to...

292
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,330
work hard
and live well to show you, but...

293
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,970
I'm sorry, Father.

294
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,910
(Bus Stop)

295
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,450
Hey, Mr. Jang. It's me.

296
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,250
Why aren't you calling me?

297
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,650
How's it going? The project I invested in.

298
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,790
Call me when you get this.

299
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,060
Hey, Han Mu Chul.

300
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,300
What's up?

301
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,140
Don't you have anything to say to me?

302
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,940
What? What are you saying? How random.

303
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,570
Do you really not know
what I'm talking about?

304
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,640
Or are you just playing dumb?

305
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,540
Move aside, will you?

306
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Hey, I'm a busy man. Don't block my way.

307
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,250
Goodness.

308
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,820
I'm going to...

309
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,420
close up my restaurant.

310
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,890
I'll close Jackpot Chicken
and move out of your house too.

311
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,490
What?

312
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,190
Close up the restaurant?

313
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,830
You want to raise the deposit
by 100,000 dollars.

314
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,560
Then try to find a new tenant
for the space.

315
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,800
Although, I doubt you'll find anyone...

316
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,200
because of all the bad rumors about you.

317
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,100
What? You piece of...

318
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,140
Let me make this very clear to you.

319
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,250
You'd better not say
you can't give me back my deposit...

320
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,150
because I didn't help you
find a new tenant.

321
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,420
Send me the money on time.

322
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,650
Are we clear?

323
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,550
Move, punk. Why, you...

324
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,320
Hey, move!

325
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,530
One punch from me will finish you off.

326
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,400
(Nara Bank, Kim Ah Jin)

327
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,940
Hey, kimchi.

328
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,390
Oh, thanks.

329
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,800
Water too.

330
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
My gosh.

331
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,720
What is this?

332
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
(Bankbook, Nara Bank)

333
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
Hey, Gyeong Sun. Is it something urgent?

334
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,090
A bankbook?

335
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,620
I'm working now. What's up?

336
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
How much is this?

337
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,060
(Total balance 31,030.04 dollars)

338
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,890
How many digits? One, two,

339
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,300
- I'll call you back.
- three, four,

340
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,300
five...

341
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,130
What are you doing?

342
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,840
Why are you going through my bankbook?

343
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,640
Where did you get this?

344
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,510
Don't tell me...

345
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,210
you went through my pouch. Did you?

346
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,210
What?

347
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,350
That's where I put it.
How could you have it...

348
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,280
unless you went through my pouch?

349
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,950
Hey, what do you take me for?

350
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,290
Why would I go through your pouch?

351
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,050
You just have some coins...

352
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,660
in that stupid pouch, you pathetic loser.

353
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,120
What did you say? "Pathetic loser?"

354
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,160
It was on the floor, so I picked it up.

355
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,690
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

356
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,430
What? I went through your pouch?

357
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,870
If you ever see something like this again,

358
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,970
just leave it. Don't open it.

359
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,970
The owner will find it, naturally.
Am I wrong?

360
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,470
Are you lecturing me right now?

361
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,740
Hey, look at you yelling at me
when you don't even have that much money.

362
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,880
If someone saw you now, they'd think
you might have a six-figure balance.

363
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,710
All you have is 30,000 dollars.
Don't be such a snob.

364
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,620
What about you? Forget 30,000 dollars.

365
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,290
Do you even have three dollars
in your bank account?

366
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,490
You're not even making money
because you're jobless.

367
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,960
What? Jobless? Why, you...

368
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,930
Hey, you see...

369
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,500
You don't even know the basics.

370
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,370
How could you raise your voice
at a customer?

371
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,270
I mean, if you're ugly,

372
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,040
you should at least be friendly.

373
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,410
You're seriously underqualified
for this job.

374
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,580
It's only a matter of time
before you get fired.

375
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,680
I told you not to talk down to me.

376
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,350
- Why, you...
- Hey, it hurts!

377
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
My gosh.

378
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,260
Honey, where did you find
this lottery ticket?

379
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,530
It was in your pants pocket.

380
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,060
Why did you get a lottery ticket?

381
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,430
Oh, I saw people lined up
in front of the store,

382
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,440
so I was just curious.

383
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,770
Hand it over. I'll check
when they announce the winners.

384
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,510
Just throw it away.

385
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,840
What? Why do you want to throw it away?

386
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,210
I just bought it for fun.
You can throw it away.

387
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,450
Why would you throw it away?

388
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,650
What if this is a winning ticket?

389
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,050
You never know,
so we should keep it in a safe place.

390
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,290
I'm home.

391
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,620
Hey.

392
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,230
That jerk. I will teach him a lesson.

393
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,730
What?

394
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,270
"Jerk?"

395
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,970
Hey, did something happen
at the restaurant?

396
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,410
- What?
- Did a customer say something to you?

397
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,670
Oh, no.

398
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,810
Right. I bought something you like, Mom.

399
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,910
Ta-da!

400
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,580
Here's the secret weapon, corn on the cob!

401
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,090
Oh, my.

402
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,490
My goodness. I was craving this.

403
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,960
I picked it up for you
because I knew that.

404
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,460
It doesn't matter how upset you are.

405
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,730
One bite of this can make you
forget all your worries.

406
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,830
Your mom is a simple woman.

407
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,670
Corn on the cob is all you need
to lift her mood.

408
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,870
That's Mom's charm.

409
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,640
Dad, you said
that was why you fell for Mom.

410
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,340
Well, that is true.

411
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,810
My gosh. I'll meet a man like Dad...

412
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,480
who finds...

413
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,280
even my little quirks charming.
I really want to.

414
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,890
Hey, a man like your dad
is hard to come by.

415
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,930
He's handsome and sweet,

416
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,760
and he loves only one woman.

417
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,130
You can keep your eyes peeled,

418
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,130
but you won't find another man like him.

419
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,800
My, what's gotten into you?

420
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,640
I don't even have to eat today
because my heart feels so full.

421
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,680
A man must be diligent.
It's the most important quality.

422
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,110
You've seen Tae Ha upstairs.

423
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,250
He's 30, but he still can't get a job.

424
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,380
He's unemployed.

425
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,420
But then again, his parents are messed up.

426
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,220
Clearly, his parents
didn't teach him right at home.

427
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,520
Goodness.

428
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,160
Why would you talk about someone
behind their back?

429
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,330
That's a bad habit.

430
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,230
Why? Mom's right.

431
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,860
I really can't stand Han Tae Ha either.

432
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,200
If only he weren't your friends' son...

433
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
My gosh.

434
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,400
Anyway, Mom.

435
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,940
I completely agree with you.

436
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,540
You should find a man...

437
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,240
who's like your brother.
Now, that's a real catch.

438
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,380
He studied abroad
without his parents' help.

439
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Now, he wants to start his own business.

440
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,750
Why are you suddenly talking
about Seok Jin?

441
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,590
Just have some fruit.

442
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,620
Yes, Mom.

443
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,520
You know
Seok Jin can take care of himself.

444
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,160
Put your worries to rest.

445
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,190
Honey.

446
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,530
Seok Jin must be doing well, right?

447
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,930
We can't even help him out as his parents.

448
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,940
He must be having such a hard time
all alone, away from home.

449
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,780
My heart aches so much
whenever I think about Seok Jin.

450
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,350
Your parents don't know yet?

451
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,780
No, they don't know
about the investment yet,

452
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,920
and they have no idea
that I'm in Korea now.

453
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,050
Then you shouldn't be here now.
You should go home first.

454
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,890
My gosh. They'll be so happy to see you.

455
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,290
I know,

456
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,960
but I wanted to see you first...

457
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,630
because you are
Farm to Market's first investor.

458
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,500
I'd like to thank you once again.

459
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,310
Keep this in mind.

460
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,940
I didn't invest in Farm to Market.

461
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,980
I invested in you, Seok Jin.

462
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,920
You're diligent, smart, and reliable.

463
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,420
You're my son's friend, Kim Seok Jin.

464
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
It's because you're you.

465
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,220
I'll do my best...

466
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,020
not to let you down.

467
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,460
Also...

468
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,460
This is a knife set
made by a master artisan.

469
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,300
I bought a few as gifts...

470
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,800
and got one for you as well, sir.

471
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,630
Goodness, you didn't have to.

472
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,340
Gosh, thank you.

473
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,410
By the way,
what's taking Tae Hyung so long?

474
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Well...

475
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,120
I was so surprised...

476
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,820
that you asked to see me again today.

477
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
I know.

478
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,020
I wasn't thinking of doing this either,

479
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,760
but I kept thinking of you
for some reason.

480
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,830
Oh, my. Really?

481
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,800
Do you have a girlfriend, perhaps?

482
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
A girlfriend?

483
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,130
No, I don't.

484
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,140
Really?

485
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,240
Come on.

486
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,970
What were you doing in France
instead of finding a girlfriend?

487
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,610
I just went to France
to learn about my father's business.

488
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,980
Oh, is that so?

489
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,250
So, he's still single?

490
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,360
Nice. You're mine now.

491
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,890
Hey, I'm sorry. I can't stay.

492
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,590
Do you remember my best friend
I mentioned last time?

493
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,560
I said I'd meet him
since it's been a while.

494
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,900
Of course. You should get going.

495
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,400
Your friend must be waiting.

496
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,700
Kim Seok Jin.

497
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,270
Hey, Tae Hyung.

498
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,380
Did you have a good talk with my dad?

499
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,310
Yes. Thanks, Tae Hyung.

500
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,050
It's all thanks to you
that I could get this investment.

501
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,810
That's no big deal. We're friends.

502
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Shall we go somewhere else
and grab a drink?

503
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,350
I wish I could too, but I have to go home.

504
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,020
My parents don't know I'm here.

505
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,790
Let's have a drink some other time.
Let's go someplace cool. My treat.

506
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,800
Tae Hyung, what are you doing tomorrow?

507
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,400
You bought me a meal today.

508
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,230
Tomorrow, I'll buy you...

509
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,100
I think it's somewhere around here.

510
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,600
Mom and Dad will be surprised to see me.

511
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,570
Will they like my gifts?

512
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
What's this?

513
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,240
Why is he talking to himself?

514
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,050
Is he crazy?

515
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,210
He won't follow me all the way here,
will he?

516
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,400
- What is this?
- Hey, go away!

517
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,270
- Go away, you jerk!
- What?

518
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,670
Go!

519
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,970
- Why are you doing this? Calm down!
- Go away!

520
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,770
My gosh!

521
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,510
My knives.

522
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,250
Don't kill me!

523
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,350
Please don't kill me!

524
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,170
(Good Luck!)

525
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,880
Please see if you can take out a loan
through your company.

526
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,080
My stomach hurts all of a sudden. Hold on.

527
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,580
I can't believe him.

528
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,480
I was so scared,

529
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,950
but he didn't even ask if I was okay.

530
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,290
So what if you make so much rent money?

531
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,160
I don't even get to see that money.

532
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,060
No soup for you! Dream on!

533
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,630
I can't give up without even trying.

534
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,630
I should give it a shot.

535
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,660
