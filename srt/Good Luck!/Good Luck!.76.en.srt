1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,140
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,940
(Episode 76)

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,850
Thanks.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,730
What... Why?

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,800
You're scaring me.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,740
Can you get up?

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,780
Well, let me try.

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,550
Hey, careful.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,150
- Can you walk?
- Let me try walking.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,760
We can't go that way.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,420
Let's go down this way.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,930
Gyu Tae.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,100
Thanks.

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,400
All right.

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,070
Let's go, Mu Chul.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,610
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,050
My eyesight isn't great,
so I can't see very well.

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,120
What should we do?

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,520
- Well...
- Hey, move aside.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,060
- I'll lead the way.
- Okay.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,390
If you lose Gyu Tae, you're doomed.
Just stay right behind us.

23
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,970
What if this punk...

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,540
What?

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,950
Goodness. What is wrong with my phone?

26
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,650
This is nuts.

27
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,290
Mr. Gyu Tae isn't picking up either,
is he?

28
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,820
No, I just spoke to Jin Tae.
He says his phone is off.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,990
Shouldn't we call the police
instead of just waiting around?

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,590
Yes, we should report this
to the police right away.

31
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,400
Honey, can you go to the police station?

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,330
I can't go because Ji Woo might wake up.

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,630
Okay, all right.

34
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,540
I'll look around the neighborhood
one more time.

35
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,870
Yes, I'll come with you.

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,410
They'll be okay, right?

37
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,110
Yes, they'll be fine.
Let's just wait for now.

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,960
Please don't talk about that stuff
in front of Seo Woo from now on.

39
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,690
It might be upsetting for Seo Woo.

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,050
I'm heading back inside.

41
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,750
Let me know if you hear anything.

42
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,150
Okay, Ah Jin. Go on in.

43
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,930
Why aren't they back yet?

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,430
Hey, Seo Woo.

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
What are you doing out here?

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,070
What brings you here, Ms. Park?

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,010
Are you here to see Seok Jin?

48
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,440
None of your business.

49
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,840
Look, Ms. Park.

50
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,410
Didn't you say
you were Seok Jin's best friend?

51
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,580
If you're his true friend,
you shouldn't do things that bother him.

52
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,220
Am I wrong?

53
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,290
Is your goal to make him uncomfortable,

54
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,490
caught between us?

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,330
What kind of friend does that?

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,900
Are you sure
you've been friends for 20 years?

57
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,330
What if I told you
I don't see him as a friend?

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
What?

59
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,000
If I don't think of Seok Jin as a friend,

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,500
then what would you do?

61
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,810
What are you saying now?

62
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,910
I like Seok Jin.

63
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,180
Not as a friend, but as a man.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,350
What did you say?

65
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,620
Somewhere along the way,
I began to have feelings for him...

66
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,750
that went beyond friendship.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,020
So, listen carefully now.

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,790
I'm not the one who should back off.

69
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,530
You are.

70
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,460
I don't plan
to keep my distance from him...

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,000
or stay out of your so-called boundary.

72
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,500
So if you can't handle it,

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,470
just back off.

74
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Oh, boy.

75
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,410
Hold on. Dae Sik!

76
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,320
Hey, Mu Chul! I'm over here!

77
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,350
- I'm here.
- Good.

78
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,020
- Hey, be careful. Watch your step.
- All right.

79
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,560
What happened? Are you hurt?

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,030
I missed my footing and slipped.

81
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,800
Gyu Tae...

82
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,200
saved me.

83
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,500
Hey, can you walk?

84
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,840
Yes, the pain's bearable.

85
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,780
Let's support Mu Chul from both sides
so he can walk.

86
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
All right.

87
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,510
- Hey, watch out.
- Okay.

88
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
I suggested this hike...

89
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,920
and ended up stressing you all out.

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm sorry, but...

91
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,830
Even so,

92
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,930
the three of us
hanging out side by side like this...

93
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,000
feels just like
the old Cheonha High Trio days.

94
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,700
It makes me really happy.

95
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,370
My strong, loyal friend, Dae Sik.

96
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,810
And Gyu Tae, my kind, funny friend
who's always such a great listener.

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,150
You two are always there for me.

98
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
Thank you so much.

99
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,420
For the rest of my life,

100
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,630
I'll be the first to listen to you.

101
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,460
And even if...

102
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,770
the whole world points fingers at you,

103
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,870
I'll always stand by your side.

104
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,010
I promise.

105
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,910
All right.

106
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,110
- Let's go.
- Yes.

107
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,150
Goodness. Why isn't he back yet?

108
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,720
Let me go back to the police station.

109
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,060
- Gyu Tae.
- Dad.

110
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,360
Gyu Tae, why are you home so late?
Where were you?

111
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,100
What? Why does your face look like this?

112
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,470
Did something happen in the mountains?

113
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,370
Gyu Tae, hey!

114
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,910
Dae Sik, I'm sorry.

115
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,370
You must be exhausted too.

116
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,280
Hey, don't be sorry.

117
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,480
Thanks to you,
I got some exercise and fresh air,

118
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,880
so stop apologizing.

119
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,220
Oh, honey!

120
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,380
- My gosh.
- Dad!

121
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,620
My goodness.
Why are you leaning on Mr. Kim?

122
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,830
What happened? Did you get hurt?

123
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,190
Well, it's nothing serious. I'm okay.

124
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,830
You guys, why are you still up?

125
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,430
How could we sleep if you're not home yet?

126
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,700
Don't go anywhere far again.
You don't have a cell phone.

127
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,770
What if something bad
happens to you again?

128
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,810
My goodness.

129
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,470
My son and daughter.
Were you worried about me?

130
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,180
I will be careful from now on.

131
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,080
Oh, are you okay, Mr. Kim?

132
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Oh, yes. I'm fine.

133
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,990
- Okay. Let's go inside.
- Yes.

134
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,090
I'll head in first.

135
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,420
- Oh, sure.
- Watch your step.

136
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,860
- Lean on me, Dad.
- Yes.

137
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,960
I'll get the door. Hang on.

138
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,990
- Watch out.
- Dad, be careful.

139
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,230
- Oh, gosh!
- Be careful.

140
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,760
- Watch out.
- Gosh, thanks.

141
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,130
- Be sure to support his weight.
- Oh, no!

142
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,460
- Oh, dear.
- Here, Dad.

143
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,900
- My gosh!
- Tae Ha.

144
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,570
- Dad, watch out.
- Oh, boy.

145
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,610
- Dad!
- Dad.

146
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,610
Dad!

147
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,980
What happened? Why didn't you call us?

148
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,480
Where were you this whole time?

149
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,090
We got lost in the mountains,
so it took a while.

150
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,820
You got lost?

151
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,790
Did you get hurt?

152
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,560
No, I'm fine.

153
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,930
My goodness.

154
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,570
You should've taken a power bank
if you were going that far.

155
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,470
We were all so worried.

156
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,100
You were worried about me?

157
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,670
Of course.
Do you know how worried we were...

158
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,510
in case you fell in the mountains
or something?

159
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,280
I even reported you to the police, Father.

160
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,450
What about your mom?

161
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,250
She went on a trip to the West Sea.

162
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,770
I don't know, I really don't

163
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,640
What on earth are you thinking about?

164
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,140
Even though I look around here and there

165
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,010
I don't see a thing at all

166
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,650
Why are you trying to find it?

167
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,790
Why are you trying to leave?

168
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,860
The more you do that, the sadder I get

169
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,690
Because I must live alone

170
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,800
If you can't make up your mind

171
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,710
Give me a potion
to make me stop loving you

172
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,710
Holding onto the string of love

173
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,330
Oh, boy.

174
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,580
How nice.

175
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,950
I can't believe I'm drinking beer outside
at this hour. What a treat.

176
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Hang on.

177
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,290
They were selling semi-dried pollack here.

178
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,490
Should I buy some tomorrow
and take it home?

179
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,760
Our whole family loves semi-dried pollack.

180
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,760
Why am I thinking about semi-dried pollack
when I came all this way?

181
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,160
Goodness, Hye Sook.
Pull yourself together.

182
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,170
My, that person must be happy.

183
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,910
She's on a trip with her mom.

184
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,250
My mom never got to go on a trip.

185
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
Mom.

186
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,790
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,620
I became financially stable too late.

188
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,160
And I'm sorry for getting a divorce
now that we're better off.

189
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm going to get an earful
when I meet my mom again.

190
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,010
Isn't the heated massage pack too hot?

191
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,120
No, it's fine.

192
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
I'm sorry...

193
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,250
you can't use my arm as a pillow today.

194
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,490
It's fine.

195
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,260
I really thought
something bad happened to you.

196
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,500
I was so worried.

197
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,600
I thought my little heart
was going to burn to a crisp.

198
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,670
I'm always causing you to worry.

199
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,310
Sorry again.

200
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,780
My goodness.

201
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,050
So, did you get your friends to make up?

202
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,920
Well, I tried, but I'm not sure.

203
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,490
But through all this,

204
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,160
I really felt how strong
our trio's friendship was.

205
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,530
Gyu Tae came...

206
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,730
and saved me,
even though he was in danger too.

207
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,100
Dae Sik had a sprained ankle,

208
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,410
but he helped me walk down.

209
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
I was...

210
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,880
so grateful that I almost cried.

211
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,610
I'm so thankful for both of them too.

212
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,350
Our other friends would jokingly say...

213
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,850
that we were the beggar trio.
All three of us were...

214
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,020
literally dirt poor back then.

215
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,160
I remember how kids would tease you
back when we were in school.

216
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,230
When the three of us saved up money,

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,670
we always gave it all
to whoever needed it.

218
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,870
We'd give Dae Sik money
when he needed a new backpack.

219
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,610
Gyu Tae would say his tooth hurt so badly,
so we'd give him money...

220
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,450
to go to the dentist.

221
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,720
When I had to pay
for my grandma's medicine,

222
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,050
they'd give me the money.

223
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,420
Was it that bad?

224
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,190
I knew the three of you were poor,

225
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,330
but I never imagined it was that bad.

226
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,800
You were rich to begin with,
so of course, you couldn't have known.

227
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,870
We all grew up in such poverty.

228
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,210
That was why we said...

229
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,840
we'd help each other out
if one of us made it big.

230
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,280
I think I finally understand
why the three of you are so close.

231
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,990
Honestly, back then,
it seemed so weird to me...

232
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,590
how you guys went everywhere together.

233
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,160
Oh, right.

234
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,130
You know,

235
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,400
I realized something fascinating too.

236
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,200
What?

237
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,670
I was on the ground in the mountains,

238
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,010
and the moment I thought,

239
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,110
"Oh, I'm going to die here,"

240
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,310
I suddenly remembered someone.

241
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Who?

242
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,450
Our kids.

243
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,560
Our kids?

244
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,330
I have to be there to see...

245
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,400
our Tae Ha settle down
and our Seo Woo get married.

246
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,700
The moment I thought of them,

247
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,180
my heart ached so much,

248
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,910
and tears streamed down my face.

249
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,290
I don't even have any memories
with our kids.

250
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,020
Isn't it fascinating?

251
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,190
I had never felt that kind of emotion
in my life.

252
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,330
As I lived with you,

253
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,830
the thing that upset me the most...

254
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,670
was how indifferent you seemed
to our kids.

255
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,010
I was so disappointed in you
as a father...

256
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,040
that I grew even more distant from you.

257
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,010
Even if you don't remember
any memories with our kids,

258
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,580
you must be their father
to think of something like that.

259
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,990
Somewhere deep down in my heart,

260
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,560
I must really love our kids.

261
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,000
I felt that for certain.

262
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,230
It was a hundred times sadder...

263
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,800
than when my grandma...

264
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,540
passed away.

265
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,830
Hey...

266
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,770
I like Seok Jin.

267
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,740
Not as a friend,

268
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,170
but as a man.

269
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,350
Seok Jin, can I see you for a minute?

270
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,220
(Seok Jin, can I see you for a minute?)

271
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,520
Is something the matter?

272
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,290
Seok Jin.

273
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,020
About you working with Ye Won
as business partners.

274
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,190
Do you really have to work with her?

275
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,330
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

276
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,400
Well, when people run a business together,
one of them might end up quitting...

277
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,300
if they don't see eye to eye.

278
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,540
So I was wondering
if that might be the case for you.

279
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,310
Your mom was always fond of me.

280
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,710
That must've been why.

281
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,850
Hey, Seo Woo. When did you get here?

282
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,960
Anyway, let's go together next time.

283
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,390
Your mom said to visit with you.

284
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,660
Hey.

285
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,990
Is this about
what Ye Won said the other day?

286
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,400
If that's the case, don't worry.
I already talked to her, and she gets it.

287
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,730
It won't happen again.

288
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,370
No, it's not that.

289
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,570
It just bothers me that you and Ye Won
spend so much time together.

290
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,510
If you didn't have to work together,
it probably wouldn't bother me as much.

291
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,150
That's why I'm asking.

292
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,550
Well, it's not as simple as you think.

293
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,020
As you know,

294
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,120
we recently signed a deal
with her father's company and...

295
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,590
By any chance,

296
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,190
did something else happen
between you two that I don't know about?

297
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,900
No, nothing happened.

298
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,530
Then please understand.

299
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,400
I understand you're upset
about what happened yesterday,

300
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,870
but we can't just stop
working together now.

301
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,410
But if she ever hurts your feelings
in any way, let me know.

302
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,750
I'll handle it and clear up
any misunderstandings.

303
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
- My gosh.
- Hello.

304
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,690
Hello.

305
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,160
Well, how's Mu Chul? He hurt his back.

306
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,800
He's much better now,
but he still seems to be in some pain.

307
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,400
Would it be okay...

308
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,870
if Mu Chul took today off?

309
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,300
I don't think he's ready
to go back to work just yet.

310
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,510
Of course. I was planning to tell him
to take the day off anyway.

311
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,280
My gosh, thank you.

312
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,710
And thank you very much
for helping my husband yesterday too.

313
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,450
I was so grateful for your generous offer
of three million dollars as well.

314
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,890
I'm not sure how I can adequately repay
your kindness.

315
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,160
My goodness. Don't worry about it.

316
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,220
If it's okay with you,

317
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,330
I'd love to have you both over
for dinner today.

318
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,330
Are you free this evening?

319
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,270
Well, I don't have any plans, but...

320
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,600
My goodness. You don't need to do that.

321
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,440
I want to.

322
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,140
Then please come to my house this evening.

323
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,480
Let Mr. Choi know too, please.

324
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,050
(Number One Real Estate)

325
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,320
I texted you yesterday,

326
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,920
but I haven't heard back.

327
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,360
What's going on with the building?
Did you sell it?

328
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,230
You need to let me know by this week
if you want to make an investment,

329
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
so give me a call.

330
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,650
Mu Chul's wife invited us over for dinner?

331
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Yes.

332
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,220
What will you do now?

333
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,590
When do you plan to tell Mu Chul
about the Daewoon Building?

334
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,760
I did a lot of thinking during our hike.

335
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,630
How did we end up like this?

336
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,240
I regret some of my past choices,
and it feels like such a shame.

337
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,440
So, I'm debating...

338
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,580
when to tell him about the lottery ticket.

339
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,850
I'm giving you one last chance.

340
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,650
Tell him about
the Daewoon Building yourself.

341
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
I was going to tell him,

342
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,860
but I think he should hear it from you.

343
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,600
If you're going to accuse me
of stealing his lottery ticket again,

344
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,760
just forget it.

345
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,900
I swear, Mu Chul gave it to me
as payment for driving him home.

346
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,770
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that?

347
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,880
Whether you want to believe me or not,
it's up to you. In any case,

348
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,980
Mu Chul will be deeply disappointed
if he finds out later,

349
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,380
so...

350
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,280
we should tell him before it's too late.

351
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
You and me both.

352
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,370
Gosh, why do I have such bad indigestion?

353
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,280
Hey, Geum Ok.

354
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,240
Hey, Mi Ja. What brings you by?

355
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,480
Oh, boy. I stopped by to see you
on my way home...

356
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,720
from the grocery store.

357
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Did you eat something bad?

358
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,720
It's been like this for a few days.

359
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,120
Did you buy groceries for dinner?

360
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,390
Yes. I invited Mr. Kim
and Mr. Choi over for dinner.

361
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,600
You invited them over?
Why, all of a sudden?

362
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
They went hiking together yesterday.

363
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Mu Chul got lost
and wandered in the woods,

364
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,770
and the two of them
went through a lot to save him.

365
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,340
- My gosh.
- Don't even get me started.

366
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,310
I heard Mr. Choi rolled down
the hillside in the woods.

367
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,710
Did Gyu Tae get injured?

368
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,010
I heard he was okay.

369
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,150
But he's not young, you know.

370
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
My gosh.

371
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,460
Right. I heard
a strange rumor about Dae Sik.

372
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,890
Do you know about it?

373
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
What rumor?

374
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,700
Well, the rice cake shop owner
went to the grocery store...

375
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,430
and overheard a conversation
between his daughter and granddaughter.

376
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,240
Apparently, Dae Sik won the lottery.

377
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,440
I noticed Dae Sik and Hye Sook
were spending more money lately...

378
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,740
and thought it was odd.

379
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,580
Did you hear anything about this?

380
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,720
It's true that they won the lottery.

381
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,890
Seriously?

382
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,120
They really won the lottery?

383
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,890
Just keep it to yourself
until Hye Sook tells you.

384
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,990
Don't tell anyone.

385
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,600
Okay, all right.

386
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
But...

387
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,430
how much did they win?

388
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,040
(Daewoon Building)

389
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,970
Oh, hello.

390
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,570
Yes.

391
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,210
Hello, sir.

392
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,510
Your business is doing well, right?

393
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,280
Well, it's doing all right.

394
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,250
Things must be really tough for you
after what happened to Mr. Han.

395
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,450
Well...

396
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,430
If only you had that lottery ticket.

397

(Number One Real Estate)

398
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,060
What do you mean?

399
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,400
"Lottery ticket?"

400
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,300
Oh, the thing is...

401
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
The truth is,

402
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,110
my friend runs a lottery ticket shop
in the next neighborhood.

403
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,840
The winning lottery ticket
worth 35.7 million dollars.

404
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,610
He knows
Mr. Han was the one who bought it.

405
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,920
Did the lottery ticket my husband bought
win the first prize?

406
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,820
You didn't know?

407
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,920
My friend saw it.

408
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,260
He saw Mr. Han buying a lottery ticket
with those exact numbers.

409
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,770
So, that means
Hye Sook's family was the one...

410
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,170
who won the lottery?

411
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,470
I guess I didn't buy
any lottery tickets that week.

412
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,080
Where is that lottery ticket shop?

413
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,610
It's...

414
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,650
Oh, it's this way.

415
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,130
Goodness. I feel better now.

416
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,500
Mi Ja?

417
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,770
What? Did she step out to get groceries?

418
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,340
Oh, my.
I should go out and get some air too.

419
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,940
Let me get changed first.

420
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,310
Oh, puffed rice cakes?

421
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,080
Dae Sik likes those.

422
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,350
Hello.

423
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,260
I'll get a bag of puffed rice cakes...
No, I'll take two.

424
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,490
Four dollars.

425
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Goodness.

426
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Oh, no.

427
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,540
What? Shoot.

428
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,710

Goodness, fine.

431
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,270
No.

(Lottery Jackpot Hotspot,

436
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,360
Sir, are you saying...

437
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,300
my husband bought
a lottery ticket right here...

438
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,870
with the exact same numbers
he always played, even that day?

439
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,870
That's right.

440
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,500
Those exact numbers won the 1,177th draw,

441
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,900
so I clearly remember it.

442
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,110
Wait a minute.

443
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,390
- Oh, here he is. Come here.
- This way.

444
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,890
- Okay.
- Come on.

445
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,020
Yes. That's him, right?

446
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,830
It's him, right?

447
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,960
Oh, you're right. Look right there.

It's Mr. Han.

- Yes.
- See? I told you, didn't I?

(Good Luck!)

451
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,060
I'm going to watch you like a hawk,

452
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,390
so you'd better be careful from now on.

457
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,140
wouldn't it be too uncomfortable?
