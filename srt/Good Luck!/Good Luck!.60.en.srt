(Episode 60)

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,750
Oh, my. Do you not feel well?
Are you all right?

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,780
- Oh, my head...
- My gosh!

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,290
Goodness, Mrs. Taylor. Are you okay?

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,760
(Number One Real Estate, 669 Chicken)

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,360
All right. Let's go inside.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Be careful. Watch your step.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,400
Careful.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,410
Oh, watch your step.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,110
Sit here.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,310
Careful.

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,260
My gosh, I'm sorry. I'm anemic.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,100
Do you feel better now?

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,700
Yes.

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,830
You know...

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,940
Earlier, when you held me in your arms,

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,670
it felt so warm.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,380
It had been so long...

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,610
since I felt
that kind of warmth and comfort.

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,520
Without even realizing it,
I thought to myself,

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,750
"I want to stay like this."

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,720
"I never want to leave his embrace."

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,230
My gosh. What am I saying now?

25
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,130
It's okay.
To tell you the truth, I also...

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,740
Goodness.
I feel like I shouldn't say anything...

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,910
because I feel guilty about last night.

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,410
I've never felt this way...

29
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,640
with anyone else since my husband died.

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,850
I don't know when it started,

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,820
but I keep wanting to see you...

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,650
and learn more about you.

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,650
I bet you find it funny.

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,090
No, I don't.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,730
Mrs. Taylor,
why would someone so amazing like you...

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,360
be interested in a nobody like me?

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,800
A nobody? What are you talking about?

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,040
Mr. Choi, you're more impressive...

39
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,540
than any other man I've ever met.

40
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,510
I am?

41
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260
Well...

42
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,230
About the investment opportunity
involving Mr. Jang.

43
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,100
I don't think I can do it.

44
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,070
What? Why not?

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,140
I recently invested in something...

46
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,410
and lost quite a bit of money.

47
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,410
So, I don't think
I can make another investment.

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm going to tell him
that I have to back out.

49
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,280
Oh, that's too bad.
It sounded like an incredible opportunity.

50
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,090
Hold on.

51
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,190
Does this mean one spot will open up?

52
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,060
But my spot will get filled
before you even know it.

53
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,160
Since Mr. Jang is leading it,

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,800
everyone wants in.

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,070
Oh, really?

56
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,440
Goodness. I want in too.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,370
Should I call Mr. Jang?

58
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,540
Don't worry.
You will be investing in it very soon.

59
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,720
Invest as much as you can, Choi Gyu Tae.

(Number One Real Estate)

61
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,690
What is her deal?

62
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,030
They seem really close.

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,870
What?

64
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,470
Did he do that with me...

65
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,340
when he's already seeing someone?

66
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,450
Have some fruit.

67
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,450
Oh, thank you.

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,750
Mu Chul won't be able to work for a while.

69
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,050
I should treat him well
and win him over...

70
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,460
so Mu Chul can keep getting paid.

71
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,030
Here, it's sweet. Have some apple.

72
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,330
Oh, thank you.

73
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,530
Sure.

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,500
Why would she feed an apple
to someone else's husband?

75
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,170
Mi Ja.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,400
I want some apple too.

77
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
What?

78
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,010
Okay.

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,710
- Here.
- Thanks.

80
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,580
It tastes extra delicious
because you fed me.

81
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,450
You must be exhausted,
having to care for him in this heat.

82
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,290
My gosh, no.

83
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,890
This must be even more stressful for you.

84
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,930
He got injured unexpectedly
and can't work.

85
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,030
Aren't you short-staffed
at the restaurant?

86
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,170
No, we're good.

87
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,840
If you need my help with anything,
just let me know.

88
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,400
I'll be more than happy
to help out at the restaurant.

89
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,140
Help out with what? Don't you worry.

90
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,440
It's never busy anyway,
so you don't need to help out.

91
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Goodness.

92
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm good.

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,220
Don't hesitate to call me
if you ever need anything.

94
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,450
I'll take care of it for you.

95
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,420
Why should she call you
when she needs something?

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
She has her husband right here.

97
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,320
I only say that because
you can barely move right now.

98
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,490
Who knows? She might need help
with something heavy...

99
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,930
when Tae Ha isn't home.

100
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
What?

101
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Something heavy?

102
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,070
Back in school,

103
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,300
he'd always ask me for help with stuff
that required physical strength.

104
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,470
As you know, back in high school,

105
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,040
he used to be a wimp.

106
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,740
Oh, I remember.

107
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,650
Out of your trio, Mu Chul was...

108
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,950
the wimpiest one, right?

109
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,050
That's right.

110
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,220
He must still be a weakling
to have fallen down like this.

111
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,220
What? A weakling?

112
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,790
This punk.

113
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,160
Mi Ja! Put my socks on for me.

114
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,530
What? Your socks?

115
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,300
Why do you need socks on such a hot day?

116
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,440
I always have cold hands and feet, okay?

117
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,670
Come on, Mi Ja. Put them on for me.
My feet are so cold.

118
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,940
My goodness.

119
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,850
Hey, did you see that?

120
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,880
Mi Ja takes such good care of me.

121
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,590
She feeds me three times a day...

122
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,350
and washes my face for me.
Do you know what else?

123
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,560
We even go to the bathroom together.

124
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,130
Gosh, seriously.

125
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,800
Honestly,

126
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,930
who else would do that for you
except for your wife?

127
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,470
This is only possible
because we've seen...

128
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,470
everything there is to see
between one another.

129
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,810
From this experience,

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,780
I've realized just how amazing it is
to be married to someone.

131
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,890
Oh, my.

132
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,490
Mi Ja.

133
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,790
Thank you.

134
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,730
I love you.

135
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,930
My goodness.

136
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,470
- Lie down.
- Okay.

137
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,840
My gosh.

138
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,080
- Oh, my back.
- Goodness!

139
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
My gosh!

140
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,580
Then, I'll be going now.

141
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,620
Okay.

142
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,290
Thank you for everything.

143
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,820
Well, I haven't done anything.

144
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,990
Don't say that.

145
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,930
If it weren't for you,

146
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,300
we wouldn't even have been able
to live in this house.

147
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,400
If I had let my stubbornness
get the best of me back then...

148
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,700
Gosh, I can't even imagine
where we'd be living now.

149
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,570
Now that I think about it,

150
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,470
I'm grateful to you for so many things,
Dae Sik.

151
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,280
What is she saying?

152
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,910
Why is it taking so long to say goodbye?
He should just get going.

153
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,250
Mi Ja. I'm thirsty.

154
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,830
Mi Ja!

155
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,870
Oh, Mu Chul is calling you.
You should go inside.

156
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,500
Okay. Goodbye.

157
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Bye.

158
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
Mi Ja!

159
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,640
Gosh, that fool.

160
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,840
I'm coming!

161
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,350
What? Your son is back?

162
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,920
It's fine. Seok Jin can sleep
in the master bedroom with my husband.

163
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,320
Don't worry about it.

164
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,150
But still, how could I...

165
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,890
It's really okay, Ms. Park.

166
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,160
Think of this as my repayment
for letting me stay at your place.

167
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,600
Please, stay here in comfort.

168
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,030
Also,

169
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,630
I have to convince
my husband about something.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,310
Actually, my husband has some money,

171
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,140
and I want to help Mi Jin out with that.

172
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,680
Are you talking
about the lottery winnings, perhaps?

173
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,980
Wait, but how do you know...

174
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,420
I overheard the kids talking about it.

175
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,950
I heard you gave your son
some of the winnings for his business...

176
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,690
while ignoring your other children.

177
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,660
Well, that's not how it happened.

178
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,660
We weren't going to help Seok Jin either.

179
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,630
Yes, I'm sure you had your reasons.

180
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,630
That's what I think too.

181
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,200
But Ms. Lee, I know...

182
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,840
I'm in no position to tell you this
right now,

183
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,540
but just this once, for one last time,

184
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,080
couldn't you help our kids out?

185
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,420
Those two don't have...

186
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,490
anyone to turn to or ask for money
except for you.

187
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,760
If you could help them
get back on their feet just this once,

188
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,160
I won't ever forget your kindness.

189
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Right.

(Sweet rice donuts)

191
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,080
All right. Come and have a look.

192
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,620
Come and get them while they're fresh!

(Sweet rice donuts,
twisted donuts, croquettes)

194
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,160
Mi Jin, do you want some donuts?

195
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,600
No, let's just go.

196
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,570
You can tell me if you want some.

197
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,070
I'll buy one for you.

198
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,340
But your company closed down.
You don't have any money.

199
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,610
Mom said we had to save money.

200
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,150
What are you saying? I have money.

201
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,910
See? I have money, right?

202
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,320
Come here.

203
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,950
We'll take one sweet rice donut.

204
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,950
Sure.

205
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,120
- Here's your change.
- Right.

206
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,630
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

207
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,870
All right. Here's your donut.
Go on and eat it.

208
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,500
But aren't you having one, Dad?

209
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,700
What? Me? I'm so full.

210
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,710
Go ahead.

211
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,940
Oh, it's delicious.

212
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,580
I love you, Dad. You're the best.

213
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,080
Daddy loves you too, Mi Jin.

214
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,550
Okay, let's go. One, two. Up you go!

215
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,460
Mister, I'll take some donuts.

216
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,560
Sure, which ones?

217
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,930
- The ones with red bean in them.
- Okay.

218
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,500
(Number One Real Estate)

219
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,540
Mrs. Taylor is my lucky charm.

220
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,480
How could she bring me
such incredible information?

221
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,260
Yes, Mr. Jang.
You're available today, aren't you?

222
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,560
I was going to call you too.

223
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,130
Shall we have a meal together?

224
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,100
Of course.

225
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,600
Yes, I'll see you there.

226
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,770
Okay, see you soon.

227
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,680
Do you have a minute?

228
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,350
Yes.

229
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,880
You're here. Do you want some tea?

230
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
No, it's fine.

231
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
Gyu Tae.

232
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,230
Why did you avoid me this morning?

233
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,030
Avoid you? What are you talking about?

234
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,070
You saw me
in front of the Daewoon Building.

235
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,300
But you ignored me and just walked away.

236
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,610
But...

237
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,240
That's weird. I didn't see you.

238
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,040
Wait, what?

239
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,450
Oh, lately,

240
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,520
my eyes have gotten bad.
They can't focus very well.

241
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,120
So, you must have been mistaken
and thought I saw you.

242
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,920
Well, that's that.

243
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,990
I saw that woman
outside your office earlier.

244
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,730
Taylor or whatever her name is.

245
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,730
You two seemed really close.

246
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,860
What's going on between you two?

247
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,600
My gosh.

248
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,540
What am I supposed to say
if she asks me that now?

249
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,640
Well, she's just...

250
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,340
someone I'm getting to know
with cordial feelings for each other.

251
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,280
Cordial feelings?

252
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,650
Then, what about me?

253
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,980
You said I was the prettiest woman
in the world.

254
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,090
If that's not what you call
cordial feelings, then what is?

255
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Right.

256
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,260
That's great.

257
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,700
What does she mean by that?

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,500
Does that mean I don't have to care
about what happened last night?

259
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,870
Oh, sure.

260
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,770
Stay calm, Hwang Geum Ok.

261
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,670
If you think about it,
you're also in the wrong here.

262
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,080
This wasn't just one person's fault.
We were both to blame.

263
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,420
Right. I should check things first.

264
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,690
See if Gyu Tae remembers
what happened yesterday or not.

265
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,890
Gyu Tae.

266
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,790
So, about last night.

267
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,500
Last night?

268
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Yes.

269
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,730
By any chance,

270
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,170
do you remember what happened last night?

271
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,270
I mean, what happened between us.

272
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,980
Gosh, what should I say?

273
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,250
I can't say that I remember.

274
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,020
Right. Let's not make things
awkward between us.

275
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,150
Just say that you don't know.

276
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,420
I don't remember anything.

277
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
What?

278
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,630
You don't remember anything?

279
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,100
No, when I woke up this morning,

280
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,570
I just found myself in your bed.

281
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,170
Gosh, I wonder how I got there.

282
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,270
What a mystery.

283
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,870
But...

284
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,440
do you remember?

285
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,050
What?

286
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,510
No.

287
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,620
I don't remember either.

288
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,120
What? You don't remember?

289
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,290
No.

290
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,160
See? We drank way too much last night.

291
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,530
But Gyu Tae...

292
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,730
Why did you take your clothes off?

293
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,170
When I woke up, I saw that
you didn't have your clothes on.

294
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,110
You remember that, don't you?

295
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,210
Yes, I do remember that.

296
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,720
To tell you the truth, it's...

297
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,890
My gosh. It's a secret, okay?

298
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,890
I sleep naked.

299
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
What?

300
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,860
You sleep naked?

301
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,200
That's right.
And it was a hot day, you know.

302
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,260
I'd had too much to drink,
and it was really hot.

303
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,430
Naturally, I took off my clothes.

304
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,900
Well...

305
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,440
At our age, I guess it's nothing unusual
to sleep in the nude.

306
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,870
Even if you did something worse,

307
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,740
it wouldn't really be a problem.

308
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,050
Exactly. We're both getting old.

309
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,480
What's the fuss about sharing a bed
for one night? Come on.

310
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,630
So, last night...

311
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,100
was a mistake for both of us, right?

312
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,670
Yes, obviously. Must you ask?

313
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,630
Well...

314
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,400
I just didn't want you
to feel uncomfortable around me.

315
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,210
It's not like we've only known each other
for a few days.

316
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,380
Why would that make me uncomfortable?

317
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,110
I already let it go,
so you should do the same.

318
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,220
Okay, I will.

319
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,320
Anyway, thanks for coming to me first.

320
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,660
I wasn't sure how to bring it up.

321
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,760
I knew it. You'll always be
my forever little sister...

322
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,330
Anyway,

323
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,360
about last night,

324
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,400
we'll pretend it never happened.
Sounds good?

325
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Yes.

326
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,070
Sounds good.

327
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,990
Did something happen?

328
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,560
I guess this is what people mean
when they say you can't act your age.

329
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
What?

330
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,100
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

331
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,030
I'm over 60 now,
and I did something I never did...

332
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,770
even when I was younger.

333
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,770
What?

334
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,810
Did something happen last night?

335
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,810
No, it's nothing.

336
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,880
Oh, boy. We talked it out
and ended the conversation on a good note,

337
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,220
so why do I still feel uneasy?

338
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
Has Mr. Kim returned
to the restaurant safely?

339
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,530
I'm sure my husband is
at the restaurant now.

340
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,570
He came by my place earlier.

341
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
You didn't know?

342
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,700
My husband was at your place? Why?

343
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,210
Mu Chul is still bedridden,

344
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,970
so he came by to talk to him.

345
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,340
Is your husband injured or something?

346
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,980
My gosh. I guess
you really don't know anything.

347
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,210
Mu Chul hurt his back,
so he's bedridden now.

348
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,620
He can't even work.

349
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Hey.

350
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,450
Did you and your husband fight?

351
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,290
Do you guys not talk much?

352
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,560
What are you talking about?
Of course, we talk.

353
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,890
I just forgot
because I had too much going on.

354
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Oh, right. About Seo Woo.

355
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,200
Do you know if she's seeing someone now?

356
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,500
Why are you suddenly asking about Seo Woo?

357
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,810
Well, she seems to be following
Seok Jin around these days.

358
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,740
So, I wanted to ask you
if she was seeing someone.

359
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,210
Seo Woo is following Seok Jin around?

360
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,580
You didn't know?

361
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,980
She showed up at his grand opening
carrying a cake...

362
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,550
shaped like a pig's head.

363
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,250
She didn't tell you?

364
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,860
She probably went there
because he's our neighbor.

365
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,320
What's the problem?

366
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,130
Well, it's just that...

367
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,730
I'm just worried since Seo Woo seems
to fall for boys very easily.

368
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,530
What does that mean?

369
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,170
She seems to fall for boys very easily?

370
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,670
The truth is,
Seo Woo used to date Seok Jin's friend.

371
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,280
Anyway, you don't need to know.
Just tell her to be careful.

372
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,310
Hey, what is it that you want to say?

373
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,380
Stop being cryptic
and get straight to the point!

374
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,050
Why are you so angry?
I should be getting angry now.

375
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,280
What did I even do?

376
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
I don't know
why you're saying these things,

377
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,760
but there's nothing wrong with Seo Woo.
Just make sure to keep Seok Jin in line.

378
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,830
Don't you know that studious types
get into bigger trouble?

379
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,030
My goodness, look at you.

380
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,900
Seok Jin is such a catch.

381
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,470
To be honest,
no one truly measures up to Seok Jin.

382
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,500
He's well-educated,
attractive, an entrepreneur,

383
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,600
and an all-around great person.

384
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,770
And you know how tall he is.

385
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,840
The whole family
literally looks up to him.

386
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,780
He's so perfect in every way. My goodness.

387
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,980
I'll let you get back
to hanging up your clean laundry.

388
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,850
Oh, I'm tired.

389
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,260
Han Seo Woo.

390
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,660
Did you go to Seok Jin's grand opening?

391
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,760
What? Mom, how did you know?

392
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,530
Why would you go there?

393
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,440
What do you mean?
I went there as his neighbor.

394
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,670
You. Stay away from that family.

395
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,710
Don't give people
a reason to gossip about you!

396
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,540
Okay, I heard you.

397
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,120
Anyway, Mom, I thought Seok Jin...

398
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,220
was just a boring nerd.

399
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,520
But at the grand opening,
everyone kept praising him nonstop.

400
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,690
They all said
he was competent, smart, and diligent.

401
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,790
What do you think of him, Mom?

402
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,230
What do I think?

403
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,530
He grew up with such a rude mother.

404
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,570
That says it all.

405
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,500
Gosh, I wonder
who will be Hye Sook's daughter-in-law.

406
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,840
I already feel so bad for that girl.

407
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,780
Don't you agree? I wouldn't be surprised
if Hye Sook even made her starve.

408
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,880
Yes, it is Seok Jin's phone.

409
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,880
Hi, this is Seo Woo.

410
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,960
Ye Won, I'm here.

411
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,960
Hey, you're here. How did it go?

412
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,600
I made sure they wouldn't back out
of the verbal agreement again.

413
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,060
They're sticking to the contract.

414
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,730
That's good.

415
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,940
What's with that reaction?
Aren't you happy?

416
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,170
I have a lot to do. We'll talk more later.

417
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,690
Mom.

418
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,590
Are we poor now?

419
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,590
What do you mean?

420
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,560
Why are you asking if we're poor?

421
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,660
I overheard Dad talking
to his friend on the phone.

422
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,760
He said we had no money.

423
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,570
He asked his friend to lend us some money.

424
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,000
Is that why they put those red stickers
all over our house?

425
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,210
Is that why you cried so much?
Because you were upset?

426
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,240
Ji Woo, it's not that.

427
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,750
I'm sorry, Mom.

428
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,350
For what?

429
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,820
For pestering you
to buy me those photo cards.

430
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,060
I only did that out of curiosity...

431
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,660
because all my friends had them.

432
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,490
You probably thought I really wanted them.

433
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,460
Ji Woo.

434
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,930
I don't need them anymore.

435
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,740
I was curious at first,
but I'm not even interested anymore.

436
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,510
So, you don't need
to buy them for me, Mom.

437
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,910
No, it's okay to want them.

438
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
They're not even expensive.

439
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,280
I can definitely buy them for you.

440
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,750
No, I really don't need them.

441
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,490
I promise I won't pester you
to buy them for me again.

442
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,290
So, don't cry, Mom.

443
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Seeing you cry makes me sad.

444
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,030
I'm sorry, Ji Woo.

445
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,030
- No...
- Mom's so sorry.

446
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,440
No, Mom. I'm sorry.

447
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,140
I won't pester you again.

448
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,780
Please don't cry, Mom.

449
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,710
- Mom's sorry.
- Mom, don't cry.

450
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,180
I'm sorry
I couldn't buy them for you right away.

451
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,180
No, Mom.

452
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,890
You were worried about me?

453
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,990
I've never heard you say that before.

454
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,430
You weren't ever interested in me before.

455
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,270
You weren't curious
about anything I did either.

456
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,240
Whenever I did something,

457
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,570
you would scold me
and be really hard on me.

458
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,310
I've made so many mistakes.

459
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,650
What can I do
to make up for my past mistakes?

460
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,050
The quickest way
to get your identity back is...

461
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,760
by clearing your name first.

462
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,660
Yes.

463
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,800
That's right.
I have to recover my memory...

464
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,000
so I can clear my name
as soon as possible.

465
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,470
That way,
I can stand unashamed before my family.

466
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,400
But...

467
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,870
how am I going to recover my memory?

468
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,310
There must be some clues.

469
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
What?

470
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,530
What? This is...

471
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,800
Honey. Has your memory come back?

472
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,800
This.

473
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,070
Right. There must be...

474
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,040
something on this. I'm sure of it.

475
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,280
Mi Ja.

476
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,820
After you held my hand,

477
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,820
my life changed completely.

478
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,190
Happy birthday.

479
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,300
You, my darling.
On this day you were born,

480
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,130
I love you
and everything that surrounds you,

481
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,410
until the world ends.

482
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,530
What? Honey, what happened?

483
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,070
I remember.

484
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
What?

485
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,910
I...

486
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,350
I remember!

487
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,630
(Good Luck!)

488
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Where did that one sock go?

489
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,140
Seok Jin. What brings you here?

490
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Are you perhaps...

491
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,210
- Mom.
- If your kid says he's struggling...

492
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,480
because he doesn't have money,

493
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,610
will you help him out?

494
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,050
You must have a lot to think about.

495
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,620
My memory is back.

496
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
