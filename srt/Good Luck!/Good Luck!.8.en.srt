1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,970
Didn't you hear me?

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,580
What are you doing out here at night?

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,880
Nothing.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,850
Hey, don't give me that.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,950
I saw you squatting down here like this.

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,390
Hey, Dae Sik.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,260
Hey! Where are you going?

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,790
That's odd.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,300
What is this piece of paper
he's looking for?

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,570
What happened? Did you find it?

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,840
I swear, I put it here. Where did it go?

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,610
That's right.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,050
When we got home
after your birthday party...

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,350
We got home, and then what?

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,550
Maybe I threw it in the trash can?

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,990
The trash can?

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,530
My gosh. Why are you going through that?

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,570
I took the trash out earlier.

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,300
How could you throw it away?
Do you know how much...

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,540
My goodness!

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,340
- Oh, dear.
- Trash is meant to be thrown out.

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,670
Should I have held it tight in my arms?

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,110
What's with him today?

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,920
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,360
Oh, hello.

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,820
I'm looking for something.

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,190
You must've lost something important.

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,300
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
Another garbage truck
picked up a load earlier.

30
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,240
What do you mean
another truck picked up a load?

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,210
A garbage truck picks up a load at 9 p.m.

32
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,370
Really?

33
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,810
Then is your truck going
to the same place?

34
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,810
Yes.

35
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,110
Then let me help you.

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,280
What? A lottery ticket?

37
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,150
Just in case you missed it,

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,220
look through all the trash cans again.

39
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,620
What kind of lottery ticket is it
that you're doing this?

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,060
Just look for it.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,990
I must find it, no matter what! I must!

42
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,200
(Ha Eco Solutions)

43
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,990
Excuse me.

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,360
Where's the truck from Gahyeong-dong?

45
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,590
It looks like
they already dumped it over there.

46
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,460
Oh, boy.

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,640
No.

48
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,470
Oh, dear.

49
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,970
No...

50
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,050
What? The winning lottery ticket?

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,450
You mean, the piece of paper you lost...

52
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,920
was the winning lottery ticket?

53
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,990
But hold on.

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,490
How do you know
if it's the winning lottery ticket?

55
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,190
There's no way you chose the numbers...

56
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,960
that match
the construction completion date.

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,760
Mu Chul gave me that lottery ticket.

58
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,600
He said it was
the construction completion date.

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,800
He said he always chose those numbers
when buying lottery tickets.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Then...

61
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,340
are you sure that was where you put it?

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,370
Your jacket pocket.

63
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,010
Yes, I'm sure.

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,540
Oh, gosh.

65
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,450
Honey, what are you doing?

66
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,020
Well, I want to check just in case.

67
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,350
Maybe I put it someplace else.

68
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,590
Is it there?

69
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,390
No.

70
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,560
It could still be somewhere in the house.

71
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,660
It might've fallen out
when I was taking out the trash.

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,570
It's also possible
that I dropped it somewhere.

73
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,470
I'll search the living room.

74
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,000
You look through this room.

75
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
My gosh.

76
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,750
The prize is 35.7 million dollars.

77
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,080
Oh, dear.

78
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,570
Honey.

79
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,640
Hey, honey. How did it go?

80
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,780
I didn't find it.

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,150
You didn't either, right?

82
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,450
Honey.

83
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,350
- Where could it be?
- Honey.

84
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,090
- I'll keep looking.
- No, I'm fine.

85
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,560
- Just go to bed, okay?
- No.

86
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,880
This man never once bought me
a birthday present,

87
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,150
let alone a single flower
throughout our entire marriage.

88
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,680
Just because I wanted to have
a seven-dollar multigrain shake,

89
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,120
this guy insulted me
with all kinds of mean words.

90
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,320
And yet, he bought a lipstick
worth over 30 dollars...

91
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,990
for another wench?

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,090
I won't forgive you, ever.

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,450
Are you still a young man?

94
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,760
I took care of you when you were busy...

95
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,990
and raised our kids.

96
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,290
That has turned me
into a wrinkled old lady.

97
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,030
But after standing
on the back of your wife,

98
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,670
you're still young enough
to date someone at your age?

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,110
I want to get revenge.

100
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,810
I want to date another man
just to show you.

101
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,610
But who would love me now?

102
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,750
I have...

103
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,520
neither money nor youth.

104
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,870
Have a good day!

105
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,310
Have a good day.

106
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,150
Have a good day.

107
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,420
Hey, Ah Jin. What are you doing here?

108
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,720
Seok Jin.

109
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,730
So, you're delivering newspapers?

110
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Yes.

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,430
I want to do it and get some exercise
in the morning while at it.

112
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,500
You know this is a secret
from Mom and Dad, right?

113
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Ah Jin.

114
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,540
I'm trying to expedite the launch
of my online shopping mall.

115
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,910
Leave Mom and Dad's worries to me,

116
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,010
and you should just quit.

117
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,280
Going around this early in the morning
on your own is dangerous.

118
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,750
It's fine.

119
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,050
It's good for my health
to wake up early too.

120
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,690
Also,

121
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,460
Mom and Dad went through so much
for our sake.

122
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,060
I want to help them out in any way I can.

123
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,870
All right.

124
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,670
But tell me anytime
if it gets too hard, okay?

125
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,970
Okay.

126
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,670
By the way,

127
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,640
the house was a mess when I left earlier.

128
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,340
Did you see it?

129
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,650
I thought a thief broke in at first.

130
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,780
I know. It seemed like Mom and Dad
were looking for something last night.

131
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,120
Really? What were they looking for?

132
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,020
Well, I'm not sure either.

133
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,460
But they seemed really busy.
It must be important.

134
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,090
What could they be looking for?

135
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,800
Hey, give me some jam too.

136
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,440
Are you crazy?
It's not like you don't have hands.

137
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
Get it yourself!

138
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,870
You little... Hey, is it so hard
to give me something...

139
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,010
right in front of you?

140
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,540
Gosh, you're so gross!

141
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,410
You spat all over me!

142
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Oh, my. Give me some too.

143
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,220
Make me a piece of toast.

144
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,420
- You do it.
- What?

145
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
That little...

146
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,000
Sorry. There's no more bread.

147
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,500
Why, you...

148
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
What?

149
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,680
Mom, are you okay?

150
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,210
Mom, what about breakfast?
Should I get you something?

151
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,780
I'm not hungry.

152
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,550
Oh, my gosh! My hand!

153
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,790
- My hand. Oh, my.
- What's wrong, Dad?

154
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,420
- Did you get hurt?
- Oh, my hand.

155
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,790
Look at this. It hurts. Oh, gosh.

156
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,400
- What? That's blood!
- Oh, dear.

157
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,300
Gosh, how did you hurt yourself?
Did you cut yourself with a knife?

158
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,870
I was trying to open the can on the table!

159
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,840
Hey, is my finger still attached?

160
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,240
Yes, it's still attached. Don't worry.

161
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,840
Really? Oh, it's still there.

162
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,080
Gosh, it hurts so much.

163
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,450
Goodness, I can't feel it.

164
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,780
Call 911!

165
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,850
Call 911, kid!

166
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,890
I don't think we have to call 911.

167
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,160
You should just apply pressure
to stop the bleeding.

168
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,320
Seo Woo, hurry inside...

169
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,190
and bring a bandage and some ointment.

170
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,190
We don't have any bandages.

171
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,100
Then hurry on down to the pharmacy
and buy some, kid!

172
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,200
My gosh.

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,330
Hey, Seo Woo. Where are you going?

174
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,670
I'll go to my room and look for some.

175
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,970
My goodness.

176
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,010
Those brats.

177
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,040
Their dad is in so much pain.

178
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,740
How can they be so calm?

179
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,180
Dad isn't even that badly hurt.

180
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,410
Why is he making such a fuss?

181
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,850
Let me see. Where are the bandages?

182

(50 percent immediate loans)

184
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,830
Should I use this if nothing else works?

185
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,130
Darn, I can get started right away
if I just have the money.

186
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Hang on.
Why hasn't she called, by the way?

187
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,740
She doesn't even have that much money
in her bank account.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,900
Is she so scared of
dipping into her savings?

189
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,910
You've raised me all my life.

190
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
You can accept this much from me.

191
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,550
You've already done enough for us.

192
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,020
I've done enough?

193
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,950
What do you mean?

194
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,420
Right when you were born,

195
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,090
just watching you...

196
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,690
squirming about as a baby...

197
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,200
made me so happy. Did you know that?

198
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,300
That's what you meant to us.

199
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,770
We were grateful...

200
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,940
and happy...

201
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,470
just to have you with us.

202
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,310
Dad.

(Jackpot Chicken)

204
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,610
Your mom told me this.

205
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,880
When you were three years old,

206
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,180
you already did a lifetime's worth
of filial duty.

207
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,390
So, you keep this.

208
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,260
You saved up this much
by pinching every penny.

209
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,390
You should use it well when you need it.

210
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Okay.

211
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,900
I will.

212
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,770
All right.

213
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,940
I'm going to the market.

214
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,250
I'll be back, Ah Jin.

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,790
Hey.

217
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,760
Hey!

218
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,830
What happened?

219
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,630
Will you lend me the money or not?

220
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you avoiding me right now?

221
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,470
Oh, you're just going to ignore me
and act dumb now?

222
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,470
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,980
I'm not in the mood
to talk about that now.

224
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,740
I'll be in touch.

(Number One Real Estate)

226
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,510
Hey.

227
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,380
Are you shameless...

228
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,980
or just plain rude?

229
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,550
Tell me honestly.

230
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,890
You're trying to play tricks
so you won't have to pay me back.

231
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,160
It's not like that.

232
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,060
As if it's not.

233
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,590
At first,
you asked me to reduce your debt,

234
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,330
but you're just trying
to get away with it now.

235
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,400
Do you think I don't know?

236
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,970
There are always people like you.

237
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,730
They're completely fine
with causing harm to others,

238
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,240
but they refuse to take any losses.
How selfish...

239
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,470
I'm asking you to wait a little.

240
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,440
Who says I won't pay you back?

241
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,910
I'll pay you back! I will!

242
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,010
I'll pay you back, no matter what.
So, please...

243
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,880
Just stop this.

244
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,550
Wait, who does she think...

245
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,260
she's yelling at right now?

246
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,130
Gosh, where on earth did it go?

247
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,770
What's wrong, Mom?

248
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,830
What are you looking for?

249
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,640
You've been looking for something
since last night.

250
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,440
Hey, Seok Jin. Did you perhaps...

251
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,610
Oh, never mind.

252
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,340
What is this about?

253
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,610
No, you can get going.

254
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,050
Yes, hello.

255
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,690
Oh, you mean now?

256
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,190
Get going.

257
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,230
I'm a little busy right now.

258
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,930
Okay, I understand.

259
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,300
Gosh, why does he want me
to come and see a house now?

260
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,910
Things are a mess already as it is.

261
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,980
Hey, wait.

262
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,350
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,220
If I've done anything wrong
up to this point,

264
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,750
please forgive me.

265
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,760
What are you doing?

266
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,330
Well, can you please help me...

267
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,830
so that Tae Hyung will like me?

268
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,100
- Pardon?
- I mean,

269
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,230
please talk me up to Tae Hyung, okay?

270
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,270
Please.

271
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,710
I'm begging you, neighbor.

272
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,910
Hey!

273
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Do you like it?

274
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,450
Thank you for letting me use this office.

275
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,790
Don't get me wrong.

276
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,360
There may not be a security deposit,
but you'll have to pay rent.

277
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,030
Do your best.

278
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,860
Let me ride on my smart buddy's coattails.

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,100
Thanks, Tae Hyung.

280
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,840
By the way, what exactly is going on
between you and Seo Woo?

281
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,970
Seo Woo? Well...

282
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,810
I'd say we're casually seeing each other.

283
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,340
You know what?

284
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,350
Seo Woo is the hottest girl I know.

285
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,680
- What?
- She has a hot body.

286
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,350
And she has a pretty face.

287
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,320
She's kind of dumb,

288
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,120
but I feel proud
when I have her standing next to me.

289
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
You know what I mean, right?

290
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,960
Yes, I guess.

291
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,230
Anyway, why do you ask?

292
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,130
I was just curious.

293
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,770
Goodness.

294
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,080
Oh, boy.

295
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,360
Hey, is this a cave
or an underground bunker?

296
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,530
You should've told me
about the state it was in.

297
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
I took the time to find something for you.
Must you pick on me?

298
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,900
Long-term lease properties
that match the budget are rare.

299
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,100
Whatever. Find something else.

300
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,500
Hold on. I wonder if she left already.

301
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,080
Then find yourself a different realtor.

302
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,180
Although, I doubt you'll find anyone...

303
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,110
who's willing to work
with Number One Real Estate.

304
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,180
Hold on.

305
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,550
What does that mean?

306
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,550
Don't you know?

307
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,060
All the other realtors in the area
want nothing to do with you...

308
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,090
because Han Mu Chul
exclusively works with you.

309
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,060
Oh, that's why they always say...

310
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,200
they have no listings
or that they're too busy...

311
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,100
whenever I call them.

312
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,800
Do you think
I want to work with Han Mu Chul?

313
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,210
He pays me peanuts for my commission.

314
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,810
You greedy ingrate.

315
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,210
How could you say that,
knowing how many buildings he owns?

316
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,910
So?

317
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,710
Is it nice to work as his butler?

318
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,250
What? Butler?

319
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,720
Don't play dumb.

320
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,760
Everyone knows
you got that exclusive deal...

321
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,160
in exchange for doing Han's dirty work.

322
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,890
I hear you do all sorts of things for him.

323
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,290
You even wash his car
and hang wallpaper for him.

324
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,130
- Hey!
- Goodness.

325
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,230
Han Mu Chul is my friend!

326
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,300
- Friend?
- That's right!

327
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
We've been friends for 40 years.

328
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,540
Friends can help each other out.

329
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,340
What? "Butler?"

330
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,180
Who said such a ridiculous thing?
I'll teach them a lesson!

331
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,050
Well, anyway,

332
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,650
I went through hoops to find this,
so you do whatever you want.

333
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,550
Do they have no conscience?

334
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,150
How could they even hope...

335
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,320
to sign a long-term lease
on such a tight budget?

336
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,760
They should find a month-to-month rental.

337
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,790
Even if you keep looking,

338
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,390
you won't find a better place than this.

339
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,400
Goodness.

340
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,330
Oh, sorry.

341
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,770
Is this the place?

342
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,010
Yes, well...

343
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,340
It is, but...

344
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,130
Well, I'm sorry.

345
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,400
I should've asked for more info
before I called you.

346
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,900
That realtor kept saying he was sure...

347
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,600
it'd be rented out soon.

348
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,340
No, thank you
for keeping an eye out for us.

349
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,080
I'll call you when I find a better place.

350
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Just wait a little.

351
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,950
I'm sure something better will come along.

352
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Okay.

353
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,490
Darling!

354
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
What?

355
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,330
What's going on?

356
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,360
(Typhoon Invest Group)

357
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,730
Why are you here?

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,700
Mr. Jang said something had come up
and sent me here.

359
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,600
Did you wait long?

360
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,270
Even so,

361
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,140
why did he send you?
He could've just called me.

362
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,780
He said you didn't pick up.

363
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,980
I didn't pick up? As if.

364
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,920
(5 missed calls from Mr. Jang)

365
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,560
Well...

366
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,190
Goodness.

367
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,060
What? You're leaving?

368
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,460
Come on.
Let's hang out for a bit, darling.

369
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,730
- Hey!
- My gosh. What's wrong?

370
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,500
- This...
- Oh, no.

371
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,240
What happened to your hand?

372
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,610
Did you hurt your hand?

373
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,690
Hey, that's...

374
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
I said I could do it myself.

375
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,890
Come on. How? You hurt your finger.

376
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,230
Just stay still.

377
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,270
I got this.

378
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,040
Anyway, how did this happen?

379
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,070
It must've really hurt.

380
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,180
"It must've really hurt?"

381
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,680
Don't you live with your family?

382
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,450
You should've put on a bandage, at least.

383
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,750
Why would you walk around like this?
This makes me upset.

384
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,850
There, it's done.

385
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,390
Be careful from now on.

386
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,830
It breaks my heart
to see these things happen to you.

387
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm the one who's hurt.

388
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,670
Why would it break your heart?

389
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
Are you asking because you don't know?

390
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,600
Do you really not know...

391
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,240
why it'd break my heart, darling?

392
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
My goodness, stop.

393
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,620
- What?
- Oh, no.

394
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,290
What is this?

395
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,290
A lipstick?

396
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,330
Why do you carry this around?

397
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,030
- Throw it away.
- What?

398
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,930
I don't need it anymore,
so just throw it away.

399
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,330
- Then can I have this?
- What?

400
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,900
It'd be such a waste to throw this away.
It looks new.

401
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,870
Can't I just use it?

402
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,540
Sure, whatever.

403
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,850
Really? Thanks, darling!

404
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,890
Hey!

405
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,460
My gosh.

406
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,860
Darling, thanks for this lipstick!

407
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,070
I came out of the house,
but I have nowhere to go.

408
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,340
And I have no money to spend.

409
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,210
Isn't that Hye Sook?

410
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
How come she looks so down?

411
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,950
Goodness. Did her husband upset her too?

412
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Honey.

413
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,690
What's wrong, honey?
Are you not feeling well?

414
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,130
Look at me.

415
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,100
See?

416
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,770
I knew it.

417
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,970
I bet they fought last night too.

418
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,910
Right, we all deal
with similar problems in life.

419
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,110
I should grab a drink with Hye Sook soon.

420
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,910
Honey, how come you look so pale? Hold on.

421
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,920
You don't have a fever.

422
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,250
Did you catch the flu?

423
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,950
This is not good.

424
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,420
Let's take you home. Come on.

425
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,230
My goodness.

426
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,460
- My gosh.
- Honey, watch your step.

427
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,770
This won't do. Lean on my shoulder. Good.

428
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,500
- Come on.
- Gosh, how embarrassing.

429
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,110
What are they doing,
hugging each other on the street?

430
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,270
I can't believe this.

431
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,510
(Jackpot Chicken)

432
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,450
Tell me.

433
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,980
What happened?

434
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,020
Did you see the place?

435
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,650
Did something happen there?

436
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,660
Honey, what's wrong?

437
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,630
I don't want to move.

438
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,400
They said we could only get...

439
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,710
a one-bedroom apartment
with no windows with our budget.

440
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,870
How are we going to live...

441
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,780
in a moldy basement apartment...

442
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,210
with our adult children at our age?

443
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,180
I don't want to do that.

444
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,980
I really don't want to move.

445
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,360
If only we had that lottery ticket,

446
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,360
we wouldn't have to move.

447
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,830
My gosh. They say
bad things always happen at once.

448
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,500
I can't believe this.
It's not even a small amount of money.

449
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,730
How could we lose our chance
to get 35 million dollars?

450
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,540
Welcome.

451
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,610
Oh, Dae Sik.
What brings you here at this hour?

452
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,680
Did you come alone?

453
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,080
I'll have a beer.

454
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,420
Okay, sure.

455
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,160
Oh, boy.

456
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,400
I always make my wife cry.

457
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,630
You're so pathetic, Kim Dae Sik.

458
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,500
All right, Dae Sik.

459
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,140
- Here's your beer.
- Thanks.

460
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,880
My goodness. What's going on, Dae Sik?

461
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,120
Why would you gulp it down
without even taking your jacket off?

462
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,250
Give me your jacket. I'll hang it for you.

463
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,990
No, it's fine.

464
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,330
(Jackpot Chicken)

465
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,330
What?

466
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,930
What are you doing down there?

467
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,030
Oh, your jacket fell down.

468
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,810
That's right. My jacket.

469
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,040
Then, did Mu Chul perhaps...

470
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,250
What is this?

471
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Here.

472
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,400
Hey, Dae Sik.

473
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,400
Dae Sik, where are you going?

474
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,870
- Oh, hello.
- Hey.

475
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,380
Yes, hi.

476
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,780
Have you been well?

477
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
Yes.

478
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,220
Are your parents home?

479
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,550
No, they're not home yet.

480
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,320
Mom called and said she'd be home late.

481
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,820
Did you come to see my dad?

482
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
What?

483
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,460
Oh, yes.

484
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,190
Right. Then, will you wait here?

485
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,130
I have stuff to do. I'll be in my room.

486
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,630
Okay. Go in and rest.

487
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,700
It should be here.

488
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,610
(Jackpot Chicken)

489
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
What?

490
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,640
Are you going somewhere?

491
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,880
Yes, this jacket.

492
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,010
This was what he wore that day.

493
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,280
Is it in his pocket?

494
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,130
Wait, no.

495
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,130
No.

496
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,430
I shouldn't do this
when he's not even home.

497
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,770
I'll ask him when he gets here.

498
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,770
Wait.

499
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,740
What if he lies and says he never took it?

500
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,210
He's definitely capable of such a thing.

501
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,710
Right.

502
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,420
I'll just check to see if it's here.

503
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,490
What are you doing here?

504
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,320
Hey.

505
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,090
Why are you in my room?

506
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
What...

507
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,380
(Good Luck!)

508
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,280
Is that lipstick limited edition
or something?

509
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,080
- What?
- She can't be the only one to have it.

510
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,550
I've never been to a place like this.

511
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,520
- I'm a little nervous.
- Let's go.

512
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,090
Now, we're business partners
who have a contract.

513
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,260
Let's be friends.

514
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,230
I had the lottery ticket.

515
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,300
Thirty million...

516
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,770
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
