1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,170
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,880
(Episode 56)

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,910
I'm done with the kitchen.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,020
Shall I take a look at the bathroom?

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,150
Let's wash the rag.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,720
Oh, boy.

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,180
I guess he left early
in hopes of moving in with that woman.

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,650
Han Mu Chul.

9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,250
You're out of my life for good now!

10
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,590
What? Why isn't he here?

11
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Mom.

12
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,100
Mom!

13
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,130
Yes, what is it?

14
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,670
Dad isn't here.
His blankets don't look slept in either.

15
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,040
Do you think
he didn't come home last night?

16
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,010
He often goes to work out in the morning.
He must've gone out for that.

17
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,110
But he packed all his stuff yesterday
for his move.

18
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,580
How could he have gone to work out?

19
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,750
What if something has happened to him?

20
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,650
Could that be why he didn't come home?

21
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,490
Who cares
if something has happened or not?

22
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,090
But...

23
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,820
My gosh.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,860
I can't even call him
since he doesn't have a phone.

25
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,030
Mom, I'll go outside and check first.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Is he even staying out all night now?

27
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,380
Oh, hello.

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,310
Hey, Tae Ha. Where are you going
this early in the morning?

29
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,880
By any chance, did my dad mention...

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,480
going somewhere after work yesterday?

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,220
No, he said he was moving today,

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,220
so he just asked for a day off.
Why do you ask?

33
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,460
Then, could you tell me
where my dad is moving to?

34
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,540
Oh, man.

35
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,570
Dae Sik?

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,710
Hey, what's up?

37
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,150
Mu Chul's new address?

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,750
Okay, I'll text it to you.

39
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,890
Why is he asking for Mu Chul's address
all of a sudden?

40
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,690
Oh, boy.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,860
Hey, Ah Jin.

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,800
Do you still deliver newspapers?

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,370
Yes, but I said I'd quit after today.

44
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,070
Is that so? But why?

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,770
I'm going inside.

46
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,770
Ah Jin.

47
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,610
Come and have a seat for a minute.

48
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,250
Won't you tell me...

49
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,550
what's going on?

50
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,350
Actually,

51
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,890
I've decided to take over Buddumak.

52
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,990
The owner said
he was going to close the restaurant.

53
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,560
Is that right?

54
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,730
Then, are you taking over the business...

55
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,830
with the 30,000 dollars
you tried to give me before?

56
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,840
No, not that.

57
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,840
Seok Jin helped me out.

58
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,770
Seok Jin?

59
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,810
Yes. You wouldn't understand, Dad.

60
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,720
Giving away a big sum of money
for your family.

61
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,990
That's something
you can't understand at the moment.

62
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,060
Right, I also know...

63
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,360
that I caused you guys a lot of pain.

64
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,760
But you know, Ah Jin...

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,260
It's okay.

66
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,370
I'm not interested
in the lottery winnings.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,770
That money belongs to you and Mom, not me.

68
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,310
Honestly, I was a bit upset at first too,

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,010
but when I told myself
that money wasn't mine,

70
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,310
it didn't bother me anymore.

71
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,780
So,

72
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,490
you don't have to mind me at all.

73
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,920
I've done it so far,
and I will keep doing it in the future.

74
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,990
I am going to make it on my own for sure.

75
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,060
All right. Thank you.

76
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,000
You're so impressive, my daughter.

77
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,540
But Dad,

78
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,870
Mom isn't like me.

79
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,510
You've spent years earning money...

80
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,610
and overcoming hardships together.

81
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,750
If you act so heartlessly
because you won a lot of money,

82
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,720
Mom would be so upset.

83
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,150
I don't think that's right.

84
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,620
So,

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,030
be sure to make Mom feel better this time.

86
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,930
Please do it for me.

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,900
I'll head inside.

88
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,830
Yes, okay.

89
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,510
Oh, dear.

90
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,850
Where is it?

91
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,720
(Sun Apartment Unit 201,
32 Daewoon-ro, Sujeong-gu, Seoul)

92
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,450
Oh, here it is.

93
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,290
Dad.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Dad!

95
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,300
Dad!

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
Dad!

97
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,370
Are you okay?

98
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,640
Oh, my back.

99
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,040
My back hurts so much.

100
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,550
Hello?

101
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
Is this 911?

102
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,530
Are you okay, Dad?

103
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Gosh, what's taking them so long?

104
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,770
So, this is Mr. Han Mu Chul, right?

105
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,170
And his birthday is January 8, 1965?

106
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,740
Yes, please hurry up and help him.
He's in so much pain right now.

107
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,140
That's strange.

108
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,810
It says he's dead.

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,810
So, he has lost his health insurance too.

110
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,290
You didn't know the last seven digits
of his resident ID number,

111
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,520
so I checked through
your family's health insurance records.

112
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,330
The records say that your dad is dead.

113
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,930
Well, the thing is,

114
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,500
it's a long story,
but I'll explain it to you later.

115
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,200
Can't you just treat him first?
He's in so much pain.

116
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,300
Well...

117
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,770
Okay, then. One moment.

118
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,180
Don't worry, Dad. I'm sure you'll be able
to get some X-rays taken.

119
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
Okay.

120
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,950
(Police)

121
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,390
Darn it. What do we do?

122
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,720
- Dad, let's go.
- What?

123
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,860
There's a police officer over there.
I think he's about to come over here.

124
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,290
- A police officer?
- Yes.

125
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,460
- Okay.
- Let's go.

126
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,700
Watch out.

127
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
Gently.

128
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,970
Be gentle.

129
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
Slowly.

130
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
Be gentle.

131
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,690
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,090
Dad, will you be okay
if we leave before you see a doctor?

133
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,190
Tae Ha.

134
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,300
Because of me,

135
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,630
you're going through so much.

136
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,630
It's fine.

137
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,770
I want to be a good dad,
but it's not that easy.

138
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,780
I feel bad about what happened today too.

139
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
I'm...

140
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,250
really sorry.

141
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,160
Fine. I'm a fool
who doesn't know his own place.

142
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,000
I may be a fool
who acted up and got scammed...

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,130
when I was nothing
but a simple-minded and jobless bum,

144
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,200
but I at least know
how to feel bad for my family...

145
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,570
in case I break their hearts
with my own mistakes.

146
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,910
But what about you, Dad?

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,110
You were scammed,
and your family is going through all this.

148
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,050
Have you ever once apologized to us?

149
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,320
Dad, put your weight on me.

150
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,550
- I'll go slowly.
- Okay.

151
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,500
Mom! Seo Woo! Mom!

152
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,630
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hold on.

153
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,970
Tae Ha! What's wrong with Dad?

154
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,170
Oh, my! Tae Ha, what's going on?
What's wrong with your dad?

155
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,610
Let's go inside and talk.

156
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,510
- Yes, go inside.
- Oh, it hurts!

157
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,350
- Dad, are you okay?
- Be careful.

158
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,350
My gosh.

159
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,150
Watch out.

160
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
- Oh, dear.
- Come on.

161
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,650
- Be careful.
- My goodness.

162
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,690
Oh, no.

163
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,750
Put this over him.

164
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,720
- My goodness.
- It really hurts.

165
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,730
Here, Dad.

166
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,230
He fell while moving his things
by himself?

167
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,700
Weren't you going to help him move?

168
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,840
I was,

169
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,010
but I guess he just wanted
to get it done last night.

170
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,240
So, how badly was he hurt?

171
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,740
I think he hurt his back and arm,

172
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,480
so we went to the hospital,

173
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,850
but we just ran out
before he could see a doctor.

174
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,980
You went to the hospital?

175
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,620
Yes, but we just ran out
because a police officer was there.

176
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Oh, dear.

177
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,260
Dad will be okay, right?

178
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,330
You don't think he hurt his head
like last time, do you?

179
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,030
I'm sure he's fine.

180
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,200
Anyway, you should go and get some rest.

181
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
You've been through so much.

182
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,370
No, I'll just go to work.

183
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,940
I don't think
he'll be able to move out anyway.

184
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,010
Call me if you need anything.

185
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,310
Okay.

186
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Mom, what will Dad do now?

187
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,480
Is it okay for him to just lie there
without any treatment?

188
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,380
My gosh.

189
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,790
Seriously.

190
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,330
Why did you go there
and get yourself into this mess?

191
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,730
I went there to clean the place
before the move.

192
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,630
I didn't know the floor was wet.

193
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,240
I stepped in the water and slipped.

194
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,570
Why?

195
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,140
I guess that woman
won't clean your new place for you?

196
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,110
Sorry? What do you mean?

197
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,610
If you have any painkillers,
can you give me some?

198
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,250
I need to take painkillers.
It hurts too much.

199
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,190
You're never any help.

200
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,360
I thought
I wouldn't have to see you again.

201
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,090
Darn it.

202
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
Gosh, my back...

203
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
All right.

204
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,820
Hey, don't you see
any of your friends around?

205
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,060
Your friends should be here to see this.

206
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,190
Is your homeroom teacher here?

207
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,530
Should we drive around the school
and come back when your teacher is here?

208
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,660
Forget it.

209
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,070
You didn't show up when you were told to.

210
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,530
You can't meet my teacher
whenever it suits you.

211
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,970
I didn't show up when I was told to?
What do you mean?

212
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,770
Forget it. I can't talk to you.

213
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,610
You brat. Why are you so cranky
first thing in the morning?

214
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,340
Despite how busy I am,
I still gave you a ride.

215
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,710
Like I even asked you for a ride.

216
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,810
I never asked you to do this.

217
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,150
- Darn it.
- What?

218
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,420
- That punk!
- No, Gyu Tae.

219
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,050
Don't get worked up.
It's still very early.

220
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,150
That's enough. Let's go.

221
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,420
That brat thinks I'm a joke
because I've been too nice to him.

222
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,460
Oh, hi. I'm Min Yong's dad.

223
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
He's in 11th grade.

224
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,900
(Jeongram High School)

225
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,430
Anyway, my son goes here.

226
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,530
I'm Min Yong's dad.

227
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,870
Cool car, right?

228
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,270
(Number One Real Estate)

229
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,910
Gosh, seriously.

230
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,880
That brat doesn't even understand
why his father wanted to do that for him.

231
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,650
Goodness.

232
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,620
Anyway, the investment
Mrs. Taylor mentioned.

233
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,320
I'm interested too.

234
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,590
Should I ask him about it?

235
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,370
Oh, Mr. Jang.

236
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,680
I've been meaning to buy you a meal.

237
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,880
Thank you
for making the time to meet with me.

238
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,220
My pleasure. Anyway,

239
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,150
you're amazing at finding information.

240
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,190
How did you find out about the new town
they're building in Baeheung...

241
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,420
and already manage to invest?

242
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,660
Oh, please. I'm not amazing by any means.

243
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,200
I guess I just lucked out.

244
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,640
But I have to say,
the timing's not so ideal.

245
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,570
If you invest pre-construction,

246
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,540
you should expect to wait
about ten years before getting a return.

247
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,180
Right, that's true.

248
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,550
Oh, that reminds me.
Mrs. Taylor told me...

249
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,020
you were working
on an important new business.

250
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,820
Yes, that's right.

251
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,690
You know what a hedge fund is, right?

252
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,760
Yes, I sure do.

253
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:19,830
Well, my cousin is
a hedge fund hotshot in the US.

254
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,230
He's close friends
with the Director of the CIA,

255
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,570
the Deputy Director of the FBI,

256
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,170
and even a gang boss in New York.

257
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,110
He has access to all kinds of information
about the US capital markets.

258
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,750
Anyway, my cousin
recently started investing in something,

259
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,310
so I gathered a group of investors.

260
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,220
Is that right?

261
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,390
But there's no point
in explaining all this now.

262
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,830
With Mrs. Taylor on board,
we're done finding new investors.

263
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,790
What? Already?

264
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,160
The truth is, a lot of people want in.

265
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,230
But as you probably already know,

266
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,600
private equity funds
are only open to a select few.

267
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,770
You have to be in the inner circle
to get involved.

268
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,740
However wealthy you may be,

269
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,650
you need an invitation to take part.

270
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,180
What's the point in telling you...

271
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,780
about an investment opportunity
that's already closed?

272
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,350
Let's just eat.

273
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,250
Sure, but...

274
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,590
A hedge fund hotshot?
This is an incredible opportunity.

275
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,630
Can't he get me in too?

276
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,230
This sounds a hundred times more lucrative
than the new town in Baeheung.

277
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,000
That woman looked familiar.

278
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,340
I swear, I've seen her somewhere before.

279
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,380
Who is she?

280
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,810
By any chance, do you know
where Mr. Han Mu Chul lives?

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,150
(Number One Real Estate, Jackpot Chicken)

282
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,220
What? Han Mu Chul?

283
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,920
Yes, she's that woman.

284
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,890
The woman who was looking for Mu Chul.

(Number One Real Estate)

286
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,000
Excuse me, hello.

287
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Sorry?

288
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,970
Oh, hello.

289
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,280
Don't you remember me?

290
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,180
I saw you
at Number One Real Estate yesterday.

291
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,250
Right, you brought coffee.

292
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,920
Yes, that's right.

293
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,190
Are you here to see Gyu Tae again?

294
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,520
"Gyu Tae?"

295
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,430
The owner of this place
and I are close friends,

297
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,400
so I did that out of habit.

298
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,370
Did Mr. Choi go somewhere?
The door is locked.

299
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,110
I'm not sure,
but he's been stepping out often.

300
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,940
If you leave your number, I'll pass it on.

301
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,910
No, it's fine. I have his number.

302
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,150
I'm off.

303
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,280
Wait.

304
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,050
Yes?

305
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,450
Well, aren't you the lady...

306
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,260
who asked me about Mr. Han Mu Chul
a while ago?

307
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,560
Sorry? Me?

308
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,970
A while ago, you asked me
if I knew where he lived.

309
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,070
Don't you remember?

310
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,740
No, I don't recall that.

311
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,970
Aren't you confusing me with someone else?

312
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,710
No, I'm not.

313
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,640
That day, you asked me
about Mr. Han over there.

314
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,280
You were shocked when I told you he died.

315
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,050
I'm sorry. I don't remember that.

316
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,620
Anyway, have a good day.

317
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,250
What?

318
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,690
That's strange.

319
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,990
I swear, it was her.

320
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,630
Why does she keep denying it?

321
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Goodness.

322
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,100
You can't suddenly break
your contract like this.

323
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,600
Sir. Hello?

324
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,170
Hello?

325
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,140
Is the pear farm trying
to back out of the contract?

326
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,240
They wanted to raise their price,
claiming their pears were premium quality,

327
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,180
but we didn't accept it.
I guess that's why.

328
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,780
And rumor has it they might sign...

329
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,610
an exclusive contract
with a department store.

330
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,310
I'll talk to them.

331
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,350
Don't bother. They won't budge.

332
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,920
Then I guess I have no choice
but to go there myself.

333
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,390
The farm is in Naju. It'll take
ten hours to get there and back.

334
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,360
Why don't we just...

335
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,290
try contacting
the other farms on our list?

336
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,130
It was the only farm
that met all our conditions.

337
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,030
We can't sell pears that don't meet
the quality standards we stand by...

338
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,830
just because we're pressed for time.

339
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,940
Yes, you're right.

340
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,800
Then let's go together.

341
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,770
- All right.
- Yes.

342
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,480
Hold on.

343
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,580
Hello, sir.

344
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,180
Really?

345
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,950
Thank you. Yes, we'll visit you soon.

346
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,420
That was the owner
of Gaseong Meat Company.

347
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
He wants to sign the contract.

348
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,360
Really? That's great.

349
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,430
You should hurry over there, then.
I'll go alone.

350
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,260
- Okay, drive safe.
- Yes.

351
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,460
Call me when you get there.

352
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,630
- Will do.
- All right.

353
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,270
Hello.

354
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

355
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,980
Hello, it's been a while.

356
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,210
Yes, hello.

357
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,050
Did Seok Jin step out?

358
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,320
He just left for a business trip.

359
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,380
A business trip?

360
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I see. When will he be back?

361
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,790
He'll spend the night there
and come back tomorrow.

362
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,760
What? Where did he go
that he can't come back today?

363
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,960
He went to Naju in South Jeolla Province.

364
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,500
What about Ms. Park Ye Won?
Don't tell me they went together.

365
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,300
Ms. Park went on the business trip too.

366
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,640
What? They went there together?

367
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,150
My gosh. What should I do?

368
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,080
He and Ye Won
went on a business trip alone?

369
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,660
Why do I have to cook for that man?

370
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,770
There's a police officer over there.

371
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,010
- I think he's about to come over here.
- A police officer?

372
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,580
Did you forget that you can't go
to the police right now?

373
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,950
Your death has been registered,

374
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,580
so you're no longer alive
in the government's eyes. Did you forget?

375
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,080
Oh, right.

376
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,290
What if you go to the police station...

377
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,890
and they try to look you up in the system?

378
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Have some food.

379
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Okay.

380
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,780
My gosh, I can't get up.

381
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,940
Goodness.

382
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,350
It hurts. Be gentle, please.

383
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,630
Left hand.

384
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,430
What? My left hand?

385
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,870
So,

386
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,440
when do you plan on moving out?

387
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,210
If you think
you're going to keep staying here...

388
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,680
just because you hurt yourself,

389
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,750
don't even dream of it.

390
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,410
I have no intention of taking care of you.

391
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,250
So, hire a caregiver or something.

392
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,950
Move out of this house
as soon as possible. Got it?

393
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,790
Hey, so...

394
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,790
I have a favor to ask.

395
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,360
(Closed today due to personal reasons,
Thank you for visiting Buddumak.)

396
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,400
(Buddumak Korean Cuisine)

397
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,370
(We are closed.)

398
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,210
I said you didn't have to come.
Why are you here?

399
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,840
You should've just taken the day off.

400
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,880
Well, the move was canceled,

401
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
so I thought I'd come in.

402
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,320
By the way, are you really going to
renovate the whole place on your own?

403
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,150
I should save money whenever I can.

404
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,420
By the way,
why was your dad's move canceled?

405
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,590
Dad fell while cleaning his new house,

406
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,530
so he hurt himself.

407
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,800
How badly was he hurt?

408
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm not exactly sure either.

409
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,630
We went to the hospital,
but he's listed as a deceased person,

410
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,970
so he couldn't get any treatment.

411
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,910
But...

412
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,310
as I was bringing my dad home,

413
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,810
I felt rather strange.

414
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,950
I felt bad for him and pitied him.

415
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,750
I get it. He couldn't even get treatment
when he was hurt.

416
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,190
That too,

417
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,020
but my dad apologized to me
for the first time.

418
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,890
Even when our family was ruined
because of his wrongdoings,

419
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,760
which put the whole family
through hardship,

420
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,500
he never once said he was sorry.

421
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,300
But he apologized to me.

422
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,840
To be honest,
I wasn't really sure about it at first,

423
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,180
but he really has changed so much.

424
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,810
That's why I felt kind of strange.

425
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,850
Gosh, what am I saying?

426
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,650
Hey, we've done a lot of work.
Shall we take a break?

427
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,890
Wait just a little.
I'll go and buy us some coffee.

428
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,630
Coffee?

429
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,560
You bought me coffee
when I was feeling down too.

430
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,300
Today, it's on me.

431
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,100
No, you can rest. I'll go and get them.

432
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,040
- What?
- I'll get them.

433
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
But...

434
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,410
What are you doing?
Why are you packing all of a sudden?

435
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,250
I should go now.
I can't stay here forever.

436
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,780
No, you can't.

437
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
Come on.

438
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,350
Hey, I'm not such a shameless person.

439
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,890
How can I stay here longer?
I wouldn't be able to face Ms. Park.

440
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,220
But I told you it was fine.

441
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,890
Mother even asked me to look after you...

442
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,030
so that you wouldn't feel uncomfortable.

443
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,900
So, just stay here.

444
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,970
My goodness.

445
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,440
Hey, Mi Jin.
Isn't your dad being too mean?

446
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,580
How could he not even call me
after I left home like that?

447
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,280
I ran away from home for the first time
after spending decades with him.

448
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,680
How can he be so indifferent?

449
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,720
Someone must be here.

450
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,320
Is it Dad?

451
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,590
Come on. How would your dad know
that I'm here?

452
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,900
Seok Jin told Dad that you were here.

453
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
I'll go and see.

454
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,540
Hey, who is it?

455
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,970
Is this Ms. Park Bok Ja's house?

456
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,670
Who are you?

457
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,080
We're from the courthouse.

458
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,010
This is a foreclosure notice.

459
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,980
Ms. Park's loans are in default.

460
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,680
We will be seizing the tangible movables
in this house.

461
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,950
You're seizing our things?

462
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,550
Seizing their things?
What are you talking about?

463
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,760
These items will be put up for auction
in three weeks.

464
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,090
If you remove these stickers before then,

465
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,860
you may be punished under the law.

466
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,330
Wait, but...

467
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,660
- Oh, my!
- One second.

468
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,500
- No!
- No, just a second. My child is here too.

469
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,040
- Please stop!
- Can't you do this later?

470
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,900
- Please?
- Dad, what's going on?

471
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,540
- But...
- Why are you doing this?

472
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,910
- Ji Woo, come here.
- What do we do?

473
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,940
What do you think you're doing
in someone else's house?

474
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,810
Gosh, seriously?

475
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,380
- Goodness, Ms. Park.
- Oh, my.

476
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,650
- Ms. Park, hang in there.
- No...

477
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,920
- My gosh.
- It's okay.

478
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,260
Gosh, Ji Woo, don't cry.

479

(Jackpot Chicken)

480
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,470
Be sure to make Mom feel better this time.

481
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,310
Please do it for me.

482
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380

(Nara Bank)

484
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,460
- Hello?
- Hello.

485
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,360
This is the branch manager of Nara Bank.

486
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,160
Hello, how can I help you?

487
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,100
I heard from my employee...

488
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,930
that you decided to withdraw
all of your funds from our bank.

489
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,640
Yes, I plan to do so.

490
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,210
So, there's something
I'd like to tell you.

491
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,910
If it's not too much to ask,
may I pay you a visit?

492
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,410
Visit me here?

493
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,180
I don't think that would work.

494
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,420
Then, how about we meet somewhere nearby?

495
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,060
I will come to you.

496
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,960
No, I'll come to the bank. Yes.

497
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Yes, I'll see you later.

498
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,430
I'm sorry, sir.

499
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,300
The branch manager's meeting
is running long.

500
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,070
Please wait in the lounge.
I will come and get you.

501
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,170
(Nara Bank)

502
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,040
Gosh, what a shame.

503
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,150
If only I had known about it earlier,

504
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,150
I could've joined in.

505
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,380
Pardon? What do you mean?

506
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,790
Oh, it's nothing.

507
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,120
Let's go to the bank.
I have some business there.

508
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,160
By the way,
you haven't seen the VIP lounge, have you?

509
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,730
Of course not.
When would I ever get to go there?

510
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,700
Why? Are you going to go there today?

511
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,740
Go on.
I'll show you something amazing today.

512
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
Gosh, the VIP lounge.

513
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,140
Oh, my.

514
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,640
Hey, act naturally.

515
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,780
- Don't act like such a newbie.
- Oh, right.

516
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,820
- Nice.
- Yes.

517
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,490
This way, sir.

518
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,160
Gosh, he's a very important client.

519
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,330
My goodness. The branch manager
is greeting that man in person.

520
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,800
He must have a lot of money.

521
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,630
Sir.

522
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,970
Yes.

523
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,910
Hello.

524
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,510
Wait, isn't that...

525
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,650
Dae Sik?

526
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,690
(Good Luck!)

527
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,490
You must have a girlfriend.

528
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,860
You should watch out.

529
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,800
Mom, I missed you!

530
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,230
I can't let him be alone with Ye Won.
