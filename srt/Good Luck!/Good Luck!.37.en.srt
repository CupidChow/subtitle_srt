1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,610
My gosh.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,440
What great luck this is.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,180
At this rate, it's only a matter of time
before I can pay Mu Chul back.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,750
Oh, right. I wonder if that guy
who looks like Mu Chul is doing okay.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,930
(Han Mu Chul and Han Tae Ha's DNA
is a 99.99-percent match.)

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,800
(It is confirmed
that they are father and son.)

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,970
Wait, then...

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,180
That man is Mu Chul?

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,710
Oh, dear.

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,350
Grandpa.

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,980
Thank you for saving me
and taking care of me...

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,290
when I was found unconscious
on the street.

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,160
I can't keep on
inconveniencing you here forever,

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,460
so I'm leaving.

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,000
I will never forget
the warmth and kindness...

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,300
you showed me.

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,630
And this is...

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,870
the little bit of money I saved
from selling scrap cardboard.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,180
Please stay in good health.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,750
From Han Mu Chul.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,460
That's right.

22
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,760
My family.

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,500
The time that I've lost.

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,570
I will find them.

25
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,770
Wait for me.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,070
Han Mu Chul is coming!

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,760
Mu Chul! Han Mu Chul!

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,990
Open up!

29
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,160
Mu Chul! Han Mu Chul!

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,830
(Number One Real Estate,
Properties for Sale)

31
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,040
No way.

32
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,380
That man really is Mu Chul?

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,750
Then,

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,120
is it really true...

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,720
that he got into an accident
and lost his memory?

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,330
Should I tell his family now?

37
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,260
No.

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,860
I should meet Mu Chul in person...

39
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,900
and talk to him.

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,340
My gosh. Anyway,
I told him not to leave the house.

41
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,240
Where on earth did he go?

42
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,970
Oh, boy.

43
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,580
So, this is really our home now?

44
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,780
I've never lived in a house this big.

45
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,020
I'm so happy that
I'm about to burst into tears.

46
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,190
My goodness, honey.
You said you didn't want to live here.

47
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,720
Do you like it?

48
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,690
Of course, I do.

49
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,860
This is our home now.

50
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,400
The two of us...

51
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,730
will live here until the day we die.

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,440
No one can tell us to move out anymore.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,610
Now, we can put nails in the walls,

54
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,380
and I can change the wallpaper
whenever I want.

55
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,610
Honey, you're happy too, right?

56
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,320
Do I really have to tell you
how happy I am?

57
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,690
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

58
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,390
I can't believe I own a home now.

59
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,620
I know, right?

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,330
Up until recently, we had no money
and had to worry about becoming homeless.

61
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,430
Who knew we'd win the lottery
at such perfect timing?

62
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,170
I've finished organizing my stuff!

63
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,640
What is it?

64
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,710
You two.

65
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,810
What were you talking about?

66
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,310
Nothing. Nothing at all.

67
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,320
That's right.

68
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,180
I'll go to my room and get ready for work.

69
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,020
- All right.
- Okay.

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,460
Hey!

71
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,720
What?

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,190
Anyway, I wonder how Mi Ja's move went.

73
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,300
She was throwing out her furniture pieces
as they were all too big.

74
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,330
My gosh. The place must feel so empty.

75
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,880
What is this?
What's up with this flooring?

76
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,080
And why is the house so small?

77
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,480
You said you wanted
to move into this house.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,720
Then, shouldn't you be happy?

79
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,760
I am, but I didn't know
it would be this cramped.

80
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,920
My gosh, whatever.

81
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,700
Don't forget we're holding
your dad's 49th-day memorial today.

82
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,040
You should come home early
from work today and help me out.

83
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,740
Okay, I will.

84
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,170
Oh, my.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,970
Nice, it worked!

86
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,510
What do you think?
You can't even tell, right?

87
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,140
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,750
This was the best house
that I could afford.

89
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,680
What are you talking about?

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,950
If I'm with you,

91
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,950
I don't mind wherever we live.

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,990
Well, the room is small,

93
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,530
so we'll be able to stick closer
to each other as we sleep.

94
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,410
All I can do for you now
is to hug you like this,

95
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,070
but wait.

96
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,940
I will work hard...

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,410
and let you live in a much nicer house.

98
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,350
I promise.

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,920
There's something
more important than that.

100
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,760
What?

101
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,720
Mu Chul, when you proposed to me,
you said...

102
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,930
that you'd protect me until the very end.

103
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,500
You can never go away
and leave me all alone.

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
You have to stick right by my side
until the day I die.

105
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,540
Okay?

106
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Okay.

107
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,610
I will live one more day than you, Mi Ja.

108
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,910
I will protect you until the end...

109
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,710
and follow you.

110
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,310
Don't worry.

111
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Promise.

112
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,190
Okay.

113
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,310
Gosh, this room is so tiny.

114
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,850
Whose room was this before?

115
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
What?

116
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,830
Isn't this my old room?

117
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,430
I could see a window like this
from my old room too.

118
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,040
Is it perhaps the neighbor's room?

119
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,380
Gosh, it's hot.

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,480
Why is it so hot all of a sudden?

121
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,290
Hey, there.

122
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,860
Hey, can you hear me?

123
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,860
Hey.

124
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,030
Isn't anyone there?

125
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,640
- What?
- How...

126
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,880
Is that your room?

127
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,710
Yes. Then, is that your room?

128
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,380
Yes, it is.

129
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,990
Gosh, I always looked at this window...

130
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,120
and wondered where it led to.

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
Why didn't I know until now?

132
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,090
I don't know.

133
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,730
When I wasn't home,
that used to be an empty storage room.

134
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,760
And all I ever did was sleep there
and leave early.

135
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,500
Oh, I see.

136
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,270
Hang on.

137
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Hey, Ye Won.

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,710
What? You're in Korea?

139
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,240
Where are you now?

140
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,610
Okay, then. I'll meet you there.

141
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,680
Who was it?

142
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,880
The co-CEO of Farm to Market
and a good friend of mine.

143
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,390
A friend?

144
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,650
I have to get going now.
I'll see you later.

145
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,590
Okay, bye.

146
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,960
Was it just a friend who's a girl?

147
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,600
It sounded like a girl's name.

148
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,200
So, your room is right across from mine.

149
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,470
We'll be able to meet often now.

150
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,310
Hey, are you leaving already?

151
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,110
Yes, I have a lot of work to take care of.

152
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,810
But you only just got here.

153
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,450
You should stay for a few days. I'm upset.

154
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,550
Sorry, but now is not a good time, Mom.

155
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,890
I'll be close by now, so I'll visit often.

156
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,590
You could just live here.

157
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,460
Why did you find your own place?

158
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,190
We have an apartment unit in Seocho-dong.

159
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,900
Why would you find a studio apartment
on the outskirts of the city?

160
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,230
I feel more comfortable that way.

161
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,870
I'll stay there just until I'm done
with urgent business.

162
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,370
Then, I'm off.

163
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,140
Hey, wait! Stop.

164
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,780
Are you leaving already, just like that?

165
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,280
You're running off
without having a meal with your dad?

166
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,710
Why, you little brat.

167
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,280
I mean, you started a business
without even consulting with me,

168
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,490
and you won't even tell me
how things are going when I ask.

169
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,360
Can you really do this to me?

170
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,990
Dad.

171
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,330
Goodness, don't you know how she is?

172
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,830
She never wanted to accept your help.

173
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,800
Even her friend
who studied abroad with her...

174
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,030
thinks she is a poor working student.

175
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,570
- What?
- Oh, dear.

176
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,800
Just leave her alone.

177
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,780
I'll just sit back and watch
since I know you never get into trouble,

178
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,580
but you're going to learn a harsh lesson
if you think starting a business is easy.

179
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,520
Don't worry, Dad. Then, I'll be going.

180
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,750
- What?
- I'm off!

181
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,190
What? My gosh.

182
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,290
Go. Fly far away.

183
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,090
Yes, I'm the co-CEO of Farm to Market.

184
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,500
Couldn't you please reconsider
canceling your contract with us?

185
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Who is she?

186
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,700
I haven't seen her before.

187
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,130
The opening has been delayed,

188
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,470
but it's just a delay.

189
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,100
It hasn't been canceled.

190
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,410
Yes, please get back to us. Thank you.

191
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Hey, Seok Jin.

192
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,880
What? Do they know each other?

193
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,980
How come you're here?
You said you were going to stay longer.

194
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,780
Hey, aren't you even glad to see me?

195
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,020
What's with that face?

196
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,820
Sorry. It's my fault...

197
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,860
that we lost the investment
for Farm to Market.

198
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,190
What? This won't do.

199
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,460
- Let's duke it out. Darn it.
- What?

200
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,690
Why are you doing this?

201
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,930
Hey, is your life over?
Who said you could be so dejected?

202
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,170
This is why I came.

203
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,900
Stop looking so glum! You little...

204
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,400
Okay! Just let go of me.

205
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,070
Gosh, you punk.

206
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,140
All sorts of things happen
when you're running a business.

207
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,480
Why are you so downcast
over a mere thing like this?

208
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,610
I'm here now.
Let's start things over together.

209
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,920
Okay?

210
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,250
All right. Thanks.

211
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,720
Hey, you two must be close friends.

212
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,120
Who is this? Your girlfriend?

213
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,530
Oh, no. She's just a friend.

214
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,930
- Yes.
- Oh, I see.

215
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,630
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Seok Jin's friend.

216
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,200
Then, have a good time.

217
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,740
Yes, thank you.

218
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Who is she?

219
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,910
She's a friend of my parents
from their hometown.

220
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,910
Is that right?

221
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,580
Since I'm here,
should I say hello to your parents?

222
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
Maybe next time.

223
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,520
We just moved today,
so they're pretty busy.

224
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,250
Move? Did you move? Where to?

225
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,290
Where did you move to?

226
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,390
It would be nice to say hello
since I'm here.

227
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,830
Hey, how is the house you moved into?

228
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,590
Well, it is what it is.

229
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,600
What about you? Do you feel better?

230
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,330
Yes, I'm doing much better.
I can walk around a bit now.

231
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,600
I won't get fired
once you get better, will I?

232
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,640
Come on. I doubt that. Don't worry.

233
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,180
You can work for me for life if you want.

234
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,880
Are you crazy? I won't stay here for life.

235
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,150
Gosh, don't even say
such a horrible thing.

236
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,520
Oh, by the way,

237
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,690
we're having
my dad's 49th-day memorial this evening.

238
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,550
I can go home early, can't I?

239
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,320
It's the 49th day?
Of course, you should go home early.

240
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,230
Okay. Got it. See you next time, Jin Tae.

241
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,430
Oh, gosh. This is so heavy.

242
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,330
Hey,

243
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,270
peel all of these by today and wash them.

244
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,240
What? I have to peel
all of these by today?

245
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,910
Hey, I can't.
I have to go home early today...

246
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,280
for my dad's 49th-day memorial.

247
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,140
I just talked it over with Jin Tae too.

248
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,080
Then work hard until you have to go.

249
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,950
If I catch you being lazy,
I'm going to dock your pay.

250
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,520
I've talked it all over with Mr. Choi too.

251
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,420
If you don't do your job properly,

252
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,460
I can fire you or dock your pay
in any way I see fit.

253
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,990
Why, that little...

254
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,030
What is this? A Chinese restaurant?
Why do we need so many onions?

255
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,010
I've made some side dishes
and left them on the counter.

256
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,510
Put them in the fridge once they cool off.

257
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,410
I worked hard all morning to make those.

258
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,910
Don't spill a single drop.

259
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,250
Yes, all right.

260
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,550
Gosh, it's no surprise.

261
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,060
Does she think she's the owner or what?

262
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,490
Gosh, when will I peel all of these?

263
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,030
My goodness.

264
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,900
Oh, no.

265
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,010
What? Shoot.

266
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,710
This is bad.

267
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Oh, no.

268
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,620
No, this is dirty now.
It's not edible anymore.

269
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,950
Shoot, what do I do?

270
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,550
- It will cause food poisoning.
- Tae Ha.

271
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,590
Shoot.

272
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,520
What? Where did he go?

273
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,730
What the... What happened here?

274
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,800
Why did he toss it in the trash?

275
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,330
Darn you, Han Tae Ha!

276
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,870
My gosh!

277
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
So, I've left Grandpa's house,

278
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,010
but where should I go?

279
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,050
I have no one I can visit.

280
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,220
Goodness.

281
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Oh, boy.

282
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,160
A fried chicken joint?

283
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,930
Dae Sik?

284
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,800
He is...

285
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,640
doing all right.

286
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
Dae Sik runs a fried chicken joint.

287
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Oh, right.

288
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,380
Should I go to Dae Sik?

289
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,020
Let's say I find him.

290
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,490
But what if he reacts like Gyu Tae?

291
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,830
No. Don't give up...

292
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,430
without trying, Han Mu Chul.

293
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,700
Yes, let's go and find him!

294
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,570
(Number One Real Estate)

295
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,310
(Daewoon Building)

296
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,940
Oh, hello.

297
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,850
So...

298
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,810
how did your move go?

299
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,780
It went pretty well.

300
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,990
As I mentioned the other day,
you don't have to worry about the rent.

301
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,990
Just think of it as your own house
and make yourself at home.

302
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,200
Okay, thank you.

303
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,030
Did you get groceries?

304
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,140
Oh, we're holding
Mu Chul's 49th-day memorial service today.

305
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,010
I bought some groceries
to make a few simple dishes.

306
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,010
Oh, it's today?

307
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,280
I knew it was coming up soon.

308
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,520
What time will it start?
If you don't mind,

309
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,520
Gyu Tae and I would like to be there too.

310
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,530
We were just going to keep it simple
and have only the family there.

311
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,000
You can definitely do that,

312
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,530
but if the others hear
that his 49th-day memorial is today,

313
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,170
they'll all want to be there.

314
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,300
My wife, Gyu Tae, Geum Ok. As you know,

315
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,410
they knew Mu Chul for many years.

316
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,950
We'll do it in the evening,
so you can come if you'd like.

317
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
I'll be off, then.

318
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Okay.

319
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,430
- Darn, why isn't he picking up?
- The person you have reached is...

320
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,270
- Gyu Tae.
- Hey, Dae Sik.

321
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,710
I just ran into Mu Chul's wife.

322
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,480
She said
Mu Chul's 49th-day memorial was today.

323
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,210
His 49th-day memorial?

324
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,420
It will be held in the evening.

325
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,190
Let's go together.

326
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,220
Should I tell him
that Mu Chul is actually alive?

327
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,730
It makes no sense to hold a memorial
for someone who's alive.

328
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,560
You'll come too, right?

329
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,360
Well, the thing is...

330
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,900
No. I should find Mu Chul
before I say anything.

331
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,440
If I tell him now
but fail to find Mu Chul,

332
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,940
I'll get chewed out
for not telling him sooner.

333
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,180
Yes, sure. We'll go together.

334
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,210
Gyu Tae.

335
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,220
Oh, Dae Sik. You were here too.

336
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,120
Hey, Geum Ok. I'm glad you're here.

337
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,790
Come to Mu Chul's house in the evening.

338
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,390
You mean, Mi Ja's place?

339
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,360
But why?

340
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,790
Mu Chul's 49th-day memorial service
is today.

341
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,400
It'd be nice to have you there too.

342
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,830
Oh, it's already been 49 days.

343
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,740
Okay. Of course, I should be there.

344
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,870
All right. I'm off.

345
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,210
- All right.
- Okay, have a good day.

346
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,270
Thanks, you too.

347
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,580
Gyu Tae, have you given it some thought?

348
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,680
What? What are you talking about?

349
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,520
The blind date.

350
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,790
So, have you thought it over and decided?

351
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,520
Well, forget it.

352
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,190
I can't do it.

353
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,530
What?

354
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,430
Why not? Did something happen?

355
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,470
Hey, Geum Ok.

356
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Yes?

357
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,070
No, never mind.

358
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,840
Did you come here to ask me that?

359
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,840
Oh, here. Take this.

360
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,410
What's this?

361
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,180
Side dishes.

362
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,250
Keep them in the fridge
and eat them with rice.

363
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,690
You have rice, right?

364
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,260
Side dishes? I see braised soybeans.
I don't eat beans.

365
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,960
Hey, I won't eat these. Take this back.

366
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,730
What? Just eat them
instead of cup noodles.

367
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,330
Must you act like a little kid
complaining about side dishes?

368
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,870
I don't want it. Take it back.

369
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,770
Just listen to me and eat them.

370
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,470
Unless you want to die before you turn 60.

371
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,180
Hey! Why would you say I might die?

372
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,910
Why would I die so young?

373
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,420
It can happen to anyone.
Look what happened to Mu Chul.

374
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,380
He died before he turned 60.

375
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,490
Hey! Why are you bringing up Mu Chul?

376
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,620
I'm so frustrated.

377
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,120
My gosh.

378
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,130
(We only use fresh,
locally raised chicken.)

379
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,900
Is this restaurant owned
by Mr. Kim Dae Sik?

380
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,800
Do you know Mr. Kim Dae Sik?

381
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,870
Is your boss' name Kim Dae Sik?

382
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,740
Yes, Kim Dae Sik.

383
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,510
Kim Dae Sik.

384
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,710
His name is Kim Dae Sik.

385
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,350
Kim Dae Sik.

386
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Do you know him?

387
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,390
Who? Kim Dae Sik?

388
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,190
Yes. Oh, my! Do you know him?

389
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,490
Kim Dae Sik?

390
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,030
He's the one who runs Jackpot Chicken.

391
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,830
Jackpot Chicken?

392
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,700
The 49th-day memorial service is today?

393
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,530
Yes, that's right.

394
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,500
Let's go there together, honey.

395
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Okay.

396
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,010
Right, about Mi Ja's rent.

397
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,010
What? Rent?

398
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,180
How much are you thinking
of charging them for rent?

399
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Oh, that.

400
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,750
Well, what would be a good amount?

401
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,060
If you charge too much,
you'll look like a heartless man,

402
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,030
so make sure it's a reasonable amount.

403
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,330
And let them live there rent-free
for a few months.

404
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,830
All right.

405
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,470
I'll take care of it,
so don't worry about it.

406
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,100
Anyhow, Mi Ja and her family...

407
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,870
This is their first time
holding a memorial in that house.

408
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,170
Is this the right spot for these?

409
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,670
I'm pretty sure there are rules
you must follow to place these correctly.

410
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,140
I don't know. Just put them anywhere.

411
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Do you remember?

412
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,650
Dad said we should eat
the flesh on the apple peels.

413
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,510
Of course, I remember that.

414
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,080
Not just apple peels.

415
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,980
"You should also eat the white part
when eating watermelon."

416
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,190
"When eating Korean melons,
eat the seeds too."

417
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,520
"And eat the grape skin too."

418
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,990
We could go on and on
just talking about fruits alone.

419
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,930
But I don't think...

420
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,860
my heart felt this empty back then.

421
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,630
Now that we've moved into this unit,

422
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,140
I feel Dad's absence even more.

423
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
What about you?

424
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,410
Me, what? Just go and bring the food.

425
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Whatever.

426
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,420
Oh, hello. You're here.

427
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,590
Yes. Is everything ready?

428
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,630
Yes. Mom, the guests are here.

429
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,160
Oh, you made it. You're here too.

430
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,930
Yes, Mi Ja. It's my first time
visiting your new place.

431
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,170
So, I got this for you.

432
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,970
You didn't have to bring anything.

433
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,780
Thanks.

434
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,010
Were you cooking?

435
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,780
Yes.

436
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,980
Let's go. Let me help you.

437
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,080
It's all done.

438
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,750
What about Mr. Choi? Is he coming too?

439
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,290
Gyu Tae? Yes, he'll be here soon.

440
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
I see.

441
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,980
- Oh, hello.
- Aren't you that guy from the other day?

442
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,040
Excuse me, sir.

443
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,510
That guy who used to live here.
Do you know where he went?

444
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,120
He left.

445
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,420
He left? Where did he go?

446
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,960
He left a letter and took off.

447
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,030
What?

448
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,330
(Number One Real Estate)

449
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,770
(Jackpot Chicken)

450
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,780
My gosh.

451
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,910
This is it.

452
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,850
Dae Sik.

453
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,290
Oh, it's locked.

454
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,460
Where did he go?

455
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,430
Who are you?

456
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,430
Oh, hello.

457
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,300
I'm a friend of the owner here.

458
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,230
Do you know where he went?

459
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh, Mr. Kim?

460
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,400
He said he had to go and do something
at home earlier.

461
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,110
Home?

462
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,110
This is...

463
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,180
What?

464
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,990
This place?

465
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,520
I was here before.

466
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,160
I see.

467
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,760
I guess my head hurt like that...

468
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,460
because this was Dae Sik's house.

469
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,900
Oh, "Kim Dae Sik."

470
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,070
What?

471
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,540
Which one should I press?

472
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,750
Wait.

473
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
What?

474
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,320
Where on earth has he gone off to?

475
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,760
This won't do.
I should hurry over there now...

476
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,700
and stop them
from having the 49th-day memorial.

477
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,910
Tae Ha.

478
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,960
It must be Gyu Tae. I'll let him in.

479
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,190
Oh, it's open.

480
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,930
Is that you?

481
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,740
Mu... What?

482
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,710
Oh, hello. I'm here to see Kim Dae Sik.

483
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,780
Mi Ja!

484
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,620
- I'm sorry!
- Mi Ja!

485
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,980
- I was just...
- Look.

486
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,350
Oh, my.

487
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,190
Mr. Han?

488
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,020
What?

489
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,590
What's all this noise?

490
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,690
Honey.

491
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,900
Mu...

492
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,100
Mu Chul?

493
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,100
What's going on?

494
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,810
Hello.

495
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,480
My name is Han Mu Chul.

496
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,090
(Good Luck!)

497
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,690
I'm a fraud and a divorced man.

498
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,060
Was I such an awful person?

499
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,670
You don't think Mu Chul is pretending
to have lost his memory, do you?

500
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,670
What if his memory comes back later?

501
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,600
I know. That can't happen.

502
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,110
So, tonight,

503
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,040
can I stay here?

504
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,010
