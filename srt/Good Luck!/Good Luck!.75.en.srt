1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,470
(All child actors filmed safely
under the supervision of their guardians.)

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,470
(Animal scenes were directed
and filmed...)

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,480
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,850
- Mu Chul.
- Dae Sik.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,380
Oh, boy.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Let's go.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
Hold on.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,530
Hey, Gyu Tae.

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,380
Hey.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,040
You invited Gyu Tae too?

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,950
Of course, the three of us
should go hiking together.

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,450
Hey.

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,320
Mu Chul, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,090
I don't think I can go hiking today.

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,090
Same here.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,560
I'm sorry, Mu Chul.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,900
I got everything ready...

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,670
since last night
to go hiking with you guys.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,900
Must you do this to me?

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,180
What? Dad went hiking?

21
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,080
Yes, he was looking forward to hiking
with his friends again after a long time.

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,650
With his friends?
So, the owner of Jackpot Chicken too?

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,660
She just asked you
about the owner of Jackpot Chicken.

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,160
Why are you glaring
at Seo Woo like that, Mom?

25
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,630
Gosh, I'm full now.
Thank you for the food.

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,970
My goodness.
That brat is stressing me out so much.

27
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,540
I'm getting indigestion because of her.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,670
Why? Did Seo Woo cause
some kind of trouble?

29
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,010
She sure did! She definitely stirred up
some serious trouble.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,610
I don't even want to talk about it.

31
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,910
Put this away when you're finished eating.

32
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,220
My gosh.

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,930
Let's go, Mother.
Let me escort you to the car.

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,530
Don't worry about it. I can go alone.

35
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,160
Will you really be okay alone?

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,870
If you want me to come with you,
just say so.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,470
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,070
- Call me if anything happens.
- Will do.

39
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,840
By the way, where's Dad?

40
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,280
He headed out early this morning.
He said he was going hiking.

41
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,110
Hiking?

42
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,250
He went hiking
without even saying bye to Mom,

43
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,750
even though he knew she was leaving today?

44
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,480
He's so mean.

45
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,920
Forget it. It's no big deal. I'm off.

46
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,220
Oh, right. Here.

47
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,990
What is this?

48
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,600
We all chipped in a little money...

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,300
for you to spend on your trip.

50
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,500
Goodness, you guys have no money.
Forget it. Take this back.

51
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,740
- It's not even a lot of money.
- Just take it.

52
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,010
Eat lots of good food and get the rest
and recuperation you deserve, okay?

53
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,340
All right, thanks. I'll be going, then.

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,580
Bye, Grandma.

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,150
Gosh, my sweet little pumpkin.
Take care. I'll be back soon.

56
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,490
Hye Sook.

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,390
Are you all right?

58
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,700
Oh, are you going away?

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,470
Have a good trip.

60
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,570
Also,

61
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,970
about the other day,

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,140
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,080
No matter how angry I was,
I shouldn't have done that.

64
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,720
I apologize. I'm sorry.

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
I'm sorry too.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,720
I said some really harsh things.

67
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,990
Please understand.

68
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,630
I'm under a lot of stress these days.

69
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,970
Hey.

70
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,340
Are you getting a divorce?

71
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,440
How did you know?

72
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,880
My husband told me.

73
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,350
I don't know what the problem is,

74
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,950
but you should really think it over
before you decide.

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,760
I thought a lot
before deciding to get a divorce,

76
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,690
but it was still really hard for me
for some time.

77
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,660
You and Mr. Han seem to be
getting along really well these days.

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,940
I feel bad saying this to you now,

79
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,010
but honestly, it feels like
we're newlyweds all over again.

80
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,380
Congratulations on getting back together.

81
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,950
- Thanks.
- I'm off.

82
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,750
Hold on.

83
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,790
Oh, thanks.

84
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,500
The air is so fresh and clean.

85
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,470
Hey, wait. Hang on.

86
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,910
One moment.

87
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,410
Let's slow down a little.

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,510
This is why it's important
to exercise regularly.

89
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
My goodness.

90
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,820
Dae Sik, are you all right?

91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,590
Yes, I'm fine. It's not too bad.

92
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,890
Goodness. This is not good.

93
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,230
Oh, let's sit down over there
and take a break.

94
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,390
- Okay.
- Come on!

95
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Okay.

96
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,170
- Oh, boy.
- Come on.

97
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,910
- Here.
- What?

98
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,610
Mi Ja prepared it for us.

99
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,250
- Thanks.
- No problem.

100
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,910
- Thanks for this.
- Sure.

101
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,620
Do you remember...

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,820
how we used to go up that hill
all the time in high school?

103
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,290
What?

104
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,870
Hey. Back then, you guys...

105
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,100
Oh, my stomach suddenly feels upset.

106
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
I'll be right back.

107
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,210
Oh, boy.

108
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,120
You haven't told him yet, have you?

109
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,590
Don't tell me...

110
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,190
you're planning to keep it from him.

111
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,820
I'll figure out what to do.

112
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,130
Just find a good time to tell Mu Chul...

113
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,130
so it doesn't shock him too much.

114
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,760
Worry about yourself.

115
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,430
As for me,
Mu Chul entrusted me with the building.

116
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,400
Worry about...

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,770
how you're going to tell him
without shocking him.

118
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,310
How many times did I say he gave it to me
as payment for driving him home?

119
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,220
- And do you have proof?
- What?

120
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,350
Is there proof that
he voluntarily gave it to you?

121
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,950
Hey, why would I lie to you?

122
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,820
Of course. Since that's how you think,

123
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,330
it's no surprise you'd stab
your friends in the back.

124
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,330
What?

125
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,260
How dare you talk like that
when you've done nothing to be proud of?

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,570
You became wealthy
by stealing from your friend.

127
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,100
Look who's talking.

128
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,540
Did you become wealthy
by conning your friend?

129
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,880
That's right. I'm a conman,

130
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,340
and you're a thief!

131
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,580
What? A thief?

132
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,980
Hey, punk. Do you want to go?

133
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,020
Gosh, you thief! Seriously...

134
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,350
- What did you say?
- Hey! My goodness.

135
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,520
Hey, guys. Why are you doing this?

136
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,020
Are you going to fight
when we came all this way?

137
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,460
Gosh, seriously.

138
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,130
Hey, I can't go any farther
with that jerk.

139
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,860
You guys can go on your own
if you want to.

140
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,330
Hey, Gyu Tae.

141
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,700
Fine, then. Leave!

142
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,500
I'll spend some quality time
with Mu Chul...

143
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,100
and talk about stuff
I haven't been able to tell him.

144
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,810
Hey, man. Go on if you have the guts.

145
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,080
What's stopping you? Go on, man.

146
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,240
That punk. My gosh.

147
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,880
(Buddumak Korean Cuisine)

148
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,650
(Break time)

149
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,990
(Buddumak Korean Cuisine)

150
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,690
First, for the waiting list,
we'll put a QR code outside.

151
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,860
Let's have the customers scan it
and fill it out.

152
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,090
I think that'll be most reasonable.

153
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,960
- Okay, a QR code.
- Yes.

154
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,700
Also, I've printed out a sales data list
for each item on the menu.

155
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,540
As you can see,

156
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,570
the dish we sold the most was spicy pork,

157
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,740
and the dish we sold the least
was bibimbap.

158
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,310
Also, stews sell really well
on Wednesdays for some reason.

159
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,780
Is that right?

160
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,820
So, we should buy ingredients
based on this data.

161
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,120
It might be hard
to buy ingredients in bulk...

162
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,450
if we keep shopping at the market
each time as we do now.

163
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,890
So, here's what I thought.

164
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,390
We could sign a deal with a nearby grocer
and get ingredients regularly...

165
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,960
Why? Do I have something on my face?

166
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,530
I've never seen you work so hard before.

167
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,200
I thought it would've been great for you
to work at a company with such diligence.

168
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,470
A company, my foot.

169
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,440
I hate having to work hard
for a small paycheck to build up wealth.

170
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,510
- Why?
- My dad was...

171
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,480
a self-made man who built his wealth
from the bottom up.

172
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,480
But in my eyes,
the result didn't seem that great.

173
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,220
Still, your dad was rich. I was jealous.

174
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,520
You know what?

175
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,490
My family never even got to use
the electricity freely.

176
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,860
On cold nights,
we wrapped ourselves up in blankets.

177
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,360
On hot nights, we'd sleep on the rooftop.

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,530
Even when we had stomachaches,

179
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,570
we had to eat food
that had already expired.

180
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,200
Was it that bad?

181
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,370
I think this was back in middle school.

182
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,810
I broke something
that belonged to my friend once.

183
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,940
It was pretty expensive,
so I had to pay him back.

184
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,580
So, I went home and told my parents,
and this is what my dad said.

185
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,620
"Deal with your own business yourself!
I have no money to give you!"

186
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,660
I think I finally understand you a bit.

187
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,830
"Why does he only dream
of getting rich overnight..."

188
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,760
"when he's fully capable of working?"

189
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,130
I thought you were pretty foolish.

190
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
What?

191
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,170
So, will you do as I say or what?

192
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,610
Okay. I'll trust you and follow your plan.

193
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,140
Okay, then. I'm going to turn Buddumak
into a huge success.

194
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,820
So, how will we do this?

195
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,950
What? You went to my house?

196
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,760
But why didn't you tell me?

197
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,160
I just stopped by for a minute.

198
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,100
By the way, didn't you tell your mom
about your relationship with Seo Woo?

199
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,570
No, it wasn't the right time.

200
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,070
My family is going through some stuff.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is that so?

202
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,540
Oh, right. Your mom kept asking me
what I thought of you.

203
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,080
It was so awkward.

204
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
What you thought of me?
What does that mean?

205
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,020
She didn't know that you had a girlfriend,

206
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,920
so she kept telling me that
we should become more than friends.

207
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,250
She thought we'd make such a good couple.

208
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,590
Gosh, why did Mom have to say that?

209
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,430
Your mom was always fond of me.

210
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,960
That must've been why.

211
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,270
Hey, Seo Woo. When did you get here?

212
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,310
Anyway, let's go together next time.

213
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,880
Your mom said to visit with you.

214
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,410
Oh, right. My mom said
you should come over once more too.

215
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,180
Hey, Ye Won. Let's talk about that later.

216
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,580
Oh, shall we?

217
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Okay.

218
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,660
Thanks for the coffee.

219
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
One second.

220
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Ye Won.

221
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,670
Don't take this the wrong way.

222
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,580
What? Do you have something to say?

223
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,850
Please don't talk about that stuff
in front of Seo Woo from now on.

224
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,650
What stuff?

225
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,080
About how we visit each other's houses.

226
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,860
It might be upsetting for Seo Woo.

227
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,960
Are you telling me to watch my mouth
in front of Seo Woo?

228
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,290
No, that's not what I mean.

229
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,160
Well, Seo hasn't even been to my house.

230
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,200
I mean, that's beside the point.
Even if it were me, I'd feel bothered...

231
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,070
if another guy visited
my girlfriend's house.

232
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,740
Okay, fine.

233
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,580
You're not mad, are you?

234
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,580
Why would I be mad?

235
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,550
I get it. You can go.

236
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,390
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

237
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,830
Excuse me.

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
How much does it cost
to stay here for a night?

239
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,440
Which room would you like?

240
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,370
Each room has a different price.

241
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,410
Give me the nicest room you have.

242
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,310
Will anyone be joining you?

243
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,810
No, it's just me.

244
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,650
Then, the room might be too big.

245
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,850
That's fine. I like having a big room.

246
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,150
I'll take that one.

247
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,800
Will it be very expensive?

248
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,490
Oh, my.

249
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,000
Hello?

250
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,630
Hey, Mom. Did you get there safely?

251
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,070
Yes, is everything all right at home?

252
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,440
Yes, everything is fine.

253
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,410
How is it?
Is it nice to go on a trip by yourself?

254
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,010
It's great. I feel so refreshed.

255
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,080
I wonder why
I never thought to do this until now.

256
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,550
I'm glad that you're enjoying yourself.

257
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,550
So, what are you doing now?

258
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,990
I'm at the restaurant.
I'm hungry, so I'm going to eat.

259
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,290
I hope you didn't go
to some shabby rice soup place.

260
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,930
Eat something nice, okay?

261
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,130
Don't worry.

262
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,960
I'll get the most expensive thing
on the menu.

263
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,770
Hey, I should order now. Bye.

264
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,370
I'll have the special course.

265
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,810
Of course.

266
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,180
Mom must be having so much fun.

267
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,320
Why? Does she sound happy?

268
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,390
Yes, she's having a blast.

269
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,150
We should have sent her on a trip sooner.

270
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,690
I didn't even look after her
because I was busy with my own life.

271
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,160
I feel so bad.

272
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,630
It's fine since she got to go now.

273
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,760
(Business Proposal, Hanwoo Romance)

274
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,800
By the way, honey.

275
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,140
Since we're getting 500,000 dollars,
shouldn't we go home now?

276
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,080
I don't like how my mom is all by herself.

277
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,520
I feel bad for staying here
for so long too.

278
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,620
I'll go once Mom gets back from her trip.

279
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,950
Mom and Dad are talking about divorce.

280
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,920
I don't feel comfortable
with leaving them just yet.

281
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,760
Okay. Let's do that.

282
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,630
By the way,
you have to go to your part-time job.

283
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,700
I was about to leave.

284
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,400
Mom, let's draw together.

285
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,600
Okay, let's go.

286
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,840
This smells great.

287
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,580
There we go.

288
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,050
Okay.

289
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,180
The side dishes are all set.

290
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,950
Why is he running so late, though?

291
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,630
Gosh, it's so uncomfortable
with him not having a cell phone.

292
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,070
We reached the top!

293
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,000
Thank you...

294
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,770
and sorry!

295
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,320
Mi Ja told me yesterday...

296
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,220
that I used to look down on you guys
and mistreat you...

297
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,320
just because I had some money.

298
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,030
After I heard that,

299
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,500
I thought I should be a better friend
as a way of apologizing to you guys.

300
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,370
And I promised myself
that I'd do anything it takes...

301
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,540
to get our trio's friendship back.

302
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,970
I asked you guys
to come hiking with me today...

303
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,610
so we could look back
on our old memories together...

304
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,780
and reaffirm our friendship.

305
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,990
Guys, if you're upset with each other,

306
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,890
resolve everything before we descend,
at least for my sake.

307
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,260
Does that sound good?

308
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Okay?

309
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,640
Let's head down before the sun sets.

310
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,780
Once we descend,
I will tell him everything.

311
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,990
I can no longer withhold the truth
from Mu Chul.

312
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,090
From my lottery ticket
to the Daewoon Building,

313
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,420
I'll tell him everything,
so just know that.

314
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,090
Just tell him what you did.

315
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,130
I'll tell him what I did.

316
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,900
Don't make me laugh, man.

317
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,900
I can't trust you anymore.

318
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,900
I'll tell him everything.

319
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,170
Move.

320
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,920
Oh, boy.

321
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,050
Goodness. It's too dark.
I can barely see anything.

322
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,490
- Hey, Mu Chul. Be careful.
- Yes.

323
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,430
- Step aside. I'll lead the way.
- Okay.

324
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Oh, dear.

325
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,670
- Be careful.
- All right.

326
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,180
- We're home.
- Hey.

327
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,950
Why are you standing there?

328
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,160
Your dad isn't back yet.

329
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,530
What? He left for a hike this morning
and still hasn't come back?

330
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,860
He doesn't even have a cell phone.
I'm so worried.

331
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,200
Is Mr. Kim from Jackpot Chicken
not answering his phone either?

332
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
No idea. How would I know?

333
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,440
What about his other friends?

334
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,340
I don't know! Just go and wash up.

335
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,170
Hello?

336
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,680
Hey, it's me. Is your dad home?

337
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,110
My dad? No, not yet. Why?

338
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,380
What?

339
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,350
Okay, I'll try calling him
and let you know. All right.

340
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,650
What's wrong?

341
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,130
I don't think
Dad is back from his hike yet.

342
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,430
What?

343
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,660
I thought he came back earlier
and then went to the restaurant.

344
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,730
He's not back yet?

345
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,230
It's dark outside now,
so it could be dangerous.

346
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,210
You said you'd sell the building
to invest more money.

347
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,750
How's that going?

348
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,380
Give me a call when you get this message.

349
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,820
Hey, Ah Jin.

350
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,660
Ah Jin?

351
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,400
What?

352
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,000
Why? Did your phone turn off?

353
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Yes, the battery must be dead.

354
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,870
- This is crazy.
- My eyesight isn't great,

355
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,540
so I can't see very well.
What should we do?

356
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,070
- Well...
- Hey, move aside.

357
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,610
- I'll lead the way.
- Okay.

358
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,240
If you lose Gyu Tae, you're doomed.
Just stay right behind us.

359
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,610
- Let's go slowly.
- Okay.

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,520
("A Flower That Didn't Bloom"
by Kim Soo Chul)

361
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,060
It has been a while since you left

362
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,460
Why haven't you come back?

363
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,440
You left one leaf behind, my dear

364
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,410
On the branch soaked with tears

365
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,450
And only the sound of the wind remains

366
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,450
On the bare branch

367
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,130
A sobbing leaf trembles

368
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:42,930
Even the moonlight hides behind the clouds

369
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:48,510
Only deepening the loneliness

370
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,710
Worn out by the birdsong all night

371
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,280
Even the one lone leaf may fall

372
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:07,620
Though you are far away, it will bloom

373
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,760
The flower that never fully blossomed
will bloom

374
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,400
On the bare branch

375
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,110
A sobbing leaf trembles

376
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,650
Yearning to bloom a single flower

377
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:36,020
Is it trembling with sorrow?

378
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,750
I really won't hold back anymore.

379
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,160
Can you not hold yourself back?
I feel the same way.

380
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Seriously...

381
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,890
- Don't hold back.
- Gosh, seriously?

382
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,000
- My gosh.
- Hey!

383
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,900
Who dared to pick on my dear Geum Ok?

384
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,570
Tell me. I'm going to teach them a lesson!

385
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,940
What, are you my guardian or something?

386
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,740
My offer to be your reliable big brother
still stands.

387
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,510
Call me anytime.
I'll go and snap those jerks in two!

388
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,180
Hey, you look really pretty today.

389
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,350
Is it because you're drunk?

390
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,720
Do you really think I'm pretty?

391
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,990
Yes, you're pretty.

392
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,270
(Gyu Tae)

393
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
This guy, seriously...

394
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,390
Hey, are you sure this is the right way?

395
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,390
I don't know. I'm just trusting my gut.

396
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,030
What's wrong?

397
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,560
Goodness. I think I twisted my ankle.

398
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,970
Can you walk?

399
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,900
Yes, it's not too bad.

400
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,170
Mu Chul.

401
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,010
Where is Mu Chul?

402
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,110
Mu Chul?

403
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,810
Mu Chul.

404
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,410
- Mu Chul.
- Mu Chul?

405
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,180
Did he lose us?

406
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,920
Hey, where are you going?
You hurt your ankle.

407
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,120
Stay here. I'll go find him.

408
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,390
- Hey, give me the phone.
- Right.

409
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
Here.

410
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,200
Just follow the path we took, okay?

411
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,260
- Will do.
- I'll wait right here.

412
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,330
All right.

413
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Oh, boy.

414
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,170
Goodness.

415
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,380
Oh, dear.

416
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Mu Chul.

417
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
Han Mu Chul!

418
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,190
Mu Chul, can you hear me?

419
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
Mu Chul!

420
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,360
Hey, Gyu Tae.

421
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,270
Mu Chul.

422
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,670
Hey, are you all right?

423
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,270
Yes, but I hurt my back again.

424
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,540
My gosh. Where is Dae Sik?

425
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,810
Dae Sik? He twisted his ankle too.
He's resting over there.

426
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,020
Once we descend,
I will tell him everything.

427
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,290
From my lottery ticket
to the Daewoon Building,

428
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,320
I'll tell him everything,
so just know that.

429
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,660
Gyu Tae.

430
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,560
It's slippery here.
You could get hurt too,

431
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,230
so just call 911.

432
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,230
No.

433
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,140
I'm coming for you.

434
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,170
No, it's too dangerous. Don't come down.

435
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,160
Thanks.

436
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,260
What... Why?

437
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,900
Why are you looking at me like that?

438
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,570
You're scaring me.

439
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,420
(Good Luck!)

440
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,890
Gosh, why do I have such bad indigestion?

441
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,730
- Did you eat something bad?
- It's been like this for a few days.

442
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,800
I like Seok Jin.

443
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,230
Not as a friend, but as a man.

444
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,040
What did you say?

445
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,370
Gyu Tae, why are you home so late?
Where were you?

446
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,640
Why does your face look like this?

447
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,040
Did something happen in the mountains?

448
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,710
