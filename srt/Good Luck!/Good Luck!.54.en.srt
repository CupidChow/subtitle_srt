00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,510
(Episode 54)

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,010
That woman...

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,910
She looks so familiar.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,880
It's okay. You didn't know.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,790
I hope that didn't offend you.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,990
No, not at all.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,060
Jang Mi?

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,180
How did Jang Mi show up again?

9
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,350
And how's it possible
that he recognized Jang Mi?

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,350
Did he get his memory back?

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,590
Or is it just his body that remembers her?

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,430
My gosh, it's disgusting.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,530
So disgusting.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Well...

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,140
You came all the way
to my humble little office, Mrs. Taylor.

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,970
I'm truly honored.

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,550
You said you were at your office,
so I thought I'd stop by.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,280
I hope I'm not being a bother.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,250
My gosh, not at all.

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,050
Please don't worry about it.

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,960
I didn't expect
Gold Investment Group's office...

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
to be a real estate office.

23
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,860
Well, I started out as a realtor,

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,960
and I'm still using this office.

25
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,770
Are you disappointed?

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,700
Disappointed? No.

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,100
In fact, I like this.

28
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,970
Your office feels so inviting and warm,

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,810
just like you.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,650
If your office looked
all fancy and glamorous,

31
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,650
I would've wanted to leave right away.

32
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,790
I'm glad you like my office.

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,660
You're really impressive.

34
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,260
So, you started out here...

35
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,700
and founded an investment firm.

36
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,730
You're probably not even 60 yet.

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,040
How old are you,
if you don't mind me asking?

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
I'm...

39
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,940
I'm in Class 1 of 6th grade.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,840
Class 1 of 6th grade?

41
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,450
So, you're 61?

42
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,880
Yes, that's right.
I was born in 1965, the Year of the Snake.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,390
I see.

44
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,160
Then when is your birthday?

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,190
My birthday?

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,030
I checked the property deeds
of the buildings Han Mu Chul used to own.

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,430
The Daewoon Building is currently listed
in Choi Gyu Tae's name.

48
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,440
I think
Choi Gyu Tae owns the building now.

49
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,770
See if you can get
his resident registration number.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,510
At least his date of birth,
if you can't get the whole thing.

51
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,280
I want to know your birthday
so I can get you a gift.

52
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,420
You don't need to tell me
if it makes you uncomfortable.

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,160
Well...

54
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,360
Why would it make me uncomfortable?

55
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,990
It's not like my birthday is top secret.

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,600
My birthday is October 21.

57
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,000
October 21?

58
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll remember that.

59
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,340
You don't have to.

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Well...

61
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,890
If you don't mind,

62
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,720
could I visit your office
from time to time?

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,520
What? Sorry?

64
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,890
Ever since I let Mr. Han deceive me,

65
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,930
I've had trouble opening up to others.

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,570
But I feel like I can have
open and honest conversations with you.

67
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,070
That'll be okay, right?

68
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,240
Yes, of course!

69
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,470
Feel free to visit me anytime.

70
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,780
Thank you.

71
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,380
- My gosh, it's hot!
- Oh, no. It's hot!

72
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,890
(Former Owner, Han Mu Chul)

73
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,390
(Current Owner, Choi Gyu Tae)

74
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,130
Yes, it's him, 651021.

75
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,430
So, I was right. I knew it.

76
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,300
How did Choi Gyu Tae come to own
the Daewoon Building?

77
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,340
The building must be worth
at least ten million dollars.

78
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,610
So, we can each take five million.

79
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,140
No, would it be worth tens of millions?

80
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,110
Goodness. You're getting excited
over just ten million dollars?

81
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,250
What?

82
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,450
You see, what we do is...

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,490
about squeezing every last penny
from them.

84
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,820
And just so you know,

85
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,130
we haven't even touched
Choi Gyu Tae's cash.

86
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,730
My gosh. You're right.

87
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,930
You're really something, Jang Tae Poong.

88
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,640
You're a genius
when it comes to devising scams.

89
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,010
I won't let you down.

90
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,280
I'll even strip Choi Gyu Tae down
to get every last penny.

91
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,010
Okay, sounds good.

92
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,950
But are you just going to go after Choi?

93
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,390
You know,
there's the last member of the trio.

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,820
The owner of the fried chicken joint.

95
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,460
Wouldn't it be better
to go after them at the same time?

96
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, I want to do that,

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,800
but I haven't found anything on him
except for how he bought a house.

98
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,100
And he's still running
that fried chicken place,

99
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,040
so maybe he doesn't really have money.

100
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,640
How dare a housewife stay somewhere else
instead of coming home?

101
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,010
And she went out for drinks
with another man.

102
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,750
Seriously, where did she sleep?

103
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,950
(Jackpot Chicken)

104
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,960
What?

105
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,830
This is...

106
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,200
Isn't this so pretty? I bought it
for five dollars at the market.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,540
I knew it. She has nowhere else to go.

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,010
Lee Hye Sook,
I have you in the palm of my hand.

109
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,550
I'm here.

110
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,550
Hey, you.

111
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,980
Did you get everything?

112
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,290
- Yes, I'll take these to the kitchen.
- All right.

113
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,290
Oh, right!

114
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,790
The lottery ticket I bought the other day.

115
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,530
What? Lottery ticket?

116
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Yes.

117
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,430
I'd forgotten about it,

118
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,400
but I just ran into someone
and remembered.

119
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Where did I put it?

120
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,140
Oh, where did it go? Hold on.

121
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,550
Yes, it's here!

122
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,590
I forgot to catch the show
announcing the lottery winners.

123
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,330
Can you check if I won anything?

124
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,270
Come on! Here.

125
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,810
(The 1,185th Lottery)

126
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,410
(Winning Numbers: 4, 5, 15, 21, 30, 42)

127
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,620
What does it say?

128
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,950
- You didn't win anything.
- Let me see.

129
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,560
Darn it. I really didn't win anything.

130
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,760
No! Don't throw it out.

131
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,030
I don't remember anything else,

132
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,240
but these numbers stuck with me clearly,

133
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,770
so they must mean something.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,170
Zero, two, zero, three, eleven...

135
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,980
I must keep this.

136
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,050
I'm going to...

137
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,250
play the lottery using only these numbers.

138
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,450
What?

139
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,460
Gosh, if I were to win the lottery,

140
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,090
I'd buy a building
like the Daewoon Building.

141
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,600
And I'd buy a house too!

142
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Then, I'll pay you back
for everything I owe you.

143
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,130
My goodness.

144
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,640
I feel awesome just thinking about it.

145
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,410
Oh, man.

146
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,910
Hey, punk.
You won't win the lottery like that.

147
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,910
It'd be better to get a ticket
with random automated numbers.

148
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,050
How do you know?

149
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,150
You.

150
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,920
Have you won the lottery before?

151
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,120
Win the lottery? As if.

152
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,160
That's just what I hear from people.

153
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,430
Is that so?

154
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,930
No.

155
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,440
I'm just going to use these numbers.

156
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,640
If I keep using these same numbers...
Who knows?

157
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,040
I might actually win.

158
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,350
Hey, man. Enough daydreaming.

159
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,780
Just get to work.

160
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,980
Zero, two, zero, three, sixteen,
nineteen, twenty.

161
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,920
Goodness, wandering around all day
isn't an easy thing to do.

162
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,430
Oh, boy. Where will I sleep tonight?

163
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,870
(Eldest Daughter Mi Jin)

164
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,140
No, I shouldn't.

165
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,740
What would I say to her
when I'm in this state?

166
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,650
She has enough on her plate already.

167
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,520
I can't add to her burden as well.

168
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,620
What? Mom ran away from home?

169
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,290
Yes, that's why I wanted to ask you
if she called you by any chance.

170
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,990
No, she didn't.

171
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,330
What does Dad say?

172
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,700
He isn't saying much.

173
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,030
Let me know if she happens to call.

174
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,970
We're all worried about her.

175
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,810
Okay, I will.

176
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,450
I'm pretty sure...

177
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,020
Mom would've wanted to help you out too.

178
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,590
But she must not have been able to say so
because of the money she gave me.

179
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,590
Also, with Dad
being so staunchly against it,

180
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,560
Mom seems really upset.

181
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,510
Mi Jin.

182
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,180
How do you feel?
Do you still have a fever?

183
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,920
You seem better now.

184
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,550
Hey, why are your hands so cold?

185
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,020
And it's such a hot day too.

186
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,530
What about your meals?
Have you been eating well?

187
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,060
Do you have any other aches or pains?

188
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,030
You were really upset because of me,
weren't you?

189
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,800
Ever since you left like that,

190
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,470
I haven't been able to get
a good night's rest.

191
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,380
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,250
I couldn't even help you
and only caused you pain.

193
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,050
I'm so sorry.

194
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,120
Why should you apologize, Mom?

195
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,930
I heard you gave Seok Jin that money...

196
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,530
behind Dad's back.

197
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,500
I know that Dad wouldn't let you use
a single cent of your lottery winnings,

198
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,970
so you fought with Dad
and ran away from home.

199
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,810
Wait, how do you know that?

200
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,840
Did Dad really do that?

201
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,850
Did he not let you use any money...

202
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,410
and act like a scrooge?

203
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,420
I didn't want to say anything
in case you guys resented him.

204
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,990
But yes, he did.

205
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,790
Your dad...

206
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,630
did that to me, Mi Jin.

207
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,860
I can't believe it.

208
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,030
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,900
You two went through
such tough times together.

210
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,340
Is he going to pretend not to remember
now that he has money?

211
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,980
Has Dad always been like this?

212
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,310
Let's go.

213
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,180
Go and tell him.

214
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,750
Tell him that money isn't just Dad's.
It's your money too.

215
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,420
He doesn't have to give me anything,
so ask him for half of the money.

216
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,990
I'll tell him, so let's go.

217
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,390
Gosh, Mi Jin.

218
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,760
Why would you run away from home
like a fool?

219
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,930
You need to stick it out
and get your share of the money.

220
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,930
Only then will Dad realize
he was in the wrong.

221
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,170
Still,

222
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,770
my eldest daughter is the only one...

223
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,880
who will stick up for me.

224
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,250
Why are you crying?

225
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,410
You're making my heart ache.

226
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,180
Don't cry, okay?

227
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,600
What, 23 million dollars?

228
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,070
Hang on. Do you mean
your in-laws have really won the lottery?

229
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Yes.

230
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,440
And what about their winnings?

231
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,640
Did they really win 23 million dollars?

232
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,340
Even after taxes?

233
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,540
Gosh, lower your voice.

234
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,680
We'll be in big trouble
if Mi Jin hears us.

235
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,550
But why would she be mad?
Doesn't she know all about this too?

236
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,820
That's true, but...

237
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,520
No, I really shouldn't say this.

238
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,090
- Why? What is it?
- Mom.

239
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,760
Actually, Mi Jin went to her parents
and asked to borrow some money,

240
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,860
but her parents said
they wouldn't give her any.

241
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,770
What? But why?

242
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,230
I don't know either.

243
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
But the thing is,

244
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,500
they gave Mi Jin's brother
five million dollars.

245
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,640
What, five million?

246
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,340
Gosh, I told you to be quiet.

247
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,110
Hey, are they playing favorites?

248
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,850
One child gets five million dollars
while another gets nothing?

249
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,280
Goodness. That must be so upsetting.

250
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,020
Anyway, Mi Jin isn't
in a good mood these days,

251
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,250
so you should be careful too, Mom.

252
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,830
Also, don't ever let on
that you heard about this from me, okay?

253
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,830
All right.

254
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,270
Oh, will you please let me go?

255
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,100
But you don't even have
anywhere to go right now.

256
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,340
What? Are you going to go home now?

257
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,110
No, but still, I can't stay here.

258
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,910
Why not?

259
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,050
I'll explain everything. Let's go inside.

260
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,220
Come on. Still, how could I stay
at my in-laws' house?

261
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,550
Why can't you?

262
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,460
Can't a mom come to visit
her daughter's house?

263
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,820
Gosh, just trust me. Come on.

264
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,770
Have you been doing well, Ms. Park?

265
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Yes.

266
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,900
But what brings you here?

267
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,010
Since I've been having a hard time lately,

268
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,270
my mom wanted to stay here
and look after me.

269
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,910
I asked her to come
since I wanted to have Mom's food...

270
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,850
and get some rest for a few days.

271
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,510
You're okay with this, right?

272
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,750
Pardon?
Then, you mean you will stay here...

273
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,950
for a few days?

274
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,250
Well...

275
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,530
What? Mom is staying at Mi Jin's house?

276
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,170
Yes.

277
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,440
Mi Jin called me earlier.

278
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,140
Gosh, what a relief. I was so worried.

279
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,880
Now, let's hear about you.

280
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,250
What about me?

281
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,020
Kim Ah Jin. How long
are you going to act so distant from me?

282
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,880
Didn't you say you were taking over
a business or something?

283
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,390
Actually,

284
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,760
the owner of the restaurant
wants me to take over the business,

285
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,430
but I was wondering what to do
since I don't have any money.

286
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,600
I'll give you that money.

287
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,340
You should go for it.

288
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
What?

289
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,970
Gosh, you don't have to do that.

290
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Do you think...

291
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,780
I'm only saying this because I feel bad
about accepting the five million from Mom?

292
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
I know too.

293
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Ever since that happened,
you've been treating me differently.

294
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,920
You're my younger sister.

295
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,220
You've always been my baby sister
who was half my height.

296
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,660
I promised myself that I'd protect you
if Mom and Dad passed away.

297
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,430
And my little sister...

298
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,900
isn't able to do what she wants
because of money.

299
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,630
Can't I help you out as your big brother?

300
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,210
Not being able to do what you want
because of money?

301
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,110
I've been there, and that's enough.

302
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,750
I don't want you
to go through that as well.

303
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,520
So, please accept my offer.

304
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Honestly,

305
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,830
I resented you a bit.

306
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,230
I thought our family didn't favor
sons over daughters.

307
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,440
But seeing how hard this was on Mi Jin,

308
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,700
I resented you
because it felt as though...

309
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,540
you were getting special treatment
as the only son.

310
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,880
It's funny, right?

311
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,310
I said I didn't need money,

312
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,420
but when I thought about you
getting five million dollars by yourself,

313
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,350
I'd get so mad.

314
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,460
So, before I knew it,

315
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,460
I think I began to resent you.

316
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,330
It's all right.

317
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,570
I get how you feel.

318
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,100
I would've felt the same way.

319
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,710
That's why I can't accept your money.

320
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,510
I'd feel too bad.

321
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,210
What are you saying?

322
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,350
Mi Jin is one thing,

323
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,310
but if you don't accept my money either,

324
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm really going to be upset.

325
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,590
It's not really about the money.
I want to do it, okay?

326
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,860
Okay, then...

327
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,430
just lend me the money.
I'll be sure to pay you back.

328
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,930
Of course, you'd say that, Kim Ah Jin.

329
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,270
Give me a low interest rate, though.
All right?

330
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,440
All right, I heard you. My goodness.

331
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,810
Oh, I'm home!

332
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,650
I went grocery shopping,
so I got home late.

333
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,090
Who was the woman you were with
in front of the Daewoon Building earlier?

334
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,650
What? A woman?

335
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,660
Well...

336
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,990
Do you mind...

337
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,130
pretending not to know me
when you see me from now on?

338
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,700
Should I pretend not to know her?

339
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,230
No, I'm not pretending.

340
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,900
I really don't know who that woman is.

341
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,540
Just some woman I don't know.

342
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,810
As if I'd believe that.

343
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,780
Who smiles like that while talking
to a complete stranger on the street?

344
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,680
She just asked me for directions,
so I told her where to go.

345
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,490
Well, this is odd.

346
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,860
Why is she so angry?

347
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,160
Mi Ja, is she someone you know?

348
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,240
I'll make sujebi quickly.

349
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
- Don't bother!
- What?

350
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,010
I already prepared dinner.

351
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,480
Sorry?

352
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,350
Mom, Dad can't eat blue crab.
Did you forget?

353
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,450
Dad gets a rash when he eats it.

354
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,060
That's why we haven't eaten
blue crab in over ten years.

355
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,590
Do all of us have to miss out on it
just because one person can't eat it?

356
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,130
Just eat it. Don't complain.

357
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,270
Tae Ha.

358
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,340
Can you help me on my moving day?

359
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,440
Oh, sure. Just let me know when.

360
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,540
I'll let my work know
and take the day off.

361
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,950
All right, thanks.

362
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,180
When's your moving day?

363
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,590
I'm thinking of doing it
sometime mid-week next week.

364
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,620
If you can do it tomorrow,
just get it done...

365
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,320
so you can move out as soon as possible.

366
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,260
Hey, Mom.

367
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,430
You, just eat your food.

368
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,470
Why isn't she home yet?

369
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,480
What if she doesn't come home again?

370
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,510
(Kim Dae Sik)

371
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,050
Where on earth is she?
And what is she up to?

372
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Dad.

373
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,250
Hey, Seok Jin. You're home.

374
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,450
What are you doing here?

375
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,520
Are you waiting for Mom?

376
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,660
I'm not waiting for anyone.

377
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,860
I came out to get some fresh air.

378
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,330
Oh, my. The night air feels so fresh.

379
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,200
I know where Mom is now.

380
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,270
You do? Where is she?

381
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,940
She's staying with Mi Jin.

382
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,070
She's at Ms. Park's place?

383
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,580
I think Ah Jin spoke to her
on the phone earlier in the day.

384
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,350
Anyway, she's doing fine, so don't worry.

385
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,150
Why would I be worried?

386
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,420
Why should I worry about someone
who just packed up and left?

387
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,890
Dad.

388
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,420
Can't you just call her first
and try to make up with her?

389
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,960
Why should I do that?

390
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,430
I just feel like
you two ended up fighting because of me.

391
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,330
I feel bad.

392
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,970
I know she gave you money,
but this has nothing to do with that.

393
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,010
This is between me and your mother,
so don't worry.

394
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,210
We'll get it sorted out.

395
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,640
All right. I'll head in, then.

396
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
Okay.

397
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,720
She got the kids worried.

398
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,590
And why did she go to Ms. Park's house?

399
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,430
My goodness.

400
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,260
Gosh, I'm sorry, Gwang Sik.
You have to do this because of me.

401
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,860
No, don't worry about it.

402
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,830
Just make yourself at home
and get some good rest.

403
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,070
Good night.

404
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,610
Hey, can I really stay here?

405
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,440
Didn't you hear what Gwang Sik just said?

406
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,950
Just make yourself at home.

407
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,980
But how can I? You two aren't
the only ones who live here.

408
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,980
Goodness, come here.

409
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,460
My gosh. This is nice.

410
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,830
When was the last time
I slept next to you like this?

411
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,960
I know, right? I get to sleep
next to my married daughter today.

412
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm sorry, Mom.

413
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,630
What? For what?

414
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,870
I lashed out, without even knowing
how you were feeling.

415
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,810
You must have been heartbroken,
stuck in the middle.

416
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
It's all right.

417
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,510
I'm fine as long as you're okay.

418
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,910
I don't understand
why Dad has suddenly changed so much.

419
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Mi Jin.

420
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,220
I think money has a wicked way about it.

421
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,520
I guess it's hard for people
to stay in their right mind...

422
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,790
when they suddenly come into money.

423
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,690
Even so, this is wrong.

424
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,130
From the safe to recording every expense.

425
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,270
You aren't the family's housekeeper
or something.

426
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,870
Do not let him get his way.

427
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,670
You must stick it out...

428
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,770
until Dad apologizes to you on his knees.
All right?

429
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,310
Yes, got it.

430
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,770
It's not that. I was just...

431
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,040
Hey. Let's just go, darling.

432
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,340
No way.

433
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,040
That can't be true.

434
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,850
Mu Chul told me...

435
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,580
that he'd leave his family soon...

436
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,520
and come to me.

437
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,090
Mu Chul.

438
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,330
Darling!

439
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Oh, my.

440
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,330
Yes.

441
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,940
I missed you, darling.

442
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,470
Me too.

443
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,280
I missed you like crazy, Jang Mi.

444
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,980
What about your wife?

445
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,580
Has she caught on that
you didn't actually lose your memory?

446
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,080
Don't you worry.

447
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,590
I've got her totally fooled,
being the great actor I am.

448
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,290
Wait just a little longer.

449
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,290
As soon as I gain
my wife's complete trust,

450
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,160
I'll come to you.

451
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,100
My darling!

452
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,330
Oh, my Jang Mi!

453
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,340
It's so nice to smell you again.
It's been too long.

454
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,910
That jerk.

455
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,580
Jerk!

456
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,020
Jerk.

457
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,950
You jerk!

458
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,830
Does Mi Ja...

459
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,900
really want me to move out...

460
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,430
this soon?

461
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,410
(Daewoon)

462
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,120
Gosh, the dishes.

463
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,090
What? What is this?

464
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,630
Darn it.

465
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,600
Nothing's going my way.

466
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, boy.

467
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,510
What? The new owner
of the Daewoon Building...

468
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,570
has the same name as Mr. Choi?

469
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,250
Yes. I asked Gyu Tae,
and that's apparently the case.

470
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,650
How's that possible?

471
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,320
What a coincidence.

472
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

473
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,790
What do you mean?

474
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,790
The new owner of the Daewoon Building...

475
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,920
and Gyu Tae have the same name?

476
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,360
Oh, her husband happened to see...

477
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,500
the building's property deed.

478
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,130
It said the building was owned
by someone named Choi Gyu Tae.

479
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,930
So, I asked Gyu Tae about it,

480
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,240
and he said the new owner
had the same name as his.

481
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Is that so?

482
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,340
Oh, right.
Isn't there water leaking in your store?

483
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,180
We keep getting water leaks.

484
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,880
Goodness. I've mentioned it
to Mr. Choi several times,

485
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,820
but I still haven't heard from him.

486
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,850
Mr. Han always took care of these things
right away.

487
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,820
Ma'am.

488
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,460
Can I see the property deed?

489
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,800
(Number One Real Estate)

490
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,330
Hello.

491
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,530
Hello.

492
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,310
Hey, you're here.

493
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,940
What brings you here so early?

494
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Hey, I heard you told people...

495
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,620
that the new building owner
had the same name as yours.

496
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,490
Yes, I did. What about it?

497
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,550
Is that really true?

498
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,720
Of course, it's true.

499
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,990
Why do you ask?

500
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,160
Choi Gyu Tae,
the owner of the Daewoon Building.

501
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,140
It's you, not someone else
with the same name.

502
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,540
How did this happen?

503
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,790
(Good Luck!)

504
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,690
Why are you acting like this?

505
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,230
- Didn't you break up with me?
- What?

506
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,930
But seeing how beautiful you are,

507
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,500
it doesn't seem like
we're here just for the food.

508
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,730
Pardon?

509
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,700
I made a fresh cup of coffee...

510
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,330
- Hey.
- and brought you some.

511
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,300
- What?
- Thanks for the coffee.

512
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,710
Who is this client
that he's trying so hard to please them?

513
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,970
