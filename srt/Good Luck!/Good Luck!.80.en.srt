1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,410
(All child actors filmed safely
under the supervision of their guardians.)

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,410
(Animal scenes were directed
and filmed...)

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,410
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

4
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,080
You know, that money...

5
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,350
Let's just put it behind us.

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,080
What do you mean?

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,620
I want to believe Dae Sik.

8
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,720
What?

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,160
Are you saying...

10
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,920
you'll just give up on that money?

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,870
Think carefully about this.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,910
You bought that lottery ticket.
It is your money.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,410
Wouldn't it be a shame to give it up?

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,050
I may have bought that lottery ticket,

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,680
but Dae Sik says I gave it to him.

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,920
That's what he says,
but how are we supposed to believe him?

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,290
What if he stumbled upon it or stole it?
We have no way of knowing.

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,920
Are you saying Dae Sik is lying now?

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,530
I do not think so.

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,090
It's totally possible he is lying.

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,260
You absolutely treasured
every lottery ticket you bought.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,870
There's no way you just gave it to him.

23
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,040
Dae Sik says he hasn't had...

24
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,170
a single peaceful night of sleep
since collecting that money.

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,640
Because I was being chased by creditors,

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,740
died, and then came back to life,

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,310
he never found
the right moment to tell me the truth.

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,820
Mu Chul!

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,720
I went through a lot
to find my friends again,

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,320
and I don't want to lose them over money,

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
so let's just...

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,790
put it behind us.

33
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,800
Can you do that?

34
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,770
I can't do that.

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,870
Even if you really gave him
the lottery ticket...

36
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,440
and told him to keep all the money,

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,880
I'll make sure to get it back.

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,950
You bought that lottery ticket,

39
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,810
so it is your money!

40
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,570
Seo Woo, I heard from Mr. Kim
that you weren't coming in today.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,630
Are you really not coming in today?

42
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,300
This shoot is very important.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,670
Can't you stop by for a few moments?

44
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,510
- Should we go without this?
- What?

45
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,310
- Seo Woo, you're here.
- Hello.

46
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,550
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,650
I'm really sorry
for springing that on you.

48
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,790
Don't be. Thank you for coming.

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,960
So, shall we get started
with the shoot right away?

50
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,290
Yes.

51
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,960
I'll call you as soon as I find
a suitable home for you.

52
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,030
Thank you in advance.

53
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,100
Sure, no problem.

54
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,500
- Have a good day.
- You too. Get back safely.

(Real Estate Office)

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,610
Hold on.
Seok Jin's office isn't far from here.

57
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,950
Seo Woo didn't come to work?

58
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,820
She got a job?

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,950
My gosh. You didn't know?

60
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,560
Seo Woo works at our company.

61
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,090
(Kim Dae Sik)

62
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,090
What?

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,630
Seo Woo works at Seok Jin's company?

64
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,460
So, you don't know anything.

65
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,800
What should I do?
Can I tell you this or not?

66
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,470
It's fine. Hurry up and tell me.
What's going on?

67
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,970
The thing is...

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,010
Seok Jin and Seo Woo are dating.

69
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,120
Mom, what brings you here?

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,620
I came to check something.

71
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,020
Is Seo Woo here?

72
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,460
What? Why are you asking
about Seo Woo all of a sudden?

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,060
Seo Woo isn't here.

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Are you sure?

75
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,900
Is she really not here?

76
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,860
No, what's going on?

77
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,730
- Well done.
- Thank you!

78
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,100
- Good job.
- Thank you.

79
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,570
- Did you get everything?
- Yes.

80
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,110
Hey, Seok Jin.

81
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,640
Why are you here?

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,150
Hello, Ms. Lee.

83
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,550
You said Seo Woo wasn't here.

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,650
So, why is she here now?

85
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,960
Well, that's...

86
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,560
Seo Woo, when did you start working here?

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,700
Just recently.

88
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,100
Why did you get a job here?

89
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,340
- Pardon?
- There are many other companies.

90
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,100
Why Seok Jin's company?

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,470
Mom, we shouldn't talk about this here.

92
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,040
I'll tell you everything later.

93
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,080
You, listen to me carefully.

94
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,980
I'm against you dating Seok Jin.

95
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,150
I won't say more
since we're at the office.

96
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,820
But I'm sure you get what I mean by now.

97
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,860
We'll talk later at home.

98
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,110
Don't worry too much.

99
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,710
I'll talk to her.

100
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,550
Will that make things better?

101
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,690
I've had this thought for a while,

102
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,020
but your mom seems to really hate me.

103
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,090
Also,

104
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,660
I felt distant from you lately,
and I was honestly so anxious.

105
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,500
It felt as though
I wasn't in the same league as you.

106
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,270
I was a little sad about that,

107
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,410
but with your mom adding to all that...

108
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,310
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

109
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,250
I'm sure it's because our families
are in a complicated situation.

110
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,550
Let's give it some time.

111
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,290
(Buddumak Korean Cuisine)

112
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,630
What? My brother is dating Seo Woo?

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,670
I guess you didn't know either.

114
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,900
But how?

115
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,270
I thought my brother was too busy
to date anyone.

116
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,510
Seo Woo is working
at your brother's company as a model.

117
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,040
I see.

118
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,810
They'll be in so much trouble
if my mom finds out.

119
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,780
- Why?
- Well, because of the lottery ticket.

120
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,080
Both of our mothers are
so emotionally on edge right now.

121
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,050
That's what I'm worried about.

122
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,860
My mom is really opposed to this too.

123
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,530
Does your mother not approve
of your sister dating my brother?

124
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,290
Of course not. Hey.

125
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,860
Your mother doesn't like it.
Why would my mom be any different?

126
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,470
- Ah Jin.
- Oh, Dong Min.

127
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,110
By the way,
I stopped by Seok Jin's office yesterday.

128
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,480
Seok Jin says that you live
right next door to Ah Jin.

129
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,250
Yes, well...

130
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,620
Dong Min. Shall we go somewhere?
I've been feeling cooped up today.

131
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,490
Shall we? Let's go on a date, then.

132
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,020
Wait just a minute.
I'll go and grab my bag.

133
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Okay.

134
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,070
Is something wrong?

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,010
What?

136
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,240
Well, you haven't said anything
for a while.

137
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,210
I was wondering what was going on.

138
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,980
I just have a lot on my mind.

139
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,250
Did something happen
between you and Han Tae Ha?

140
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,890
What? Why?

141
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,460
The two of you seemed unusually awkward.

142
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,690
I'm right, aren't I?

143
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,060
It's hot. Shall we go to a coffee shop?

144
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,070
It's on me.

145
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,100
- Coffee? But...
- Where's my wallet?

146
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,240
Why are you looking for your wallet?
I'll pay.

147
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,210
No, you always pay for me.

148
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Here it is.

149
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
What is that wallet?

150
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,950
Oh, Han Tae Ha got a freebie
and gave it to me.

151
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,220
Pretty, isn't it?

152
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,960
Han Tae Ha?

153
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,890
He always nagged me for liking freebies,

154
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,260
but he brought this for me.

155
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,630
He's a funny guy.

156
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
You.

157
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,930
What about the wallet I gave you?
Why are you using that one?

158
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,940
Well, that's...

159
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,940
To be honest,
the wallet you gave me is too nice.

160
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm saving it for later.

161
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,540
I don't want to get it dirty
from using it roughly.

162
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,510
Gosh, I'm about to be upset.

163
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,950
It's true.
I kept it safe since it was too precious.

164
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,150
All right.

165
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,050
Use the one I gave you from now on.

166
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,760
- Okay, I will.
- Let's go.

167
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,730
Put your wallet away.
I'm buying everything today.

168
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,490
We're having ice cream.

169
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,880
I need to hurry
and sell the Daewoon Building now.

170
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,390
About the owner of the Daewoon Building.

171
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,060
Why is it under your name?

172
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,290
Oh, the landlord
has the same name as mine.

173
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,890
Auntie.

174
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,900
Thank you.

175
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,240
Aren't you eating?

176
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,470
Oh, I have an upset stomach.

177
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,980
Eat up, Min Yong.

178
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
Okay.

179
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,150
Min Yong.

180
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,320
Did you ever...

181
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,820
want a little brother or sister?

182
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,290
A little brother or sister?

183
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,220
You're an only child.

184
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,690
I'm an only child too,

185
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
and I often think about how lonely I am.

186
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,430
How about you?

187
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
I feel the same way.

188
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,670
It has always been just men in my house,

189
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,970
so I thought it would be nice
to have a little sister.

190
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,110
A little sister?

191
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,880
Then, it should be a girl.

192
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,880
- What?
- What?

193
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,480
Oh, nothing.

194
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,020
So, do you think you'd like it
if you had a younger sibling now?

195
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,590
Gosh, how could I have
a new younger sibling now?

196
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,290
Still, if I do,

197
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,330
I'll take such good care of her,

198
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,830
so she won't be lonely like me.

199
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,700
Are you lonely?

200
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,270
I don't have a mom,

201
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,340
so I was always home alone
since I was little.

202
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,070
Dad was working,

203
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,640
and Uncle was either working or at school.

204
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,180
I did have a few stepmoms,

205
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,680
but they didn't really care about me.
They just made me play on my own.

206
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,720
I see.

207
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,590
So, if I get a younger sibling,

208
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,360
I will never let her feel like I did.

209
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,260
I'll take care of her,

210
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,260
teach her how to read and write,

211
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,200
take her to amusement parks,

212
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,300
and cherish her more than anyone.

213
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,870
Is that right?

214
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,940
(Jackpot Chicken)

215
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,660
That lottery ticket.

216
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,830
Is it true...

217
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,970
that I gave it to you?

218
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,940
It's true.

219
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,040
After you won the lottery,

220
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,340
you said...

221
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,980
you never got a good night's sleep, right?

222
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,090
That's right.

223
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,790
I will...

224
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
believe you.

225
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,400
You tried to give it back to me,
but you missed your chance.

226
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,100
When I came back to life,
you had already used some of the money.

227
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
I'll just think...

228
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,070
that you couldn't tell me
because of many circumstances.

229
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,510
This whole situation
with the lottery ticket.

230
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,350
Let's forget it ever happened.

231
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,890
Are you sure?

232
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,490
Will you really do that for me?

233
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,600
My memories haven't fully come back yet,

234
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,700
and suspecting you
will only be hard on me.

235
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,770
That's why I'm going to believe you.

236
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,810
Thanks.

237
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,110
But still,

238
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,910
my resentment for what you did
isn't all gone.

239
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,250
The fact that you lied to me...

240
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,420
still hurts me
like a wound that won't heal easily.

241
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,220
Also, my wife says...

242
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,160
she will take back every last penny
of the winnings you took.

243
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,830
That's beyond my control.

244
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,160
All right. I understand.

245
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,170
When I woke up after hurting my head,

246
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,440
I remembered you guys
right after my grandma.

247
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,650
I went to find you guys,
the two people who know me best...

248
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,880
and understand me the most
in this whole world.

249
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,720
I went through a lot to find you again,
and you guys are my friends.

250
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
I don't want to...

251
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
lose you guys again.

252
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm so sorry, Mu Chul.

253
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,870
Hey, Mr. Kim.

254
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,710
I'm trying to put a commercial building up
for sale right now.

255
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,680
Yes, it's a four-story building
in a great location.

256
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,150
If anyone is interested, let me know.

257
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,890
Okay.

258
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,690
Yes, I'll call you again later.

259
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,830
(Number One Real Estate)

260
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,730
What happened? What did Mu Chul say?

261
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,370
Why? What's up with you?

262
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Mu Chul says...

263
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,440
he'll forget it ever happened.

264
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,980
He still resents me for some things,
but he'll just let it go.

265
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,980
For the sake of our friendship.

266
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,120
Gyu Tae.

267
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,220
I'm grateful to Mu Chul,
but I feel so guilty at the same time...

268
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,590
that I don't know what to do.

269
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,960
We're friends, you know.

270
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,160
I was blinded by money at that moment...

271
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,500
and did something
I can't forgive myself for.

272
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
And yet, he wants to forgive me
because I'm his friend.

273
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,140
Gyu Tae. From now on,

274
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,440
I'll be so good to him
and make sure I never let him down.

275
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,240
So, you shouldn't let him down either.

276
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,750
Please, Gyu Tae. All right?

277
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,100
Hey, is everything all right?

278
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,400
Well, I heard...

279
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,840
Mu Chul forgave Dae Sik.

280
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,380
About that lottery ticket?

281
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,750
My gosh.
Mu Chul really has changed so much.

282
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,680
I thought he'd demand
to get everything back.

283
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,490
So? What are you going to do?

284
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,220
Are you really going to sell
the Daewoon Building?

285
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,090
He even forgave Dae Sik.

286
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,830
Why don't you just tell him the truth now?

287
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,230
Who knows? He might forgive you too.

288
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,930
Since Mu Chul is responding like that,

289
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,440
I really can't tell him.

290
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,710
And Jin Tae.

291
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,740
There's another thing you don't know.

292
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,250
What? What's that?

293
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,850
I'll tell you later. Actually,

294
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,490
I'm not even sure
if it's something I can tell you.

295
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,690
Anyway,

296
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,620
my situation is different from Dae Sik's.

297
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,430
It's not that simple.

298
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,500
Then what are you going to do?

299
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,600
Whatever you decide to do, I trust you.

300
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,710
Just...

301
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,110
remember that. All right, then.

302
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,260
I'm home.

303
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,330
Hey.

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,700
Seok Jin, let's talk.

305
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,740
How long has it been?

306
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,140
When did you start dating Seo Woo?

307
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,080
When Farm to Market opened.

308
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,350
What?

309
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,580
Even after all that mess with Tae Hyung,

310
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,080
you still started seeing her?

311
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,250
What on earth are you thinking?

312
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,190
You nearly had to cancel
Farm to Market's opening because of her.

313
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,590
Don't you remember?

314
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,460
That was because of Tae Hyung.
It had nothing to do with Seo Woo.

315
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,900
Fine, let's say
it had nothing to do with her.

316
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,000
But why would you date a girl like her
when you have everything going for you?

317
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,640
Did she go to a good school?
Is she from a good family?

318
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,470
She comes across as a party girl.

319
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,310
Do you know...

320
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,750
how many guys I've seen
waiting outside the house to see her?

321
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,350
She might have been like that in the past,
but not anymore.

322
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,320
- What?
- And Seo Woo...

323
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,490
helped and supported me emotionally...

324
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,190
when I was stressed about
the grand opening being postponed.

325
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,930
She was genuinely worried about me
and heartbroken for me.

326
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,190
That was probably because she felt guilty.

327
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,030
She was the one
who got you into that mess.

328
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,100
Anyone with a conscience
would feel bad and guilty.

329
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,670
Anyway, she's not as simpleminded
and thoughtless as you think.

330
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,170
So?

331
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,240
Are you saying you'll keep seeing her?

332
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,280
It's my problem, so let me handle it.

333
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,740
I'll never approve of her!

334
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,680
Even if she weren't Mi Ja's daughter,
I'd disapprove of her.

335
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,050
You want me to accept Mi Ja's daughter
as your girlfriend?

336
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,920
That will never happen.

337
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,720
Keep dating her if you want me dead.

338
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Come here.

339
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,580
Where did you go?

340
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,780
I told you not to go out.
Did you see Kim Seok Jin again?

341
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,920
No, I just stepped out
to go to the office.

342
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,720
You went there to see him!

343
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,920
Do you really want to do this
even after what happened yesterday?

344
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,460
With the son of the thief
who stole your dad's lottery ticket?

345
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,400
It's possible he didn't steal it.
Why are you jumping to conclusions?

346
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,730
What?

347
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
I'm home.

348
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,500
Are you trying to make me drop dead,
you brat?

349
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,300
You. Wait right here.

350
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,410
Where did you go?

351
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,650
I went to see Dae Sik.

352
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,490
And? What did he say?

353
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,490
Don't tell me...

354
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,430
About the lottery ticket, I told him
we should just put it behind us.

355
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,600
Who says
we can put it behind us and move on?

356
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,100
I made it clear to you
that I'd never agree to that!

357
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,700
I know you feel that it's unfair, but...

358
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,870
What do you even know?

359
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,070
Do you even know what my children
and I had to go through after you died?

360
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,570
After you died,

361
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,240
I lost everything overnight,
even our house!

362
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,380
Do you know what that was like?

363
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,150
Those people said nothing
even though they saw it all.

364
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,220
Afraid of losing the money,
they kept their mouths shut.

365
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,690
If we let it go, it's my call.
Who are you to decide?

366
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,720
I absolutely can't let it go.

367
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,960
I refuse!

368
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,900
Be sure to state your stance firmly today.

369
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,600
Especially you, Ah Jin.

370
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,910
Is this really necessary?

371
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,470
Honestly, I do understand
where Dad is coming from.

372
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,710
I'd want to give the money back
to my friend too.

373
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,680
What are you saying? That's our money.

374
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,250
They gave it to us, so that's that.

375
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Right, Seok Jin?

376
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,380
I looked up some precedents.

377
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,720
We're not obligated to return it
if he gave it to us without saying...

378
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,890
he wanted to split it.

379
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
See?

380
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,490
If you say you disagree with us,

381
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,790
I'll no longer consider you my sister.

382
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
Dad.

383
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,370
Dad, let's talk.

384
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,010
What is it? Just say it.

385
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,910
About the lottery winnings.

386
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,110
Forget 500,000 dollars.
We each want 5 million.

387
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,580
What? Five million?

388
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,820
I heard you decided to give
half of the lottery money to that family.

389
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,050
We absolutely can't let that happen.

390
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,660
We'd rather have you
give us five million each.

391
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,930
I agree with Mi Jin.

392
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,630
Instead of giving away half the money,

393
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,930
I think you should just give it all to us.

394
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,700
I agree. I want to claim my share too,
just like Mi Jin and Seok Jin.

395
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,940
You guys, what is this?

396
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,910
Why are you demanding money from me?

397
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,410
I can do whatever I want with my money.

398
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,750
Who do you think you are
to step in like this?

399
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,850
Do you think your father is a joke?

400
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,720
Dad, you said
he gave you that lottery ticket.

401
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
Then you don't have to give it back.

402
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,250
I understand that you feel bad
because he's your friend,

403
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,960
but giving it back now
may only complicate things.

404
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,630
Okay, but why are you telling me
what to do with my money?

405
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,200
You have no say
in what I do with that money,

406
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,360
so I don't want to hear anything from you.

407
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,030
Think about how frustrated
they must've been to bring this up.

408
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Mom.

409
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,940
You hesitate to spend
even a dime on your wife and kids,

410
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,410
but you're eager
to give away millions to a friend.

411
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,410
I'd be so frustrated too.

412
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,080
That's enough!

413
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,210
Dad, I'm a parent too.

414
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,450
I think it's understandable
when parents can't provide something...

415
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,650
because they don't have the money.

416
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,850
I know you both raised us
with a lot of love,

417
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,690
but let's be honest.
Financially, you haven't done much for us.

418
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,460
I could understand
when we didn't have money,

419
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,460
but if you do now,
you should help your children first.

420
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,330
This isn't right.

421
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,930
It's wrong to prioritize helping others
before your own family.

422
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,070
To be honest, I understand
why Mom wants to divorce you.

423
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,640
- What?
- Look at this now.

424
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,120
If you cared about us, how could you
even think of giving that money away?

425
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,220
You only say that because you care more
about your friend than us!

426
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,190
All right.

427
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,390
I now know what you guys think.

428
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,330
I heard it loud and clear.

429
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,140
Hye Sook.

430
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,970
You said you wanted a divorce.

431
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,710
All right. Let's get divorced.

432
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,380
And you guys.

433
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,180
I want you all to move out.

434
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,220
If you hate your father that much,

435
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,850
move out and live on your own.

436
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,420
Are we good now?

437
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,570
(Daewoon)

438
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,390
(Number One Real Estate)

439
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,620
Gyu Tae.

440
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,460
Hey, let's talk.

441
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,000
I happened to overhear something
while walking by.

442
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,170
You're selling the Daewoon Building?
What does that mean?

443
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,900
What? The Daewoon Building?

444
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,670
Don't try to weasel out of this
like before.

445
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,080
I already checked
all the registration records...

446
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,780
and overheard your conversation
with Jin Tae.

447
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,050
So,

448
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,520
you mean you're the current owner
of the Daewoon Building?

449
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,760
Then, the money you've been spending
all this time...

450
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,160
was Mu Chul's money?

451
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,100
How could you do such a thing?

452
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,910
Even if you had to pay
Min Yong's hospital bills urgently!

453
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,680
Well, you can go and tell him now.

454
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,450
Go to Mu Chul and tell him the truth!

455
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,820
You don't have to worry.
I'll take care of it.

456
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,450
Take care of what?

457
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,790
If that were possible,
things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

458
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,460
Don't you have a conscience?

459
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,690
How could you do such a thing
and pretend not to know about it?

460
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,800
What? A conscience?

461
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,400
That's right, a conscience.

462
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,600
You're behaving like this now...

463
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,330
because you don't have anyone
to tell you stuff like this.

464
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,370
But still,

465
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,840
how could you trick your friend?

466
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,410
Have you always been this pathetic?

467
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,110
I get it, so just leave.

468
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,350
Promise me you'll tell him now
before it's too late. Please?

469
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,850
If you don't, I'm really going
to be disappointed in you.

470
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,960
I only told you
since you said you knew everything.

471
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,730
I didn't tell you this
to get an earful from you.

472
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,200
Also, my head already hurts enough
without you adding to it.

473
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,470
Gosh, please just go. Leave!

474
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,870
Gyu Tae.

475
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,340
Please say it.

476
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,310
I'm begging you. Please?

477
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,440
What is wrong with you?

478
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,880
Let go of me!

479
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,310
Gyu Tae!

480
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,250
I said, let go of me!

481
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,380
Oh, what...

482
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,350
Hey, are you okay?

483
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,290
So, why did you have to provoke me?

484
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,450
(Good Luck!)

485
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,650
No matter what you say,

486
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,650
I will get that money back for sure.

487
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,450
I can't leave. I'm too anxious
Dad might hand over the rest of the money.

488
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,520
You're trying to extort money.

489
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,390
- Ms. Lee!
- What?

490
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,600
If anything might cause
a misunderstanding between us,

491
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
we'll tell each other in advance. Okay?
