(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,240
The three million dollars...

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,480
What if I took care of that for you?

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,350
Sorry?

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,180
What? Three million dollars?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,790
But how? It is a lot of money.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,120
More importantly, why would you...

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,090
pay off his debt for him?

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,260
Mu Chul really wants
to get his identity back,

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,870
so I want to help him.

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,900
We will have to look into it
to figure out the exact amount,

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,170
but Mu Chul and I can take turns
making the monthly payments,

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,810
or I could act as a joint surety for him.
I'll find a solution.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,210
What? He will act as a surety?

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,120
I really appreciate your offer,

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,720
but it's such a huge amount of money,

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,350
so I don't know what to say.

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,690
It's okay. I don't want to pressure you.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,990
Excuse me.

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,460
Aren't you going in?

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,800
Sorry.

22
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,730
(The Best Fried Chicken)

23
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,670
I wanted to talk
to Mu Chul about it first,

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,770
but I didn't want
to make him uncomfortable,

25
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,300
so I figured I should just talk to you.

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,140
So, discuss it with him and let me know.

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,510
Yes, I will.

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,110
Do you want plain fried chicken
or the spicy kind?

29
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,410
- You have customers.
- Oh, yes.

30
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,250
- I should get going.
- All right, see you.

31
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,720
- Bye.
- Hello, come on in.

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,280
- Hello.
- Yes, you can take this table.

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,790
(Number One Real Estate, Jackpot Chicken)

34
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,700
I beg your pardon?

35
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,100
You know, that time when
the lottery prize kept accumulating...

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,340
because there were no winners
for a few weeks.

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,380
The prize was 35.7 million dollars.

38
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,380
Did you say 35.7 million dollars?

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,520
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

40
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,490
You should pick different numbers.

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,550
The same set won't win again.

42
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,860
Hey, Mu Chul.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,670
Mi Ja...

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,670
Someone already won the lottery...

45
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,540
with the set of numbers that matches
the construction completion date.

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,310
My gosh! Are you serious? When?

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,280
Before I lost my memory.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,810
In the neighboring neighborhood.

49
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,850
If I always used to buy lottery tickets
with those numbers,

50
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,480
how come I never won?

51
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,550
Did I not buy a lottery ticket that week?

52
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,560
Or did I lose it?
And then, someone else found it?

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,930
Well, all I know is that you always used
to buy lottery tickets with those numbers.

54
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,260
We never sat down together
to check the winning numbers.

55
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,900
Right. I'm sure I always bought
lottery tickets in our neighborhood.

56
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,430
Why would I buy it
in a different neighborhood?

57
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,400
I guess I never bought
any lottery tickets that week.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,370
No, you always bought lottery tickets
in different neighborhoods.

59
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,510
You said buying them
from the same place...

60
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,280
would reduce the chances of winning.

61
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,910
I'm pretty sure you rarely bought them
in our neighborhood.

62
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,120
My gosh.

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,190
They said those exact numbers
would never win again,

64
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,220
so I'll just give up now.

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,160
No, I always used those numbers
to play the lottery.

66
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,060
Someone else won with those numbers
the one week I didn't play.

67
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,600
What a shame. I'm so disappointed.

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,830
Seriously.

69
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,440
It is such a shame!

70
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,240
The person who won with those numbers
must be so happy.

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,810
Gosh, I'm upset.

72
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,810
Oh, right.

73
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,510
I saw Mr. Kim earlier.

74
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,850
He offered
to take care of your remaining debt...

75
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,780
of three million dollars.

76
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,450
What?

77
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,090
What was it?

78
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,660
He said it could be paid back
in installments,

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,790
or he could act as a joint surety.
Something like that.

80
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,830
- Oh, my.
- You're surprised, right?

81
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,230
I was so surprised that
I couldn't even ask him any questions.

82
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,140
I told him I'd discuss it with you
and let him know.

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,910
Why do you think
Mr. Kim is suddenly doing that?

84
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,510
Oh, right. The other day, I told him
I wished I'd had three million dollars.

85
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,280
That's probably why.

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,820
So, you did mention that to him.

87
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,990
Yes.

88
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,090
I told him I wanted to pay off my debt
as soon as possible...

89
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,830
so I could live without shame.

90
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,530
Dae Sik said that?

91
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm so grateful.

92
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Mu Chul.

93
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,350
Do you know why I fell for you
and decided to marry you?

94
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,920
You didn't even go to college
or have a good job,

95
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,120
so why did I go
against my parents' wishes...

96
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,520
and decide to marry you?

97
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,790
Because of your resilience and persistence
that would help you...

98
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,900
survive anywhere in the world.

99
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Resilience and persistence?

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,700
You know,

101
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,740
you went from having nothing
to owning several buildings.

102
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,270
I know the inheritance
from my parents helped you at the start,

103
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,480
but it wasn't a lot of money.

104
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,050
I know you would have become wealthy
even without my help...

105
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,850
because you were
such a diligent and capable man.

106
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,620
I was?

107
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,490
Yes, you were.

108
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,160
So, believe in yourself
and try to be confident.

109
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,990
You will regain your memory soon,

110
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,100
and everything will return
to how it's supposed to be.

111
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,900
I will help and support you
by your side...

112
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,370
to make sure we can make it happen.

113
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,970
Thank you, Mi Ja.

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,480
About Mr. Kim's offer,
let's give it some more thought.

115
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,580
I know he's your friend,
but it's a huge amount.

116
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,080
Wouldn't you feel uncomfortable
accepting such an offer?

117
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,650
Yes.

118
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,550
Today,

119
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,790
when I saw Gyu Tae and Dae Sik,

120
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,960
I felt that I had lived my life well.

121
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,960
It's not easy...

122
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,000
to have friends
who genuinely want to help you like that.

123
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Once I...

124
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,100
regain my memory,

125
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,310
I will repay them for everything.

126
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,980
For sure. We really should...

127
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,780
repay them for their kindness
for the rest of our lives.

128
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,090
What? Three million dollars?

129
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,660
How could he? It's so much money.

130
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,230
Mother.

131
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,260
Can we talk?

132
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,530
You know, I thought about it.

133
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,540
About the 500,000 dollars
Father mentioned.

134
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
No.

135
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,070
I don't want to hear it now.

136
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,780
What?

137
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,850
We should at least get that money.

138
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,690
What if we end up with nothing
at this rate?

139
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,890
So, about Dong Min.

140
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,060
Don't you think
he's such a wonderful person?

141
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,360
Seeing how he treated
his grandmother earlier,

142
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,260
I think he's so sweet.

143
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,470
Maybe it's because
I grew up watching my dad.

144
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,740
I'm really into sweet guys
who are family-oriented.

145
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,410
So, I've fallen for him again.

146
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,410
"Again?"

147
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,250
Oh, back in elementary school,

148
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,310
Dong Min came over to our house...

149
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,850
and comforted me when I was crying.

150
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,990
I thought that was so charming and sweet.

151
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,920
I was totally smitten in that moment,

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,920
and now I've fallen for him
all over again.

153
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,990
Hey, do you...

154
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,530
actually have feelings for him?

155
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,430
- What?
- I mean...

156
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,600
Not as your childhood first love.

157
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
Do you have feelings for him now?

158
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,070
Well...

159
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,810
I'm going to take out the trash.

160
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,820
What's this? Is it really true?

161
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
(Break time)

162
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,400
Dong Min.

163
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Hey, Ah Jin.

164
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,930
Why are you coming from over there?

165
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
I was taking out the trash.

166
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,470
I didn't think you'd come today,
but here you are.

167
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,470
Me?

168
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:22,970
Why wouldn't I come?

169
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,640
I saw you with your grandma earlier.

170
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,040
Someone called Grandma Cutie-pie?

171
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,780
Oh, did you see us?

172
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,350
You should've said hello if you saw me.

173
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,250
It seemed like you were having a good time
with your grandma.

174
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,290
By the way, is she your actual grandma?

175
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,660
Yes, but she has dementia.

176
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,690
She thinks I'm my grandpa.

177
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,730
Still, it was nice to see
how affectionate you were with her.

178
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,740
My grandma took care of me a lot
since I was little.

179
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,010
Maybe that's why
she doesn't recognize anyone else,

180
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,770
but she's always so happy to see me.

181
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,480
She calls me, "Old man."

182
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,540
(Buddumak)

183
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,750
Actually, when I heard you
calling someone "Cutie,"

184
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,580
I thought it was your girlfriend.

185
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,520
You nearly fooled me.

186
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,990
What you just said...

187
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,290
sounds like you were relieved.

188
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,990
Gosh, it's not like that.

189
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,230
You're always teasing me.

190
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,630
I'm kidding. Gosh, you're so adorable
when you act like this.

191
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,170
Oh, right.
Would you happen to have time tomorrow?

192
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,040
Tomorrow? Why?

193
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,940
My company is having
a new product launch event.

194
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,640
We can invite people if we want to.

195
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,950
They'll have lectures on cooking...

196
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,110
and have a raffle.

197
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,380
I thought it might be fun to go together.
Do you want to come?

198
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,250
Is it okay for me to come along
on a work event?

199
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,250
Yes.

200
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,590
They said it was okay to bring a date.

201
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,990
A date?

202
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,260
(Jang Dong Gun has sent you money,
100,000 dollars)

203
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,870
Wait, how did you already send me
a share of the profits?

204
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,340
Well, the stock prices...

205
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,080
for a nuclear energy company
I recently bought...

206
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,680
are going through the roof.

207
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,810
Next time, I'll be able to give you
more than triple that amount.

208
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,820
Triple?

209
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,490
Gosh, you sure are impressive, Mr. Jang.

210
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,490
You flatter me.

211
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,720
Maybe it's because
the market is doing well,

212
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,030
but my cousin looked into buying
more shares in renewable energy.

213
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,030
I see.

214
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,100
This seems to be
the perfect market entry point.

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,900
Market... What?

216
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,470
Oh, I mean the point in time
where you enter a new market.

217
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,480
You know how investments are
all about timing, right?

218
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,180
If you can afford to do so,

219
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,550
it would be beneficial for you
to take this chance to invest more.

220
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,750
Oh, but the thing is,

221
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,760
I made my previous investment
with every last dollar I had.

222
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,090
I don't have any extra cash to spare.

223
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,300
I see. Then, what about using leverage?

224
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,340
Leverage?

225
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,000
You can take out a loan...

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,940
using your asset as collateral
and invest with that money.

227
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,570
This strategy is...

228
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,940
like taking 1 step back
to take 2 steps forward.

229
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,780
By any chance,

230
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,980
do you have any assets
that you could put up as collateral?

231
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,950
All I could put up as collateral
is the Daewoon Building.

232
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,060
What should I do?

233
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,090
If Mu Chul's memory comes back,

234
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,930
I have to give that back.

235
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,800
Oh, well...

236
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,000
You should give it some thought.

237
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,230
Investments are all about timing.

238
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,640
Don't forget.

239
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,110
Right.

240
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,310
Hey, I'm sorry.

241
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,750
Thanks for setting me up on a blind date,

242
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,780
but I'm not really interested.

243
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,320
Gosh, so why did you arrange a date...

244
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,550
when I said I didn't want to?

245
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,120
I know you were just thinking of me.

246
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,590
Okay, I understand.

247
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,490
Sorry, and thank you.

248
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Come to the cafe sometime.

249
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,100
Hey, Gyu Tae.

250
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Hey.

251
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,670
Did you go somewhere?

252
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,040
Yes, I had some business.

253
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,950
How did your blind date go?

254
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,950
My blind date?

255
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,380
How did you know about that?

256
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,420
I saw you when I came to your cafe.

257
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,060
He's supposed to be younger than you,
but he didn't look that young.

258
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,500
Looks aren't important.
A man's personality is what matters.

259
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,930
He's a hard worker
and has a strong sense of responsibility.

260
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,270
He's just my type.

261
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,370
And what about you?
Are things going well with that woman?

262
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,580
You know, that Mrs. Something.

263
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,550
You seem really into her,
seeing how you bought her a necklace.

264
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,520
Of course. Once a woman becomes mine,

265
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,220
I'm so good to her.

266
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,620
Hey, a necklace is nothing.

267
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,490
I could even buy her a house
if she were to ask for it.

268
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,120
Are you crazy?
Why would you buy her a house?

269
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,630
Why? Did she ask for a house?

270
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,230
No, my dear Mrs. Taylor doesn't expect
things like that from a man.

271
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,900
Did that woman perhaps
approach you for your money?

272
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,010
You make a lot of money these days.
You drive a nice car too.

273
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,710
Gosh, I told you it wasn't like that.

274
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,680
Why do you keep trying
to slander Mrs. Taylor?

275
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,780
Anyway,
what time do you get off work later?

276
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,280
I said I'd bring you side dishes,
but I couldn't bring them.

277
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,750
I was going to go home
and bring them to you.

278
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,590
Forget it.
We have plenty of side dishes at my house.

279
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,860
Just eat them yourself.
Don't bring them. Leave them.

280
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,320
They're for Min Yong, okay?

281
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,330
Didn't you hear him? He said
he liked my spicy dried squid strips...

282
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,730
and pan-fried anchovies the most.

283
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,530
Okay, then. Fine.

284
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,500
I'll call you later.

285
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,130
I'm off.

286
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,800
Why don't you go on another blind date?

287
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,140
My goodness.

288
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,380
(Farm to Market, Open call for models)

289
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,010
Gosh, look at the number of visitors.

290
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,150
Seok Jin is so impressive.

291
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,590
What? "Open call for models?"

292
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,800
I'd appreciate it if you could avoid
visiting our office whenever you please.

293
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
(Apply, Name: Han Seo Woo)

294
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,380
Hey, Ye Won. I came home to pick it up.

295
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,010
Let's talk when I get to the office. Bye.

296
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Seo Woo.

297
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,920
I thought you were going to work earlier.
Why are you still here?

298
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,620
Oh, I was out for a meeting nearby
and came to pick something up.

299
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,820
I see.

300
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,230
What are you doing?
What if someone sees us?

301
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,430
Who cares? Let them see.

302
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,400
Can't we just tell our parents
that we're dating?

303
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,670
Now isn't the time to tell my family.

304
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,040
What? Why?

305
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,840
I'll tell you more later.

306
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,810
By the way, are you going somewhere?

307
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,950
I was going to meet a friend.

308
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,250
What are you doing after work?
Should we have dinner together?

309
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,320
Okay, let's do that.
Call me after you decide what you want.

310
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,150
Oh, my. Seo Woo, you're still here.

311
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,560
You're here too, Seok Jin.

312
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,590
Yes, hello.

313
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,300
Oh, right. About Seo Woo.

314
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,170
Do you know if she's seeing someone now?

315
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,510
Why are you suddenly asking about Seo Woo?

316
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,680
Well, she seems to be following
Seok Jin around these days.

317
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,980
It's been a while. Are you doing well?

318
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,850
Yes.

319
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,550
Then, I'll be going.

320
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,290
Oh, wait a minute.

321
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,260
I heard you opened
an online shopping mall.

322
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,460
I know it's late, but congratulations.

323
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you.

324
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,870
Okay, then. Go on.

325
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,530
- Okay. Bye, then.
- Bye.

326
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,840
- I'm off too.
- Wait!

327
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,380
You're seeing someone these days,
aren't you?

328
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,850
Who is that guy?

329
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,620
I'll introduce you some other time.

330
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,920
You're not... Is it Seok Jin...

331
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,720
No, it can't be.

332
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,220
You.

333
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,330
If you have no pride and chase after a guy
who doesn't even like you,

334
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,260
you're so dead. I'll see to it myself.

335
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,400
They say that a woman should date
a man who likes her,

336
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
not a man she likes.

337
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,240
That way,
you won't have any regrets, okay?

338
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,700
Mom, don't you know me?

339
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,740
Guys line up and chase after me.

340
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,240
I have never once chased after a guy!

341
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,510
I'll be going.

342
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,350
But...

343
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,490
Gosh, that brat is making me nervous.

344
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,550
Here, Ye Won.

345
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,860
Okay, thanks.

346
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,060
By the way, about the 4.5 million dollars.

347
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,230
You should have it by the end of the week.

348
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,660
Gosh, thank you.

349
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,970
I'm sorry we can't expand
the distribution center because of me.

350
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,770
There you go again.
I told you. It's really fine.

351
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,240
But our sales are increasing these days.

352
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,470
It hurts to lose
all the extra sales we could bring in.

353
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,540
There's no need for that.

354
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,540
What's this?

355
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,550
(Distribution Collaboration Agreement)

356
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,580
"K.Win Logis?"

357
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,890
My dad says he'll sign
a collaboration agreement...

358
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,190
with Farm to Market.

359
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,260
We can ship our company's products
through K.Win Logis from now on.

360
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,590
We'll be able to use
the warehouse, the shipping system,

361
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,370
and the entire distribution system
that K.Win Logis has.

362
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,870
Is that for real?
Did your dad really say that?

363
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,840
Don't get the wrong idea.
I didn't do anything.

364
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,540
My dad made the decision
after meeting you.

365
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,680
You made it happen. All of it.

366
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,480
Make sure you tell your father
that I sincerely thank him.

367
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,050
No. Set something up soon.

368
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,790
I'd like to treat him to a meal.

369
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,050
Okay, I will.

370
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,290
Hey, about the model audition.

371
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,760
We should get started on it next week.
What do you think?

372
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,330
Sure, sounds good.

373
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,730
Hey, Seo Woo. What's up?

374
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,800
How about cream pasta for dinner?
I'm craving it.

375
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,110
Sure, sounds good.
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

376
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,840
Are you going somewhere after work?

377
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,180
Yes, I have plans for the evening.

378
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,680
Right. My dad wanted
to have dinner with you.

379
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,820
Your dad? When?

380
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,950
He said, the sooner, the better.

381
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,420
He's leaving soon for a work trip.

382
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,930
How about we do it this evening
since it was brought up?

383
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,590
This evening?

384
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,530
Why? You can't?

385
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,270
Yes, let's do that.
Let's have dinner with him today.

386
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
All right.

387
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Honey.

388
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,820
I'm stepping out to see Dae Sik.

389
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,720
I'll see you later.

390
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Yes.

391
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,530
The soup is going to boil over.
Get going. Go.

392
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,370
My gosh.

393
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,140
Oh, hello.

394
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,840
Yes, it's been a while.

395
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,210
You've been keeping well, right?

396
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,940
Yes, thanks to you.

397
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,110
Should I ask Hye Sook
about the three million dollars?

398
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,350
No. If she doesn't know,
Dae Sik will end up in a pickle.

399
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,090
Everything's well with you, right?

400
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,420
Yes, I'm doing fine.

401
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,760
Should I ask him
about the three million dollars?

402
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,630
No. They're divorced. How would he know?

403
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,770
Well, I heard you and Mi Ja got divorced.

404
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
Sorry?

405
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,640
Oh, but the thing is...

406
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,110
If you don't mind,
can I ask you some questions?

407
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,510
Please don't take offense,
and hear me out.

408
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,820
Don't you give her any money
for living expenses after the divorce?

409
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,890
For living expenses?

410
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,620
I do. Why do you ask?

411
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,130
Oh, I was just wondering
if Mi Ja might need my help.

412
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,300
I figured her pride might be hurt
if I asked her directly,

413
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,100
so I'm asking you instead.

414
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,970
I see. Every month,
she gets 5,000 dollars...

415
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,470
deposited directly into her account.

416
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,880
Where else would I get paid
that much money?

417
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,450
Mi Ja gets 5,000 dollars
deposited directly into her account?

418
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,950
Yes. Oh, you didn't know?

419
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,290
No, I thought we were paying you directly.

420
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,290
Dae Sik is doing it this way
because it's hard to manage cash.

421
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,200
When I see how considerate
Dae Sik is of me these days,

422
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,470
I feel so bad that
I misunderstood his intentions,

423
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,570
albeit only for a short while.

424
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,170
You misunderstood his intentions?

425
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,340
It was nothing serious, though.

426
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,610
Back in high school,
Dae Sik had a crush on Mi Ja, so...

427
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,680
Oh, never mind.

428
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,380
That was just a slip of the tongue.

429
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,150
Gosh, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

430
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,660
I know about it too.

431
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,790
Oh, you know?

432
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,730
Of course.
My husband and I joke about it often.

433
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,500
Right. It's all in the past anyway.

434
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,210
The thing is, back in high school,

435
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,580
I had a crush on Mi Ja.

436
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,950
But one day,
I went over to Dae Sik's place and...

437
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,990
Dae Sik.

438
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Where did he go?

439
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,970
Hi. It's me, Mi Ja.

440
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Let's meet under the streetlight
in the alley at 9 p.m. tonight.

441
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,110
(Hi. It's me, Mi Ja.)

442
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,810
I got sad, thinking she was finally going
to confess her feelings...

443
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,850
to Dae Sik.

444
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
But at that moment,

445
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,720
I happened to come across
the letter he wrote to her.

446
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,990
A letter?

447
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,020
That's right.
I was so surprised when I read it.

448
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,860
What did the letter say?

449
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,430
Mi Ja.

450
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,270
I like you in a romantic way,
not just as a friend.

451
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,440
I don't know
how to express my feelings to you.

452
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,010
But just know this.

453
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,250
You're my first love.

454
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,810
"First love?"

455
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,990
When did you get here?

456
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,620
Just now.

457
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,430
Hey, are you going somewhere?

458
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,330
Yes, I'm meeting someone later.

459
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,830
How do I look? Do I look all right?

460
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes.

461
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,550
Who knew Dae Sik liked Mi Ja too?

462
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,210
Feeling threatened,

463
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,250
I stepped in and sabotaged their plan.

464
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,550
Lee Mi Ja.

465
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,490
You're not my type.

466
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,060
So,

467
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,930
don't ask to see me again.

468
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,530
I don't like you.

469
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,260
From Kim Dae Sik.

470
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,040
Just in case you get the wrong idea
about why I asked to see you,

471
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,510
I like someone else.

472
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,640
So, don't be mistaken.

473
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,310
Bye.

474
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,150
Just like that,

475
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,180
I wrote fake letters and delivered them...

476
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,950
to those two.

477
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,750
But in Dae Sik's room,

478
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,130
I saw piles of letters
he'd written to her...

479
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,360
but never gave to her.

480
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
My goodness.

481
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,270
Oh, what's the matter?

482
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,400
Nothing. I have to go.

483
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,120
Oh, boy. Should I not have said that?

484
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,420
Who cares? That happened 40 years ago.

485
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,090
Hey, Mom. It's me.

486
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,860
Have you had lunch yet?

487
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,760
No, I can't eat in that house right now.

488
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,430
Because of the lottery winnings.
It's a mess.

489
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,300
"Lottery winnings?"

490
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,740
She fights with her sister
during the day...

491
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,240
and with her brother at night.

492
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,940
My wife is totally a wildcat right now.

493
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,280
But you know,
they won a whopping 35.7 million dollars.

494
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,510
Why can't they give five million dollars
to each child?

495
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,950
- I'd just be generous and do that.
- Did he say 35.7 million dollars?

496
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,320
Seriously, what is with them?

497
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,920
Hold on. Did he...

498
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,420
(Number One Real Estate)

499
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,590
If only it weren't for my father-in-law...

500
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,990
Darn, I really regret it.

501
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,430
I should've held on to the lottery ticket.

502
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,100
I can't say anything anymore
since it's his money now.

503
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,470
What can I do?

504
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,270
Darn it.

505
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,310
Hey.

506
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,210
What brings you here?

507
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,680
Mom, I'll call you back later.

508
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,580
Have you eaten yet, Father?

509
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,350
- Come on in.
- Okay.

510
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,690
(The Best Fried Chicken)

511
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,970
(Jackpot Chicken)

512
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,870
So, if Dae Sik is his father-in-law...

513
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,170
Then, the person
who won the lottery must be...

514
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,910
It was Dae Sik?

515
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,590
Even if my letter never reaches you,

516
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,030
I hope you find out how I feel about you.

517
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,130
To my shining first love, L.

518
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,740
So, this "L" was Lee Mi Ja?

519
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
Not me, Lee Hye Sook?

520
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,980
Mi Ja.

521
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,050
I really regret what happened.

522
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,990
When Hye Sook asked me out,
I said yes in a fit of anger.

523
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,190
I really am a fool.

524
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,330
Why did I make that choice?

525
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,760
I guess I can't turn things back now,
can I?

526
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Would I really be able to forget you?

527
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,770
Can I forget you and go on with my life?

528
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Honey.

529
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,350
Who was your first love?

530
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,980
Oh, come on.

531
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,690
Who else would it be? You know it too.

532
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,940
(Good Luck!)

533
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,080
Is he even reading books
for his relationship now?

534
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,980
Oh, what's this?

535
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,350
- See you tomorrow.
- Where is Seok Jin?

536
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,650
He just went that way with Ms. Park.

537
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,950
Where did they go by themselves?

538
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,560
This is the first time
Ye Won brought a boyfriend home.

539
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,220
I prepared a special meal for you.

540
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,260
Right.

541
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
My gosh.

542
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
