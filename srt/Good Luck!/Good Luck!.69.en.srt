00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,740
(Episode 69)

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,740
Hey, honey.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,010
I was wrong.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,680
Gosh, how could I even think
to lend someone...

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,280
such a huge sum of money...

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,380
without even discussing it with you?

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,490
I must've been out of my mind
for a minute.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,420
Please forgive me.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,660
What's this?

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,240
(Application for Divorce
by Mutual Consent)

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,610
Let's...

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,270
get divorced.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,210
Honey, what is with you?
Get divorced? What do you mean?

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,410
I said I was sorry.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,450
Come on. Don't be so mad at me.

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,320
I'm not saying this
because I'm mad at you.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,150
I admit I was really angry with you,

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,120
but I'm not anymore.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,290
Then why would you say you want a divorce?

20
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,390
Because I feel like I don't even know...

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,630
who you are anymore.

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,100
What?

23
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,330
From the moment
I married you at 25 until now,

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,970
even when
we were struggling with no money,

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,800
even when I felt suffocated
taking care of your sick father,

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,970
and even when I worked as a cashier
with our newborn strapped to my back...

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,340
The moment I came home and saw your face,

28
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,080
I felt okay for some strange reason.

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,450
And that's why I stayed with you.

30
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,850
But now,

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,420
when I look at your face,
it feels like I don't know you.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
You are...

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,130
not the Kim Dae Sik I used to know.

34
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,000
You're a stranger I don't know.

35
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,340
No, honey.

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,870
It is me. I am that Kim Dae Sik.

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,850
When you...

38
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,720
offered your first love
the kind of money...

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
you never once gave
to your own wife or kids,

40
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,720
didn't you see this coming?

41
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,890
Read it over...

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
and sign it.

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,500
Wait, honey!

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,300
(Jackpot Chicken)

45
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,640
My gosh.

46
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,550
How did Mr. Choi make so much money?

47
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,250
A building worth ten million dollars?

48
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,650
And it looked like
he was a VIP at the bank.

49
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,950
That's right. He is.

50
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,790
I saw Gyu Tae getting a call
from the bank a little while ago.

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,100
He is actually a VIP at the bank?

52
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,330
Yes.

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,800
Oh, I'm stepping out
to go to the restaurant.

54
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Now?

55
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,770
But you said you were on vacation.

56
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,710
Yes, I am,

57
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,110
but Dae Sik has been
too understanding and kind.

58
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,580
I should work harder.

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,710
Come on. What about me?

60
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,250
I'm having so much fun...

61
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,690
spending the whole day
doing lovey-dovey things with you.

62
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,820
Just stay home with me, please.

63
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,760
My goodness. I want to,

64
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,460
but I need to earn money
as the head of the family.

65
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,460
All right. I'll see you later, then.

66
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,170
See you later.

67
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,310
Have a good day.

68
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,580
You too.

69
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,010
See you!

70
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,110
You're such a prankster.

71
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,320
Actually, this is fascinating.

72
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,090
We used to do this as newlyweds.
How does he remember this?

73
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,030
Seeing this,
I think his memory will come back soon.

74
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,130
Hello, Mr. Jang.

75
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,230
So, I've given it some thought.

76
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,340
I think you're right.

77
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,040
I should invest more money.

78
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,510
So, I asked the bank...

79
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,270
how much I could borrow
using the building as collateral.

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
- That's right.
- Gyu Tae!

81
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,250
Yes, I'll call you back later.

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,280
Hey, are you heading
to the restaurant to work?

83
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,380
Yes.

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,320
Hey, do you own a building?

85
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,290
A building?

86
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,960
Yes. When Mi Ja and I
were at the bank earlier,

87
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,500
we saw you talking to a bank teller...

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,500
about taking out a loan
using a building as collateral.

89
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,170
Oh, that.

90
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,700
Someone I know wants to use
their building as collateral for a loan,

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,370
so I looked into it for them.

92
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,670
Oh, is that right? I see.

93
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,340
Knowing how wealthy you are now,

94
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,610
I assumed you owned a building.

95
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,310
Well, I see.

96
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,180
Anyway, why did you go to the bank?
You don't even have your own account.

97
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,180
Mi Ja said we should practice
withdrawing cash from an ATM,

98
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,250
so we went there together.

99
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,250
Is that right?

100
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,190
It seems like you and your wife
are getting along better these days.

101
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,490
Yes, things have been really great
between us lately.

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,330
I can't really recall
how it was as newlyweds,

103
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,470
but it feels like
we're back to being newlyweds.

104
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Also,

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,970
Mi Ja said
she'd help me get my memory back.

106
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,540
Your memory?

107
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,380
She said it would help me if she told me
what she knows about my past.

108
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,220
We decided to recover my memory together,

109
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,720
and I'm looking forward to it.

110
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,890
- I see. Good luck.
- Thanks.

111
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,860
- See you.
- Yes, see you.

112
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,700
Hey, Dae Sik. I'm here.

113
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
(Jackpot Chicken)

114
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
What?

115
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,710
What's wrong? Did something happen?

116
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Hey, you're here.

117
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,840
You said you'd take a few days off.

118
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,210
I just returned to work.
Why bother resting at home?

119
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,050
Are you feeling sick?

120
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
What?

121
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,290
What is this?

122
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,700
(Application for Divorce
by Mutual Consent)

123
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,970
"Application for Divorce
by Mutual Consent."

124
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,010
Look, Mom's here.

125
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,240
- Oh, careful.
- Okay.

126
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
(My Husband Kim Dae Sik)

127
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,380
Did Mr. Kim go somewhere?

128
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,020
He went out for a meeting.

129
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,580
And didn't he say when he'd be back?

130
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,920
I couldn't ask since he was
on the phone on his way out.

131
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,020
From what I heard,

132
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,220
it seemed like
he was fighting with his girlfriend.

133
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,790
He said something
about plans for dinner or something.

134
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,530
He fought with his girlfriend?

135
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,070
You said it was for work.

136
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,070
I thought that was why
you couldn't have dinner with me.

137
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,710
So why did you go to Ye Won's house?

138
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,910
Is that work?

139
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Well...

140
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,280
I couldn't explain fully for some reason,

141
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,120
but my company will be working
with Ye Won's father's company.

142
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,680
That's why I went to greet him.

143
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,120
By Ye Won's father's company,

144
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,220
do you mean K.Win Logis?

145
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,990
How did you know that?

146
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,090
I heard when I went to your office.

147
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,330
I see.

148
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,530
Actually, we were going to
expand our distribution center,

149
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,270
but we couldn't
because of certain reasons.

150
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,270
Thankfully,
Ye Won's father asked to work together.

151
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,870
It's a good thing for my company.

152
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,780
Anyway,
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

153
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,910
Okay.

154
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,510
Just tell me exactly what's going on
in the future,

155
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,720
so I won't get the wrong idea.

156
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,850
Okay, I will.

157
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,290
So, what did you do there?

158
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,860
Did you eat dinner there too?

159
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,120
Well, yes.

160
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,790
What was her house like?

161
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,230
Was it nice?

162
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,500
Are you curious about that?

163
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,100
Well, just because.

164
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,600
Oh, no. I have to go to a client meeting.

165
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,710
Oh, okay. I have to go somewhere too.

166
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,040
- Let's go, then.
- Okay.

167
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,080
Hello.

168
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

169
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,520
How have you been, Ye Won?

170
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,860
Good, but what brings you here?

171
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,990
Seok Jin isn't here at the moment.

172
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,430
Oh, yes.

173
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,360
Hey, Seo Woo.

174
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,200
I told you before.

175
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,340
Please don't visit the office
whenever you please.

176
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,070
I thought I made it clear
that you were interfering with our work.

177
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,040
Yes, I remember that too.

178
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,950
I heard you were looking for a model.
So, I came in for an audition.

179
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,280
It said to come to the office,
so here I am.

180
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,120
An audition?

181
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,320
Yes, I want to audition too.

182
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,650
That's all right, isn't it?

183
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,570
Hey, do you...

184
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,140
actually have feelings for him?

185
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,970
- What?
- I mean...

186
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,210
Not as your childhood first love.

187
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,610
Do you have feelings for him now?

188
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,160
I told Dong Min that I'd accompany him
to his company event tomorrow.

189
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,600
Why isn't she here yet?

190
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,860
Does she know what time it is?

191
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,480
- Here.
- Thank you.

192
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,550
I had so much fun today.

193
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,510
Your company was nice,

194
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,820
and I heard
there were over 10,000 employees.

195
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,990
I thought,
"Large companies sure are different."

196
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,750
I'm glad you had fun.

197
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,920
I was so surprised
to see you win the raffle...

198
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,730
and the treasure hunt too.

199
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,700
Do you want some of the prizes I got?

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,300
No, it's fine.

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,700
When is she coming?

202
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
Also,

203
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,170
there was another event
you didn't know about.

204
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,780
I won the prize from that raffle.

205
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,550
What is this?

206
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,710
- Here. Open it.
- What?

207
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,190
It's so pretty.

208
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,760
Isn't this expensive?

209
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
You can have that.

210
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,630
What?

211
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,100
Gosh, it's fine.

212
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,730
I have a bunch. You can keep it.

213
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,730
What?

214
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,140
No, this is for women. You can keep it.

215
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,470
I told you. It's fine.

216
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,180
Just give it to your grandmother.

217
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,080
My grandma doesn't need this kind of...

218
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,050
Oh, man.

219
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
What should I do?

220
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
What do you mean?

221
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,950
To be honest,

222
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,220
I bought this for you.

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,530
You bought this?

224
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,260
I thought of you when I was at the mall,
so I bought it.

225
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,400
Don't you like it?

226
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,830
Gosh, it's not that. It's so pretty,

227
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
but I think it's too much for me.

228
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,270
No, you don't have to...

229
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,370
think of it like that. Just keep it.

230
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,710
I just...

231
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,410
didn't know how to express my feelings.

232
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,310
Your feelings?

233
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,790
I like you, Ah Jin.

234
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,390
It was just for a while,
but it felt great...

235
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,990
to be a couple with you at work today.

236
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,830
I want to be
in a serious relationship with you.

237
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,060
What do you think?

238
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,020
"It must be nice being you."

239
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,790
Since I was a kid,

240
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,320
that's always what I'd say
when I saw Mi Ja.

241
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,160
A pretty face,

242
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,000
the richest dad in the neighborhood,

243
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,930
and the daughter of the house
my family rented a room from.

244
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,700
That familiar sense of inferiority
I had lost since my husband chose me...

245
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,340
reared its ugly head again today.

246
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,440
Hey, when did you get here?

247
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,950
I didn't even realize you were there.

248
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,680
Oh, right. I heard you won the lottery.

249
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,190
Gosh, congratulations, Hye Sook!

250
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,920
Goodness, how could you keep
something so huge from me?

251
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,390
I'm upset, Hye Sook.

252
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,790
Hey.

253
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,760
Have you thought about moving away?

254
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,070
What? Why would I suddenly move away?

255
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,310
Why?

256
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,410
Are you asking
because you really don't know?

257
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,410
I don't like you living in this house.

258
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,850
You don't?

259
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,320
Why don't you like me living here?

260
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,550
You.

261
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,650
You're my husband's first love.

262
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,130
I don't like having
my husband's first love as a neighbor.

263
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,560
And you're divorced.

264
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,900
I don't like having a divorced woman
for a neighbor either.

265
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,730
No, I hate the very idea of you.
I hate you so much!

266
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,940
So, please get out of my face! Get lost!

267
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,170
Hye Sook. What's wrong?

268
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,880
Oh, I...

269
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,320
Why did you suddenly ask about moving?

270
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,050
- It's nothing.
- Hey.

271
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,390
Please tell your husband
that I said thanks.

272
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,890
I mean the three million dollars.

273
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,990
I know they're friends,
but that's not an easy thing to say.

274
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,430
Your husband said so before.

275
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,600
To tell him
whenever I was struggling with anything...

276
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,970
and that he'd help out.

277
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,140
I thought that was just a formality.

278
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,040
I didn't know
he'd really help us out like this.

279
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,610
My husband said he'd help you out?

280
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,410
Yes. Actually, I was being stubborn...

281
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,180
about not moving into this house
back then.

282
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,850
But then, Mr. Kim got so mad at me...

283
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,520
and said,
"Just live here! We're all friends!"

284
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,160
"Face your reality!"
That's what he told me.

285
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,930
So, that's how I ended up moving in here.

286
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,330
He basically helped me out
back then too, right?

287
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
So,

288
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,840
did you whine to my husband
whenever things got tough?

289
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,710
Hey, why would I whine to your husband?

290
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,840
Don't act like you don't know.

291
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,510
I've seen you alone
with my husband several times.

292
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,750
Why? Did you say you were lonely
and struggling without a husband?

293
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,080
Did you bring up those old feelings?

294
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,020
Hey, Lee Hye Sook!

295
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,320
You! Behave yourself.

296
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,720
You're divorced already.

297
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,130
What would people say
if you behaved this way?

298
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,590
Do you think they'll be kind to you?

299
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,260
What's up with you?

300
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,230
Are you saying
I'm trying to seduce your husband?

301
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,230
You...

302
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,840
used to like my husband.
He's your first love.

303
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,540
I mean, you're divorced too.

304
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,140
What's there to stop you?

305
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,540
You mean witch.

306
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,980
Is that all you have to say?

307
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,380
Shouldn't you comfort a friend
if she told you she got divorced?

308
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,450
How could you suspect something
was going on between your husband and me?

309
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,020
Do you still call yourself my friend?

310
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,090
You don't even know what's going on.

311
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,530
I got back together with my husband.

312
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,400
We're living here together.

313
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,700
You don't even know!
How dare you spew that nonsense?

314
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,200
Mean witch.

315
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,010
What, 500,000 dollars?

316
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,780
Who says we'll just accept 500,000
and walk away?

317
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,050
Then what do we do?

318
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,150
If he withdraws the offer
because we keep being stubborn,

319
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,150
will we just lose the house?

320
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,920
Even so, if you just agree to accept
only 500,000, what does that make me?

321
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Mom.

322
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,490
Can you talk to Dad again?

323
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,430
Gwang Sik agreed
to accept only 500,000 dollars.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,570
Mom!

325
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,070
Mom.

326
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,110
Mom.

327
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,510
Come on, Mom!

328
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,010
Please...

329
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,610
Mom, what's wrong?

330
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,050
What's the matter?

331
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,000
That mean witch.

332
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,170
How dare she say such a thing?

333
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,470
What does she take me for?

334
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,390
- Thank you.
- Well done.

335
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,890
- Thank you.
- Good work!

336
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,590
- Thank you.
- Good job.

337
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,290
My gosh, Seo Woo. You did really well.

338
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,030
You were the best
out of everyone we auditioned today.

339
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,500
Oh, really?

340
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,470
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

341
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,070
Well done. The results
will be announced in a few days.

342
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,610
You can go now.

343
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,240
I wanted to see Seok Jin today. Too bad.

344
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,880
Seok Jin won't be back until late.
He has a lot to take care of.

345
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,650
I know. He told me
he wouldn't be back until late.

346
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,720
I was just saying I was sad
I couldn't see him before I left.

347
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,290
I mean, I'm his girlfriend.

348
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,260
Of course, I know my boyfriend's schedule.

349
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,940
Oh, what's this?

350
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,040
Property tax?

351
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,940
How much is this? One, two, three, four...

352
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,510
Why is he paying so much
for property taxes?

353
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,680
Why was he billed so much
for property taxes?

354
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,220
He only owns one home.

355
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,790
What if...

356
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,030
Oh, boy.

357
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,330
Hey, I'm returning
the side dish containers.

358
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,930
Thanks for the side dishes.

359
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,940
Gyu Tae, by any chance,

360
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,740
did you purchase a house
for that woman, Mrs. Taylor?

361
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,710
What?

362
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,050
A house? What do you mean?

363
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,620
I happened to see your property tax bill
while I was at your place yesterday.

364
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,050
I saw that the bill was ridiculously high.

365
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,890
You mentioned
you'd buy her a house or whatever.

366
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,560
Did you actually buy her a house?

367
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,190
No, I didn't. A house, my foot.

368
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,060
And why would you even look
at my tax bill?

369
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,270
You're being ridiculous.

370
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,670
It wasn't intentional.
Like I said, I happened to see it.

371
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,210
You still went through it
and read the whole thing!

372
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,640
Okay, then explain.
Why is your bill so high?

373
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,180
It's none of your business!

374
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,680
Why would you go through
someone else's tax bill?

375
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,450
Unbelievable.

376
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,920
Something's really fishy here.

377
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,190
The Daewoon Building
is turning into a big headache.

378
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,790
When I take out a loan using it...

379
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,930
What if it complicates things?

380
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,340
Gwang Sik, why are you standing there?

381
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,640
How's Mother? Is she okay?

382
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,850
What's wrong, Gwang Sik?
Did something happen to Mom?

383
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,420
We don't know. She just keeps crying.

384
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,320
What? She is crying?

385
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,920
Mom is crying?

386
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,120
Mom, what's wrong?

387
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,520
Are you not feeling well?

388
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,790
How long has she been like this?

389
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,490
Since the afternoon.

390
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,030
Mom.

391
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,770
Are you upset because of me?
Because of my money issues?

392
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm sorry for worrying you.
It won't happen again.

393
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,410
Why is everyone here?

394
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,010
Get out, all of you.

395
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,820
Did you sign it?

396
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,830
If you've signed it, give it to me.

397
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,830
I refuse to sign it.

398
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,370
Then I have no choice.

399
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,140
If we can't come to an agreement,
I'll have to sue you.

400
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,570
Sue him?

401
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,940
What do you mean you'll sue him, Mom?

402
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,080
Listen up, you guys.

403
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Your dad and I...

404
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,380
are getting a divorce.

405
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,780
- "Divorce?"
- What?

406
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,080
- "Divorce?"
- But...

407
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,920
What do you mean, Mom?

408
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,120
Divorce, all of a sudden?

409
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,690
For my alimony,

410
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm requesting
half of the lottery winnings.

411
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
What?

412
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,730
Isn't it only natural...

413
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,900
for a divorced couple
to split their assets in half?

414
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,130
So, please get ready.

415
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,290
Dad.

416
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,950
What are you doing out here?

417
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,860
Hey, I'm waiting for Seo Woo to get home.

418
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Seo Woo?

419
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,190
I...

420
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,230
always dreamed of
being my daughter's first boyfriend.

421
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,370
If I showed her how
a man should treat her by taking her out,

422
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,870
bringing her home safely,
and caring for her,

423
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,740
I believed she'd find...

424
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,310
the perfect man to marry one day.

425
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,210
Right. I'll wait for her here.
I need to get some fresh air anyway.

426
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,080
Go inside, Dad.

427
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,480
What? Is something the matter?

428
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,720
Tell me what's bothering you.

429
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,530
Dad.

430
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,700
How did you manage to win Mom's heart?

431
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,030
Well, I'd say I used a shortcut.

432
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,400
A shortcut?

433
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,700
Hey, Tae Ha.

434
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,910
I guess there's someone you like.

435
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,010
Tell me. You see,

436
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,220
I've always dreamed of
being my son's best friend too.

437
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,850
If my son shares something...

438
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,790
he can't even tell his friends with me,
then I...

439
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,730
Dad, what are you doing out here?

440
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,590
And why are you here, Tae Ha?

441
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,600
Welcome home.

442
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,600
I was waiting for you, my daughter.
It's getting really late now.

443
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,700
What? It's late?

444
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,870
- It's only 10 p.m. now.
- What? "Only 10 p.m.?"

445
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,170
The world is a scary place.

446
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,040
From now on, you have to call your mom...

447
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,610
if you can't come home before 9 p.m.

448
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,410
Before 9 p.m.?

449
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,280
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

450
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,850
Oh, boy.

451
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,090
Honey.

452
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,930
Our kids are home.

453
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,330
I'm home.

454
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,590
I'm home too.

455
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
What?

456
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,310
Goodness.

457
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,940
What's the matter?

458
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,380
What's wrong?

459
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,980
Did I upset you?

460
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,450
What?

461
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
Are you crying?

462
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,790
Honey.

463
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,830
Hye Sook said...

464
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,330
My goodness.

465
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,900
Oh, gosh. Calm down. Don't cry.

466
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,840
Hye Sook...

467
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,310
looked down on me because of my divorce...

468
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,650
and suspected
I was involved with her husband.

469
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,790
What? With Dae Sik?

470
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,060
I just wanted to thank them...

471
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,160
for the three million dollars. That's all.

472
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,430
She treated me like I was
having an affair with her husband.

473
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,000
How could she do this to me?

474
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,240
How could she say such a horrible thing
to her so-called friend?

475
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,140
My gosh.

476
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Mi Ja, my darling.

477
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,480
You must've been so upset.

478
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,080
You know, the two of them...

479
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,990
are on bad terms right now.
Try to understand.

480
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,730
What do you mean
they're on bad terms right now?

481
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,760
Dae Sik and Hye Sook...

482
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,770
I think they're getting a divorce.

483
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,300
Divorce?

484
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,610
What is going on, Dad?
Why is Mom so upset?

485
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,750
Say something, please.

486
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,750
Divorce, all of a sudden?
There must be a reason.

487
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,020
Is this because of us?

488
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,120
Because we fought over your money?

489
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,030
It's not like that.

490
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,260
Then why on earth...

491
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,330
Hey, it's me.

492
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,570
Now?

493
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,110
What's going on?

494
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,140
Let's talk tomorrow unless it's urgent.

495
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
What?

496
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
All right.

497
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,580
I'm going out for a bit.

498
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,490
- Dad, where are you going?
- But...

499
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,490
Dad.

500
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,090
That's weird.
Where is he going at this hour?

501
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,070
What is it that
you had to call me here at this hour?

502
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,540
Hey, Dae Sik.

503
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,040
You said you wanted to buy
the Daewoon Building, right?

504
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,610
What are you saying out of the blue?

505
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,220
The landlord changed their mind.

506
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,220
They want to sell the Daewoon Building.

507
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,820
Do you want to buy it?

508
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,860
What?

509
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,290
(Good Luck!)

510
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,130
It seems like there's a girl Tae Ha likes.

511
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,630
Will you give me everything on that menu?

512
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,630
Pardon?

513
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,330
Then, who was that man earlier?

514
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,900
Seo Woo goes through boys so quickly.

515
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,370
Not this time.

516
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,540
I'm going to be with him
for the rest of my life.

517
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,780
Are you going to marry that guy?

518
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,350
