1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,440
(All child actors filmed safely
under the supervision of their guardians.)

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,440
(Animal scenes were directed
and filmed...)

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,440
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,610
Oh, my head.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,760
What's going on?

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,060
Didn't I wash my makeup off last night?

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,030
I must be crazy.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm so dizzy.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,730
Oh, my head.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
So dizzy.

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,710
What?

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,750
What do I do?

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,170
Oh, no. This is literally insane.

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,440
My gosh! What do I do?

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,950
What am I supposed to do?

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,350
What?

17
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,400
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

18
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,370
Oh, what do I do? My goodness.

19
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,450
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

20
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,550
- My gosh.
- Oh, boy.

21
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,660
Hey, are you getting home just now?

22
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,730
Where were you?

23
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,970
This is crazy.

24
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,980
This is just nuts. What do I do now?

25
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,280
Calm down, all right? Take a deep breath
and try to remember what happened.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,490
It's possible
that nothing actually happened.

27
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,120
Maybe we just fell asleep
on the bed together.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,020
He probably took his clothes off
because it was hot.

29
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,930
What?

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,400
Hold on.

31
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,290
Oh, my!

32
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,810
- My gosh!
- Ouch, it's too hot.

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,210
I'm burning for you too.

34
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,650
Oh, no.

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,260
Gosh, after that...
What happened after that?

36
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,560
Goodness me.

37
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,060
Right.

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,590
Yes, the camera was on.

39
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,810
Oh, no.

40
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,820
My gosh.

41
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,190
My goodness. Was I out of my mind?

42
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,690
Gyu Tae!

43
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,060
Gyu Tae.

44
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,640
- Hold on.
- No.

45
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,840
No!

46
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,030
Did I make you lose sleep last night?

47
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
No, it's fine.

48
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,570
Did you get some sleep?
Is your leg okay now?

49
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,200
It's much better now.

50
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,810
By the way,

51
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,480
where did Ye Won go?

52
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,080
I thought she came
on this business trip with you.

53
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,850
Something suddenly came up,
so I came alone.

54
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,520
Did you perhaps...

55
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,790
come all this way because you thought
I came here with Ye Won?

56
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,760
Seo Woo, we're just friends.

57
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,870
It's not something for you to worry about.

58
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,440
I don't believe
that men and women can be friends.

59
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,240
There are two ways
for men and women to become friends.

60
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,740
Either one person gave up
their feelings for the other,

61
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,080
or one person is hiding their feelings
for the other,

62
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,550
- and they're about to become lovers.
- What?

63
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,220
Don't worry. Neither one applies to me.

64
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,020
I don't care either.

65
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,890
At first,

66
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,690
I was really curious...

67
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,060
how high I was on your list of women
and how much you liked me.

68
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,200
But not anymore.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,240
How much you like me...

70
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,940
or whoever is by your side...

71
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,040
doesn't matter at all.

72
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,940
I'm going to like you even more
to my heart's content.

73
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,320
I'll try harder not to disappoint you too.

74
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,190
Promise.

75
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,700
I love you.

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,850
Please eat your fill, Ms. Park.

77
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,310
Okay.

78
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,450
Try the dried squid strips.

79
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,150
It's my mom's specialty.

80
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,350
Everyone agrees that it's to die for.

81
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,890
I'm fine, so don't mind me. Just eat.

82
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
By the way,

83
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,100
isn't Mr. Kim joining us?

84
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,060
He said he wasn't hungry.

85
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,630
Oh, I see.

86
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,300
Mom, when are we going home?

87
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,440
I want to go home.

88
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,180
All of my toys are there.

89
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,380
Ji Woo, you should eat first.
Let's talk after you're done.

90
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,150
Okay.

91
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,260
What will you do now?

92
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,130
About that family, I mean.

93
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,770
Shouldn't we help them out somehow?

94
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,140
Are you asking me to help out our in-laws?

95
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,540
Not just your in-laws. I'm talking
about your daughter. Our Mi Jin.

96
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,810
They're about to lose their house
if they can't pay the interest.

97
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,520
Do you want to see the whole family
end up on the streets?

98
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,650
At the class reunion, I heard...

99
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,820
our friend, Nam Gyu,

100
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,630
ended up in a psychiatric ward
after lending money to his son.

101
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,400
He helped his son
since he kept begging for help,

102
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,570
but he lost all his money,
and his son landed himself in jail.

103
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,540
And his wife died from the shock.

104
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,670
Apparently,
the whole family was shattered to bits.

105
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,040
That's that family.

106
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,740
Are we the same as them?

107
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,350
I'm sure we're different,

108
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,480
but I've never seen any families
with good outcomes...

109
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,720
after giving their kids money.

110
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,590
It's better not to give them anything
in the first place.

111
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,090
Honey.

112
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,890
You know what?

113
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,160
Your granddaughter...

114
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,730
even had her piano taken away,
the one her tiny fingers used to play.

115
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,600
The piano?

116
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,370
Those people even put a seizure sticker
on Ji Woo's piano too.

117
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,140
Ji Woo cried and said it was hers...

118
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,310
and that they couldn't take it,

119
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,180
but they said not to touch the stickers
since you could get arrested for it.

120
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,350
My heart broke into a million pieces.

121
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,520
That's why I brought their family here.

122
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,290
If you don't help them out,

123
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,060
I'm going to tell them
to live here for life.

124
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,160
If they lose their house,
they won't have anywhere to go anyway.

125
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,730
We can't help it.

126
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,240
We could either live here with them
for the rest of our lives,

127
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,040
or send them back home
after helping them out a bit, at least.

128
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,240
You can decide what to do.

129
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,100
I'll go and get some coffee. Wait here.

130
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Okay.

131
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,990
(Ye Won)

132
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,960
Seok Jin left his phone.

133
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,690
Hello?

134
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,530
What... Isn't this Kim Seok Jin's phone?

135
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,500
Oh, yes, it is Seok Jin's phone.

136
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,600
Hi, this is Seo Woo.

137
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Seo Woo?
Why are you answering Seok Jin's phone?

138
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,770
Did you perhaps go to Naju with him?

139
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,680
Well, it just kind of happened.

140
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,680
Anyway, Seok Jin stepped out for a minute.

141
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,980
Should I tell him to call you
when he gets back?

142
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,620
No, it's fine.

143
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,360
He went there with Seo Woo?
Without even telling me?

144
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,440
Oh, I'm thirsty.

145
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,780
Mi Ja.

146
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,880
Mi Ja!

147
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,850
Gosh, did she go somewhere?

148
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
What...

149
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,500
What?

150
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,130
It feels fine.

151
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,270
Am I better already?

152
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,310
What?

153
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,750
I guess my bones weren't broken.

154
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,920
What is it?

155
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,060
Did you call me?

156
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,490
Yes, can I have some water?

157
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Here.

158
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,540
- Gently. Yes.
- Gently.

159
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,510
- I want water.
- Okay. Here.

160
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,210
If she finds out that I'm all better,
she'll kick me out immediately.

161
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,420
Then, I won't see Mi Ja ever again.

162
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,390
And I won't be able to smell
Mi Ja's scent ever again either.

163
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
What?

164
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,740
That's right. I've made up my mind.

165
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,370
I want to lie back down.

166
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,880
Okay. There.

167
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,580
- Oh, dear.
- My gosh!

168
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,620
Wait. I'll bring you some breakfast.

169
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,990
Mi Ja.

170
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,990
Thank you.

171
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,370
Right.

172
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,740
Let's stay like this for the time being.

173
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,740
When else
would I get to stay close to Mi Ja?

174
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,450
Until Mi Ja and I grow closer
to each other again,

175
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,220
I won't get better, even if I do.

176
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,860
Never.

177
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I won't.

178
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,030
"Thank you?"

179
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,770
This is just humanitarian aid.
Nothing more.

180
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,940
By the way,
why hasn't Seo Woo come home yet?

181
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,710
So, she actually spent a whole night out?

182
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,240
The person you have reached...

183
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,410
- is unavailable.
- Look at you.

184
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,250
- Please leave a message after the tone.
- Just wait until you get home.

185
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,750
I won't let this slide.

186
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,850
Welcome.

187
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,120
You serve breakfast here, right?

188
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Yes, we do...

189
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,330
What? Han Tae Ha?

190
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,260
Hey, do you work here?

191
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,570
Yes. Hey, it's been so long.

192
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,240
Say hello. He's a friend from high school.
His name is Han Tae Ha.

193
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,000
Hello.

194
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,510
Oh, hi.

195
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,580
You haven't been coming to our reunions,
so I was wondering what you were up to.

196
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,980
I heard you had become a jobless bum.

197
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,720
It looks like you're an employee here.
Isn't that right?

198
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,920
Come on, man. What did I tell you?

199
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,990
I told you a college diploma
wouldn't last that long.

200
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,260
You should've gotten started somewhere
and grown your career from there.

201
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,660
I can't believe
you're a part-timer at your age.

202
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,360
Who is this, Mr. Han?

203
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,900
Oh, are you perhaps Mr. Han's friends?

204
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Well, yes.

205
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,040
Hello.

206
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,970
I'm the co-owner of this restaurant.
We run this place together.

207
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,370
Co-owner?

208
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,710
Tae Ha, so you own this restaurant?

209
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,010
What? No, it's not...

210
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,750
That's right.
This is Mr. Han Tae Ha's restaurant.

211
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,450
We run this place together.

212
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,550
Oh, I knew it.

213
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,790
Even if you were unemployed,

214
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,760
you wouldn't stoop
to taking a part-time serving job.

215
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,590
You should've told me about
opening your own restaurant here.

216
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,530
I would've visited sooner
with all my friends.

217
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,830
Hey, order everything you want to eat.

218
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,730
This is my friend's restaurant,
so I should help boost their sales.

219
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,940
My gosh, you're Mr. Han's friends.

220
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,210
Even if you only order a little,
we'll still take great care of you.

221
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,710
Here's our menu. Take your time deciding.

222
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,710
Thank you.

223
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,500
"Dad's sorry.
I was really worried about you."

224
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,030
You could've just said that.

225
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,640
How's the spot where you got hit?
Does it still hurt?

226
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,480
It must've hurt a lot. I'm...

227
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,350
sorry...

228
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,930
Yes, I did well.

229
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
I tried talking to him.
That's a great first step.

230
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,530
Well done, Choi Gyu Tae.

231
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,170
How am I going to face Gyu Tae
from now on?

232
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,240
Seriously, how did that even happen?

233
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
What?

234
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,220
Right, we should work things out.

235
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,420
Shoot. What do I do?

236
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,800
What? Gyu Tae! Wait...

237
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,430
What was that?

238
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,300
Is he avoiding me now?

239
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,030
Unbelievable.

240
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,870
(Number One Real Estate)

241
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,470
My gosh.

242
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,040
It's so awkward.

243
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,550
What was I thinking,
sleeping with Geum Ok?

244
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,080
She's like a little sister to me.

245
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,780
Am I an animal?
What is this, "Animal Kingdom?"

246
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,550
My goodness.

247
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,850
What are you mumbling to yourself about?

248
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,420
Hey, you're here.

249
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,430
Yes.

250
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,760
Did you look into the thing
Mu Chul mentioned?

251
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,100
He asked us
to help revoke his death registration.

252
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,060
Yes, I looked into it.

253
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,430
He still has some outstanding debt.

254
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,570
Excluding the properties
that have been put up for auction...

255
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,740
and his loans,

256
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,010
I believe he still has
about three million dollars remaining.

257
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,880
What? Three million dollars?

258
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,180
That's right.

259
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,450
The problem is,
getting his death registration revoked...

260
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,050
could lead to the scam investigation
being reopened.

261
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,790
Then they might also suspect
he faked his death.

262
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,590
Right, of course. He can pay off his debt,

263
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,030
but his name still hasn't been cleared.

264
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,800
I think it's in his best interest
not to go that route.

265
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,130
What do you think?

266
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,670
What?

267
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,100
Realistically, yes. I do agree with you.

268
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,240
But it must be uncomfortable for him.
Even this time,

269
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,280
he couldn't go to the hospital
even though he was in so much pain.

270
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Goodness.

271
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,150
Anyway, let's go
and talk to him in person.

272
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,150
No, you can go alone.

273
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,750
What? Why? You won't come with me?

274
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,420
Why do we both have to go?
You can just go and tell him that.

275
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,420
You guys live in the same building,
so you go talk to him.

276
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,990
And have lunch with him
while you're there.

277
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,590
I always have lunch at the restaurant.

278
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,930
I can't leave the restaurant
during lunchtime.

279
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,330
Hey, running the fried chicken place
is basically just a hobby for you now.

280
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,740
Why worry about missing peak hours
when you have tens of millions of dollars?

281
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Hey!

282
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
Hey, why...

283
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,740
Hush, shut it.

284
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,780
Will you stop saying I have money?

285
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,810
Rich people can be even pettier.

286
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,610
The richer they are, the pettier they get.

287
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,280
All right. I'm sorry, okay?

288
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,920
He's still bedridden and can't work.

289
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,660
How are we going to cover
our living expenses this month?

290
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,130
What...

291
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,240
Five thousand dollars?

292
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
Who sent this?

293
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,310
(Kim Dae Sik has sent you 5,000 dollars.)

294
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,740
Kim Dae Sik?

295
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,280
Is this his monthly salary?

296
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,950
How come he gets paid so much?

297
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,750
Mu Chul.

298
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,560
- My gosh, hello.
- Hello.

299
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,600
What brings you by?

300
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,040
Well, is Mu Chul home?
I need to talk to him about something.

301
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,570
Yes.

302
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,410
Actually, just now,

303
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,710
I received 5,000 dollars
in my bank account from you.

304
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,150
I know he got a pay advance recently,
and you sent more money today.

305
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,680
And it's a large amount.

306
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,320
Was the money supposed
to go to someone else?

307
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,950
No, the pay advance was a separate matter.

308
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,220
I still need to pay him on time.

309
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,590
Also, Mu Chul said
he didn't have his own bank account...

310
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,760
and told me to just send the money
to your account instead.

311
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,100
That's okay, right?

312
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,530
Yes, that's fine, but...

313
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,800
Does that mean
he got paid twice this month?

314
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,270
Just think of it as a bonus.

315
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,180
Mu Chul is very good at his job,

316
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,040
so the money feels well spent.

317
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,810
Even so,

318
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,880
I already feel so bad
since you're not charging us any rent.

319
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,520
I can't accept this on top of that.

320
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,690
I told you right from the start
that I wouldn't charge you rent,

321
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,050
so don't worry about it.

322
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,500
Well, anyway...

323
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,030
Mu Chul is inside, right?

324
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,770
- Yes, come on in.
- Thank you.

325
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
That feels nice.

326
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,710
I feel so cooped up and bored,
having to lie down all day.

327
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,520
Mr. Kim is here.

328
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,680
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

329
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,320
Have a seat.

330
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,350
- Thank you.
- Sure.

331
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,020
Hey, Mu Chul. Are you all right?

332
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,020
No, my back...

333
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,390
- Hey.
- Yes.

334
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,230
Where's Gyu Tae? Why did you come alone?

335
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,600
I don't know. I guess he's busy.
He told me to go alone.

336
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,330
I see. Did you look into it?

337
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,430
Can I get my identity back?

338
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,670
Well, I think it'll be hard.

339
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,910
What? Why?

340
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,550
First off, you still have
about three million in outstanding debt.

341
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,950
Three million dollars?

342
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,620
And if the police find out you're alive,
they might reopen your case...

343
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,220
and reinvestigate you for fraud.

344
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,860
On top of that,

345
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,190
they might suspect
you deliberately faked your death.

346
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,260
So,

347
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,230
I have to live like this
for the rest of my life?

348
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Mu Chul.

349
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,940
A while back,
Gyu Tae told me that you said...

350
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,580
you didn't set up that scam.
You told him you also got scammed.

351
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
What?

352
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,550
So, I didn't scam people?

353
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,350
I got scammed?

354
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,420
Yes. Apparently,
you told Gyu Tae over and over...

355
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,190
that you were falsely accused.

356
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,650
If that's the case,

357
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,590
the quickest way
to get your identity back is...

358
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,260
by clearing your name first.

359
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,530
But the problem is,
you don't remember anything.

360
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,440
There's nothing I can do about that.

361
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,210
So if I never scammed anyone
but was falsely accused,

362
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,110
that's so unfair.

363
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,450
How did something like that happen?

364
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,520
That I don't know.

365
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,620
Anyway, that's the situation now.

366
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,590
All right.

367
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,630
Thanks for looking into it for me.

368
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,100
Where are you hurting? Here?

369
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,430
Is it here?

370
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,450
You didn't have to drive me home.

371
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,890
You said you had to go back to the office.

372
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,150
Still, I couldn't send you home alone.

373
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,190
Let's go. I'll walk you to your door.

374
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,830
Is your leg okay?

375
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,370
What should I cook for Ms. Park?

376
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,400
- Seok Jin.
- Mom.

377
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,770
So, you're back now?

378
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,110
I came back yesterday.

379
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,440
Anyway,
what are you guys doing here together?

380
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,780
Seok Jin, didn't you say
you had a business trip?

381
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,420
Well, the thing is...

382
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,690
I ran into Seo Woo over there.

383
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,250
That's right. He was standing over there.

384
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,920
I said hi to him,
and we walked here together.

385
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,230
I'll head in, then. Have a good day.

386
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Hey.

387
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,940
Don't hang out with her.

388
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,140
What? Why not?

389
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,540
Think about all the problems
you had to deal with because of her.

390
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,580
Nothing good will come out
of spending time with that girl,

391
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,420
so don't hang out with her again. Okay?

392
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,060
Han Seo Woo!

393
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,830
Hey, Mom.

394
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,900
- You, come here.
- What?

395
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,070
- Hush.
- Why?

396
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,070
Hush!

397
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,200
Why, you... Have you lost your mind?

398
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,770
How dare you stay out all night, you brat?

399
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,310
Gosh, that hurts!

400
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,310
You.

401
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,410
You didn't go to a funeral, did you?

402
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,910
You went to have fun with your boyfriend,
didn't you?

403
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,710
What are you talking about?

404
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,650
I had to help my friend all night long
and didn't get any sleep.

405
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,850
Don't make me laugh.

406
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,790
Has any woman not used
the funeral excuse...

407
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,020
to stay out all night
with her boyfriend back in the day?

408
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,630
What? Did you do that too?

409
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,890
I did not...

410
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Did I do that too?

411
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,770
You.

412
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,770
Hey!

(Number One Real Estate)

414
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,510
Gyu Tae.

415
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,080
What? Where has he gone this time?

416
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,620
My gosh.

417
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,960
Seriously, though.
Even with everything that happened,

418
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,660
how could he avoid me right now?

419
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,300
No way. Is he acting like this
in case I want him to take responsibility?

420
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,400
Is that why he's acting like
he doesn't know what's going on?

421
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,670
Gosh, who does he think I am?
This is so annoying.

422
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,570
Gosh, darn it!

(Number One Real Estate, 669 Chicken)

424
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,850
Gosh, how many trips
have I made here today?

425
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,650
Well, the finish line is in sight now.

426
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,630
I'll win him over for certain.

427
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,040
Mr. Choi.

428
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,640
Oh, Mrs. Taylor.

429
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,610
You must be busy.

430
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,440
I was here this morning,

431
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,610
but you weren't here, so I called you.

432
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,150
Didn't you see that I had called?

433
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,590
Oh, sorry. I've been so busy.

434
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,450
By the way, what brings you here?

435
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,090
What do you think?

436
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,920
I came because I missed you.

437
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,660
What? You missed me?

438
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,600
And I have something to tell you too.

439
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,730
Then, let's head inside.

440
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,070
Okay.

441
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Is that Gyu Tae?

442
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,050
Oh, my. Do you not feel well?
Are you all right?

443
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,150
- Oh, my head...
- My gosh!

444
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,790
Goodness, Mrs. Taylor. Are you okay?

445
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,240
(Good Luck!)

446
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,180
How could she bring me
such incredible information?

447
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,750
I'm just worried since Seo Woo seems
to fall for boys very easily.

448
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,550
Just make sure to keep Seok Jin in line.

449
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,520
Don't you know that studious types
get into bigger trouble?
