1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,070
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,210
Anybody home?

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,410
(Episode 44)

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,980
Goodness. It's so messy.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
My gosh.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,660
What? It's a photo album.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,370
These rascals. How adorable.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,610
What?

9
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,850
Is this my wedding photo?

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Is this me?

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,390
Oh, my. Mi Ja.

12
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,340
My gosh.

13
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,580
Come on!

14
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,350
What are you doing?

15
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,950
What?

16
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,590
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,430
Oh, I came in to help tidy up...

18
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,300
Who said you could come into my room?

19
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,400
Get out! Now!

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay.

21
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh, my.

22
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,670
- Get out!
- Okay.

23
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,510
My gosh.

24
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,070
My goodness.

25
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,140
Seok Jin.

26
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,410
Seok Jin?

27
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,780
Gosh, it's late.

28
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,680
Is he not home yet?

29
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,420
Seok Jin.

30
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

31
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,860
Congratulations, Kim Seok Jin.

32
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,830
I know you were under a lot of stress.

33
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,290
It was worse for you.

34
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,500
You were worried and stressed
because I lost that investment.

35
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Compared to how you had to
struggle all by yourself in Korea,

36
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,200
that's nothing.

37
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,270
My dad happened to fall ill
right around that time...

38
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,410
and came to the US for treatment,

39
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,280
so you had to prepare
for our opening on your own.

40
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,280
Yet you never showed your stress.

41
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,310
You are the best, my friend.

42
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,420
Of course, I should do that much for you.

43
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,490
Is your dad okay now?

44
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,420
Yes, he recovered so quickly.

45
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,090
He doesn't look like someone
who was ill recently.

46
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,090
I'm glad to hear that.

47
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,860
Then is he back to work now?

48
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,070
You said
he ran a courier service office, right?

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
Yes, that's right.

50
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,610
I guess he couldn't come today
because he was busy with work.

51
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,140
He must be sad he couldn't make it.

52
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,840
The truth is, my parents...

53
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,910
don't really know what I do.

54
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,850
What? Why not?

55
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,620
I wanted to tell them
once our business became successful,

56
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,250
so I haven't told them yet.

57
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,490
And they're really busy anyway.

58
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,320
Besides, they don't know much about
this industry, so they wouldn't get it.

59
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,030
I see.

60
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,230
Right. You know Jin Sun, right?

61
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,470
She studied with us in the US.

62
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,770
She's getting married, in Korea.

63
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,440
That's amazing.
Give her my congratulations.

64
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,840
I'll be the MC at her wedding.

65
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,110
Come to think of it,
who can be the MC at my wedding?

66
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,650
Hey. Of course, I should do it.

67
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,050
- You?
- Well, I get stage fright,

68
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,190
but I can overcome it for you.

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,660
Or how about I sing at your wedding?

70
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,730
Forget it. You're a terrible singer.

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,670
I am a good singer. You've heard me sing.

72
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,200
No, thank you. I must decline.

73
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,070
Just pour me one.

74
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Hey, Ye Won.

75
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,610
I'll make sure Farm to Market
becomes successful, no matter what.

76
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,690
Yes, of course. We can do it.

77
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,490
It's not about whether we can do it.
I will make it happen.

78
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,960
I was always curious...

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
what it would really feel like...

80
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,260
to reach the top on my own.

81
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,440
I want to live a cool life...

82
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,140
that naturally comes with money and honor.

83
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,040
Yes, you can do it. I believe in you.

84
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
Anyway, we're in this together,

85
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,650
so let's make it a success.

86
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,990
Here's to Farm to Market.

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Cheers!

88
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,660
(Seo Woo)

89
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,770
My gosh.
How come he's not even calling me?

90
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,470
He said he was going to the after-party.

91
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,040
Is he blackout drunk again?

92
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,270
I noticed that he was a lightweight.

93
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,610
My gosh.

94
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,120
You really didn't have to walk me home.

95
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,980
It's not like I don't know
that you're a lightweight.

96
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,920
I need to see you get home, or I'll worry.

97
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
You're so stubborn.

98
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,990
(Kim Dae Sik)

99
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,260
All right. I'm home. Get going already.

100
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,700
You said Seo Woo lived here too, right?

101
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,930
Yes, why?

102
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,030
Well, she came to our grand opening
with that cake.

103
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,140
That was really sweet of her.

104
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,640
I know. She's got
a really thoughtful side to her.

105
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,510
Do you know this?

106
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,680
Your face lights up with a smile
whenever her name is brought up.

107
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,710
Really? I do that?

108
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,390
Hey, Seok Jin.

109
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,690
Do you perhaps...

110
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,160
Forget it. Go on in.

111
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,890
Why? What is it?

112
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,330
Nothing. I'm off.

113
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,700
Okay, get home safe.

114
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Gosh, you scared me.

115
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,910
What are you doing here?

116
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,240
Why didn't you answer my calls?

117
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,810
You called?

118
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,980
Sorry, I didn't know you called.

119
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,820
Were you waiting for me to get home?

120
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,120
Did you go out for drinks
with just Ye Won?

121
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,960
Yes, just one drink. We wanted
to celebrate after our grand opening.

122
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
My gosh.

123
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,600
Sorry. I really didn't know you called.

124
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Then give me a kiss. Right here.

125
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,440
Hey, what if someone sees us?

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,200
Come on. Hurry up.

127
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,910
Sweet dreams.

128
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,760
Seok Jin is running late.
Is he still at his after-party?

129
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,130
Still, I'm relieved
he opened his business.

130
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,860
I almost want to...

131
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,100
go to that investor who saved Seok Jin...

132
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,570
and give that person a huge bow.

133
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,740
Who is that investor?

134
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,110
What? I don't know either.
Seok Jin must've found someone.

135
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,610
Anyway, Seok Jin has come back to life
thanks to that person.

136
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,080
This person is practically our savior.

137
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,220
I'm home.

138
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,420
- Hey.
- You're here.

139
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,090
How was your after-party?

140
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,120
Good.

141
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,590
Thanks for coming today, everyone.

142
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,930
Gosh, there's no need for that.
You're the one who worked hard.

143
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,700
You've started off on the right foot now.
Keep working hard from now on.

144
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,830
I'll keep watching.

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Yes, Dad.

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,240
Also, be sure to go
and thank your investor in person.

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,440
And you can never forget that kindness
if you make it big.

148
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Do you understand?

149
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,710
Yes, I understand.

150
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
Good.

151
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,380
Gosh, what should I do?

152
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,650
If he looks at the bankbook now,

153
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,890
he'll see right away
that five million dollars is gone.

154
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,790
Right. I should hide it somewhere else.

155
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,990
- That feels refreshing.
- Oh, my. You scared me.

156
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,630
I was so startled.

157
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,460
Why were you so startled?

158
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,700
Gosh, it's nothing.

159
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Honey, you don't have to spend
any money these days, right?

160
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,840
Why would I have to spend money?

161
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,280
It's hard enough
just trying to keep the money I have safe.

162
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,380
By the way, why do you ask?

163
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,780
Well, just because. I was curious.

164
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,680
Honey, about Mu Chul.

165
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,690
I feel like he knows something
about the lottery ticket.

166
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,720
Really? Like what?

167
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,630
He hasn't been treating me
the same way lately.

168
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,900
I packed him some fried chicken
to eat with his wife today,

169
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,800
but he didn't seem all that happy.

170
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Is that so?

171
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,800
Has he remembered something?

172
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,210
Gosh, that's not it.

173
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,040
I think it'll take a while
for him to regain his memory.

174
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,210
He has become a whole different person.

175
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,020
You don't have to worry
for the time being.

176
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,180
Do you think so?

177
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Of course.

178
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,990
Well, it's a relief to hear that. Oh, boy.

179
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,260
Ask Mr. Choi...

180
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,460
to find you a place to live
as soon as possible.

181
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,570
Once you get a place,

182
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,430
please move out right away.

183
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,650
Goodness, seriously.
This is driving me crazy.

184
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,300
Oh, it's totally empty.

185
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,010
There's no rice either.

186
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,350
Hey.

187
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,290
We don't have any rice.

188
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,450
We should go and buy some.

189
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,260
If you give me money, I'll go and buy it.

190
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,500
There's nothing to eat for breakfast.

191
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,300
Leave it. I'll take care of it myself.

192
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,080
What's with the fried chicken
at this hour of the morning?

193
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,580
Don't we have any bread?
Or at least give us some rice.

194
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,780
We're all out of bread.

195
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,790
And we don't have much rice either.

196
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,560
Still, how can we have fried chicken
for breakfast? And it's cold at that.

197
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,370
Hey, you don't even make money.
Why are you complaining so much?

198
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,140
Why should I make money?
There are plenty of others in the family.

199
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,410
What would you know?

200
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,740
You're the one who owes loan sharks.
Don't act all high and mighty.

201
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,940
That's enough out of you.

202
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Loan sharks?

203
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,380
Hey, did I do that on purpose?

204
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,420
You're the one
who's stuck at home doing nothing.

205

Hey, I'm a student.

206

If you're a student, then go to school.

207
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,620
I'll deal with it myself!

208
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,090

209
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,860

Did you enjoy that chicken last night?

216
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,780
Why do you look so glum?
Is something going on?

218
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,390
Could you...

219
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,490
give me an advance on my paycheck?

220
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,930
An advance?

221
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,830
Yes, I knew we didn't have money,

222
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,070
but the situation is much more serious
than I thought.

223
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,170
I don't think
we can hold out until payday.

224
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,370
Can you help me out?

225
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,440
Of course, man.

226
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,410
Tell me whenever you're going through
something tough.

227
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,380
I'll put everything aside to help you out.

228
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,150
Thank you.

229
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,850
I don't think...

230
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,390
working here will be enough.

231
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,630
And what if it's not?
Will you work two jobs or something?

232
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,700

233
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,730
but when will I make money at this rate?

234
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,000
Well...

235
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,540
If I want to become a realtor
like Gyu Tae,

236
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,770
would I have to study a lot?

237
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Why are you asking about that
all of a sudden?

238
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,080
If becoming a realtor means
I can be as rich as Gyu Tae,

239
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,580
it would be worth a shot.

240
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,780
Gyu Tae is rich?

241
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,350
Hey, didn't you know?

242
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,020
Gyu Tae is really rich.

243

Hey, did Gyu Tae say that he was rich?

244
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,090
It's not that. I saw him and...

245
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,430
Seriously, that guy is lying
every chance he gets.

246
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,300
Anyway, I'll give you that advance today.
Don't worry too much.

Thanks. I'll be sure
to repay you for this kindness.

recently made enough money...

259

to buy up the whole of Gangnam
from real estate investments.

260

just from the inheritance from his father.

264
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,320
thank you for bringing me here.

265
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,760
Don't mention it.
You'll be like those men soon too.

266
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,730
Right. Actually,

267
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,030
I invested in the thing you recommended,

268
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,900
and I made
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

269
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,240

in a related branch of the government?

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,100
I'll tell you
whether he's a weirdo or not.

359
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,670
Here.

360
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,110
"This was the best soft tofu stew
I've ever had in my life."

361
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,250
"You have a kind heart
and make the best food."

362
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,480
"You're a true chef!"

363
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,590
Hey, this simple note made you that happy?

364
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,490
"Simple note?"

365
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,830
Do you think it's easy to find someone
who appreciates your cooking this much?

366
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,390
It's not like you're a chef.

367
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,660
You're just an employee
at a small restaurant.

368
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,100
What did you say?

369
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Hello.

370
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,770
- My gosh. You're back.
- Hello.

371
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,570
Thank you for the note yesterday.

372
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,540
It really made my day!

373
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,610
- Did it?
- Yes.

374
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,770
I'm glad to hear that.

375
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,140
What would you like today?

376
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,940
Today, I'll have...

377
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,110
I'll try the spicy pollack soup.

378
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,750
That's another specialty of mine.

379
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,280
- Really?
- Yes!

380
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,780
I can't wait to try it.

381
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,590
Oh, how would you like it?

382
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,220
Would you like it bland or extra spicy?

383
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,360
- Goodness.
- They both sound good.

384
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,720
- What homeless guy gets to choose?
- Extra spicy, please.

385
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,360
- Okay, I'll prepare it quickly.
- Sounds great.

386
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,760
Please sit here
and wait just a few minutes.

387
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,430
- Oh, then should I...
- She never smiles in front of me,

388
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,100
but she's smiling nonstop now.

389
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,270
(Entrance to Buddumak)

390
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,940
So, spicy pollack soup is your specialty?

391
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,340
That's right. I bet you had no idea.

392
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,080
You eat spicy pork all the time.

393
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,280
Then make me a bowl of it for lunch too.

394
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,180
Will you have lunch here today?

395
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,520
Why? I can't?

396
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,790
It's not that. Of course, you can, but...

397
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,890
All right.

398
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,860
Anyway, about that homeless guy.

399
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,400
Doesn't he look a little suspicious?

400
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,660
What do you mean?

401
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,870
I mean...

402
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,600
What kind of homeless person
eats at a restaurant every day...

403
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,500
and picks and chooses what they want?

404
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,840
From the way he talks and everything,

405
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,740
it doesn't seem like
he's been living a messed-up life.

406
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,240
I'm telling you.
You have serious trust issues.

407
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,650
Have you just been getting fooled
your whole life?

408
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,610
Enough of your nonsense.

409
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,380
Just prep the ingredients in the fridge.

410
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,150
Thank you. Come again.

411
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,390
Thank you!

412
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,620
- Bye.
- Bye.

413
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,660
(Jackpot Chicken)

414
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,990
- Honey.
- Yes?

415
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,600
I have to go home for a bit.

416
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,930
You have to go home? Why?

417
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,030
I'm behind on cleaning
and have to do laundry too.

418
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,500
Okay, go ahead.

419
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,170
- All right. See you in a bit.
- Okay.

420
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,570
(The Best Fried Chicken)

421
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,810
Hey, did your wife step out?

422
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,210
Yes.

423
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,150
- Oh, right. I'm stepping out too.
- Where are you going?

424
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,480
I should go to the bank so I can pay you.

425
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,520
- Right, okay. Go ahead.
- All right.

426
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,850
- See you shortly.
- Okay.

427
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,430
I have to say, Dae Sik is the only one
who's willing to help me.

428
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,770
Oh, boy.

429
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,100
I misunderstood him for no reason.

430
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,290
I should store the bankbook
in the safe at the bank again.

431
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,590
My gosh.

432
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,230
Oh, that man is...

433
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,070
And...

434
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,140
this is...

435
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,270
Well...

436
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,740
He's a tenant in my building.

437
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,480
Hello!

438
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,220
What? Do I know you?

439
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,750
Don't you remember me?

440
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,590
We've met a few times.

441
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,790
I'm Jang Mi.

442
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,890
Jang Mi?

443
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,490
Oh, you're...

444
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,090
It's been a while.

445
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,730
Yes, indeed.

446
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,400
Anyway, what brings you here?

447
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,870
I was on my way to your restaurant
for some fried chicken.

448
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,900
You run Jackpot Chicken, right?

449
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,370
Yes, that's right.

450
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,010
I saw...

451
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,180
that Mu Chul's cousin
worked at your restaurant.

452
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,510
Yes, that's right.

453
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,020
May I ask what his name is?

454
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
His name?

455
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,460
I keep calling him Mu Chul.
That's why I'm asking.

456
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,860
If I know his name,

457
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,830
it'll be less confusing for me.

458
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,760
Oh, I see.

459
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,000
Han Soo Chul. His name is Han Soo Chul.

460
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,010
Han Soo Chul?

461
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,280
What's your name?

462
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,410
Han M...

463
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,880
M...

464
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,920
Min Chul.

465
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,090
Then can I ask you something else?

466
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,190
Sure, ask away.

467
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,630
The man working for you
at Jackpot Chicken now.

468
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,800
He is not Mu Chul's cousin.

469
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,410
He is Mr. Han Mu Chul. Am I right?

470
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,640
(Good Luck!)

471
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,810
- You seem to know him...
- See you later.

472
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,210
very well.

473
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,680
We were always together
while studying in the US.

474
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,420
Can you carry the groceries by yourself?

475
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,650
Yes. I'll see you soon.

476
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,750
- Yes, see you.
- Thank you.

477
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,860
Oh, no. The bankbook is gone.

478
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,020
I should call the police.

479
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,020
Honey!

480
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,190
Let's go!

481
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,030
I won't give up.
