00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,620
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,430
- Move!
- My gosh! What is this?

3
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,800
Hey, you!

4
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,070
Kim Dae Sik.

5
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,570
Me? I'm not Kim Dae Sik.

6
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,200
He's Kim Dae Sik.

7
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,310
What's up?

8
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,040
- Did you ask for me?
- Yes, you!

9
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,910
You little punks.

10
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,160
- Hey!
- Get him!

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,420
The best fighter in Cheonha High
is nothing special.

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,790
Why would you act up like that?

13
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,960
Dae Sik, Gyu Tae!

14
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm here!

15
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,940
You punks!

16
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,970
Don't lay a finger on my friends!

17
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,730
Thanks, Mu Chul.

18
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,130
You saved us.

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,840
Come on. Of course,
I should come to your rescue.

20
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,040
Last time, you guys saved me.

21
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,310
Don't you remember?

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
You see,

23
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,050
if it's for you guys,

24
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,750
I can do even more difficult things.

25
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,750
Wait and see...

26
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,580
if I'm a man of my word.

27
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,590
From now on, the three of us...

28
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,460
will never let any one of us...

29
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,900
go through life's ups and downs alone,
no matter what!

30
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,640
Until the day we die,

31
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,140
the three of us
will do everything together.

32
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,910
Until when?

33
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,810
- Until the day we die!
- Until the day we die!

34
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,710
Until when?

35
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,550
- Until the day we die!
- Until the day we die!

36
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,920
Until the day we die!

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Dae Sik.

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
(42 years later)

39
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
Is it true that he is gone?

40
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,650
Is it true?

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,220
Let go of me, punk!

42
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,530
- Let go!
- Hey!

43
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,860
Get out of here while I'm being nice!

44
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,530
Hey, I'm not going anywhere!

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,770
Before I get my money,

46
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,030
I refuse to leave!

47
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,340
Mu Chul, that jerk.

48
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,870
What brings him here?

49
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,010
What's with all the ruckus?

50
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,870
What's going on?

51
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,510
Dad must've borrowed money from him
before he passed away.

52
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,510
What?

53
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,350
He came here asking for that money back.

54
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,550
I'll be sure to pay back
what my husband owed you.

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,420
But we just don't have
the money right now.

57
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,420
What?

58
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
You don't have the money?

59
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,560
No.

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Then, what?

61
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,070
What about this? Isn't this money?

62
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,700
Is it just full of used toilet paper?

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,840
- My gosh.
- Do you mean the condolence money?

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,370
Hey, get out. Talk outside.

65
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,070
Hey, let go of me!

66
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,640
- Why, you punk.
- Look.

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,180
Before I get my money,

68
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,380
I won't move an inch!

69
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,520
My goodness.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Get out of here while I'm asking nicely.

71
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,450
If not, we'll call the police.

72
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,450
What?

73
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,090
Hey, punk.

74
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,260
- Oh, my.
- I'm your dad's friend.

75
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,160
Friend, my foot.

76
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,800
How could a person like you be his friend?

77
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,030
Even a total stranger wouldn't do this.

78
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,830
A person died, and you're demanding money!

79
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,840
Would a friend do that?

80
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,640
Gosh, I was trying to be civil,

81
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,970
but this won't do.

82
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,840
Hey, haven't you ever heard
of guilt by association?

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,180
If your dad has done something wrong,

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,250
you, as his son, should repay his debt
with responsibility!

85
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,480
- Oh, my!
- If you feel so wronged,

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,880
go and blame your dead father for it.

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
If he wanted to die,
he should've paid me back first!

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,920
How dare he just die on his own?

89
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,960
- No, don't!
- Calm down.

90
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,020
Don't you dare insult my dad again!

91
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,090
I won't let it slide!

92
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,600
Hey, did you just hit me?

93
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,140
Gosh, you punk.

94
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,700
Hey! Come here!

95
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,710
What is this?

96
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,840
Get over here. Who are you guys?

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,140
Let go of me! Hey.

98
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,850
Gyu Tae. Help me out. Come on.

99
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,450
Hey.

100
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,950
Dae Sik.

101
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,890
Come on, man.

102
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,990
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

103
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,590
- Dae Sik.
- Hey, man.

104
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,790
- Dae Sik.
- Hey!

105
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,130
Gosh, this is so uncomfortable.

106
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
Let me go. My back.

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,030
Put me down! My back hurts!

108
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,940
- My goodness.
- Let go of me!

109
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,370
- Seriously.
- Let go!

110
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,210
Does he want to do that
even at his age now?

111
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,970
To a kid young enough to be his son.

112
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,640
I'm the fool for swearing
to be friends for life...

113
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,510
with a jerk like that.

114
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,950
Don't you know that
he'd even steal a gold tooth...

115
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,950
out of a dead man's mouth
if it had to do with money?

116
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,920
Why are you even surprised?

117
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,920
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

118
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,420
Yes, go on through.

119
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,490
Thank you.

120
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,730
Oh, my.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,900
She sure takes great care of herself.

122
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,230
Do you think she's single?

123
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Come on.

124
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,470
Are you seriously doing that here?

125
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Hey.

126
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,610
You never know
when or where a connection might happen.

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,310
(Nara Bank)

128
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,150
Hello?

129
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,950
Yes, this is he.

130
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
What?

131
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Oh, okay.

132
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
What's wrong?

133
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,530
Hey, I'll be going first.

134
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,530
What? Dae Sik!

135
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,330
Is something the matter?

136
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,440
So, I'm sorry,

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,510
but could I leave first after our meal?

138
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,240
You see, my husband is home.

139
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,840
I have to prepare his meal.

140
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,980
Oh, right, Jung Hee.

141
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,310
You said your husband retired, right?

142
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,820
All right.
You should get going after you eat.

143
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,080
Come on. Why should you go?

144
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,250
Do you have to serve him his meals
just because he retired?

145
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,790
Tell him to prepare his own meal.

146
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,560
My gosh, hey.

147
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,690
You must not know
since you have a husband...

148
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,790
who still brings home the paycheck
every month,

149
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,060
but that's not the case for me.

150
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,260
She's right.

151
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,500
If my husband...

152
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,930
brought home a six-figure salary
just like yours does,

153
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,070
I would gladly serve him
a dozen meals a day.

154
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,370
Just how many buildings does
your husband own, exactly?

155
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm not sure. He has so many, you see.

156
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,710
He's managing his buildings all day...

157
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,550
that I barely get to see him.
So, that many?

158
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,650
By the way, how about we meet
at Hye Sook's shop next time?

159
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,090
- Yes.
- Why not?

160
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,790
My shop?

161
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,890
You run your own restaurant.

162
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,430
We could go and boost your sales.

163
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,000
Won't that be nice?

164
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,900
Then, shall we?

165
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,000
That sounds great.

166
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,170
It was hard to come out so far.

167
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,740
It'd be great for me
if we met closer to home.

168
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,770
Mi Ja, is your house close
to Hye Sook's restaurant?

169
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
What?

170
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,010
Well, that is...

171
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,410
Yes, it's close.

172
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,050
My restaurant is on the first floor
of Mi Ja's building.

173
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,350
And I rent a unit in Mi Ja's house.

174
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,690
Oh, my. Is that so?

175
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,790
Gosh, I didn't know.

176
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,130
Hye Sook, didn't you use to live...

177
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,130
in Mi Ja's house during high school too?

178
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
That's right.

179
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,370
Hye Sook's mother
used to work at my house.

180
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,370
So, we lived together. She lived...

181
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,770
in the spare room of my house.

182
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,980
When you think about it,
you and I have such a long connection,

183
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,210
don't we?

184
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,380
Anyway, Hye Sook,
is your son back in Korea now?

185
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,890
I remember you saying
that he went to the US...

186
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,890
for his MBA at Stanford University.

187
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,460
Oh, my. Really?

188
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,560
Hey, that's so impressive.

189
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,730
My goodness.
You must've raised him so well.

190
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,030
How well could I have supported him...

191
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,330
by selling fried chicken in a rented shop?

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,100
I couldn't spend any money on him...

193
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
for tutoring
or sending him to academies...

194
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,770
like some people I know.

195
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
He did it all on his own.

196
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,740
Hey, that makes it even more impressive.

197
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,840
Goodness, Hye Sook.
You raised your son so well.

198
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,610
I'm nothing compared to Mi Ja, though.

199
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,820
She not only raised her kids well,

200
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,920
but she's such a supportive wife too.

201
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,550
You girls may not know,

202
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,250
but you can't leave out Mi Ja's part...

203
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,090
in her husband becoming rich.

204
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,160
Oh, my. Is that right?

205
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,790
But how did she do it?

206
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,000
(Clothing Collection Box)

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,170
When her husband got her birthday gift
out of old clothing collection boxes,

208
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,070
she understood him with an open heart.

209
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Oh, my.

210
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,670
Taxi.

211
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,680
- She and her husband only ride buses...
- Honey!

212
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,980
because they don't want to waste money...

213
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,750
- in a country that produces no petroleum.
- But honey!

214
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,150
- Do you think that's all?
- Let's take the taxi!

215
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,380
- She recently got sychnuria too.
- No! Seriously!

216
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,720
- Sychnuria?
- Sychnuria?

217
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,960
Move aside, kid.

218
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,690
Don't flush every time.
How many times must I tell you?

219
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,500
- We live in a water-stressed country,
- My goodness.

220
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,900
- so they flush after multiple uses.
- What?

221
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,000
- No!
- They hold their pee as long as possible.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
- I have to go!
- What's wrong with you?

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,630
- Shouldn't she get an award...
- No!

224
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,040
- from the government for this?
- Don't flush yet!

225
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,740
An award for being thrifty and frugal.

226
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

227
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,240
That's incredible.

228
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,680
Mi Ja, did you become rich
by saving money like that?

229
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,050
Goodness, girl. You never once let on.

230
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,420
I'm learning so much from you today.

231
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,390
So, why did you get on my nerves?

232
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,690
I know your weaknesses better than anyone.

233
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,300
As long as your scrooge of a husband
is by your side,

234
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
you can never beat me, you brat.

235
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,300
- That was fun.
- How did you raise your son so well?

236
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,870
- Come on.
- I envy you so much.

237
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,870
- How old is your son again?
- You mean wench.

238
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,340
I have to pay for this.

239
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,140
I can't stand
how she embarrassed me like that.

240
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,580
Oh, right.

241
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,380
He said he wouldn't let it go
if I used the credit card again.

242
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,620
Oh, whatever. Who cares what he says?

243
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,620
Hey, this is on me.

244
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,560
No, it's my turn this time.

245
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,290
Come on. You paid last time.

246
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,590
Move aside. I'll pay.

247
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,130
Look at you.

248
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,060
You're all saying you'll get the bill.

249
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,970
Then,

250
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,470
someone who hasn't paid before
should get this.

251
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,670
Which of us hasn't paid before?

252
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,140
I think we've all paid at least once.

253
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,810
Me?

254
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,210
Oh, did I not?

255
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,850
How much is it?

256
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,790
It's 358 dollars.

257
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,420
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

258
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,460
Ma'am, your card isn't working.

259
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,360
- It says it's not in use.
- Oh, my.

260
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,470
But that can't be right.

261
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,040
Then, please try this card.

262
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Okay.

263
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,010
Oh, this one doesn't work either.

264
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,680
Isn't your machine broken?

265
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,150
There's no way
two of my cards aren't working.

266
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,520
Try this one.

267
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,020
We can see
if the machine is broken or not.

268
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,730
It must've been your card
that wasn't working.

269
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Had I known this would happen,
I would've just paid in the first place.

270
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,230
I'm sorry about this.

271
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,070
- That was great.
- I know, right?

272
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,510
- The meal was great.
- Yes.

273
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,150
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

274
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,780
No answer. What is going on?

275
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,920
Pardon? I can't get the loan?

276
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
(Nara Bank)

277
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,360
What? You said it'd be approved,
so I waited until now.

278
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,060
You can't do this now.

279
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,830
The thing is,
you've taken out a number of loans,

280
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,770
and you're often late
with your interest payments,

281
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,840
so your application was denied
in the final evaluation process.

282
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,910
Wait, then...

283
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,110
Can I apply for a different loan?

284
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,950
I'm in a tight spot at the moment.

285
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,820
I'm sorry. There is nothing we can do.

286
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,120
(Bus Stop)

287
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,140
(Wife)

288
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
(Wife)

289
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,350
Hey! Kim Dae Sik.

290
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,350
You little...

291
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,850
Hey.

292
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,960
What?

293
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,290
Hey, what are you doing?

294
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,760
You pretended not to know me
at the funeral earlier.

295
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,530
You disloyal jerk.

296
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,530
Aren't we friends?
How could you do that to me?

297
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,870
Where do you think you are going?
You punk.

298
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,640
Listen attentively
when your elder is speaking.

299
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,840
How rude!

300
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,340
What? My elder?

301
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,510
Come on. I'm a year older than you, man.

302
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,980
I told you I started school a year late
because my family was so poor.

303
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,150
Do you want to see my ID?

304
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,090
Hold on. Where is my wallet?

305
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,090
Is it here?

306
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,330
You get shaky hands
even when you have to spend a penny.

307
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,090
Why are you always looking
for your wallet?

308
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Move.

309
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,330
- Move, you punk!
- Why, you...

310
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,770
- You little...
- What?

311
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,400
Hey! My money...

312
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,740
You petty jerk.

313
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,410
You'd better not say to anyone
that you're my friend. Jerk!

314
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,280
- Why, you...
- That is what I want, you fool!

315
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,720
You piece of...

316
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Darn you.

317
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Oh, right.

318
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,120
Hey, Tae Ha.

319
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,790
My gosh.
Does he realize what time it is now?

320
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,960
Son, wake up.

321
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,470
Son, it's time to wake up.

322
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
- Hey!
- What?

323
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,210
What is it?

324
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,180
You haven't forgotten about today,
have you?

325
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,510
Royal Cafe, at 3 p.m.

326
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,860
"Life Mentor?"

327
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,760
Why would you peep at my phone?

328
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,400
Don't you dare talk to your mother
in that manner.

329
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,700
What do you mean I was peeping?

330
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,830
Mom, you look really pretty today.

331
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,830
I guess you're meeting your friends.

332
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Go and have fun.

333
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,070
- Hey, why...
- Come on.

334
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,370
- Let go!
- Go and have fun.

335
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,370
- Hey, I...
- Go.

336
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,480
Have fun, Mom. Bye!

337
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,350
Hey, you.

338
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,680
Hey, didn't you invest
in Byungjin Construction?

339
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,950
Hurry up and check.
Their stock is soaring.

340
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,020
For real? Okay, thanks. Talk soon.

341
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,390
(Byungjin Construction)

342
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,060
Yes! As they say,
one event can change your life.

343
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,060
Let's keep up this momentum. To the moon!

344
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Honey.

345
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Mom.

346
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,870
Why are you here?
Why didn't you go to the restaurant?

347
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,070
Have you seen your dad?

348
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,440
Dad? No, I haven't.

349
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
He's not at the restaurant?

350
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,150
Where on earth did he go?

351
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,280
Are you going to work?

352
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,420
Yes.

353
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,690
Mom, can I have this?

354
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,260
Do you still collect coins?

355
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,660
What do you mean, still?

356
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,090
They add up, you know.

357
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,090
- See you later.
- All right.

358
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,330
He's neither at the restaurant
nor at home.

359
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,370
Where on earth did he go?

360
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,910
Nice, Byungjin Construction.
It keeps going up!

361
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,950

What are you doing?

365
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,430
Is it yours?

366
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,730
Who still uses coins these days?

367
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,470
Nowadays, it's all about cryptocurrencies.

368
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,200
What's wrong with using coins?

369
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,040
These are money too, you see.

370
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,270
I never said they weren't.

371

My gosh.

375
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,330
Where have you been?

376
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,600
You didn't even answer your phone.
What happened?

377
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,970
You need to call the credit card company.

378
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,700
It doesn't look like the payment
has been received on their end.

379
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,970
We took out a loan
to make that payment, remember?

380
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,210
Wait, was it taken out for something else?

381
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,550
You should hurry up
and call the bank first.

382
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,310
Find out where the money
from the loan has gone.

383
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,550
The loan application...

384
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,390
wasn't approved.

385
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,850
What do you mean
the loan application wasn't approved?

386
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,430
I know you were very worried,
so I lied that it'd been paid off.

387
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,600
I was going to pay it
once the loan was approved today,

388
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,530
but the loan application...

389
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,330
was denied.

What?

391
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,840

- Yes, got it.

00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,080
that you're not allowed
to leave your garbage out here?

407
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,480

- I was going to...
- As if I'd believe that!

409
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,050
No wonder you have no customers.

410
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,020
Your food tastes awful.

411

What did you say?

a business with a lazy owner do well.

416

If you want to fail here too,

417
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,000
keep lazing around.

can reveal a lot about you.

- Both your business and your body.
- What?

of either of them.

Have you even bought me a single meal
to help me gain weight?

All right.

of the apartment we just saw?

Well, I liked the location,

430
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,570
but it wasn't really in good shape.

431
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,970
I told you not to worry.

432
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,840
The landlord will fix everything for you.

433
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840

434
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,210
Yes, of course.

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,210
The landlord owns this building too.

436
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,950
He owns several buildings
in this area alone.

437
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,120
Maybe it's because he's well-off.

and moving out today.

about something like this?

What? The landlord is nice?

what Han Mu Chul's nickname is?

to waste a single grain of salt.

Instead of buying salt,

465
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,850
he'd go and pump the ocean water
to make salt.

It's not just me.

467

- Where are you going?
- I'm sorry.

479
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,450

Are you perhaps Mr. Han Tae Ha?

Oh, this?

494
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,160
I don't know if you've heard,
but I'm jobless.

495
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,460
I can't afford nice clothes.

496
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,000
Still, I wore the best outfit I had.

497
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,700
- Does it look bad?
- Then...

498
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,800
do you mean you came here in this outfit,

499
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,740
knowing you had a blind date?

500
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,110
The thing is,
I was going to wear sneakers,

501
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
but I have athlete's foot.

502
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,580
For athlete's foot, it's really important
to let your feet breathe.

503
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,320
So, I had no other choice.

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,460
What are we going to do now?

505
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,090
We have no money left in the bank,

506
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,460
and our cards are blocked too.

00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,800
Forget about our property being seized.

508
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,900
We don't even have money
to put food on the table.

509
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,400
What are we going to do?

510
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,070
I wouldn't even be saying this
if our sales were good.

511
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,240
We barely have customers as it is.

it's coming from our building.

518
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,590
And we have gifts too.

- What is this?
- If you take this flyer,

528
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,170

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,590
There's a new chicken restaurant
that opened up next door.

536
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,290
Did you know about this?

537
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,660
Well, that is...

538
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,560
I tried to dissuade him...

539
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,700
from having a new chicken restaurant
come in for your sake,

540
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,700
but that jerk, Mu Chul...

541
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
What did Mu Chul do?

542
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,240
That jerk is the landlord.

543
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,370
If the landlord is okay
with letting the restaurant open,

544
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,440
what could I do to stop him?

545
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,340
And they're a franchise,
so they pay a lot for rent.

546
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,240
Would that jerk, Mu Chul, pass on this?

547
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,050
Where is Mu Chul now?

548
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,950
Hey, Dae Sik.

549
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,920
As long as you bring this flyer,

550
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,520
you can get many freebies.

551
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,030
Please take a flyer.

552
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,760
- Yes, please come again.
- Hello.

553
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,230
I'm sorry, sir.

554
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,160
You're always sorry.

555
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,100
We're giving out many freebies
on the house.

556
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,800
Please take a flyer.

557
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,940
Hey, Han Mu Chul.

558
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,010
Oh, Kim Dae Sik.

559
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,870
I'm seeing you often today.

560
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,540
Did you let a chicken restaurant open
in our building?

561
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,650
Do you mean 669?

562
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,550
Yes, so? What about it?

563
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,820
Why, you little...

564
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,550
Don't you know anything
about business ethics?

565
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,750
How could you let
a new chicken joint open in front of ours?

566
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,890
And in the same building at that!

567
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,920
Whether I let a chicken restaurant open
or a flower shop,

568
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
it's up to me.

569
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,930
Must I report every little thing like that
to you?

570
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
What?

571
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,230
Why should I have to tiptoe around you
and lose business?

572
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,340
Stop minding other people's business...

573
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,270
and just go and fry your chickens, man!

574
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,640
I'm telling you.
The ones with no talent...

575
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,280
always blame their tools.

576
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,350
You little punk.
Is that all you have to say?

577
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,810
Mu Chul, why are you doing this?

578
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,220
So what if you grab my collar?

579
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,920
- Do you think I can't do the same?
- How dare you?

580
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
Hey, Dae Sik.

581
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,890
Calm down. Let go of him first, okay?

582
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,020
You must not know,

583
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,890
but your restaurant space used to be
a cell service provider's office.

584
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,260
You begged me so much,

585
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,400
so I let you open a fried chicken joint.

586
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,600
But now, you're acting out of place...

587
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,470
and telling me what to do?

588
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,270
Fine, I didn't know
you had changed so much...

589
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,540
and begged you nonstop.
I was the crazy one.

590
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,640
I will never ask you
for another thing again.

591
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,980
You money-crazy jerk!

592
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,240
Money-crazy?

593
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,950
Sure, I at least have money.

594
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,120
What about you?

595
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,150
At your age,

596
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,850
you're still renting from someone else
to run a restaurant.

597
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,720
All you have is your pride. Good grief.

598
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,120
This behavior...

599
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,290
is nothing but an inferiority complex,
you fool.

600
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,600
What?

601
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,000
An inferiority complex?

602
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,800
Look at you.

603
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,760
(Good Luck!)

604
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,430
You're handsome and went to a good school.

605
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,430
Your family has a lot of money.

606
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,460
You can stand up to anyone.

607
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,860
Still, he's jobless.

608
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,200
Make money from working.

609
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,300
If you try hard,

610
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,130
a good day will come. Cheer up.

611
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,140
Hey!

612
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,270
Little punk. You're good at washing cars.

613
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,540
I'm going to raise the security deposit.

614
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,780
About 100,000 dollars.

615
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,780
Did you say 100,000 dollars?

616
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,410
