1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,640
What is it that
you had to call me here at this hour?

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,380
Hey, Dae Sik. You said...

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,950
you wanted to buy
the Daewoon Building, right?

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,480
What are you saying out of the blue?

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,620
The landlord changed their mind.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,220
They want to sell the Daewoon Building.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,490
Do you want to buy it?

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,820
What?
Why do they suddenly want to sell it?

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,430
They were adamant
about not selling it before.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,990
Did something happen to the current owner?

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,660
Yes, I guess so.

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,170
Rather than taking out a loan
against the building,

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,840
I'd much prefer to sell it to Dae Sik
and use the money to invest.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,200
Mu Chul would prefer that too,

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,670
rather than selling it
to a complete stranger.

16
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,940
Anyway, I'm not too sure
what's going on with the owner.

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,850
But they contacted me
and asked me to sell it.

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,180
I see.

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,250
But I'm not sure
if I can spend ten million dollars now.

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,490
Why can't you?

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,690
Have you already spent all that money?

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,090
No, it's not that.

23
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,900
My wife wants a divorce.

24
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,860
She wants a divorce?

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,140
Oh, boy.
She wants half of the lottery prize.

26
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,270
I don't know what to do.

27
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,450
Mom.

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,290
Where did she go?

29
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,990
I really regret what happened.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,630
When Hye Sook asked me out,
I said yes in a fit of anger.

31
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,700
What? His first love?

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,370
Then, you mean our neighbor,
Ms. Mi Ja, was Dad's first love?

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,580
Mom must've been really shocked.

34
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,310
She thought she was Dad's first love
all these years.

35
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,180
Of course.
Even my heart sank when I read it.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,020
I understand why Mom's acting that way.

37
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,090
Me too. I get it now.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,260
I'm sure that's not the only reason.

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,360
After I lost the investment
for Farm to Market,

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,930
Mom gave me money
while keeping it a secret from Dad.

41
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,030
That was why they started fighting.

42
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,640
I basically caused all this.

43
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,540
I shouldn't have accepted
that money back then.

44
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,110
I just wanted to make it
in any way I could.

45
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,650
I guess I only thought about myself
without meaning to.

46
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,920
I'm so sorry, you guys.

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,680
No.

48
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,850
I said I wouldn't take my 500,000 dollars
without thinking.

49
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,620
It's my fault for ruining the mood.

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,230
I didn't consider how my actions
would put you guys in a tough spot.

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,900
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,130
Whatever you guys say,

53
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,800
I think I'm the biggest cause of all this.

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,870
I'm the one who turned down
my 500,000 dollars...

55
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,670
and threw a tantrum,
asking for five million instead.

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,240
That led me to fight with you guys
for no reason too.

57
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,950
Since we're on the subject,

58
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,980
I want to apologize for my behavior.

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,490
I had a lot of pent-up resentment
growing up as the eldest.

60
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,290
I think it made me act out emotionally
toward the wrong people.

61
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,800
But when I think about it,
it wasn't always hard.

62
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,900
Seok Jin,
when you said you were praised...

63
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,540
as you were studying
with the money I sent you,

64
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,300
I felt happy as if it had happened to me.

65
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,940
Ah Jin, you'd go out with friends to buy
workbooks with the money I gave you.

66
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,640
That would make me so happy too.

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm serious.
I was glad to help you guys out.

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,250
I felt the same way.

69
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,390
I mean, I asked you for pocket money
before I'd ask Mom and Dad.

70
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,390
Although I knew you were working so hard,

71
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,930
you were the person I could rely on.

72
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,560
That made me so happy.

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,600
Me too.

74
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,160
I may have said I was okay,

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,930
but I think I might've wanted your help
deep down inside.

76
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,100
Still, what kind of older sister
can actually do that for her brother?

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,540
I wouldn't have been able
to do what you did. Never.

78
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,540
Right.

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,710
Hey, you guys are embarrassing me.

80
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,850
Are you crying?

81
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,550
Why should you feel embarrassed?

82
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,250
Anyway,

83
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,020
what will Mom and Dad do now?

84
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,990
Do you want to try talking to Mom?

85
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,430
Mom listens to you more than anyone.

86
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,830
Right, it might be better
if you talked to her rather than us.

87
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,570
Okay, I'll go and talk to her.

88
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,490
Mom.

89
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,220
Are you okay?

90
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,860
Actually, I saw that letter too.

91
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,100
The letter that Dad wrote to Ms. Mi Ja
a long time ago.

92
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,340
I made me understand
why you're doing this.

93
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,540
Mom, you must've been so upset.

94
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,750
Sure, that's probably not the only reason
for wanting a divorce,

95
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,420
but I know it must've been a huge shock.

96
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,250
But Mom,

97
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,720
can't you let Dad off the hook this once?

98
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,830
I'm sure you feel betrayed,
but it's all in the past.

99
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,800
Dad never cheated on you all these years.

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,700
I can guarantee you
that you're the only woman in Dad's heart.

101
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,800
So, Mom...

102
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,770
Can't you reconsider the divorce?

103
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,580
Mi Jin.

104
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,550
Yes, Mom. Tell me.

105
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,590
Do you know...

106
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,000
what my dream was?

107
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,900
Your dream?

108
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,500
No, I don't.

109
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,070
I was watching TV in high school,

110
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,980
and a famous chef at a foreign restaurant
was a woman.

111
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,510
These days, they'd call her the head chef.

112
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,020
Back then,
female chefs weren't that common.

113
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,190
That looked so cool to me.

114
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,690
That's when I started dreaming about it.

115
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,560
I told myself that I'd also become
a female chef, no matter what.

116
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,060
But the reality was...

117
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,230
that I was living in a room
in someone else's house...

118
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,570
and couldn't even afford
to take cooking lessons.

119
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,470
I barely managed to get away from that
by getting married,

120
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,280
but things were even harder than before.

121
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,950
As I raised three kids,

122
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,450
I worked all kinds of jobs.

123
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,250
And I've gotten this old in no time.

124
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,820
Mom.

125
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,890
Mi Jin.

126
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,190
Ever since we won the lottery,

127
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,060
I got a perm,

128
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,900
bought a few outfits at the market,
and bought furniture for this house.

129
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,540
I never even thought about buying
something decent for myself.

130
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,870
I only thought about
how I could give you kids...

131
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,780
as much as possible.

132
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,550
That whole time,

133
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,520
I never thought about myself.

134
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,850
You know,

135
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,190
I want to live freely now
before it's too late.

136
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,760
I want to do what I want
to my heart's content.

137
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,000
Just for me, Lee Hye Sook.

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,370
I really want to live like that.

139
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Mi Jin.

140
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,670
Can't I...

141
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,410
do that for myself?

142
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,780
Mom.

143
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,390
Do you feel better now?

144
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,630
Yes, I feel better now that...

145
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,990
you've comforted me.

146
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
You know what?

147
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,130
I always wanted you to listen to me...

148
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,170
and take my side.

149
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,770
Actually, as long as a husband does that,

150
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,210
a woman's anger melts away,
at least by half.

151
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,680
But I didn't do that before, did I?

152
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,380
It's okay. You're doing that for me now.

153
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,350
I'm so thankful and happy.

154
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,890
I'm sorry for being
a lousy husband until now.

155
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,130
From now on,

156
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,830
I'm the closest person to you,
and I'm on your side.

157
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,740
If anything upsets you,
just tell me everything.

158
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,270
Okay.

159
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,870
Oh, right.

160
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,880
What?

161
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,480
Do you remember the Yisan Building?
I told you about it before.

162
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,720
Yisan Building?

163
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,650
It was your building that was sold.

164
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,850
That building is called
the Yisan Building.

165
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,660
Now that I think about it,
something is strange.

166
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,430
What's that?

167
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,060
I'm sure you told me
that it was sold for four million dollars.

168
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,570
But after you died,
I asked Mr. Choi about it,

169
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,500
and he said he sold it
for three million dollars.

170
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,840
You must not have heard from Mu Chul,

171
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,780
but the Yisan Building was sold...

172
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,810
for 3 million, not 4.

173
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,810
Does it make sense for him
to dock the price by a million at once?

174
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,450
Well, I'm sure he did it
because we needed money urgently.

175
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,590
Even if that were true,
how could he cut the price by a million?

176
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,160
Also, I honestly don't like...

177
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,530
how you received the money for that sale
through Mr. Choi's bank account.

178
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,130
Sure, you may be friends,

179
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,570
but who can resist
the temptation of money?

180
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,940
It's only natural for anyone
to get greedy with money.

181
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,040
Don't say that.

182
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,680
Then, do you mean
Gyu Tae stole my money...

183
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,510
as the middleman?

184
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,910
Well, that's not what I meant.

185
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,280
Gyu Tae would never do that.

186
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,520
Mi Ja, if you keep talking like that,
I'm going to be angry.

187
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,760
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,030
I just thought this might trigger
your memory.

189
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,830
Oh, dear.

190
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,670
It's okay.

191
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,210
By the way, about Tae Ha.

192
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,810
It seems like there's a girl he likes.

193
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,310
- Did you know?
- Our son, Tae Ha?

194
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,210
No, this is news to me. Really?

195
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm not certain,

196
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
but it seems that way.

197
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,710
I like you, Ah Jin.

198
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,210
I want to be
in a serious relationship with you.

199
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,110
What do you think?

200
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,990
What?

201
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,660
Isn't Tae Ha joining us?

202
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,630
He said he wasn't hungry.

203
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,560
Maybe he's not feeling well.

204
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,870
What? He seemed totally fine yesterday.

205
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,970
Seo Woo, what are you up to these days
that you keep coming home late?

206
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,270
Are you still seeing that guy?

207
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
What?

208
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,980
"That guy?"

209
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,050
Seo Woo, do you have a boyfriend?

210
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,520
Yes, I do.

211
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,120
Oh, my.

212
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,490
Who is this punk... Sorry.

213
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,760
Who is this guy?

214
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,590
Bring him over so we can meet him.

215
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,100
Bring him over? As if.
Seo Woo goes through boys so quickly.

216
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,730
As usual, she'll break up with him
in about three months.

217
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,070
Not this time. I'm going to be with him
for the rest of my life.

218
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,070
For the rest of your life?

219
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,950
Hey, are you going to marry him
or something?

220
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,050
That I don't know.

221
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,320
Well...

222
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,920
Hey, Seo Woo.

223
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,490
You know, why don't you...

224
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,490
just bring him over so I can meet him?

225
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,130
A man is the best judge
of another man's character.

226
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,030
I'll meet him...

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,630
and tell you
whether or not he's worth your time.

228
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,000
- Yes.
- I'll make it very simple for you.

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What do you say?

230
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,340
Don't you worry. I know anyone would say
he's the best husband material,

231
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,010
so I don't need you to confirm that.

232
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,010
Thanks for the food.

233
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
What?

234
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,220
What? Honey.

235
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,190
Are we just going to leave her be?

236
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,160
We need to see
what kind of person this guy is.

237
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm not sure what to do.
She seems to be head over heels this time.

238
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,000
Who is this guy she's seeing?

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
My goodness.

240
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,370
Dad, I'm heading out.

241
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,190
I want to live freely now
before it's too late.

242
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,620
I want to do what I want
to my heart's content.

243
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,930
Just for me, Lee Hye Sook.

244
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,600
I really want to live like that.

245
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Mi Jin.

246
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,670
Can't I...

247
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,270
do that for myself?

248
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,550
Hey, honey.

249
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,720
So, I've been doing some thinking.

250
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,160
You seem exhausted
from all the house chores...

251
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,060
and the work at the restaurant.

252
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,260
That being said,
how about you take a trip somewhere...

253
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,100
to freshen up your mood?

254
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,870
Taking some time apart
might give us a fresh perspective.

255
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,140
I think it'll be good for both of us.

256
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,310
Okay.

257
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,910
Great. Then let's do that.
I'll give you enough money for your trip.

258
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,150
No, I just want the lottery money.

259
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,890
What?

260
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,490
Let's split the lottery winnings
before I leave for my trip.

261
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,530
Seriously, honey.
Why are you being like this?

262
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,300
Do you really have to do this?

263
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,830
There are many things you want to do.

264
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,300
Let's split the lottery prize,
and you can do whatever you want.

265
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,470
I'll stay out of your way.

266
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,280
What? But...

267
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,080
Oh, dear.

268
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,120
So? What will you do?

269
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,190
I have no idea.

270
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,060
She said she wouldn't care what I do
once we split the lottery prize.

271
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,430
Just give it to her, then.

272
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,730
You'll still have over ten million,
even after giving her half.

273
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,900
Yes,

274
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,740
but I'm worried it'll really be over
as soon as she gets the money.

275
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,980
Hey, what do you want to do
about the Daewoon Building?

276
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,080
If you don't buy it now,
you'll miss the opportunity for good.

277
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,380
I haven't listed it yet
so you could buy it.

278
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,950
Or should I just go ahead
and put it up for sale?

279
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,260
Let me meet them first.

280
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,560
Meet who?

281
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,330
The owner of the building, who else?

282
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,570
Hey, why do you need to meet the owner?
You can sign the contract with me.

283
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,770
Of course, I should meet the owner.
If I'm buying such an expensive building,

284
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,210
it makes no sense
to go through with the transaction...

285
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,270
without meeting the owner first.

286
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,510
Hey, but how?

287
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,450
The owner isn't in Korea.

288
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,880
Really? When will they be back?

289
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,290
Not for at least another month.
They're really busy.

290
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,520
Something doesn't feel right.

291
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,930
We're talking about ten million dollars,
not a small amount of money.

292
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,700
Hey, I'm their representative.
What's there to worry?

293
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,470
I'd hate for both of us
to end up in a scam.

294
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,440
Let's say that person is a fraudster.

295
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,510
Then we'll lose everything
and take all the heat in the middle.

296
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,180
I'm saying all this because it's you.

297
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,690
Tae Ha.

298
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
Are you all right?

299
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,790
He doesn't have a fever.

300
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,230
Oh, boy.

301
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,330
Let me bring you some medicine.

302
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,650
What? How did that happen?
Are you all right?

303
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,580
Sorry. I should be there.

304
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,050
No, it's okay. Get some good rest
and feel better soon.

305
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
All right.

306
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,830
How did he catch the flu?

307
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,760
He seemed perfectly fine yesterday.

308
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,170
Hello.

309
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

310
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,400
You serve breakfast, right?

311
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,010
I'm sorry.
My employee didn't come in today,

312
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,040
so we're not ready to open yet.

313
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,280
Oh, no. I'm starving right now.

314
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,510
The truth is, this is the only restaurant
in the area that serves breakfast,

315
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,280
so I came here on purpose.

316
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,220
I have no energy to walk
all the way back. This is not good.

317
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,460
Then can you give me a few minutes?

318
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,960
I'll prepare it quickly.

319
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Really?

320
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,190
I'm so hungry
that I can't go anywhere right now.

321
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,930
I can't do anything when I'm this hungry.

322
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,070
I'm about to pass out now.

323
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,730
Please help me out.

324
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,140
Yes, I'll be quick.

325
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,770
Oh, what would you like to order?

326
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,640
Will you give me everything on that menu?

327
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,680
Pardon? Do you have someone joining you?

328
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,310
No, it's just for me. I'm a big eater.

329
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,750
But you said earlier that
your employee didn't come in today.

330
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,780
If it's too much,
should I take out a few things?

331
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,490
Well, no. Let me try.
Just give me a few minutes.

332
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,490
Thank you so much.

333
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,330
Here's everything you ordered.

334
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,800
Oh, my. You are amazing.

335
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,940
Do you mind if I record
a video of myself eating these?

336
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,870
Not at all. By all means.

337
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,940
- Thank you. I really appreciate it.
- Enjoy the food.

338
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,950
Hi, guys. It's Manli here.

339
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,420
Today, I'm at this small Korean restaurant
I stumbled upon.

340
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,490
I was so hungry that I ordered...

341
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,630
everything on the menu
as soon as I walked in.

342
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,130
I can't wait to taste these dishes.
I'll try them now.

343
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,800
I'm going to enjoy this meal!

344
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,340
(Buddumak)

345
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,150
Goodness.

346
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,350
Where's the part-timer?
Why are you doing this alone?

347
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,450
Well...

348
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,960
He's off today.

349
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,590
What about you?
What are you doing here at this hour?

350
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,930
I'm off too.

351
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,660
I have many vacation days left,
so I'm trying to use them up.

352
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,200
Have you thought about
what I said yesterday?

353
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,700
Well...

354
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,680
I'm not sure
how I feel about jumping into...

355
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,310
a serious relationship right away.

356
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,780
How about we keep things casual for now?

357
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,920
I see.

358
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,290
Sure, all right.

359
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,720
But just know this.

360
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,090
You may feel comfortable around me,

361
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,060
but I don't at all,

362
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,660
because you're...

363
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,370
not like a little sister to me.
I'm attracted to you,

364
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,600
so I'm not always comfortable around you.

365
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,370
I'm just reminding you in case you forget.

366
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,310
All right, I'll remember that.

367
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,010
(Han Seo Woo, Seo Hye Mi,
Shin Yoo Ah, Park Si Eun)

368
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,610
What? Seo Woo entered the model audition?

369
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,920
Yes. You didn't know?

370
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,180
No, I had no idea.

371
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,820
So, she entered the audition
without even telling you?

372
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
I guess. Why did she do that?

373
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,760
Anyway, I'll step aside
for the sake of a fair evaluation.

374
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Seok Jin.

375
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,270
Why did you come all this way?

376
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,910
I can see you later at home.

377
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,380
I wanted to see you.

378
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,380
I wanted to have lunch with you
since you had business nearby.

379
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,780
All right. Let's order.
I have a meeting right after this.

380
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,790
Oh, right. I saw you auditioned
to be the model for my company.

381
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,150
Why didn't you tell me?

382
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,920
Well, that's because...

383
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,730
I wanted to do this on my own.

384
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,630
All of your employees know
that I'm your girlfriend.

385
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,230
They would feel so pressured
if they heard you suggested the job to me.

386
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,670
It might be awkward for them
to reject me too.

387
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,970
So, I told them never to tell you
since it's a secret.

388
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,080
Is that what it was?

389
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,750
So, you don't know the results yet,
do you?

390
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,550
No, I think they're still discussing it.

391
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,690
Gosh, I hope I get the job.

392
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,690
Then, I'd get to see you often.
That would be so nice.

393
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
Did you perhaps...

394
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,230
apply for the job to see me?

395
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,290
I mean...

396
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,400
That would be a perk.

397
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,230
Seok Jin.

398
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,200
You can't help me get the job
just because I'm your girlfriend.

399
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,670
I'm going to get it fair and square
through my own talent.

400
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,610
Don't worry. I said
I'd leave the judging to the others.

401
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,650
Look at this mess.

402
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,920
Gosh, how can a girl's bedroom
look like a pigsty?

403
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,020
My, what a pain.

404
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,120
Goodness, all these clothes...

405
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,230
Who is this guy she wants to marry?

406
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,170
What's this?

407
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,970
What?

408
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,010
What's Seok Jin doing next to her?

409
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,080
Yes, I was busy earlier
and couldn't take your call.

410
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,850
What?

411
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,160
I'm sorry, but I'll call you back later.

412
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,430
(Warehouses and factories,
For lease or sale, Number One Real Estate)

413
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,300
He said he was going to invest more money?

414
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,700
"Invest?" What is she talking about?

415
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,070
So, don't lose focus until the end.

416
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,640
Do your job, okay?

417
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,240
I don't want any sass from you.

418
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,610
"Focus?"

419
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,810
What on earth are they talking about?

420
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,220
My gosh.

421
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,560
- What?
- Oh, my.

422
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Oh, dear.

423
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
What?

424
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,830
Are you okay?

425
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,300
Excuse me.

426
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Do you need help?

427
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,030
Oh, my.

428
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,630
What?

429
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
What?

430
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,600
What's up with that woman?

431
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,580
My gosh.

432
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,410
Gosh, that hurt so much.

433
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,180
By the way, who was that man?

434
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,290
No way.

435
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,590
Is she two-timing Gyu Tae?

436
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm going out for a delivery.

437
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Dae Sik.

438
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,130
What?

439
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,970
Oh, did you say something?

440
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,540
Should I ask him
if he's really getting a divorce?

441
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,310
Never mind.

442
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
I'm off.

443
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,710
Okay.

444
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Dae Sik.

445
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,990
Hey, Gyu Tae.

446
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,430
Oh, who's this?

447
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,860
This is the owner of the Daewoon Building.

448
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,560
What? The owner?

449
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,470
Hello. I'm Lee Chang Hwan,
the owner of the Daewoon Building.

450
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,010
Oh, right. Hello, I'm Kim Dae Sik.

451
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,170
By the way, how did you come...

452
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,610
Didn't you say he was staying abroad?

453
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,580
Oh, I called him,
and he happened to be in Korea.

454
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,350
So, I asked him to come.

455
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,220
Let's have a seat first.

456
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,920
Okay. Here, please have a seat.

457
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,420
- Okay.
- Yes, have a seat.

458
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
There you go.

459
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,730
(Jackpot Chicken)

460
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,530
What?

461
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,430
This must be a popular restaurant.

462
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Twisted donuts?

463
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,910
I should buy some for Mi Ja.

464
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,750
(Yisan)

465
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,280
The Yisan Building?

466
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,550
Do you remember the Yisan Building?

467
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,990
Yisan Building?

468
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,860
It was your building that was sold.

469
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,130
That building is called
the Yisan Building.

470
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,830
(Twisted donuts,
Simsong Real Estate, Yisan)

471
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,210
(Twisted donuts,
Simsong Real Estate, Yisan)

472
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,680
(Yisan)

473
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,040
My gosh.

474
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,310
If this building
and the Daewoon Building were mine,

475
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,620
I must've been...

476
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,850
really rich.

477
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,560
I've heard a lot about you from Mr. Choi.

478
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,360
I heard...

479
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,530
that you were interested
in buying the Daewoon Building.

480
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,170
Yes, that's right. This was where
my childhood home used to be.

481
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,900
I'm quite attached to the place.

482
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,970
Then, why don't you just buy it now?

483
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,810
I'll be going abroad again soon.

484
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Pardon?

485
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,350
Well, the thing is...

486
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,050
Come on.

487
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Say yes.

488
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,500
Go on.

489
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,220
(Thank you to Manli Park Min Jeong
for her special appearance.)

490
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,390
(Good Luck!)

491
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,230
I don't think Seo Woo's image
is right for our company.

492
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,900
Have you decided on a model?

493
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,030
The three million dollars
that I mentioned.

494
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,300
I never intended to accept it,
so don't worry.

495
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
Three million dollars?

496
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,200
I saw that woman, Mrs. Taylor.

497
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,370
She was going somewhere with another man.

498
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,370
A man?

499
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,040
Why are you with him?

500
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,510
