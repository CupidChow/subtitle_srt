1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,040
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,980
I believe there have been
quite a few misunderstandings...

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,680
and speculations
because of that money up until now.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,950
So, I've made up my mind.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,320
The lottery winnings.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,250
I'll split the money
and give it to you guys.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,430
What are you saying?

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,090
You will give the money to the kids?

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
First off,

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,470
the amount would be
the most important factor.

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,900
The three of you
will receive an equal amount.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
Five hundred thousand dollars.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,880
You will each be expected
to take care of your own gift tax.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,240
Let me make this clear to you.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,480
I will give each of you
500,000 dollars, but no more.

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,250
You will not receive a single penny more,

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,250
so make sure to put the money to good use.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,950
Hold on, 500,000 dollars?
Then what about Seok Jin?

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,220
He already got five million from us.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,590
So, Seok Jin is the only one
getting 5.5 million dollars?

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,160
Seok Jin, I expect you
to pay back the difference,

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,100
which is 4.5 million dollars.

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,930
You were supposed to pay it back anyway.

24
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,840
No, that's not right.

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,270
It is 4.5 million dollars, not 45 dollars.

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,840
How long do you think
it'll take him to pay it back?

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,210
He has just launched his business.

28
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,710
It'd be unfair to let him
keep the five million dollars...

29
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,750
while only giving them
500,000 dollars each.

30
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,580
You're each getting exactly 500,000.

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,350
No one will get more or less.

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,790
What is my deadline for repaying you?

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,020
We can discuss that at a later time.
In any case,

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,830
you have to pay back the money,
so don't forget.

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
And you, Mi Jin.

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,800
You said you should be able
to get the house back with 200,000.

37
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,330
That's right.

38
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,140
Even after paying the gift tax,
you should have enough...

39
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,000
to get the house back.

40
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,070
Whether you get the house back
with the money or do something else,

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,380
it is up to you.

42
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
All good, right?

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,160
What? Did you say 500,000 dollars?

44
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,260
He said he would only give his children
500,000 each from the lottery winnings?

45
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,200
That's right.
We should accept the money, right?

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,030
No, hold on. Let me think about this.

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,840
What's there to think about?

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,870
We need the money to get out of this rut.

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,240
But... My gosh.

50
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,940
Goodness.

51
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,950
What are you going to do, Seok Jin?

52
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,880
Can you pay back 4.5 million dollars?

53
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,120
I should pay him back, no matter what.

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,650
I was planning to pay him back anyway.

55
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,160
I know, but still...

56
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,260
Anyway, why is he suddenly offering
to give us money?

57
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,830
Five hundred thousand dollars, at that.

58
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,860
Honestly,

59
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,400
Even 100,000 feels huge.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,300
I can't even imagine
having that kind of money.

61
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,400
So, I'm a bit flustered
and confused right now.

62
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,710
You should have consulted with me first...

63
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,840
if you wanted to split
the lottery winnings with them.

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,010
You can't just go ahead
and decide the amount.

65
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,220
Had I consulted with you,
it wouldn't have ended at 500,000.

66
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,120
We would've ended up
blowing all the winnings.

67
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,760
Fine, whatever.

68
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,130
But why 500,000 dollars?

69
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,260
There are 3 of them,
so it's 1.5 million in total.

70
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,730
What will you do
with the rest of the money?

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,030
We won't do anything with the money.
We'll just leave it in the bank.

72
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,270
Don't touch that money again.

73
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,670
I gave the kids some of the money
as you wanted,

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,410
so don't bring it up again. You got that?

75
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,580
What? Unbelievable.

76
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,220
Dad must be home by now, right?

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,550
Should we visit Dad's place tomorrow?

78
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,920
Like a housewarming party.

79
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,760
Hey, that's a great idea.

80
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,890
Mom, you'll come too, right?

81
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
What?

82
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,520
It's you.

83
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,460
I thought Tae Ha would come.

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
No.

85
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,610
I should get my act together...

86
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,750
and get...

87
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,080
my memories back soon.

88
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,120
Let's eat. You must be hungry.

89
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,000
I am Min Yong's mom.

90
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,860
What's the matter?

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,400
You should apologize to my son too.

92
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,100
Thank you.

93
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,610
I'll tell my dad
about the hospital bill...

94
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,010
and pay you back for it soon.

95
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Min Yong.

96
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,060
You know what?

97
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,930
No matter if we're 20 or 50,

98
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,730
we all need a mom.

99
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,900
I felt that way too.

100
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,570
When I was six,

101
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,110
I thought I wouldn't need my mom
when I turned seven.

102
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,440
At seven years old,

103
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,380
I thought I wouldn't need my mom
when I turned eight.

104
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,210
But...

105
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,010
that wasn't how it worked.

106
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,250
Even at my age now,
there are times when I need my mom.

107
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,960
That is...

108
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,590
what our moms mean to us.

109
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,430
Dear Min Yong.

110
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,840
You must've had so many moments like that.

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,810
I got to have a new mom later on,

112
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,380
but for you, every single moment...

113
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,810
must've been so hard.

114
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,490
When I saw you earlier,

115
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,320
it reminded me of myself when I was young.

116
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,560
It made my heart ache so much.

117
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,800
And don't tell your dad about this.
He'll only worry.

118
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,670
As for the hospital bill,

119
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,370
you don't have to pay me back,
so don't worry about it.

120
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,940
If it really bothers you,

121
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,940
you can just come to my house
every now and then and eat with me.

122
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,150
Oftentimes, I don't want to eat by myself.

123
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,150
And I get bored,
not having anyone to talk to.

124
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,490
It would be so nice to have you around
for those instances.

125
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,290
What do you say?

126
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,330
Good. Then, from now on,
we'll be secret friends.

127
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Here.

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
All right. Let's eat.

129
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,570
You're inviting a woman
to Min Yong's birthday party?

130
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,140
Is it perhaps that woman, Mrs. Taylor?
You've been seeing her often.

131
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,580
Yes, that's her.

132
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,480
She might become your sister-in-law
in the future, so please treat her nicely.

133
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,290
Then,
are you even considering marrying her?

134
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,460
By the way, why is Min Yong running late?

135
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,960
He just called. He's at Geum Ok's house.

136
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,200
What? Why is he over there?

137
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,570
I guess he ran into her on the street.

138
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,470
By the way, Gyu Tae,

139
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,570
on the day Min Yong ran away from home,

140
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,640
where did you spend the night?

141
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,380
You didn't spend the whole night
with Geum Ok, did you?

142
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,110
Are you crazy?
Why would I spend the night with her?

143
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,110
Gosh, you scared me.

144
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,180
Why are you yelling at me?
You nearly burst my eardrums.

145
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,450
Enough of your nonsense!
Just go to bed! My goodness.

146
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,160
What utter nonsense is that?

147
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,860
Gosh, that punk.

148
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,130
My goodness. Why is he talking nonsense?

149
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,730
Gosh, seriously. He's such a fool.

150
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,400
Anyway, why is Min Yong at her place?
It feels so awkward.

151
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,720
Why did you ask to see me?

152
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,350
You're here.

153
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,090
I wanted to have a drink with you.
I'll pour you a glass.

154
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,460
I thought about what you said earlier,

155
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,660
and I would've been angry too.

156
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,300
You must've thought, "He's there to work,
but he's on a date instead."

157
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,070
"He must think our work is a joke."
I'm sure that's what you thought.

158
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
But Ye Won,

159
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm upset about something too.

160
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,610
If something was bothering you,
you should've said so right away.

161
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,680
Why were you all sulky?

162
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,350
It really weighed on my mind.

163
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,350
Is that how things are between us?

164
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,590
I was worried
that something might've happened to you.

165
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,790
"What if her dad is sick again?"

166
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,230
"Or did something bad happen?"

167
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,700
Do you know how worried I was by myself?

168
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,770
So,

169
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,340
if something like this happens
in the future, tell me right away. Okay?

170
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,710
Right. This is the kind of person you are.

171
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,210
You know me better than anyone...

172
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,210
and worry about me the most.

173
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,080
You haven't changed one bit,

174
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,650
and you're by my side like this.

175
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,720
What was I thinking?

176
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,820
Okay, I will.

177
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,190
Sorry for being so grumpy.

178
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,760
No, it's understandable.

179
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,270
Then, we're all good, right?

180
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,970
Now that we're done talking about me,
tell me about you.

181
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,970
About me?

182
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,610
I can tell
just from that look on your face.

183
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Something's going on, right?

184
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,180
I can't fool you.

185
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,750
Actually,

186
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,480
about the five million dollars
that I said was an investment.

187
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,820
It looks like
we'll have to pay it back soon.

188
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,250
Not all of it. Just 4.5 million dollars.

189
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,690
What? But why?

190
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,590
Something just came up and led to this.

191
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,200
Sorry. I keep causing problems
with our investments.

192
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,300
Don't be sorry. We were able
to keep getting investments thanks to you.

193
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Don't worry. If we just postpone
the distribution center expansion,

194
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,070
we'll be able
to put 4.5 million dollars together.

195
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,480
Is this how things will go
because of money?

196
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,250
I was really looking forward to...

197
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,580
expanding the distribution center.

198
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,650
Don't worry. We're doing well now.

199
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,250
Soon, we'll be able to pay everything back
and find our footing.

200
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,660
Keep your chin up.

201
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,790
Cheers.

202
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,560
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

203
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Thanks.

204
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,430
(Seo Woo)

205
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,670
Gosh, why isn't he picking up?

206
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,870
Did he fall asleep?

207
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
Hello?

208
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,770
Who is this?

209
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,140
It's me. This is Seo Woo, right?

210
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,170
Why are you answering Seok Jin's phone?

211
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,140
I was having a few drinks with Seok Jin.

212
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,380
He just stepped away to use the restroom.

213
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,250
Oh, you must be having a team dinner.

214
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,920
No, it's just the two of us.

215
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,490
Seok Jin and me. Just us.

216
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,760
Just you and Seok Jin?

217
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,120
I guess you didn't know.

218
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Seok Jin asked me
to grab a drink with him,

219
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,390
so I thought he had told you about it.

220
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,800
I'll tell Seok Jin to call you
once he gets back.

221
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,130
But... Hello?

222
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,170
Shall we go now?

223
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,310
Seo Woo just called.

224
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,950
I answered your phone
since it kept ringing.

225
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
That's okay, right?

226
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,080
Yes, I'll call her back.

227
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,060
Did all of you...

228
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,530
think about what I said yesterday?

229
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,470
Let me know as soon as you decide.

230
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
So, Dad.

231
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,880
The 500,000 dollars
that you want to give me.

232
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,680
You don't have to give me that.

233
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,050
What are you saying?

234
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,920
You don't want me to give you
the 500,000 dollars?

235
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,150
It's too much money for me,

236
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,390
and I'm just not used to taking money
from someone...

237
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,790
that I didn't work for.

238
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,730
Goodness, your dad isn't any old person.

239
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,100
Just take the money when he offers it.

240
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,630
That's right. You don't have to
pay me back for that, so no pressure.

241
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,900
That only makes me not want it.

242
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,280
I recently realized
that money is a really scary thing.

243
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
If I accept that money now,

244
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,180
I'm afraid I might live like a bum
since I'd have that money to fall back on.

245
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,650
I like making money...

246
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,920
by working hard for it.

247
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,790
So, you don't have to
give me that money, okay?

248
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,030
Hey, are you really not going
to accept that money?

249
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,570
What? That's right.

250
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,800
Don't be like that. Just take it.

251
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,670
You might think you don't need it now,
but later on,

252
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,170
you'll regret it so much,
wondering why you did such a thing.

253
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,310
Well, that might happen later on,

254
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,180
but as of now, I don't want to accept it.

255
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Mom.

256
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,450
Tie my hair for me.

257
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,590
Oh, okay.

258
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
Hey, Ji Yeon.

259
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,830
What? Was that today?

260
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,370
All right, I'll see you later. Bye.

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
My gosh. What should I wear?

262
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,210
Seriously, I just don't get it.

263
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,850
Why is Ah Jin saying she won't take
the money when he's offering it?

264
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,710
You just don't know her well.

265
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,680
I'm not surprised Ah Jin is doing this.

266
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,720
Actually, honey, I looked into it.

267
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,420
The gift tax on 500,000
will be 80,000 dollars.

268
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,330
That means we'll have nothing left
once we get the house back...

269
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,260
and pay off our debt.

270
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,900
What can we do?

271
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,030
We should just take the money
and get the house back.

272
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,600
Honey, that said,

273
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,370
what about asking for five million dollars
like Seok Jin?

274
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,340
What? Five million?

275
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,210
We can say that
we'll pay it back like Seok Jin did.

276
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,380
How are we going to pay back
that kind of money? Stop talking nonsense.

277
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,420
The truth is, there's this business idea
I've had for a while.

278
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,390
You know my friend, Yong Seop, right?

279
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,320
This is something
Yong Seop only shared with me.

280
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,090
If it goes well,
we can definitely pay back that money.

281
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,030
What is it?

282
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,100
A Hanwoo restaurant.

283
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,430
A restaurant
that specializes in Hanwoo beef.

284
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,540
It's a high-margin business,

285
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,770
so Yong Seop is making a killing now.

286
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,040
So, if we just do as he says,

287
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,710
we're guaranteed to succeed.

288
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,780
Come on. Even so, how could we...

289
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,720
Isn't five million too much?

290
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,580
No, it is not!

291
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,750
You need that much money
to start and run a business.

292
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,530
Also, you probably didn't know this,

293
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,390
but I've always wanted
to have my own business.

294
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,200
Honestly, when I heard about
Seok Jin and his business,

295
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,800
I was so jealous.

296
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,540
You see, I can do a really good job too.

297
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,270
But since I didn't have money,

298
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,670
I only thought about it
and never acted on it.

299
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,710
Really?

300
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
Yes.

301
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Honey.

302
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,010
I'm confident that I can do a great job.

303
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,780
So, let's become successful
and show your parents...

304
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,820
how comfortable and happy we are.
Let's show them, okay?

305
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,690
Then it'll be fine, right?

306
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,330
My gosh.

307
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,630
Honey, please?

308
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,370
I guess you got home late last night.

309
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,270
Yes, sorry.

310
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,340
I ended up grabbing a drink with Ye Won,

311
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,840
but I couldn't tell you before I went out.

312
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,680
I called you, but you didn't pick up.

313
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,080
Are you really angry?

314
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,350
No, I'm not angry.

315
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,360
Are you sure?

316
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,690
Yes, of course.

317
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,630
I'm not such a narrow-minded woman
who can't even understand that much.

318
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,400
All right, thanks for understanding.

319
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,830
You didn't answer my call,
so I thought you were mad at me.

320
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,640
But from now on,
you have to tell me before you go out,

321
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,910
no matter who you're meeting. Okay?

322
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,810
Okay, I will.

323
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,510
Hey, I'm running late.
I'll talk to you after work.

324
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,710
Okay, bye.

325
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,710
Bye.

326
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,060
Oh, my. This is actually possible?

327
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,190
I didn't get mad at a guy
for something like that.

328
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,960
Well done, Han Seo Woo.

329
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,470
What would you have done if he'd wanted
to break up because you were angry?

330
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Well done.

331
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Hey, Mom.

332
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,470
Did you change the light bulb
in the kitchen?

333
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
The light bulb?

334
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,550
Oh, these are LED bulbs too.

335
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,310
When did we get these LED bulbs?

336
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,290
LED? What's the difference?

337
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,890
Oh, LED bulbs last longer,

338
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,690
so you can use them
without having to change them often.

339
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,960
Did Dad change the light bulbs?

340
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,160
What? No way.

341
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,970
I've never seen Dad
change any light bulbs.

342
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,080
Don't struggle on your own.

343
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,550
Share the burden.

344
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,050
Even something
as trivial as changing a light bulb too.

345
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,350
No way.

346
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,090
He changed them before he left?

347
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,120
For me?

348
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,030
Hey, you're here.

349
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,770
So? How are you liking your new place?

350
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,940
It's not bad.

351
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,340
But there's one thing that bothers me.

352
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,180
What's that?

353
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,550
The fact that Mi Ja isn't there.

354
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,650
Seeing how much I miss her
after a short while apart...

355
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,280
(Jackpot Chicken)

356
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,290
I think I really love her.

357
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,590
Well...

358
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,490
You don't think things could work out
between the two of you at all?

359
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,730
I really hope things work out,

360
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,360
but I don't think
that is what Mi Ja wants.

361
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,370
Oh, right. Don't you remember...

362
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,300
any of the people who were close to me?

363
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,570
People who were close to you?

364
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,970
That's right.

365
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,710
If I got scammed too,

366
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,480
meeting my acquaintances might help me...

367
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,880
figure out what happened.

368
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,650
Well, I remember nothing
about your acquaintances.

369
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,560
It could be people, places,
or anything else related to me.

370
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,390
Tell me if there's anything you remember.

371
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,090
Places?

372
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,630
Right! That place.

373
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
What?

374
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,800
Hey, Min Yong.

375
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,670
Come here for a second.

376
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,840
It's your birthday today.

377
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,210
I'm throwing your birthday party.

378
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,150
Invite all your friends.

379
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,620
Forget it. I don't want a party.

380
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,620
Actually,
can I really invite whoever I want?

381
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,890
Of course! Invite whoever you want.

382
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,360
I'm going to throw you an amazing party.

383
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,730
- Okay.
- What?

384
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,900
See you later.

385
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
- All right.
- Hey.

386
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,860
- My goodness.
- Bye.

387
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,100
- Have a good day.
- Why is he so excited?

388
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,230
Oh, my.

389
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,370
That seems to have worked.
He's so excited!

390
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,710
Yes. Hey, pick a nice place.

391
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,380
I don't care how much it costs.

392
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,710
Book the coolest place you can find.

393
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,020
Okay, I'll find a very nice place.

394
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,090
Did you sleep well, Mrs. Taylor?

395
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,990
I slept well too.

396
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,330
I'm good, but I miss you, Mrs. Taylor.

397
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,300
All right. I'll call you later.

398
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,910
It must've been that woman on the phone.

399
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,170
I guess things are going well with her.

400
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,780
Well, yes.

401
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,980
How did the two of you meet?

402
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,580
I was introduced to her.

403
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,420
I see, you were introduced to her.

404
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,990
That reminds me.
I'm going on a blind date soon.

405
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,190
- A blind date?
- Yes.

406
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,100
As you know, I've kept my distance
from men for too long.

407
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,570
It's not like anyone's going to praise me
for staying single my whole life.

408
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,930
Why did I live such a boring life?

409
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,800
So, I'm going to date
as much as I can from now on.

410
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,770
I'm off.

411
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,720
Goodness.

412
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,590
(Closed today due to personal reasons,
Thank you for visiting Buddumak.)

413
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,190
That's right. I used to
have a crush on you, Dong Min.

414
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,930
Gosh, she had such low standards for men
even when she was young.

415
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,970
Why did she have a crush
on someone like him?

416
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,140
There you are.

417
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,490
Hey.

418
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,790
What's with that outfit?

419
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,060
Oh, this. I'm going
to my friend's wedding today.

420
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,870
(Closed)

421
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,210
It feels really awkward
dressing up after so long.

422
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,250
How do I look? Do I look all right?

423
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,060
Who even wears makeup like that anymore?

424
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,690
And that outfit is so dowdy.

425
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,130
Is that the best you can do?

426
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,300
This is the only decent outfit I have.
The same goes for my makeup.

427
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,470
Whatever. It's not like I'm going there
to impress someone.

428
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,570
I like this,
and that's all that matters. Right?

429
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,540
When I'm back from the wedding,

430
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,280
we'll tidy up together...

431
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,080
so we can reopen tomorrow.

432
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,590
Can't you hear me?

433
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,250
What?

434
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,720
Oh, sure.

435
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,760
Hey, about that manager guy.

436
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,460
Is he really your first love?

437
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,170
What?

438
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,570
Oh, nothing. Don't mind me.

439
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,520
What's the matter with me?
Is something wrong with my eyes?

440
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Don't touch that money again.

441
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,260
I gave the kids some of the money
as you wanted,

442
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,530
so don't bring it up again. You got that?

443
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,670
I can't help but feel suspicious.

444
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,570
Did he perhaps buy something
without my knowing...

445
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,770
like when he bought the house?

446
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,120
Oh, what's this?

447
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,020
"Dear L?"

448
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,690
"Hi, it's Dae Sik."

449
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,160
"Please don't be too surprised,
and hear me out."

450
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,600
(Dear L)

451
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,570
"From the first moment I saw you,
I fell in love with you."

452
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,930
"I'm sure you don't know how I feel."

453
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,500
"I've never expressed my feelings to you."

454
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,640
Gosh, when did he write
something like this?

455
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,050
"Even if my letter never reaches you..."

456
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,990
Even if my letter never reaches you,

457
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,490
I hope you find out how I feel about you.

458
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,260
To my shining first love, L.

459
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
My goodness.

460
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,870
Oh, hello.

461
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,140
Oh, hi.

462
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,280
Are you going to see Mu Chul?

463
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,380
No, I was just...

464
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,050
walking by.

465
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,860
Seeing how much I miss her
after a short while apart...

466
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,360
(Jackpot Chicken)

467
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,460
I think I really love her.

468
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,030
Are you really going to split up
with Mu Chul just like this?

469
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,270
Pardon?

470
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,870
Mu Chul has been having a hard time
since he moved out.

471
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,800
He really misses you.

472
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,410
If there's any possibility,

473
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,910
I was hoping
you'd think it over once more.

474
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,150
No, I have no intention of doing so.

475
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
What are you doing there?

476
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,730
What? I was taking out the recycling.

477
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,560
Isn't that Mi Ja?

478
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,300
Her husband is lying in bed
with an injury.

479
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,930
Where is she going?

480
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,540
Mu Chul doesn't live there anymore.

481
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
He moved out.

482
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,540
What are you saying? He moved out?

483
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,510
Those two got divorced.

484
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,180
Divorced?

485
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,750
It's a place called Flower Wagon Bar.

486
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,250
You should check that place out.

487
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,370
Hello.

488
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,110
I am...

489
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,440
Mr. Han Mu Chul's cousin,

490
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,480
Han Min Chul.

491
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,820
Oh, that's why.

492
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,290
I was so shocked to see someone
who looks exactly like the late Mr. Han.

493
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,290
But what brings you here?

494
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
Well...

495
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,460
I heard that
my cousin used to come here often.

496
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,300
I was curious who he came with...

497
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,100
and who he met up with.

498
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,670
There was only one person
Mr. Han would meet up with.

499
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,140
Who is that person?

500
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,410
His name is Jang Tae Poong.
He's a nasty guy.

501
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,510
Jang...

502
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,950
Tae Poong?

503
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,830
(Good Luck!)

504
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,060
Do you have a boyfriend right now?

505
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,160
What about you?

506
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,600
Do you have a girlfriend?

507
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,530
Well...

508
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,170
This is my favorite person in the world,

509
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,770
- Over here.
- and I respect her more than anyone.

510
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,510
- I want to win Mother's favor.
- Hey, why are you doing this? My gosh!

511
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,210
Why do I keep causing trouble instead?

512
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,910
Just meet with him.

513
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,310
He's an important person
in terms of our business expansion.

514
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,080
