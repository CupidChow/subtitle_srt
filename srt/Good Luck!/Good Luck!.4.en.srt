1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,480
Hey.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,310
Han Mu Chul.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
What?

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,880
You called my name. Spit it out already.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,990
Save me.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,660
If you kick us out, we have nowhere to go.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,190
I'm about to go bankrupt right now.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,260
Please help me out.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,970
What?

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,570
(Episode 4)

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
Hey, man. What's with you?

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,540
Goodness. How embarrassing.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,410
This is embarrassing.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,510
Well, let's talk later.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,480
All right? My goodness.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,660
(669 Chicken, Jackpot Chicken)

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,300
Our mattress care program is amazing.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,530
After the first session,

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,200
everyone goes, "My gosh.
I didn't know my mattress was so dusty."

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,640
Everyone is shocked.

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,840
Would you like to take a look?

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,270
Do you mind cleaning the water tray too?

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,410
My gosh. Of course,
I should wash this for you.

24
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,580
If you think it's a hassle
to take care of your own mattress,

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,620
you could take advantage
of our mattress rental service.

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,750
You see those cups there, right?

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,560
Do you mind washing them too?

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,660
Pardon? You want me to wash these?

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,360
Well, you're using
the dish detergent anyway.

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,860
Why waste the dish detergent?

31
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,260
There are only two cups.

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,700
Ma'am.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,900
Even so, this is...

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,600
How much is the monthly payment
for the mattress care program?

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,780
Of course, I should wash these
while I'm at it anyway.

36
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,280
It's 29 dollars a month.

37
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,250
The package deal is cheaper.

38
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,680
Don't you need a bidet?

39
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,290
Please excuse me for a moment.

40
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,490
Sure.

41
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,960
Hi, Mom. I'm working. What's up?

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,290
What? A hundred thousand dollars?

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,730
That is nuts.

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,930
Is 100,000 dollars a dog's name
or something?

45
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,540
It's not like it'll magically appear
if you say "100,000 dollars."

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,110
You should've told me sooner.

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,740
You have me, your daughter.

48
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,180
Why keep it to yourselves
and let it stress you out like this?

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,850
It's not like you can come up
with a solution for us.

50
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,180
I know you guys are struggling too.

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,990
We could at least bring it up
to Ji Woo's dad.

52
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,190
Don't you know he got a new job recently?

53
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,420
How could he have any money to spare
when he just started his new job?

54
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,490
Don't worry.

55
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,590
I just wanted to vent to my eldest child.

56
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,500
How could I not worry?

57
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,700
My family is about to get thrown out
onto the streets.

58
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,340
Well...

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,040
Are they really going to seize
everything you have?

60
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,170
The card company said they would.

61
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,880
But won't they be lenient with us
if we make a partial payment?

62
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,380
Be honest with me.

63
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,180
How much do you have
in your bank account now?

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,280
Not including the money you need
for your supplies,

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,750
rent, living expenses, and so on.

66
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,090
How much can you put toward
the credit card payment?

67
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,490
Zero.

68
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,290
What?

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,030
I said, zero.

70
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,960
Forget about our rent and supplies.
We have nothing now.

71
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,830
Your dad and I...

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,830
can barely feed ourselves at the moment.

73
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,210
I heard the loan would be approved,
so I never doubted it,

74
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,770
but the bank denied our application.

75
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,840
Even if we could borrow 100,000 dollars,
we'd still be in debt.

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,710
But the landlord wants to raise
our deposit by 100,000 dollars.

77
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
I'm so scared, Mi Jin.

78
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,380
What if your dad and I...

79
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,790
end up behind bars?

80
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,020
What if we get arrested...

81
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,330
for not being able to make
our credit card payments?

82
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,530
Don't be ridiculous.

83
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,360
Do you think I'll let that happen?

84
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,570
Would I just sit back
and watch you two go through that?

85
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,540
I'll come up with the money somehow.

86
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,670
So, stop sounding so weak. Okay, Mom?

87
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,780
For this question, let's start with...

88
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,980
Get up, you punk.

89
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,520
Why are you hitting me?

90
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,950
- What?
- Oh, no!

91
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,190
When I see you lying around like this,

92
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,660
my heart races like mad.

93
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,590
Why did you have to quit
your perfectly fine job?

94
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,260
Gosh, seriously.

95
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,960
Mom, you don't even know.

96
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,600
They won't even give me credit...

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,870
because I only went to a junior college.
What else could I do?

98
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,900
Even when I went to work,
they just made me do busywork...

99
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,440
and run errands all day.

100
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,310
Still, you should've hung in there.

101
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,170
You have a child to raise.

102
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,580
Can't you even put up with that much?

103
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,140
Goodness, why do I even bother?

104
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,680
It's all my fault.

105
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,380
My fault for not raising my child right.

106
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,850
Goodness. Mom, please!

107
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,590
Mom, how could you say that?

108
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,720
Your child feels hurt listening to you.

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,960
Mi Jin thinks you're doing fine at work.

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,060
What if you get caught?

111
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,900
I know. That's why I'm doing my best
and going to job interviews.

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,730
I already had two interviews today.

113
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,370
I'm stressed out enough as it is.

114
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,800
Why are you adding to it too?

115
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,610
Mom, I'm scared too.
I can't even sleep at night.

116
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,910
Mi Jin said that if I got fired
from one more job,

117
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,940
she would break my legs.

118
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,410
My gosh.

119
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,750
I'm scared she might catch me too.

120
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,550
Oh, dear.

121
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,160
Hurry!

122
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,930
Gosh, Mother. I'm home.

123
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,600
Oh, hey.

124
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,370
- Mother, why are you sweating so much?
- What?

125
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,940
You should go and wash up.

126
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
I'm fine.

127
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,010
You must be hungry.

128
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,910
Come. You should eat if you're hungry.

129
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,510
I made some spicy soup.

130
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,380
Mother.

131
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,790
You made it with chicken again,
didn't you?

132
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,390
Chicken is cheap.

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,290
Still, beef tastes better.

134
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,290
You know I don't like spicy chicken soup.

135
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,700
You only make spicy chicken soup
because Gwang Sik likes it.

136
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,700
Don't you care about what I like?

137
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,910
And the bean sprouts you made yesterday.

138
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,580
- What?
- They were so salty.

139
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,580
Don't you know that
Ji Woo shouldn't eat salty foods?

140
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,610
Still, it tastes better that way.

141
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,420
That's such an outdated way of thinking.

142
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,890
These days,
people care about their health...

143
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,350
and eat low-sodium diets. I told you that.

144
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,290
You have high blood pressure too.

145
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,060
No.

146
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,330
Why? What's wrong?

147
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,070
I was in the middle of washing
my underwear.

148
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,300
Come on, Mother.

149
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,440
That's no big deal between us.

150
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,370
Are you looking down on me
because I'm old?

151
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,310
Gosh, what are you saying?
I'm not looking down on you.

152
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,040
Do you think I don't have my pride?

153
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,010
Does an old woman have to show
her daughter-in-law...

154
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,880
her underwear and be fine with it?

155
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,590
Why are you getting angry?

156
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,120
What did I do?

157
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,090
Okay, I won't go in there.

158
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,230
I'll wash my hands at the kitchen sink.
Okay?

159
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,210
- Oh, my! What is this?
- Gosh, how humiliating!

160
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,510
I'm upset enough as it is.

161
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,780
Why is Mother acting all weird too?

162
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,020
By the way, will Gwang Sik be able
to get a loan from work?

163
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,920
I hope he can.

164
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,230
That one is good too.

165
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,100
(Good meat comes
from the tip of a good blade.)

166
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,200
- Right there.
- I'll take a tray of meat.

167
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,430
Okay. Here.

168
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,140
There you go.

169
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,410
It's no use. Just leave.

170
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,710
Still, please reconsider it just once.

171
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,180
Don't you see my customers lined up?

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,810
I don't need to do
some online sales nonsense.

173
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,780
I already have plenty of customers,
so just leave.

174
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,480
But it's not like that.

175
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,720
Gosh, get out of the way.

176
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,390
Sir, please.
You could still read through it once...

177
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,970
Hello?

178
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,300
Is that you, Seok Jin?

179
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,370
Yes, Mom.

180
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,440
What's going on?

181
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,470
I just...

182
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,640
suddenly thought of you.

183
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,610
Have you eaten?

184
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,410
Yes.

185
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,250
What's wrong with your voice, though?

186
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Are you not feeling well?

187
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm fine.

188
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,120
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

189
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,860
Don't skip your meals, okay?

190
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,030
I'll call you again.

191
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Mom...

192
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,000
(Good meat comes
from the tip of a good blade.)

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,770
Should I have mentioned that I'm back?

194
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,570
I'm going to go there later anyway.

195
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,180
(Number of Rolls,
Number of Coins, Total Amount)

196
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,690
It would be nice
if the ATMs could accept coins too.

197
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,090
I'm sorry I bother you
with these every time.

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,400
Don't say that. It's more of a hassle
for you to carry your bankbook.

199
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,070
I'm fine with carrying my bankbook around.

200
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,210
Looking at that is my only joy in life.

201
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,810
I'm going to work hard, save up,
and open up my own shop.

202
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,540
Oh, my. I see.

203
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,380
I think about this every time I see you,

204
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,920
but you really are impressive.

205
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,250
Not many young people these days
are like you.

206
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,950
That's not true.

207
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,700
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

208
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,830
(Nara Bank, Kim Ah Jin)

209
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,740
(Cash deposit 515.10 dollars,
Total balance 31,030.04 dollars)

210
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,470
Have a good day.

211
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,720
I'd like to take out a loan.

212
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,760
Welcome.

213
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,560
Darn it. I can't even get a bank loan.

214
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,660
What should I do?

215
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,370
What will you have?

216
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,140
I said, "What will you have?"

217
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,340
Can't you hear me?

218
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,240
Go. I won't have you take my order.

219
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,950
- What?
- I won't let you take my order,

220
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,350
so go away.

221
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,910
Stop pestering me with your questions.

222
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,420
Excuse me. Why are you talking down to me?

223
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,860
You're younger than me, aren't you?

224
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,330
Still, we're not close enough
that you can speak down to me like that.

225
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,960
Oh, I don't speak casually
just because I'm close to someone.

226
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,700
I talk down to people who are laughable.

227
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,830
What did you say?

228
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,540
If you keep this up, I won't let it slide.

229
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,070
If you don't let it slide,
what will you do?

230
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,540
Then I will speak casually too, Tae Ha.

231
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,240
Your name is Tae Ha, isn't it?

232
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,510
Han Tae Ha.

233
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,450
What? Why, you little...

234
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,780
Hey, Tae Ha. You're here.

235
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,750
What?

236
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,220
What's wrong? Did something happen?

237
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,190
Jin Tae, have you ever thought
about hiring someone else?

238
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,630
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

239
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm giving you some serious advice
for your sake.

240
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,100
You should hire someone else right away.

241
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,300
What's wrong with Ah Jin?

242
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,970
She's a great worker and very nice.

243
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,240
There's no one like her these days.

244
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,840
You don't know what you're talking about.

245
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,240
Jin Tae, from the perspective
of a business administration major,

246
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,740
she's a negative element to your business.

247
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,050
Do you know how much an employee's looks
contribute to sales figures?

248
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,380
And she has zero customer service skills.
If you keep a server like her,

249
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,720
you might just go under.

250
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Hey.

251
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,220
Your parents are friends,

252
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,130
and you live in the same house,
just on different floors.

253
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,330
That's quite a connection you have there.

254
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,160
Why do you keep growling at each other
every time you meet?

255
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,760
Are you asking because you don't know?

256
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,430
If she's ugly, she should at least have
a nice personality.

257
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,400
If she has a bad personality,
she should at least be polite.

258
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,740
She just looks pathetic too.

259
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,970
My gosh.

260
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,110
Gosh, she's making me lose my appetite.

261
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,280
Hey, enough of your nonsense.
You should stay for a meal.

262
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,620
Oh, right. Jin Tae.

263
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,420
Actually,
I came to talk to you about something.

264
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,260
Do you have any money?

265
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,490
What? Why do you suddenly need money?

266
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,590
Well...

267
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm trying to start a new business,

268
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,200
but I'm a little short on funds.

269
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,170
If you lend me some money
you have lying around,

270
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,270
I'll double... No, I'll triple it for you.

271
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,340
You should invest in me, Jin Tae.

272
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,610
Hey.

273
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,110
I don't have any money, punk.

274
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,340
I'm barely able to make rent these days.

275
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,250
I thought the economy was bouncing back
after COVID-19 passed,

276
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,410
but things are still really bad.

277
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,220
People just won't spend any money.

278
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,520
Also, the government handed out
a support fund,

279
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,050
but they're asking for it back now.

280
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,420
Goodness. I can't believe it.

281
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,720
How is that a support fund?
Are they trying to annoy me?

282
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,090
And do you think that's it?

283
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,030
These darn landlords, you know...

284
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,000
Gosh, okay. I get it.

285
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,930
I was just saying.

286
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,230
Gosh, I'm hungry.
Hey, I want some spicy pork.

287
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,740
My gosh. My brother looks great.

288
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,280
What do you think? Do I look okay?

289
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,650
Why are you going on blind dates
at your age?

290
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,610
What?

291
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,480
- Why, that little...
- Hey, Gyu Tae.

292
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,990
Who are you meeting today?

293
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,650
Is she your type?

294
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,120
Well, I don't know.

295
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,720
She's kind of old, though.

296
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,830
Really? How old is she?

297
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,890
She's two years younger than me.

298
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,660
Hey, that's good enough.

299
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,900
How young does she have to be?

300
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,170
Think of your own age.

301
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,170
What's wrong with my age?

302
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,070
Don't you know they say life begins at 60?

303
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,640
I am still young, you see.

304
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,910
Okay, enough about her age.

305
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,710
Is she pretty?
You only want to date pretty women.

306
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,780
She is pretty, indeed.

307
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,420
- That brat...
- Wait, really?

308
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,690
But how do you know that?

309
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,690
I've seen her picture.

310
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,720
I need to know if they're pretty
before I decide to meet them.

311
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,430
Prescreening is a must!

312
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,730
Anyway, I hope it goes well.

313
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,800
Then Min Yong will get a mom.

314
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,700
I never said I needed a mom!

315
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,640
How much longer do I have to put up
with that brat's teenage angst?

316
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,480
My goodness.

317
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,940
Leave him be. He'll snap out of it soon.

318
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,180
Will you go straight there?

319
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,110
No, I have to take care of something
on the way.

320
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,620
Hey, how do I look?

321
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,490
Do I look all right?

322
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,890
Of course. You look perfect!

323
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,420
All right, then.

324
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,430
Let's do this.

325
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,130
What's taking them so long?

326
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,830
At this rate,
I'll be late to my blind date.

327
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,440
- Oh, boy. These are so heavy.
- What? Hey.

328
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,340
Why are you here?
Where are the paperhangers?

329
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,210
Shut it. Help me with these.

330
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,240
My goodness.

331
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,640
Gosh, these are heavy.

332
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,940
What are these?

333
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,050
Wallpaper, what else?

334
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,120
You said you wanted
to redo the wallpaper today.

335
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
What?

336
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,050
You didn't hire professional paperhangers?

337
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,820
Professional paperhangers? Come on.

338
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,560
The two of us can do this
if we take our time with it.

339
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,730
Why hire paperhangers?
That'd be such a waste of money.

340
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,330
Hey, the two of us?

341
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,300
How are we going to do this ourselves?
Besides...

342
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,170
I've got plans, so I have to go.

343
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,540
Let me see.

344
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,410
You punk. Got another blind date?

345
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,340
Anyway,

346
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,980
I can't do this.
You need to hire paperhangers now.

347
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,810
Oh, is that so?

348
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
Then,

349
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,450
you can cancel the lease agreement.

350
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,190
No! Hey, wait.

351
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,820
No, I'll do it.

352
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,690
Just for an hour, though. Okay?

353
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
My gosh.

354
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,370
My hair will get all messy.

355
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,000
Hey, I can't do this.

356
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,700
Hire paperhangers now!

357
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,110
Don't be such a slacker, man.

358
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,080
Hey, this is so easy.

359
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,210
Really? Then you do the ceiling.

360
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,480
The ceiling? Sure.

361
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Why not?

362
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
Oh, right.

363
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,560
I totally forgot that
I had an important appointment today.

364
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,990
What?

365
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,390
You can finish the rest, right?

366
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,230
Finish it up...

367
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,400
and make sure to leave the windows open
when you're done.

368
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
- I'm off.
- Hey.

369
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,630
Mu Chul. Hey, Han Mu Chul!

370
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,670
My gosh.

371
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,340
Darn it! I won't do this either.

372
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,310
Fine, I'll spend my own money.

373
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,780
Hello? Is this the wallpaper store?

374
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,220
I need to redo the wallpaper
in a 100m² apartment.

375
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,390
Can you send me a team?

376
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,720
What? It costs 1,500 dollars?

377
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
Forget it!

378
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,360
Mu Chul, this jerk.

379
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,260
He's working me like a dog...

380
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,030
to save 1,500 dollars?

381
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,970
Darn it.

382
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,210
Hello, Number One Real Estate.

383
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
The wallpaper?

384
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,950
Of course. It's almost done.

385
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,790
Pardon? By tomorrow?

386
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,530
Sure thing. It'll be done by tomorrow.

387
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,860
Yes, all right. Bye.

388
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,740
Han Mu Chul!

389
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,610
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

390
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,550
You made a wise decision, brother.

391
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,520
I assure you
that you won't regret investing in this.

392
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,990
Yes, I know!

393
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,960
I decided...

394
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,060
to invest in it because I trust you,
Mr. Jang.

395
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Of course.

396
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,270
What are we?

397
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,030
We're best friends, you know.

398
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,100
All right. Let's drink!

399
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,270
Mr. Jang's best friend.

400
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,740
Why didn't you reply to my text?

401
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,750
Your text?

402
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,510
What do you mean?

403
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,050
I texted you on the day we first met.

404
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,120
You didn't get it?

405
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,190
That's weird. I'm sure I sent it to you.

406
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,560
What? You sent me a text message?

407
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Why?

408
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,760
Just because.

409
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,430
I wanted to make sure you got home safely,

410
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,430
and I wanted to see you.

411
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,770
Gosh, I don't know.

412
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,370
Stop asking
because you're making me blush.

413
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,440
Anyway, darling.

414
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,470
What can I do...

415
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,980
to be your friend?

416
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,910
My friend?

417
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,750
You and Mr. Jang are best friends.

418
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,120
I want to be your friend too.

419
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,420
What can I do?

420
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,830
The thing about friends is...

421
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,330
that they need to be on similar levels.

422
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,640
Such things may not matter
when you're young,

423
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,500
but it's different at our age.

424
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,810
For example,

425
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,180
those who don't work hard...

426
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,050
will not succeed in life.

427
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,310
If you're not successful, you'll be poor.

428
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,350
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

429
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,420
- And if you're poor,
- Did you put this on my door?

430
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
you have to grovel before others.

431
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,920
- Who said you could do this?
- That's what I mean...

432
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
when I say "levels."

433
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,890
- Get out!
- Your money determines your level!

434
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,890
I'm sorry.

435
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,430
- Oh, no!
- My gosh.

436
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,690
I...

437
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,800
- never befriend people...
- Gosh, mister.

438
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,070
- who aren't on my level.
- How could you drop it here?

439
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,440
They're just never helpful in life.

440
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Please clean it up.

441
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,410
Who did this?

442
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
Oh, dear. What a waste.

443
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,820
- Goodness.
- This week's winner...

444
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,280
- will get over 30 million dollars.
- Really?

445
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,620
It's been rolled over
from the past few weeks.

446
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,890
I must win this week.

447
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,060
Oh, my.

448
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,160
(The 13th winner bought
their lottery ticket here!)

449
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,260
Oh, boy. I drank a lot today.

450
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,870
Hold on, this is... Oh, no!

451
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,040
My gosh. Are you all right, darling?

452
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,880
You seem quite drunk, darling.

453
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,520
- Brother!
- Yes?

454
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Hey, brother.

455
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,720
You brought your car, right?

456
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,060
I'll call a designated driver for you.

457
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,020
What? A designated driver?

458
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,130
Yes, there's a company I know.

459
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,660
I'll call them now.

460
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,860
No.

461
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
There's no need.

462
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,170
(Lottery Tickets Sold Here)

463
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,180
(Han Mu Chul)

464
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,690
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

465
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,590
Can you come to where I am now?

466
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm in Yongcheon-dong.

467
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,690
Yongcheon-dong?

468
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,930
Why, all of a sudden?

469
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,630
Well...

470
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,970
Just come, and you'll see.

471
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,040
Goodness. Will you come or not?

472
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,640
Well, let's talk later.

473
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,910
All right?

474
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Well, sure. I'll come.

475
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,690
Taxi!

476
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,350
Let's go somewhere else for another drink.

477
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,490
- Oh, boy.
- Let's go.

478
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,690
My gosh.

479
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,790
I'm so drunk...

480
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,700
Hey, what's up?

481
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,030
What? You're here. Oh, boy.

482
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,040
Kim Dae Sik.

483
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Hello, I'm Jang Mi.

484
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,170
This is...

485
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,140
a friend of mine.

486
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,950
Oh, I see.

487
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,810
Hello.

488
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,020
I'm Mr. Han's best friend,

489
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,420
Jang Dae Poong. Nice to meet you.

490
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,890
I see. Hello.

491
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,230
Well, this is...

492
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,670
one of the tenants in my building.

493
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,270
I see.

494
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,070
He's your tenant.

495
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I thought he was your friend.

496
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,350
Anyway, why is your tenant here?

497
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,110
Well...

498
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,920
Where do you live?

499
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,420
If it's on the way, I'll give you a ride.

500
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,720
No, don't worry about it.
Just get going, brother.

501
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,390
What are you talking about?

502
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,720
We're friends.

503
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm not such a disloyal friend.

504
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,900
You, Kim Dae Sik.

505
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,730
I'm pretty drunk.

506
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,540
Drive my car for me, will you?

507
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,910
What?

508
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,250
You want me to drive your car?

509
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,580
First, take me home.

510
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,550
We'll talk at home.

511
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,450
Come on.

512
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Why?

513
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,890
Don't you want to?

514
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,260
You know,

515
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,870
I don't know how lucky I am
to have met someone like you.

516
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,610
You know what people say.

517
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,310
If you have one true friend,

518
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,080
your life is a success.

519
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,210
Hey, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

520
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,290
I'm the one who's lucky to have met...

521
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,890
a true friend like you in my old age.

522
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,590
Then, how about...

523
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,160
we become sworn brothers?

524
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,430
What?

525
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Sworn brothers?

526
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,030
- Yes.
- Okay! Sounds good!

527
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,030
Yes, nice!

528
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,910
I'm so happy.

529
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,340
Hey, how about another drink
at a tent bar somewhere?

530
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,630
<i>Stay for a single drink</i>

531
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,400
<i>That's my last wish</i>

532
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,570
Right. Good night.

533
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,470
Hey, Han Mu Chul.

534
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,110
What?

535
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
I thought you had something to say.

536
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,540
Didn't you want to talk
somewhere near home?

537
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,750
Oh, that?

538
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,450
Let's talk tomorrow.

539
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,550
Did you perhaps...

540
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,390
call me to drive your car for you?

541
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,520
Punk. Come on.

542
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,160
Goodness, fine.

543
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,900
What is this? Oh, well...

544
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
No.

545
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,950
(Lottery Ticket)

546
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,450
Here. Take it.

547
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,390
What is this?

548
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,790
What does it look like?

549
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,190
It's a thank-you gift.

550
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,360
Oh, right.

551
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Or is it just a ride fare?

552
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,000
What? A ride fare?

553
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,870
You know, that thing...

554
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,270
isn't just an ordinary lottery ticket.

555
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,710
Those numbers are...

556
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,010
the date when the construction
of Daewoon Building was completed.

557
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,280
Daewoon Building!

558
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,290
It was the first building...

559
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,720
that I had built in my whole life.

560
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,520
They are lucky numbers...

561
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,530
that will one day win the jackpot.

562
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,460
So,

563
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,700
if this is actually a winning ticket,

564
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,940
you have to split it evenly with me.

565
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,100
All right?

566
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,380
Stop right there.

567
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,980
What?

568
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,850
You jerk.

569
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,550
- Come here, punk!
- What's wrong, man?

570
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,860
You mean jerk.

571
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,830
You knew very well
I was waiting for you to call.

572
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,160
And yet, you called me to drive you home?

573
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,930
I'm a fool for considering
a scumbag like you my friend...

574
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,430
and trusting you until the end.

575
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,500
Die!

576
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,540
Die!

577
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,440
Just die, you jerk!

578
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,080
- Die!
- I'm sorry, Dae Sik.

579
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,440
Forgive me.

580
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,850
What? Forgive you?

581
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,750
Our 40-year friendship is a joke to you,

582
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,950
but I guess my fist is pretty frightening.

583
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,890
Shut your mouth!

584
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,490
We're a trio.

585
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,490
The Cheonha High Trio.

586
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,030
Have you forgotten?

587
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,530
Hey, man.

588
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,500
Have mercy, Dae Sik.

589
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,940
I was wrong.

590
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,510
Just this once.

591
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,880
Just forgive me this once.
I'm begging you.

592
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,150
Please, Dae Sik.

593
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,910
Dae Sik.

594
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,450
Dae Sik.

595
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
Please.

596
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,190
(Good Luck!)

597
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,390
Gosh, I'd have nothing more to wish for...

598
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,290
if I didn't have to worry
about money for once.

599
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,730
I'll make sure to provide for you.

600
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,060
Don't you worry.

601
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,570
Why are you looking
at someone else's bankbook?

602
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,840
Being alone with you...

603
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,300
makes me feel all weird inside.

604
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,340
Right?

605
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,470
I'm going to close up my restaurant.

606
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,440
Should I try talking to Mu Chul?

607
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,150
What? Close up the restaurant?

608
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,580
