00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,110
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,480
(Episode 66)

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,780
Until you can look me
in the eye with warmth,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,850
and...

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,350
until you can love me again.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,160
Happy birthday, Mi Ja. And...

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,560
I love you.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,570
Mom.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,570
Mom, what's wrong?

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,940
Are you crying, Mom?

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,280
Seo Woo, do you know
where your dad's new place is?

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,180
No, Tae Ha does. Why?

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,560
- No...
- Mom!

14
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,640
Mu Chul.

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Mu Chul!

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,480
Mu Chul!

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,010
Mu Chul...

18
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,650
Gosh, Mu Chul...

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,530
I'm home.

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,430
- Hey.
- Hey, you're home.

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,070
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes, I ate.

22
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,100
Dad.

23
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,640
I want to talk to you.

24
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,210
Mi Jin.

25
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,280
Dad wants you to come out.

26
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,930
Well...

27
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,230
About the 4.5 million dollars Mom gave me.

28
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,960
I'll pay it back by the end of the month.

29
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,770
So soon?

30
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,170
But how?

31
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,240
Well, I managed to get the money somehow.

32
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,280
You don't have to pay us back so soon.
You can take your time.

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,310
No, I'll feel better this way.

34
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,120
Seok Jin says
he'll pay off the 4.5 million this month.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,250
Mi Jin, what's your thought on this?

36
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,420
He may be able to pay it back...

37
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,660
because he's received
a lot of support from you,

38
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,860
but that's not the case for me.

39
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,460
He's received the most privileges
out of the three of us.

40
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,400
Do you really have to compare me to him?

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,030
Privileges? What do you mean?

42
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,500
He's living a great life
and doing whatever he wants.

43
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,170
You two always gave him your full support
in everything he wanted to do.

44
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,840
You admit that much, right?

45
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,540
Not just Mom and Dad.

46
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,840
I've done the same for you.

47
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,450
Even when I couldn't afford
nice food or clothes for myself,

48
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,280
I still gave you everything you needed.

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm sure I've done a lot more for you
than our parents have.

50
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,120
I've never asked you
to do anything for me.

51
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,350
What?

52
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,850
You did that because you wanted to.

53
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,160
So why are you acting like this now?

54
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,760
Is that all you have to say?

55
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,190
Fine. I studied abroad
and started a business...

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,330
when you guys couldn't.
You may think that's a privilege.

57
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,600
But do you think
I had everything I wanted in life?

58
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,770
I may have rented a room for myself
with the money you sent me,

59
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,340
but I could barely afford my meals
as I studied abroad.

60
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,180
I would work 2 or 3 part-time jobs...

61
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,080
to pay my rent and tuition.

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,750
I lived desperately too.

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,250
I tried my hardest
and barely managed to get here.

64
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,320
Why should I have to hear that from you?

65
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,590
Don't talk to me like that
when you don't know anything about me.

66
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,890
Hey! Get back here!

67
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,260
What did you just say? Hey, Kim Seok Jin!

68
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,300
Seok Jin.

69
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,900
That's enough!

70
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,350
Are you...

71
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,920
happy now?

72
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,660
Are you happy that the kids' wounds...

73
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,930
have been ripped open again?

74
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,000
I didn't know.

75
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,730
I knew that Seok Jin had it hard
as he was studying abroad,

76
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,800
but I didn't know it was that bad.

77
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,840
I assumed it wouldn't be
anywhere near enough...

78
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,910
even if we gave him all the money we made,

79
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,520
but I really never knew
he struggled that much.

80
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,390
I didn't even know that,

81
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,860
and I went around
bragging to my friends...

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,460
that my son went to a good college
in the US and was starting a business.

83
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,530
Honey.

84
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,770
Let's give all of that money...

85
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,040
to the kids.

86
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,440
Let's give out all of our winnings
to the kids.

87
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,080
I just can't handle
seeing my poor kids suffer.

88
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,550
It's the same with Mi Jin...

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,820
and with Seok Jin too.

90
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,650
We should let the kids...

91
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,530
have some peace of mind now.

92
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,060
Honey.

93
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,310
I bought these peaches
as they looked good.

94
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,240
I don't think I can come here for a while.

95
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,850
I'm sorry. And...

96
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,450
thanks for everything.

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,570
Han Mu Chul!

98
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,220
You said you'd wait for me.

99
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,220
You said you'd wait
even if it took a lifetime.

100
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,530
Don't go.

101
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,870
I said, don't go.

102
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,140
I only found out today...

103
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,170
that you...

104
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,380
hadn't cheated on me with someone else.

105
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,510
Really?

106
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
Did I really...

107
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,250
not cheat on you?

108
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,260
Then, will you...

109
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,930
take me back now?

110
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,250
Kids.

111
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,390
- Dad?
- Dad!

112
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,320
Wait, how come
you're coming home together?

113
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,990
From now on, your dad...

114
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,200
will live here.

115
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,500
With all of us.

116
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,940
For real? Dad, are you really
living with us from now on?

117
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,510
You've gone through a lot
because of me, haven't you?

118
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,940
That won't happen anymore.

119
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,750
Let's...

120
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,420
all live together here.

121
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,730
I can't believe I'm here again.

122
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,640
I'm so happy.

123
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,340
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,240
I had misjudged you...

125
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,280
all this time.

126
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,950
You were...

127
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,350
so lonely by yourself, weren't you?

128
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
No.

129
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,690
It must've been harder for you.

130
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,960
Your husband suddenly died,

131
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,990
and he came back with no memory.

132
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,060
I can't even imagine
how hard it must've been for you...

133
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,740
all on your own.

134
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Oh, right.

135
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,320
Do you...

136
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,250
remember this?

137
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,920
It's the ring...

138
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,090
that you put on my finger
when you proposed.

139
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,460
Do you know what you said...

140
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,000
as you put this on for me?

141
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,440
That you'd protect me for life.

142
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,610
That you'd always be by my side.

143
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,250
But after you left like that,

144
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,180
I really...

145
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,750
resented you. On top of that,

146
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,120
I even thought you had cheated on me
with another woman.

147
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,090
I hated you so much...

148
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,510
I will...

149
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,950
put this on your finger again.

150
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,230
Now,

151
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,900
no matter what happens,

152
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,770
I will always be by your side.

153
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,510
And until the day I die,

154
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,220
I will protect you.

155
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,990
I promise.

156
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,160
Honey.

157
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Stay like this a little longer,

158
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,740
with me.

159
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,010
I have to prepare breakfast.

160
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,480
Sleep some more. I'll wake you up.

161
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,580
No.

162
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,580
We'll stay like this.

163
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
This is so nice.

164
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,090
Then just 30 more minutes.

165
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Let's snuggle under the blanket.

166
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,140
Come on, guys. Let's eat.

167
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,980
- Gosh, did you make all this food, Dad?
- What?

168
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,450
There you are. Sit. Let's eat.

169
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,450
Okay.

170
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,420
Honey, I made radish soup, your favorite.

171
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,020
But I'm not sure
if I seasoned it properly.

172
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,690
Let's see.

173
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,660
Oh, my.

174
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,760
My darling,
you're such an incredible cook.

175
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,930
It's so good.

176
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,040
I haven't made it in so long.

177
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,900
Thank you for enjoying it,
my honey darling.

178
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,970
Sure thing.

179
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,970
All right.

180
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,380
Guys, what are you doing?
Hurry up and eat.

181
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,980
- Right.
- Well...

182
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,650
Okay.

183
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,710
Oh, right.

184
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,320
I have something to tell you guys.

185
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,720
As you know, I lost my memory
due to that unfortunate accident,

186
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,160
so I hardly have any shared memories
with you guys.

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,730
I want to be really good to you kids
from now on,

188
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,470
but honestly, I don't know what to do.

189
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,510
I lost my parents when I was seven,

190
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,440
so I never had parents around
to learn from.

191
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,820
So, can you help me
get to know you better?

192
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,120
What? How?

193
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,160
We'll do our best to eat together
as often as possible.

194
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,430
We'll go on a trip once a month.

195
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,230
And if there's anything
you want to do with me,

196
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,230
we'll try to do it together...

197
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
as a family.

198
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,910
Hurry up and answer. You heard your dad.

199
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,580
Oh, okay.

200
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,140
Yes, we'll do that.

201
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,720
Thanks, guys. Dig in.

202
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,950
Okay.

203
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,890
All right, let's eat
this delicious breakfast too.

204
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,090
Let me debone the fish for you.
Just a moment.

205
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Here.

206
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,100
- It's good.
- You're eating so well, my darling.

207
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,630
Here, have some rice too.

208
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,030
Your late grandfather used to say this.

209
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,370
"You lose the person you give money to."

210
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,640
"Never give money to those close to you."

211
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,640
I know that money can be a scary thing,

212
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,640
and that's why...

213
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,250
I never wanted to give you money.

214
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,150
But I changed my mind and decided
to give each of you 500,000 dollars...

215
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,060
because I want to help you
find your own footing.

216
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,290
Let me say this again.

217
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,190
I am offering you 500,000 each,

218
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,330
and this will be the last time
I help you financially.

219
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,360
If you want the money, take it.

220
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,370
If you don't, leave it.

221
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,140
Anyone who complains
or makes a fuss about this again...

222
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,810
will have to leave this house.

223
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,680
Mark my words.

224
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,240
What are you doing, honey?
If you leave like this,

225
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,070
where are you going to sleep?

226
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,910
And what about Ji Woo?
Sit. Let's sit down and talk, okay?

227
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,550
What do you want me to do?

228
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,420
Didn't you hear what my dad said?

229
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,750
He said anyone
who didn't agree with him should leave.

230
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,660
Right now, I'm the only odd one out.

231
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,320
So, how can I stay here?

232
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,860
Mom.

233
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,960
Mom, don't cry.

234
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,670
Mom, please don't cry.

235
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
What?

236
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,380
Why did you buy so many things?
You can't even carry them on your own.

237
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,890
I didn't think you'd come,
but you're here.

238
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,050
My boss called me here.
Like I have any power.

239
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,290
So? Are you in a better mood today?

240
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,030
- What?
- You looked so upset all day yesterday.

241
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,430
What's going on? Did something happen?

242
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,000
No.

243
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,770
Let's go and get some meat.

244
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Goodness.

245
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,910
Seriously, she's always so quick.

246
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,440
Yes, I'm on my way now.

247
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,250
Why is he here?

248
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,010
Where are you, cutie?

249
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,720
"Cutie?"

250
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,150
Okay, I'll be there shortly. All right.

251
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Have a good day!

252
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,190
- You got everything, right?
- Yes.

253
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,760
- Good. Come here.
- Why? What is it?

254
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,530
Seriously, where are we going?

255
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,960
Come on. It won't take long.

256
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,530
Gosh, let go...

257
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
What?

258
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,470
Is that Dong Min?

259
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,570
What's he doing here?

260
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,380
Hey, cutie!

261
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,380
"Cutie?"

262
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,280
He must be meeting his girlfriend.
"Cutie."

263
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,580
Didn't I tell you?

264
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
Let's just go.

265
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,620
Hey, let's see her face.

266
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,520
Let's see
how cute his girlfriend really is.

267
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,590
Why do we need to see her face?
Let's just go.

268
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,000
Come on. Let's see her quickly.

269
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,530
Let's go.

270
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,770
How have you been, my cutie?

271
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,370
"Cutie?"

272
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,600
She kept saying she missed her grandson,

273
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,070
so I brought her outside.

274
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,070
She's been saying it nonstop
since yesterday.

275
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,110
My gosh, thank you.

276
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,680
My cutie-pie, I guess you missed me a lot.

277
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,580
Yes. I'm wearing lipstick.

278
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,880
- Do I look pretty?
- Of course, you do.

279
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,290
Why do you think I call you "Cutie?"

280
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,490
You're the cutest
and most beautiful woman in the world.

281
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,690
- So, I guess "Cutie" was...
- Is there anything you want to eat?

282
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,960
Dong Min's grandmother.

283
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,500
Well, I guess.

284
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,800
He's so sweet.

285
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Goodness.

286
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,370
So, are you saying
your family is arguing over money?

287
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,510
Oh, boy. So, this is happening to you too.

288
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,510
I thought
your family would be an exception.

289
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,520
Things have gotten worse
since I told them...

290
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,090
I'd give each of them 500,000...

291
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,450
than when I said
I'd never give them any money.

292
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,360
I should've just said I'd never give them
a single penny and stuck to it.

293
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
That's just human nature.

294
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,730
The more you have, the more you want.

295
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,330
Right, what about the restaurant?
Is Mu Chul holding down the fort?

296
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,470
Mu Chul is taking some time off.

297
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,970
He said he wanted to clear his mind,
so I told him to go ahead.

298
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,010
What? Why, all of a sudden?

299
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,340
He seemed to have a lot on his mind.

300
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,380
While trying to retrace his steps
to recover his memory,

301
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,720
he ran into some creditors,

302
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,850
and they recognized him.
I think it shocked him.

303
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,360
Gyu Tae.

304
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,990
That being said,

305
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,760
Mu Chul still owes three million dollars,
you know.

306
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,830
Should we just go ahead
and pay it all off?

307
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,700
- Three million?
- You told me a while back...

308
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,300
that he was still
three million dollars in debt.

309
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,910
Looking back, I realized...

310
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,640
he helped me out a lot in the past,

311
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,410
even though I used to think
he was always walking all over me.

312
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,780
- He helped you out?
- When I was getting my matrimonial home,

313
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,980
he dipped into his savings
to lend me money.

314
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,020
But there was more.

315
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,360
Mu Chul, hey...

316
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,760
What? Why is his stuff all packed up?

317
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, hey. You're here.

318
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Hey, Mu Chul.

319
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,540
Why is your stuff all packed up?

320
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,110
Are you going somewhere?

321
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,640
Well, I'm moving.

322
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,640
I'm going to stay
at the construction site residence.

323
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,710
"Construction site?"

324
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,010
Why would you suddenly move there?

325
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,820
Are you all packed up?

326
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,780
- Hello.
- He must be that friend of yours.

327
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,390
The one who's getting married.

328
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,660
So, have you found a nice home?

329
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Ma'am, please...

330
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,460
- Pardon me?
- Mu Chul said...

331
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,730
he had to move to help his friend...

332
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,830
get a matrimonial home.

333
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,330
He said he wouldn't have enough money
even if he dipped into his savings.

334
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,800
So, I told him he could move out,
even though I don't want him to leave.

335
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,800
Let me know when you're done.

336
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,010
- Will do.
- All right.

337
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,180
Hey, you...

338
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,380
Gosh, I was going to tell you later,

339
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,880
but you already found out.

340
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,550
Hey, my wedding's no big deal.
You don't have to do this to help me out.

341
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,560
I won't let you go through
any hardships by yourself!

342
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,920
Did you forget our promise?

343
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,100
I can do even bigger things for you,

344
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,730
so don't worry about it.

345
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,240
You punk. Whatever, man.

346
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,810
So, are you saying
you will give Mu Chul...

347
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,950
that money?

348
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,950
I'm thinking about it.

349
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,620
Hey.

350
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,730
This isn't 300 dollars.
This is 3 million dollars.

351
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,660
Even if you won the lottery,
isn't that way too much?

352
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,600
That's what I'm worried about too.

353
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,770
I'm wondering
how I should give him that money...

354
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,870
since it's such a large amount.

355
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,810
Gosh, this means I will have to give up
some money too.

356
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,640
I don't have a lot of money
after making investments.

357
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,650
Why did he suddenly have to
bring up the three million dollars?

358
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,250
Honey.

359
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,250
Yes?

360
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,690
Honey, what is this?

361
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,390
A lottery ticket.

362
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,260
Well, I know that too.
I mean these numbers.

363
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,360
Did you buy this ticket yourself?

364
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,630
Yes, I did. Why?

365
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,440
Honey, did you remember something?

366
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,440
This.

367
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,710
It's the construction completion date
of the Daewoon Building.

368
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
What?

369
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,050
I just bought a ticket since these numbers
kept popping up in my mind.

370
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,480
You remembered these numbers?

371
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,850
Honey, you know what?

372
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,460
You bought a lottery ticket each week
with these numbers.

373
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,330
You said they would be
the winning numbers one day.

374
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
This is...

375
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,030
the construction completion date
of the Daewoon Building.

376
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,570
What?

377
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,440
Seeing how you keep remembering things,

378
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,940
your memory must be coming back soon.
I see a ray of hope.

379
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,640
Mi Ja feels great today.

380
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,350
Goodness, I'm off to do the laundry.

381
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,550
And then, I should go grocery shopping.

382
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,420
This is...

383
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,830
the construction completion date
of the Daewoon Building?

384
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,030
Two, three, eleven, sixteen...

385
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,570
How did he remember that?

386
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,300
Gosh, I'm so proud of him.

387
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,070
Oh, hello.

388
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,410
Hi.

389
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,180
You must be working hard
on your own without Mu Chul.

390
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,210
You must've heard from Tae Ha.

391
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Mu Chul said he wanted to go on a trip.

392
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,820
No, Mu Chul is at home right now.

393
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,490
Pardon? What do you mean?

394
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,120
Well, something happened.

395
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,160
Anyway, since he has taken some time off,

396
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,060
I'll have him rest for a few more days
before returning to work.

397
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Bye, then.

398
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,530
Wait.

399
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,100
Could we talk for a minute?

400
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,380
(Jackpot Chicken)

401
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,380
What?

402
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,120
Mu Chul's remaining debt is...

403
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,390
still three million dollars?

404
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,160
- Yes.
- No way.

405
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,060
I thought there might be some debt left,

406
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,300
but I didn't think it would be that much.

407
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,870
(Number One Real Estate, Jackpot Chicken)

408
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,640
What will I do?

409
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,370
Well, that's why I bring this up.

410
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,710
The three million dollars...

411
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,720
What if I took care of that for you?

412
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,520
You'd pay three million dollars?

413
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,350
What? Three million dollars?

414
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Yes.

415
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,530
So, I always bought lottery tickets
with these numbers.

416
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Two, three,

417
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,040
eleven, sixteen,

418
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,240
nineteen, twenty.

419
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,310
(The 1157th Lottery, 1st Place,
The 1117th Lottery, 2nd Place)

420
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,950
- Hello. I'll pay for this.
- Hi.

421
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Sure.

422
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,790
(The winning numbers of 35.7 million
for the 1177th Lottery)

423
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,130
Oh, these numbers.

424
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Why?

425
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,960
Two, three, eleven, sixteen...

426
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,870
It is the same.

427
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,730
Someone won the largest amount ever
with these numbers.

428
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What did you say?

429
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,640
Two, three, eleven...

430
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
(The Best Fried Chicken)

431
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,380
(The winning numbers of 35.7 million
for the 1177th Lottery)

432
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,560
(Good Luck!)

433
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,060
My company is having
a new product launch event.

434
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,900
I thought it might be fun to go together.
Do you want to come?

435
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,570
Did that woman perhaps...

436
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,570
approach you for your money?

437
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,240
You make a lot of money these days.

438
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,810
You drive a nice car too.

439
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,980
Why do you think
Mr. Kim is suddenly doing that?

440
