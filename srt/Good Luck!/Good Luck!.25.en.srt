1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,240
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,590
(Episode 25)

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,170
(Loan payment: 191,000 dollars,
Remaining balance: 23,728,000 dollars)

4
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,570
Right, Mu Chul is dead and gone now.

5
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,410
So, let's stop being so anxious.

6
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,680
Let's put this
in the bank's safe deposit box...

7
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,350
and forget about it now.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Right.

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,400
Since things have come this far,
I have no other choice.

10
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,970
It's not like
Mu Chul is going to come back to life.

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,540
I just have to keep my mouth shut.

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,300
Then, it's over.

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,540
This looks so good.

14
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,570
Eat up, Gwang Sik.

15
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,110
Why are you making me eat crab
at every meal?

16
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,280
No, I don't want it.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,480
Why don't you want it?

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,520
Mother worked very hard to make it.

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,450
You should eat it. Eat!

20
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,750
No, you can have it.

21
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,520
Why won't you eat it?

22
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,960
You like crab.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,290
Me? No, I do not.

24
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,130
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,160
Crab soup, steamed crab, crab salad.
You name it.

26
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,930
You like everything with crab.

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,330
It's not like I don't know you.

28
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,540
You do not know me.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,510
Anyway, I don't like crab anymore,
so just know that.

30
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,140
Ji Woo, is there anything
you want to eat today?

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
Well, I want braised short ribs.

32
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,550
Braised short ribs? That sounds delicious.

33
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,050
But short ribs are very expensive
these days, Ji Woo.

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,020
All right.
I'll sell my underwear if I must...

35
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,830
to buy some short ribs
and cook them nicely.

36
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,860
I won't let you down, okay?

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,600
Okay, Mom.

38
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,260
Let me know when you're making it.

39
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,670
I'll have the pressure cooker ready.

40
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,030
No, Mother. Don't bother.

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,700
I'll only make enough for Ji Woo.

42
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,210
What? You'll only make enough for Ji Woo?

43
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,240
Come on, honey.

44
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,510
I get that beef short ribs are expensive,

45
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,710
but we're your family too.

46
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,480
You can't just make it for Ji Woo.

47
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,980
- Just don't make it, then.
- Right?

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,720
There are four of us in our family.

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,520
It's not nice to cook something
only for my child, right?

50
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,790
I think so too,

51
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,130
but we're broke, and Ji Woo says
she wants braised short ribs.

52
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,360
So, what can I do?

53
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,560
I'm sorry. Please understand, honey.

54
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
You too, Mother.

55
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,870
Mi Jin.

56
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,230
Are you doing this
because I said I made the spicy crab...

57
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,500
only for Gwang Sik?

58
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,070
What? What do you mean?

59
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,910
You said it was only for me?

60
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,380
Honey, were you not eating any
because of what Mom said?

61
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,550
Well, not really.

62
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,990
No, Mother. I understand
where you were coming from.

63
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm raising a child too.

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,490
Wanting to feed your child well
when you're struggling financially.

65
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,930
Of course, I understand.

66
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,490
So, don't get the wrong idea.

67
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,700
I'll just use a small pot to make it.
Please understand.

68
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,070
Are you really going to do this?

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,740
Ji Woo, don't eat too much at lunch today.

70
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,100
So you can have
braised short ribs later. Okay?

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,540
- Okay.
- All right, then.

72
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,940
Please excuse me. I'm full.

73
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,080
Mom, it's your fault.

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,650
Shut it, you punk!

75
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,660
Shoot. No, don't do that. Hey, over here!

76
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,760
Hey. Darn it!

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,930
Oh, you're home, Gyu Tae.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,100
Hey, Min Yong. Your dad is home.
Won't you say hello?

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,630
- Hey.
- Hi, Dad.

80
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,370
You know you're going
to the hospital tomorrow, right?

81
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,440
It's your first treatment session,

82
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,140
so don't forget. Get ready, okay?

83
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,970
Can't I just go back to school
starting tomorrow?

84
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,440
No, you can't.

85
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,540
Rest more at home.

86
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,950
But home is so boring.

87
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,620
Hey, do you think
you're staying at home to have fun?

88
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,750
You need to rest to fully recover!

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,520
Yes, your dad is right.

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,090
What if you go back to school now
and collapse again?

91
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,060
Why would I collapse?

92
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,800
It's my life,
but I can't even do what I want.

93
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,530
It's so annoying.

94
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,670
- That little...
- Hey, Gyu Tae.

95
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,040
Goodness.

96
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,900
Honey.

97
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,500
You heard
what that brat said to me, right?

98
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,240
So,

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,740
when we meet again,

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,980
don't nag or blame me...

101
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,710
for teaching him wrong.

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480
I really did my best.

103
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
Honey.

104
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,670
I'm doing the right thing, aren't I?

105
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I wish...

106
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,510
you were here to tell me so...

107
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,950
like you used to.

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,850
"You're doing the right thing."

109
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,060
"Don't worry."

110
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,990
"I..."

111
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,060
"believe in you."

112
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,370
I miss you.

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,260
Gosh, what is this?
Why isn't it working?

114
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
What's wrong?

115
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,970
The stove won't work.
I tried several times.

116
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,710
It seems like the gas isn't flowing.

117
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,880
Did they cut off the gas to our house?

118
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,750
I'm sure
it's just the stove that's broken.

119
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,510
Why would they cut off the gas?

120
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,190
(Notice of Auction)

121
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,660
Mom, the stove isn't working.

122
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,000
Did our gas get cut off, perhaps?

123
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Well...

124
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,440
But why...

125
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,110
Do we not have any money
to pay for the gas bill?

126
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,440
They sent us a reminder
while we were holding your dad's funeral,

127
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,610
but I didn't know about it,
so it got cut off.

128
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,550
It'll get fixed soon, so don't worry.

129
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,580
Okay.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,320
You look great.

131
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,290
Goodness, you look nice, son.

132
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,800
Today is your friend
Tae Hyung's wedding, right?

133
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,370
Yes, I'm going to be the MC
for the ceremony.

134
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm kind of nervous.

135
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,640
Why should you feel nervous?

136
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,800
Do a good job.

137
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,070
I will.

138
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,170
You look awesome, Seok Jin.

139
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,640
That suit is totally spiffy.

140
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,850
Go and find a pretty girl
to bring home too, okay?

141
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,450
Gosh, Mom. I'll see you later.

142
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,180
Okay, have a good time.

143
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,550
- See you later.
- Good luck.

144
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,550
Bye.

145
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,060
Oh, you must be going somewhere.

146
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
What?

147
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,190
Well, yes.

148
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,060
You look good in a suit.

149
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Thank you.

150
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,830
Oh, right. You said you had a meeting
with a client, didn't you?

151
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,070
It must be a really important meeting,

152
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,210
seeing how dressed up you are.

153
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,410
Yes, well...

154
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,180
You must be going somewhere too, Seo Woo.

155
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,750
Oh, yes. I have plans.

156
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,750
No way. He's not pulling a trick on me
to try to take it back, is he?

157
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,490
Well, I said I'd come along,
so it should be fine.

158
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,030
Ah Jin.

159
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,300
Where did she go?

160
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,770
Did she go to wash up?

161
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Oh, dear.

162
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,360
Here it is. From now on,
you may use this safe deposit box, sir.

163
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,760
Okay, thank you.

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,850
Seven, one, eight, seven.

165
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,690
(Nara Bank)

166
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,390
All right.

167
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,030
I think it would be best...

168
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,430
to keep the 2.6 million
and 1 million separately.

169
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,640
In case any problems come up later,

170
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,570
I should give myself a way out.

171
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,110
Oh, hi.

172
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,180
Yes, thank you.

173
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,220
- Hey, excuse me.
- Yes?

174
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,980
Could I ask you something?

175
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,990
Go ahead.

176
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,790
How much does one need to have...

177
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,820
in one's bank account to become
a VIP customer at this bank?

178
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,090
At our bank, if you have
over 200,000 dollars in your account,

179
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,060
you may become a VIP customer.

180
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Did you say 200,000?

181
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
Only 200,000?

182
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,000
I mean, do you mean I can become
a VIP customer with just 200,000 dollars?

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,970
Yes, sir. But why do you ask?

184
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,010
Gosh, it was no big deal.

185
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,840
It's nothing special.

186
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,050
- Pardon?
- I mean... One moment.

187
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,250
(Nara Bank,
Remaining balance: 3,540,340 dollars)

188
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,090
Oh, please come this way, sir.

189
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,060
This way.

190
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,030
(Jackpot Chicken)

191
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Hey, Gyu Tae.

192
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Hey.

193
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,030
About my house.

194
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,440
I heard they sent a notice
that it was being put up for auction.

195
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,070
Yes, you're right.

196
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,740
You're a tenant,
so you would've gotten the notice too.

197
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,210
Did you know about it?

198
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,010
Yes, I heard from Mu Chul's wife.

199
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,110
I thought he had transferred...

200
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,880
the ownership of the house
under his wife's name after the divorce,

201
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,020
but I guess he didn't get around to it.

202
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
Hey.

203
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,560
So, are you saying...

204
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,100
Mi Ja's house will go over
to the creditors?

205
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,370
Gosh, what will she do, then?

206
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,200
They lost the buildings and their house.

207
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,370
What if Mi Ja ends up on the streets?

208
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,340
Oh, welcome.

209
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,320
What should I do?

210
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,720
Their bank accounts have been seized,

211
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,120
but they're about to lose their house too.

212
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,160
Then, what will their family live off of?

213
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,190
Should I split the lottery winnings now...

214
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,230
before it's too late?

215
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,730
Should I give them
part of the 2.6 million dollars?

216
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,670
Gosh, if not,

217
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,910
they actually might end up on the streets.

218
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,710
Goodness, what should I do?

219
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,710
- Gyu Tae.
- Dae Sik.

220
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,180
You go first.

221
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
Dae Sik.

222
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,590
So, about Mu Chul's wife...

223
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,650
Wouldn't it be better...

224
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,790
for us to help her out, at least a little?

225
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,130
Yes, I was thinking the same thing.

226
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,360
A friend's family is struggling so much.

227
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,100
It wouldn't be right for us
to ignore them.

228
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,200
Let's help them out.

229
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,270
All right. Let's do that.
Then, I'll give them some money...

230
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,440
and say that it's from both of us.

231
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,940
You don't have to do anything.

232
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,270
What?

233
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,180
But why? I should help out too.

234
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,780
Hey, I know you don't have
that kind of money.

235
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,810
I'll just deal with it on my own.

236
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,520
I've been selling
some more fried chicken lately.

237
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,150
How much will you give them?

238
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,450
Gosh, I'm telling you, it's fine.

239
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,260
You can't make all that much
from selling chicken.

240
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,960
Then, what about you?

241
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,570
I guess the real estate agency
is doing well lately,

242
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,430
seeing how you're boasting about
having money.

243
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,570
How much do you make
from showing people houses?

244
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,910
Don't you worry. I make more than you.

245
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,840
So, how much do you actually make?

246
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,450
What? Do you make a few million dollars?

247
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,820
What? A few million?

248
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,520
Are you kidding me?

249
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,120
Kidding, my foot.

250
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,990
You don't have
two pennies to rub together.

251
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,190
What? "Two pennies to rub together?"

252
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,400
And do you even have 100,000 dollars
in your bank account to say that to me?

253
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,330
You're closing down your restaurant
because you don't even have 100,000.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What?

255
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,940
Why, you punk.

256
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,810
You were whining about not having money
for your son's surgery.

257
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,470
How dare you say that to me?

258
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,570
What, whining?

259
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,440
Is that all you have to say?

260
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,310
No, that's not all I have to say. So what?

261
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,820
- My gosh.
- What?

262
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,450
Oh, my. Guys.

263
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,250
What are you doing in someone else's cafe?

264
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,020
Hey, do you think you can just say
whatever you want?

265
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,330
And what about you?
How much do I make from selling chicken?

266
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,000
Hey, punk. What you just said.

267
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,270
If the 42,000 chicken restaurant owners
in Korea heard you say that,

268
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,400
you wouldn't have a single unbroken bone
left in your body.

269
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,740
What? A measly 42,000? Hey!

270
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,370
There are more than 110,000 realtors
in the whole country, punk!

271
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,540
Do you really want to have a go?

272
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,050
Fine. Let's go, man. Bring it on!

273
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,480
- Oh, my. Guys!
- Bring it on!

274
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,480
- My goodness. Please don't...
- Gosh, you and that fat belly.

275
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,390
I told you to stop!

276
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,690
You. Just wait and see.

277
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,960
From now on, you...

278
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,530
What about me?

279
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,730
My goodness. Stop this, okay?

280
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,900
You shouldn't say that you will stop
seeing each other over something so petty.

281
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,330
You!

282
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,040
I won't help you find a new house!

283
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,940
Hey, do you think I'll be sad over that?

284
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,610
From now on, you!

285
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,740
What about me?

286
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,980
I won't give you
a discount on fried chicken.

287
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
What? You won't give me a discount?

288
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,950
Gosh, you dirty punk.

289
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,880
How dare you come at me
with a mere 42,000?

290
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,650
You'd need to fill a baseball stadium
four times over...

291
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,920
to have all the realtors...

292
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,460
When we buy a house,
we'll have to move right away.

293
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,090
I should shop for furniture first.

294
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,030
I always regret it
if I buy things in a rush.

295
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,260
Let's see. What would be nice?

296
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,930
Oh, my.

297
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,770
Are you looking
for anything in particular?

298
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,940
Oh, I'm just shopping for furniture.

299
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,370
You know about apartments, don't you?

300
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,540
We're moving into an apartment, you see.

301
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,180
Oh, an apartment?

302
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,910
How big is the unit?

303
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,250
Well, about 99m²?

304
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,150
It's not an older apartment.

305
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,620
It's a brand new one.

306
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,720
I want something
that would suit the place.

307
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,560
Something elegant and... Well...

308
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,490
Anyway, please show me the nice stuff.

309
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,360
Okay, will you come this way, please?

310
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Okay.

311
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,170
Where's the bridal suite?

312
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,040
Do I look all right?

313
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,810
Yes, you look dashing.

314
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Right.

315
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,280
Seo Woo has no idea, right?
That I'm getting married today.

316
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,850
Right, she doesn't know.

317
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Hey, Tae Hyung.

318
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,230
Can we talk when you're back
from your honeymoon?

319
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Hey, man.

320
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,460
What is it that you sound so serious?

321
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
All right.

322
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,400
The groom and the MC can come with me.
This way, please.

323
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,870
Okay.

324
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,370
Let's go.

325
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,810
What? You called Seo Woo?

326
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,280
The class reunion is coming up, you know.

327
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,580
I called her about it
and ended up mentioning the wedding.

328
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,950
I just said you couldn't invite her
because of her dad's funeral,

329
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,120
but she said she'd be here.
Clearly, she's clueless.

330
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,620
My gosh. I don't want to see that girl.

331
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,690
Why? Did you two fight?

332
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,790
You don't know?

333
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,300
Her ex...

334
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,100
left her for Seo Woo.

335
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,900
My gosh. Seriously?

336
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,570
Seo Woo knows what happened in the past...

337
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,000
and still insisted on coming here?

338
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,440
She thinks she's completely innocent.

339
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,780
That girl. She must think
I don't know that she hit on him first.

340
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,240
She's ridiculous.

341
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,220
My gosh, Jung Ah! Congratulations.

342
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,450
Girl, why didn't you tell me
you were getting married?

343
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
I almost missed your wedding.

344
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,960
Hey, girls. It's been a while.

345
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,530
Have you been keeping well?

346
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,800
Anyway, you've gotten so pretty.

347
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,610
I know you're the bride,
but your face is literally glowing.

348
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,140
So, who's the groom?

349
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,710
Hye Mi told me...

350
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,210
that he was good-looking.

351
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,480
My gosh. Are you going to
steal my groom from me too?

352
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,190
What?

353
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,350
Hey, I was just kidding.

354
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,960
You didn't need to
suddenly look so upset like that.

355
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,890
Today's my wedding day, so let's be happy.

356
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,860
Let's take some pictures.
Girls, come over here.

357
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,700
All right. One, two.

358
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,440
- Oh, my. This is great.
- I know.

359
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,780
- He's very handsome.
- That girl.

360
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,310
Is she still holding a grudge
because of that incident?

361
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,310
- Look here.
- It wasn't my fault.

362
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,580
One, two.

363
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,850
Hey, your boyfriend said
he fell in love with me at first sight.

364
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,650
- What could I do about it?
- All right. Look here.

365
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,090
- All right, one, two.
- Look at the camera.

366
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,490
I'm so annoyed.

367
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,890
- All right.
- Should I just leave?

368
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,890
Let's take one more.

369
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,160
- This won't take long.
- Okay.

370
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,430
No.

371
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,330
I should stick around
to see the face of this hotshot...

372
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,900
she's marrying.

373
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,310
We'll stick with the order, right?

374
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,180
Yes, that's right.

375
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,320
Here, if you see the order of events...

376
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,780
Oh, he said...

377
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,450
he had a meeting with a client.

378
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,560
What's he doing here?

379
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,390
Then I'll get my cue to start...

380
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,270
Tae Hyung.

381
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,110
Tae Hyung?

382
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,410
Jung Ah,
you look absolutely stunning today.

383
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,480
Tae Hyung, you're making me blush.

384
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,720
Come on.

385
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,430
Seo Woo!

386
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Are you all right?

387
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,850
You're the MC, right?

388
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,850
The ceremony will begin shortly.

389
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,920
Well, this is...

390
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,770
Let's go.

391
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,670
The watch...

392
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,710
Oh, shoot.

393
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,250
Where did it go?

394
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,290
Where is it?

395
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,670
- Come here, you little...
- Wait. Let go of me first.

396
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,770
You punk!

397
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,740
You have no intention of paying me back!

398
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,970
Please, believe me.

399
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,570
I promise I'll send you the money
by the end of the day.

400
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,810
You have until the end of the day.

401
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,570
If you're even a second late,
I will kill you!

402
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,310
Sure thing. Please trust me
and give me one last chance.

403
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,310
Darn you.

404
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,910
I'll be sure to send you the money.

405
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
Darn it.

406
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,450
Have a good day, sir!

407
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,530
Hey, you.

408
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,560
- My watch. Give me my watch.
- What?

409
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,070
Did you not hear what I said?
Give me back my watch.

410
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,440
The thing is...

411
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,200
It's gone.

412
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,510
What? What do you mean it's gone?

413
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,080
I left it on my desk
so I could take it to work today,

414
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,180
but the watch vanished into thin air.

415
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,280
What? Are you saying you lost my watch?

416
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,480
Yes.

417
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,450
You're messing with me, right?

418
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,990
I'm sorry. I have to go to work.

419
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,090
I'll take another look
when I get home from work.

420
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,760
No. Go back inside right now
and look for it again.

421
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,530
What?

422
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,960
Seriously, do you want me to die?

423
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,000
If I don't send the money by today,
I really will die.

424
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,570
They'll really kill me!

425
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,900
It's not like I don't want to find it.

426
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,210
I really can't find it right now.

427
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,510
I was looking for it until now.

428
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,340
- Whatever. We'll look for it together.
- No.

429
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,550
- We can look for it together.
- No!

430
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,780
I really have to go to work.

431
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,180
Right, so let's go inside now
and find it quickly.

432
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,750
- No, please...
- Let's find this watch.

433
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,150
- No.
- We can find it.

434
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,990
Honey, it's me.

435
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,260
(Jackpot Chicken)

436
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,790
What?

437
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,790
Why isn't he here?

438
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,130
(The Best Fried Chicken)

439
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,930
Where did you go?
You left the restaurant empty.

440
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,000
Honey, do not go
to Number One Real Estate from now on.

441
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Why?

442
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,340
Did something happen
between you and Mr. Choi?

443
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,980
I can't stand him.

444
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,210
He belittled me
for running a fried chicken joint...

445
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,210
and undermined our friendship.

446
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,610
Mr. Choi?

447
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,120
But he's not like that.

448
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,050
What do you mean he's not like that?

449
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
What's that?

450
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,220
Oh, it's nothing.

451
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,030
- I'll go home and get changed.
- Okay.

452
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,200
Oh, right. When you get home,

453
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,130
check our mail.

454
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,970
Mail?

455
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,400
The house is being put up for auction.

456
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,740
Auction?

457
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,410
I heard we got
a notice of auction earlier.

458
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,980
Go and check.

459
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,440
Okay, I'll check.

460
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,820
Gosh, seriously...

461
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,690
Hold on.

462
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,460
How much will the starting bid be
if it's up for auction?

463
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,030
It's an old house,
so it can't be that much.

464
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,460
Should I just buy the house?

465
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
What?

466
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,440
They're planning to develop
a new town in Baeheung?

467
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,970
That's right.

468
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,340
So, if you buy some land there now,

469
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,240
it'll go up a lot in value.

470
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,180
Who'd develop a new town
in the middle of nowhere?

471
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,250
Where did you hear
such a groundless rumor?

472
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,280
No, it really is happening.

473
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,120
My brother-in-law told me.

474
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,390
Does your brother-in-law work
for the City of Baeheung or something?

475
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,550
He works for the Ministry of Land.

476
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,220
He's a manager in the Real Estate
Development Strategy Division.

477
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,130
What?

478
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,630
He's the one who handles...

479
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,100
all the new town development projects
in the country.

480
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
You see, he's normally very discreet,

481
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,870
but he got drunk
on my father-in-law's birthday...

482
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,100
and let it slip out. I heard it,

483
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,770
and I am only telling you.

484
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,110
Then, when will the development begin?

485
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,250
Why? Do you want to invest in it?

486
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,950
I have no money.

487
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,420
Oh, thanks for the coffee. I have to go.

488
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,520
- Okay, see you.
- Hello? Yes, I'm coming now.

489
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,550
Yes, sure thing.

490
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,390
They're planning
to build a new town in Baeheung?

491
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,760
Well, I have money now.

492
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,900
Should I...

493
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,170
invest in it?

494
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,350
Oh, gosh.

495
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,250
Hey.

496
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,490
My goodness.

497
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
What?

498
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,190
This man... Isn't he that guy?

499
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,530
Don't you know the phrase,
"Guilty of being poor?"

500
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,000
Not having money is a crime!

501
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Hey.

502
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,170
Wake up...

503
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,010
Yes.

504
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,210
What?

505
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,140
I'm okay.

506
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,650
- I should...
- What?

507
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,050
But...

508
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,690
Hey, there.

509
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,890
Oh, no.

510
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,790
Hey, there.

511
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,600
Hey, man. Wake up!

512
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,770
Goodness.

513
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,110
Is this money yours?

514
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,760
It may have been yours until a moment ago,

515
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,260
but it's mine now.

516
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,990
You should wake up soon if it upsets you.

517
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,330
(Good Luck!)

518
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,530
- I'm angrier that you lied to me...
- Seo Woo!

519
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,960
than the fact that Tae Hyung tricked me.

520
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,970
If you don't find that watch by tomorrow,

521
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,270
- you and I are going to the police.
- What?

522
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,510
Gosh, they could wait a little.
What's all the rush?

523
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,840
It's not much,

524
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,540
but please accept it
as a token of our sincerity.

525
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,780
