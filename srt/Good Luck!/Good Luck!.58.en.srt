1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,410
(All child actors filmed safely
under the supervision of their guardians.)

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,410
(Animal scenes
were directed and filmed...)

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,410
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,240
Mi Ja!

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,720
Mi Ja!

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
What do you need?

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,390
My back!

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,490
Oh, no!

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,130
Gosh, what do I do?

10
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,130
What's wrong, Mom?

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,300
I don't know...

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,880
Seok Jin, it's me.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,090
I followed you
to the pear orchard in Naju.

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,960
I don't know where I am.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm so scared, Seok Jin.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,990
What? She's here?

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,500
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,980
Are you all right?

19
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,080
Mom's so mean.

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,080
You can barely move.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,250
She should just sleep here.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,720
This is not good.
Let me go and talk to Mom.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,960
No.

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
Just leave her be.

25
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,300
It was my idea,

26
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,260
so don't blame her.

27
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,400
Oh, boy.

28
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,980
Hey.

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,310
How's your dad?

30
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,010
Is he okay?

31
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,880
Yes, thank goodness.

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
But, Mom.

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,320
I don't think it's a good idea
to leave Dad alone there.

34
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,720
Why don't you sleep next to him
to care for him?

35
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,660
Then you can sleep next to him.

36
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,330
What?

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,400
Children should care for their parents.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,430
Must you make your old mom do it?

39
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,600
Well, I do want to care for him,

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,470
but I have to work tomorrow.

41
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,580
It's not like you have to work tonight.

42
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,410
You can sleep next to him tonight.

43
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,650
If I do that,
I won't be able to sleep too well,

44
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,620
which will affect my work. You know?

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,990
He's your husband, so you do it.

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,560
We're divorced. Did you forget?

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,860
Fine, then I'll have Seo Woo do it.

48
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,130
When will she be home?

49
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,760
No idea. She went to
her friend's father's funeral.

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,530
I kept telling her not to go there,
but she flat out ignored me.

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,070
Anyway, I'm not doing it.

52
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,140
If you want to do it, go for it.
Otherwise, forget it.

53
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,900
My gosh. What do I do now?

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,710
Why did my phone battery die?

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,150
Which way should I go?

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,490
Seo Woo!

57
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,350
Seo Woo!

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,660
Han Seo Woo!

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,300
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after...

60
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,940
Seo Woo. Han Seo Woo!

61
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,150
Mi Jin, can I really stay here?

62
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,480
Yes, of course.
Didn't you hear what my mom said?

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,780
She wants to repay you
for the kindness you showed her.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,250
Don't worry about a thing. Just rest up.

65
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,890
Honey, take good care of Mother.

66
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,790
Okay, I will.

67
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,500
It must've been a hard day for you.
I hope you get some good rest.

68
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,470
I should just die.

69
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,670
What's the use in being a burden on others
and living like this?

70
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,910
Is Ji Woo asleep?

71
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,550
Yes.

72
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,820
How is your mother-in-law?
Will she be able to sleep here?

73
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,450
What else can she do,
even if it's uncomfortable?

74
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,890
We have nowhere else to go.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,530
By the way, Mom,
I honestly didn't want to come here.

76
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,730
I wasn't okay with seeing Dad.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,300
Don't worry. I have a plan in mind.

78
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,570
A plan?

79
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,600
I think I get it.

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,110
You want Dad to see for himself...

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,110
that Mi Jin's family
has nowhere else to go, right?

82
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,380
Is that it?

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,880
If he still doesn't help you
after seeing this,

84
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,210
he has no right to call himself human.

85
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,520
I've made my final move
to see how your dad reacts.

86
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,190
By the way,

87
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,290
you must've been really shocked today.

88
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,230
Well, I'm sure Ji Woo was more shocked
than I was.

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,500
Goodness, you're right.

90
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,470
I can't even imagine...

91
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,970
how it must've felt to see those stickers
on your household items.

92
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,210
My heart was quivering just from watching.

93
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,840
You know how I raised you.

94
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,950
I may not have been able to give you
the best food or clothes,

95
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,250
but I didn't make you see
such a shocking sight, at least.

96
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,890
Mi Jin.

97
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,190
Don't worry.

98
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,730
I will help you out, no matter what.

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,330
I will make sure...

100
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,500
that you guys get back on your feet.

101
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,070
Why are you doing this?
I said I was really okay.

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,810
It's okay. Don't cry.

103
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,950
Don't cry.

104
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,030
My gosh.

105
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,170
How in the world did they end up
getting seizure stickers in their house?

106
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,570
Oh, dear.

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Mi Jin.

108
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,490
You're really upset, aren't you?

109
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,760
I know too. In life,

110
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,960
all kinds of things can happen.

111
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,670
But still, Mi Jin...

112
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,740
You don't have to help me.

113
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,340
So, you don't have to
say that stuff to me.

114
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,810
I mean, I doubt
you want to help me out anyway.

115
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,650
But still, don't treat Mom that way.

116
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,680
I'll really be upset
if you keep behaving like this.

117
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,050
When you got fired from your job
and started your own business,

118
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,160
and when we had to move to a single room
because your business went bust,

119
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,330
I know what kind of sacrifices
Mom had to make for us...

120
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,960
for every hardship we faced.

121
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,330
I know that better than anyone.

122
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,300
How could you treat Mom that way
after everything she's done?

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,310
So,

124
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,470
please don't be so heartless toward Mom
because of money.

125
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,140
I'm begging you.

126
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,620
Also, we'll stay here only for a few days.

127
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,690
It's for Ji Woo's sake,
not for any other reason.

128
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,320
I can't go back to that house
with a child.

129
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,330
You can cut me that much slack, can't you?

130
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
It's all done.

131
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,950
Min Yong.

132
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,390
I know exactly how you feel
since I grew up without a mom too.

133
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,960
No matter how nice your dad is,

134
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,090
you must feel disappointed
and annoyed for no reason.

135
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,660
But still,

136
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,400
it's much better to have your dad around,
despite how he treats you.

137
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,770
In my case,
my dad passed away when I was young,

138
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,070
so I grew up calling my brother "Dad."

139
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,470
Do you know what's fascinating?

140
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,380
I was really young back then,

141
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,710
but after my dad passed away,

142
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,480
all I remembered were the regrets.

143
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,850
"I shouldn't have begged him
to buy me toys."

144
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,120
"I shouldn't have fought with my friends."

145
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,520
"I shouldn't have hated him
for being an old dad."

146
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,520
That was how I felt.

147
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,260
I was always afraid that
my dad would leave my side as well.

148
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,270
I don't know why I couldn't express that
and only caused him heartache.

149
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,940
That regret...

150
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,540
still remains in here.

151
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,280
So, don't feel too sad about this.

152
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,880
I may not know much, but I'm sure
your dad regrets what he did too.

153
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,620
You get what I mean, don't you?

154
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,320
All right. Forget about everything
and get some good sleep.

155
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,990
Good night.

156
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,310
Gosh, I hope that kid feels better soon.

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
By the way,
why hasn't Gyu Tae come home yet?

158
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,210
Is he still with Geum Ok?

159
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,750
They say no good
comes from raising a child.

160
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,420
How could that punk do this to me?

161
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,160
He doesn't even know...

162
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,630
what terrible things I've done
to save him.

163
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,660
Terrible things?

164
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,300
What terrible things did you do
to save Min Yong?

165
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,970
You don't have to know.
It's just some stuff.

166
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,310
That's right. Hey, Choi Min Yong!

167
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,740
Do you know
how hard my brother worked to raise you?

168
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,910
Do you know
about the sacrifices of a parent?

169
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,380
A parent's sacrifice is...

170
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,850
the epitome of that very noble
and beautiful love...

171
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,620
that you can't trade for anything else
in the world, okay?

172
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,960
How would you know that?
You don't even have a kid.

173
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,130
That's right. I don't have a kid.

174
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,830
It's only natural that an unmarried woman
doesn't have a child. So what?

175
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,670
Hey, you keep calling yourself
an unmarried woman.

176
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,340
Lying is bad!

177
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,710
But it's true.

178
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,810
I had a wedding,

179
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,880
but my marriage was never registered.
So, I am an unmarried woman.

180
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,240
You didn't register your marriage?
Why not?

181
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,980
Some stuff happened.

182
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,480
We'd be up all night
if I told you about it.

183
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't ask me anything else.

184
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,490
Tell me. Come on.

185
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,790
I mean, I could listen to you all night.

186
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,600
Gyu Tae.

187
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,070
You know what?

188
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,730
So,

189
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,670
before I met my parents,

190
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,370
I've had several families
cancel my adoption.

191
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,910
- Cancel your adoption?
- As you know,

192
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,880
my parents weren't my biological parents.

193
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,020
They adopted me when I was seven.

194
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,590
That's right. I already knew that.

195
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,160
Before I met my parents,

196
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,830
I bounced around from home to home.

197
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,730
Because of that,

198
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,700
I grew up always worrying
if I'd be abandoned again.

199
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,670
You know what else? I am...

200
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,980
still afraid of going into a new house.

201
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,910
I remember walking into a new house...

202
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,050
whenever I met a new set of parents.

203
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,420
Thankfully, my parents...

204
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,190
were really nice people,

205
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,660
but they passed away too soon.

206
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,900
So, I had a really hard time...

207
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,830
because I felt all alone again.

208
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,940
And right then...

209
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,110
That was when I met my ex-husband.

210
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,110
So?

211
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,610
Didn't you live happily ever after?

212
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,850
I thought he died
while you guys were married.

213
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,080
I also thought
I'd live happily ever after.

214
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,850
He was way too nice to me.

215
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,760
So, I fell head over heels
in love with him.

216
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,460
But the thing is,
that man turned out to be...

217
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,330
He turned out to be, what?

218
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,770
He was a married man.

219
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,840
What?

220
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,470
How can someone be such a piece of trash?

221
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,740
Is there another guy
who acts like Han Mu Chul?

222
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,970
Mu Chul?

223
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,110
What about Mu Chul?

224
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,410
Oh, nothing. So?

225
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,050
So what did you do?

226
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,820
"Why in the world did you do that to me?"

227
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,920
"Why did you have to lie to me?"

228
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,820
I was going to yell at him,

229
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,520
but there was an accident,
and he just died.

230
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
What?

231
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,790
My gosh.

232
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,130
I must've been really hurt back then,
because ever since,

233
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,570
it's been hard for me to open up to men.

234
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,270
That's why I've stayed single until now.

235
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,240
So that's why you kept saying
you were an unmarried woman.

236
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,280
Still, it's a good thing
you didn't have a kid with him.

237
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,350
What if you had a kid
on top of everything?

238
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,480
You would've been stuck in a pickle.

239
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,920
Things could've been even worse.

240
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,790
- That's not true.
- What?

241
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,790
"Wouldn't it have been nice
to have a child?"

242
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,790
I wonder about that a lot.

243
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,700
Before I found out
that he had been deceiving me,

244
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,200
I tried really hard to have a baby.

245
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,410
I felt like my child would always be
on my side, no matter what.

246
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
But the thing is,

247
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,080
it was harder than I thought.

248
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,980
You see, I...

249
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,050
I promised myself
that if I ever had a child,

250
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,750
I'd love them deeply
for the rest of my life...

251
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,790
and never let them feel abandoned...

252
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,230
the way I once did.
I really did promise myself that.

253
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,760
Goodness, hey!

254
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,700
Life is best without children.

255
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,970
I mean, look at me!

256
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,270
Just know that you're lucky.

257
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,340
"Lucky?" You're the lucky one.

258
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,980
In my opinion, between you and Min Yong,

259
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,980
you are the problem.

260
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,650
Sometimes, your son just needs
a warm embrace from you.

261
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,290
Do you think yelling at him like that
will make him listen to you?

262
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,160
What? Do you think
I don't know how to embrace him?

263
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Hey.

264
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,030
Embracing others comes naturally to me.

265
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,500
You don't even know.

266
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,500
How about you let me embrace you and see?

267
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,070
Forget it!

268
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,880
By the way,

269
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,150
have you hugged Eun Hee?

270
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,180
- What?
- Well...

271
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,020
You've met her a few times.

272
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,090
Do you like her?

273
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,220
That's enough!

274
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,330
Stop prying into my private life.
Hurry up and drink.

275
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,830
You and your nonsense.

276
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,510
Pour me one too.

277
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,280
Here.

278
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,420
Hey, you look really pretty today.

279
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,090
Are you wearing makeup?

280
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,730
I wear makeup every day.

281
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,030
Is it because you're drunk?

282
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,360
Do you really think I'm pretty?

283
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,630
Yes, you're pretty.

284
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm naturally pretty.

285
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,940
I'm not pretending to be pretty.

286
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,910
I was born this way.

287
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,850
But people say
I act like I think I'm pretty.

288
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,750
It really stresses me out.

289
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,360
I'm stressed too.

290
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,440
This is so nice.

291
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,050
What?

292
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,320
It's you.

293
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,290
I thought Tae Ha would come.

294
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,930
What?

295
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,070
See this line here?

296
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,340
Cross it, and you will pay for it.

297
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,810
Okay.

298
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,770
(38 years earlier,
their 1st night together)

299
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,450
Are you sleeping?

300
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
No.

301
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,630
Can you turn around...

302
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,060
and look at me?

303
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,470
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,310
I didn't know
the last ferry would leave so early.

305
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,680
Your family must be worried.

306
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,690
I told them I was at a funeral.

307
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,990
I see, a funeral.

308
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm going to turn away
and face the wall while I sleep,

309
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
so you can sleep comfortably.

310
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,270
Am I going crazy?

311
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,140
Why am I even thinking about that?
It wasn't a good memory anyway.

312
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,480
I need to sleep. One sheep.

313
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,480
Two sheep.

314
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,420
Three sheep...

315
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,320
My heart aches.

316
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,220
The woman I love is right next to me,

317
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,890
but I can't even hold her hand.

318
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,130
This really breaks my heart.

319
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,980
Seo Woo!

320
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,710
Han Seo Woo!

321
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
(No service)

322
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
Shoot.

323
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,590
Seo Woo!

324
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,040
Where is she?

325
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
Seo Woo.

326
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,760
Seok Jin, is it you?

327
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Are you all right?

328
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,930
What is this?

329
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,970
Seok Jin!

330
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,950
What on earth happened?

331
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,310
Why are you here?

332
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,950
I just came to see you.

333
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,120
You came all the way here by yourself?

334
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm sorry for saying
I wanted to break up with you.

335
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,460
I'll never do that again.

336
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,530
I can't break up with you.

337
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,200
I wouldn't be able to live
without you if we broke up.

338
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,070
So, please don't leave me. Please?

339
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,810
I'm sorry.

340
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm sorry for being harsh to you, Seo Woo.

341
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:41,870
<i>Even the bird</i>
<i>that once cried with me grew weary</i>

342
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:47,840
<i>And flew away somewhere</i>

343
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,640
<i>In the place where you left</i>

344
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,380
<i>I will let</i>

345
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,750
<i>A single, never-fully-bloomed flower</i>
<i>blossom again and again</i>

346
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Geum Ok.

347
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,130
Geum Ok.

348
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,960
Don't cry, Geum Ok.

349
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,900
I'm right here.

350
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,340
Gyu Tae, I'm so lame, aren't I?

351
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,640
What are you talking about?

352
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,540
In my eyes,
you're the prettiest woman in the world.

353
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,710
Really?

354
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,550
Yes, of course. Don't cry.

355
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,400
Did you sleep well?

356
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,940
No, I...

357
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,040
can't sleep next to someone
I'm not comfortable with.

358
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,640
I couldn't sleep a single minute.
I'm exhausted.

359
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Oh, boy.

360
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,910
You slept like a baby.

361
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,060
Goodness.

362
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,190
I'm the one who didn't sleep a wink.

363
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,530
I mean, how could I sleep?

364
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,400
What kind of woman...

365
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,310
can look that pretty,
even when she's asleep?

366
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,820
My gosh.

367
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,190
She's pretty.

368
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,790
She still is.

369
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,060
How would I be able to sleep...

370
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,860
in that situation?

371
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,230
I'm so sleepy.

372
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,780
Once Choi Gyu Tae invests his money,

373
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,050
I can finally say goodbye
to this exhausting old Daewoon Building.

(Number One Real Estate)

375
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,130
What's this?

376
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,430
Why is it locked again?

377
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,930
Gosh, did he go somewhere?

378
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,840
Let me see.

379
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,920
Oh, my head.

380
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,190
What's going on?

381
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,460
Didn't I wash my makeup off last night?

382
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,560
I must be crazy.

383
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,430
I'm so dizzy.

384
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,130
Oh, my head.

385
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,070
So dizzy.

386
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,110
What?

387
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,220
What do I do?

388
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,680
Oh, no. This is literally insane.

389
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,980
My gosh! What do I do?

390
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,510
What am I supposed to do?

391
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,790
What?

392
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,770
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

393
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,480
Oh, my goodness.

394
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,580
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

395
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,790
(Good Luck!)

396
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,690
I told you a college diploma
wouldn't last that long.

397
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,690
You should've gotten started somewhere
and grown your career from there.

398
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,030
I can't believe
you're a part-timer at your age.

399
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,830
We're just friends.

400
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,830
It's not something for you to worry about.

401
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,970
I don't believe
that men and women can be friends.

402
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
What?

403
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,940
Right, we should work things out.
