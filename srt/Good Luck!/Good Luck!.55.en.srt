1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,110
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,810
Choi Gyu Tae,
the owner of the Daewoon Building.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,780
It's you, not someone else
with the same name.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,580
How did this happen?

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,520
Look, the resident registration number.
This is your birthday.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,520
Isn't it?

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,560
Oh, this...
I wasn't going to tell anyone about this.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,260
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,930
The truth is,

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,770
the building is
under my name in a title trust.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,770
What? A title trust? What is that?

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,210
The real owner is someone else.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,880
My name is just on the paperwork.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,310
The thing is, it's illegal.

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,180
Hey, why would you do something so risky?

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,890
The building owner practically begged me,
saying they had their reasons.

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,120
So, I had no choice but to do it for them.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,320
I lied to everyone that the owner was
someone with the same name as mine.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,660
Just pretend to know nothing about this.

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,800
My goodness.

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,960
What does this person do?

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,770
Who is this person
to ask you for something so risky?

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,300
Just someone.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
You don't need to know.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,740
What? I don't need to know?

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,410
Do you know how unhappy
the tenants are with the new landlord?

27
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,250
They won't even fix things right away!

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,580
Really?

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,550
I guess they forgot
because they're too busy.

30
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,690
I'll remind them.

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,150
You'd better tell them...

32
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,320
there's water leaking from both my ceiling
and the rice cake shop's.

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,590
It must be repaired immediately.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,160
They collect rent from us every month...

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,660
and won't even fix this?

36
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,930
All right. Is that everything
I need to tell them?

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,800
And the landlord...

38
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,040
doesn't seem to care about this building.

39
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Do you think...

40
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,540
they might be interested in selling it?

41
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,080
What? Sell the building?

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,210
I mean,
would they be interested in selling it...

43
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,180
if they could make good money off it?

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
No, they wouldn't be interested.

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,420
Not at all.

46
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,790
Is that so?

47
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,260
All right. Just let the landlord know.

48
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,990
I'm off.

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,230
And quit saying yes to things
that could get you in trouble, okay?

50
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,030
All right. Bye, Dae Sik.

51
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,370
Bye.

52
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,210
He totally caught me off guard.

53
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,440
But what was that thing
about selling the building?

54
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,750
Does he know someone who wants to buy it?

55
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,990
With those feet,
he walked over to see that woman.

56
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,400
With those hands, he caressed her.

57
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,170
And he probably kissed her
with those lips!

58
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,800
And what? How dare he say...

59
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,870
that hearing me call him "honey"
makes his heart skip?

60
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,470
What a jerk!

61
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,520
So,

62
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,280
I have something to say.

63
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,090
I'm moving tomorrow.

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,630
What? Didn't you say yesterday
that you were moving next week?

65
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,960
Why did it suddenly change to tomorrow?

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,600
It just kind of happened.

67
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,630
That's good.
I was wondering when you'd be leaving.

68
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,070
Then, should I make time
to help you tomorrow?

69
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,110
Okay.

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Thanks.

71
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,080
I'll be going, then.

72
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,690
He really must be moving out.

73
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,860
Mom, are you really going to let Dad
move out like this?

74
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,830
I mean, he even lost his memory.

75
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,700
I'm not sure if he'd be okay...

76
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,660
living on his own without his family.

77
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,000
If you're that concerned,
you should go and live with him!

78
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,710
Mom accepted her birthday present
the other day.

79
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,710
Why is she mad now?

80
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,940
Didn't she seem really touched that day?

81
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,510
Gosh, how would I know?

82
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,970
Meet me outside for a minute.

83
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,600
(My lovely Seok Jin)

84
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,170
(Kim Dae Sik)

85
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
What's going on?

86
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,510
Why are you acting like this?

87
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,250
You won't even call me.
Why are you acting so stern...

88
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,210
as if you're mad at me?

89
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,320
Didn't you break up with me?

90
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,990
What?

91
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,950
You said
we shouldn't see each other anymore...

92
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,060
and that we should break up.

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,690
Come on.
People can say stuff out of anger.

94
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,460
Why are you making such a big deal
out of that?

95
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,500
Do you never blurt things out
when you're mad?

96
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,430
That's right. I never do that.

97
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,570
You may say stuff like that as a joke,
but not me.

98
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,770
I only say things
that I can be responsible for.

99
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,270
So, I took what you said...

100
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,980
to be the truth.

101
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,810
I mean, I just...

102
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,950
That's why I'm trying
not to think about you.

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
So stop trying to shake me up.

104
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,290
Hey, Ye Won.

105
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,530
I'll be right there. See you later.

106
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,940
Hey, Seok Jin!

107
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,270
Gosh, what do I do?

108
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,540
I only said that out of anger.

109
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,510
Did he think it was for real?

110
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,250
But I can't break up with Seok Jin.

111
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,250
That can't happen.

112
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,720
What? So, you decided to take over
the restaurant?

113
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,590
You were going on about
not being that shameless and all that.

114
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,660
I guess you've decided
to throw your shame out the window.

115
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,960
I did not.
My brother decided to help me out.

116
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
I will pay him back for it, though.

117
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,230
Gosh, your brother must be a big shot
to pay for something huge like this.

118
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,640
Anyway, I'm going to renovate the place
to liven it up,

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,740
and I'll revamp the menu too.

120
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,910
It'll be full of
Kim Ah Jin's signature dishes.

121
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,440
Okay. Good luck.

122
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,520
By the way,
could I perhaps take the day off tomorrow?

123
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,120
I have to help my dad move.

124
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,760
Your dad is moving? By himself?

125
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,920
Well, it is what it is.
That'll be okay, right?

126
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,430
Sure, go ahead.

127
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,430
Ah Jin.

128
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,400
What?

129
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,960
Oh, you're here.

130
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,170
It's been so long.

131
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,430
I was too busy to come here for a while.

132
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,670
I was dying to eat your food, you know.

133
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,610
I'm glad you're here.

134
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,110
Oh, meet my colleagues.

135
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,210
Say hello. She's an amazing chef
who can cook like magic.

136
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

137
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,920
Mr. Choi has told us a lot about you.

138
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,550
But seeing how beautiful you are,

139
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,050
it doesn't seem like
we're here just for the food.

140
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,390
Pardon?

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,320
You guys only get to come here this once.

142
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,690
You're dead meat
if you come again like me.

143
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,800
Sorry. We can be such jokesters.
I hope we didn't offend you.

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,500
Gosh, no. You're all so witty.

145
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,570
What would you like to eat?

146
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,170
- Oh, shall we sit here?
- Yes.

147
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,300
Let's sit down, guys.

148
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,410
Why are you so happy?

149
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,780
Is it because of
that mere manager guy, perhaps?

150
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,710
A mere manager?

151
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,450
Didn't you see
how he brought three of his subordinates?

152
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,290
Hey, didn't I tell you?
Managers are a dime a dozen...

153
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,390
My gosh.

154
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,770
Enjoy.

155
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,940
Hey, even the color of the food
looks delicious already.

156
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,070
Try it, and tell me your honest opinions.

157
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,810
Then, let's see how good
Mr. Choi's highly-praised food is.

158
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,650
Hey, why haven't you been
answering my calls?

159
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,580
Aren't you being too hard to get, sweetie?

160
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,650
"Sweetie?"

161
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,520
Who is it? Your girlfriend?

162
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,320
Of course. I miss you too, sweetie.

163
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,690
Do you want anything to eat?
I'll bring you some.

164
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,490
I guess you really do have a girlfriend,
Mr. Choi.

165
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,630
Gosh, Mr. Choi is a popular guy.

166
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,860
It'd be weird
if he didn't have a girlfriend.

167
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,800
That's too bad. Ms. Kim was waiting
for her chance to ask him out.

168
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,670
I should go and tell her today
that Mr. Choi has a girlfriend.

169
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,840
Oh, did that really happen?

170
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,670
You must be so upset, sweetie.

171
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,510
Indeed. My hunch wasn't wrong.

172
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,310
He was flirting with anyone
when he already had a girlfriend.

173
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,950
What a playboy.

174
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,690
Oh, okay.
I'm out for lunch now, so I should eat.

175
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,890
I'll call you again later, sweetie. Bye.

176
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,620
Let's eat.

177
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,790
What did you say?

178
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,560
I have to pay it back in full?

179
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,460
Yes, you haven't been making
interest payments...

180
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,660
on your housing mortgage loan.

181
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,100
So, you must pay back the interest
and principal in one full payment.

182
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,640
What if I can't pay it back?
What would happen, then?

183
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,610
We'd have no choice but to proceed
with legal action to collect the debt.

184
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,510
Then, your house will be foreclosed
as collateral for your loan.

185
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,680
Foreclosed?
Does that mean you'll seize my house?

186
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,490
Yes, I understand.

187
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,060
Who was that call from?

188
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,520
It's nothing.

189
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,560
Hey, have you looked
into borrowing some money?

190
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,830
You said you'd ask your friends.

191
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,130
Well, I asked,

192
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
but I couldn't borrow any.

193
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,870
Maybe it's because
I haven't been able to pay them back...

194
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,940
for what I borrowed during the pandemic.

195
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,700
They all seem to be avoiding my calls.

196
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,440
Oh, dear. Hey.

197
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,270
Couldn't we ask
your mother-in-law about it?

198
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,840
I mean, it looks like Mi Jin...

199
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,580
has made up with her mom.

200
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,010
Gosh, no.

201
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,820
Why not?
I thought they won 23 million dollars.

202
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,550
They'd be able to lend us money
and still have a lot left.

203
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,520
Gosh, don't be like that.
Just ask her about it, at least.

204
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,330
I told you. I can't.

205
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,260
- My gosh.
- Mother.

206
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,400
- Hey.
- Why were you so startled?

207
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,900
It's nothing. What is it?

208
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,900
The food is ready. Come and eat.

209
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,170
Oh, dear.

210
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,480
It's so nice
to eat with you like this, Ms. Lee.

211
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,720
I feel like I'm inconveniencing you.
I'm so sorry.

212
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,350
Goodness, don't say that.
I'm so glad to have you here.

213
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
You could stay for a whole month
if you wanted to.

214
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,420
- Gosh, Mother.
- How funny you are, Ms. Park.

215
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,330
Mother, my mom made
this bellflower root dish. Try it.

216
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,330
Oh, really?

217
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,370
It's delicious.

218
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,940
Mi Jin, you must take after your mom.

219
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,240
That must be why you're such a great cook.

220
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,080
What? Didn't you say
that I had no talent for cooking...

221
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,050
and that I should never cook at all?

222
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,050
Come on. I told you not to cook
so you wouldn't have to work so much.

223
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,120
Gosh, didn't you get my joke?

224
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
Oh, was that what it was?

225
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm sorry, Mother.

226
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,860
Do you see what a good girl she is?

227
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,730
She takes every word
from her elders so seriously.

228
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,240
She's as upright as can be.

229
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,270
Right.

230
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,380
You should consider yourself lucky, kid.
There's no other mother-in-law like her.

231
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,280
She even told you not to cook
since you have a job.

232
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,080
I know. I married really well.

233
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,190
Mom, I'll do the dishes after we eat.

234
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,760
- I'll do it with you, Grandma.
- Okay.

235
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,730
Your grandma from Dajeong-dong
prepared the meal,

236
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,530
so you can do the dishes with me.

237
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,860
Okay. Sounds good.

238
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,300
She has 23 million dollars in her pocket.

239
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,340
Wouldn't it be nice
for her to help out her only son-in-law?

240
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,180
Goodness, I'm burning up inside.

241
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,020
Oh, boy. How long is she planning
on staying with our in-laws?

242
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,250
How shameless can she be?

243
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,350
Dae Sik.

244
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,960
- Yes?
- Hey.

245
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,460
I'm moving tomorrow.
Can you give me the day off?

246
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,870
What? Why are you moving so suddenly?

247
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,940
It was supposed to be next week,
but I'm just going to move out sooner.

248
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,040
Why? Did your wife tell you to leave soon?

249
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,770
Are things still rocky between you two?

250
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,580
It's not like that.

251
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,810
Everyone is begging me to stay,

252
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,820
but I'm just leaving
because I don't want to be a burden.

253
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,790
Even if that's the case,
a family should live together.

254
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,320
You have your kids to think about.

255
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,330
Have you and Hye Sook made up?

256
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Hang on.

257
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,630
I haven't seen Hye Sook around lately.

258
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
What?

259
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,110
Did she pack up and leave that day?

260
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,580
You and your nonsense, man.

261
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,850
Stop talking nonsense.
Just go to the store and get what we need.

262
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,750
All right.

263
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,720
Hey, Dae Sik.

264
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,750
If you let me take tomorrow off,

265
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,290
I'll work extra hours on another day
to make up for it. So, please...

266
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,560
Forget it, man.

267
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,930
Just don't come in tomorrow.

268
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,700
Okay.

269
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,760
See you in a bit.

270
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,580
That punk. I'm offended.

271
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,510
What? Hearing me call him "honey"
made his heart skip?

272
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,580
How dare he toy with my feelings?

273
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,320
How could he meet another woman
after saying that?

274
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,560
Oh, hello. My gosh.

275
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,620
What the...

276
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,890
Is she going to show up
whenever she wants now?

277
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
What is that?

278
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,600
Are they holding hands now?

279
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,570
I asked you
to please pretend not to know me.

280
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,710
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,140
From now on,
do not say hi when you see me.

282
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Do you understand?

283
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Yes.

284
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,560
Goodness, it's so weird.

285
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,160
Why is it that whenever I see that woman,

286
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,090
I want to say hi to her?

287
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,730
Whatever.

288
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,140
I'm Choi Gyu Tae,
the owner of the Daewoon Building.

289
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,660
Welcome.

290
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,380
Hello, Mr. Choi.

291
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,380
Hello, Mrs. Taylor.

292
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,290
What brings you here? Please take a seat.

293
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,960
I was in the area,
so I thought I'd stop by.

294
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,620
Oh, I see.

295
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,130
I came to give you this.

296
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,560
This... What is this?

297
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,670
I bought it at the mall.

298
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,170
It's for your son.

299
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,170
What? It's for Min Yong?

300
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,540
That's right.
You said your son was 17, right?

301
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,340
Yes.

302
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,080
That's right, but why did you get this?

303
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,850
Choi Gyu Tae has a son.

304
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,820
I think he had major surgery
because of a serious condition.

305
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,920
I hear he loves his son dearly,

306
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,430
so try to earn some brownie points.

307
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,330
What do you mean, why?

308
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,630
You've been such a great listener,

309
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,640
and I'm grateful to you in so many ways.

310
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,040
Just think of it
as a small token of my gratitude.

311
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,040
My gosh. You thought of my son, Min Yong.

312
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,950
Thank you so much.

313
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,950
Don't mention it.

314
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,380
Oh, right.

315
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,950
I was hoping to ask
for your thoughts on something.

316
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,820
Sure, what is it?

317
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,730
I'm thinking of...

318
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,560
investing in Mr. Jang's business.

319
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,630
What? You want to make an investment?

320
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,270
Yes, the business
is going to do very well,

321
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,900
so I'm starting to feel ambitious.

322
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,470
I'm thinking of putting in more
than I first intended,

323
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,880
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

324
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,050
If it's Mr. Jang, you can trust him.

325
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,250
What does the investment entail?

326
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,050
Well, it is...

327
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,930
Hey, if anyone says anything to you,

328
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,370
just tell them about me wherever you go!

329
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,970
Tell them your bear-sized,
hot-tempered brother said...

330
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,800
he'd chase them...

331
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,180
to the other side of the Earth
if they tick him off. Got it?

332
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,010
No, not just to the other side.

333
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,550
Even if I have to chase them down
to the ends of the Earth, I'll find them.

334
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,020
Is he even my real brother?
Why does he butt in every chance he gets?

335
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,260
Should I bring him
this fresh cup of coffee?

336
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,860
My gosh, I'm flattered.

337
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
Hey.

338
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,300
Oh, you're with a customer.

339
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,670
What's her deal?

340
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,170
Who shows up dressed like that
at a real estate office?

341
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,750
Hey, what's up?

342
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,210
Well...

343
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,380
I made a fresh cup of coffee
and brought you some,

344
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,390
but I'll come back later.

345
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,790
- No.
- What?

346
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,890
I'll take the coffee.

347
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,820
- I was thirsty, so this is perfect.
- But...

348
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,960
If you're a coffee drinker,

349
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,990
would you like some iced coffee?

350
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,460
What? But it's...

351
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,670
Sure thing. That'd be great.

352
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,900
All right, then. I'll make you
a delicious cup of iced coffee.

353
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,740
Hey, but...

354
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,540
- Thanks for this.
- Wait.

355
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
All right.

356
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,710
Hey, why are you standing there?
Aren't you leaving?

357
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,050
- What? But...
- Hey, hurry up and go.

358
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,850
- If you leave your cafe empty,
- But...

359
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,850
- you'll lose customers.
- Wait.

360
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,120
- Go, hurry back.
- My gosh.

361
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
Thanks for the coffee!

362
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,190
I brought him the coffee
so we could have it together.

363
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,720
Why is he giving it to that customer?

364
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Hold on.

365
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,530
Who is that customer
he's going out of his way for?

366
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,270
My gosh. She looks like someone...

367
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,670
- There.
- who'd perform at a bar at night.

368
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,070
Hold on.

369
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,370
I feel like
I've seen her somewhere before.

370
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,440
- Who is she?
- Gosh, don't say that.

371
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,980
You're beautiful.

372
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,450
My goodness.

373
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,120
Oh, hello. My gosh.

374
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,430
Come on!

375
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,930
So, he is still deceiving me.

376
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,100
I will never forgive him!

377
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,290
Seok Jin.

378
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,890
Ah Jin.

379
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,130
Hey, honey...

380
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,670
Woman, how could you sleep
somewhere else and not at home?

381
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,690
Oh, my. I like how quiet it is,

382
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,060
with no one talking to me.

383
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
It's peaceful and nice.

384
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,880
Mi Ja, I'm home!

385
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,750
Kids!

386
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,050
What? Did they all go out?

387
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,520
Well, I should start packing.

388
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,670
Oh, I got home pretty late, didn't I?

389
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,670
I worked late today
since I'm taking tomorrow off.

390
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,900
Dae Sik was kind enough to...

391
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,510
Why are you giving me this?

392
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,680
Take that thing too.

393
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,120
And don't show up in front of me again.

394
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
You got that?

395
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,220
Oh, boy.

396
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,310
Right.

397
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,310
Let's clean.

398
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,760
Hey, those look awesome.
Did you buy those, Gyu Tae?

399
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,920
Gosh, don't make such a fuss.

400
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,730
Take good care of them and wear them well.

401
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,460
You'll wear these tomorrow, right?

402
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,200
Sure, whatever.

403
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,370
Hey, I'll give you a ride tomorrow,
so come with me.

404
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,670
It's fine.

405
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,680
Hey, this is your chance to look good.

406
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,750
You're not even a good student,

407
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,180
but you get out of an expensive car
as the driver opens the door for you.

408
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,220
From that day on,
you'll be the most popular kid at school.

409
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,120
Hey, your friends
will be so jealous of you.

410
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,760
They don't care about any of that stuff.

411
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,930
Look at him.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

412
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,570
Jin Tae, you tell him.

413
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,000
He's right. Your dad must want you
to have a comfortable ride to school.

414
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,540
Just come along, Min Yong.

415
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,840
You should get a ride
in the car that your uncle drives too.

416
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,510
All right, already.

417
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,280
Gosh, kiddo.

418
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,510
Seriously, though. Those shoes look great.

419
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,890
Your dad must not check
the school app very often.

420
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,730
He didn't choose...

421
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,700
whether to visit the school
or just talk on the phone...

422
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,300
for Parent-Teacher Conference Week.

423
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,670
So, I just tried calling him,
but he didn't answer.

424
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,600
Did he perhaps mention anything?

425
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,270
Oh, my dad told me
to tell you that he couldn't come in,

426
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,780
but I forgot.

427
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,610
Should I remind him about the conference?

428
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,510
No, conference week is over anyway.

429
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,650
Just tell him to call me
if he has any questions.

430
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Okay.

431
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,510
I mean,

432
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,080
she bought Min Yong a pair of shoes.

433
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,210
So far,

434
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,680
Mrs. Taylor is the first woman
to buy Min Yong a present...

435
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,090
even before buying one for me.

436
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,190
So, honey,

437
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,860
please help me
so that things work out for me.

438
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,160
Our dear Min Yong...

439
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,600
should get to call someone Mom now too.

440
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,430
That poor kid...

441
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,000
has been living without a mom's love
for years already.

442
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,680
Mom, what are you doing?

443
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
Mom?

444
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,690
Hey, what is it?

445
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,930
Did Dad go somewhere?
He doesn't seem to be around.

446
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,500
Who cares if he's here or not?

447
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,110
I'm done with the kitchen.

448
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,310
Shall I take a look at the bathroom?

449
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,380
Let's wash the rag.

450
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,950
Oh, boy.

451
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,380
I guess he left early
in hopes of moving in with that woman.

452
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,950
Han Mu Chul.

453
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,520
You're out of my life for good now!

454
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,790
Oh, man.

455
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,390
What...

456
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,230
(Good Luck!)

457
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,200
Dad isn't here.
His blankets don't look slept in either.

458
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,300
Is he even staying out all night now?

459
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,070
Excuse me.
You asked me about Mr. Han Mu Chul,

460
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
didn't you?

461
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,710
He'll spend the night there
and come back tomorrow.

462
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,650
- Ms. Park went on the business trip too.
- What?

463
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,650
You're Mr. Han Mu Chul, aren't you?

464
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,690
It says he's dead.

465
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,860
