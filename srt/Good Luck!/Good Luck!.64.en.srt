1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,140
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,450
I sent you a note like that?

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,280
That's not true.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,890
I never even wrote such a note.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,990
I doubt that. I'm certain I got it.

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,870
Mi Ja is as pretty as a plum.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,080
I miss her.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,630
I thought it'd all be over...

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,530
- when we offered them the money.
- Honey.

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,130
What is this now?

11
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,510
Honey.

12
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,410
What? Where did he go
in the middle of the night?

13
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,180
I don't know how it happened,

14
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,550
but what's certain is...

15
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,190
that we were both there...

16
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,860
and that we waited for each other.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,460
I never knew.

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,030
All this time,

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,500
I thought I had been rejected by you.

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
Same here.

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,080
I thought you had turned me down too.

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,280
Shortly after that, I heard
you and Hye Sook were going out,

23
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,450
so I naturally assumed that you...

24
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,200
Oh, that's Mi Ja.

25
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,870
That was why I thought...

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,700
What? Why is she with Dae Sik?

27
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,610
Honey.

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,410
What are you doing out here?

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,580
Oh, I came out to get some air...

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,450
and saw Mi Ja here, so...

31
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,690
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,230
Well, good night.

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,300
I'm heading in.

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,500
What? Why are they both heading inside
now that I'm here?

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,770
My goodness.

36
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,150
Honey, what did you and Mi Ja talk about?

37
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,790
Nothing much.

38
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,190
Right, so what did you two talk about?

39
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,060
Why are you so curious?

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,660
We didn't really talk
about anything important.

41
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,270
Whatever. I don't want you
getting tangled up with her.

42
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,600
It's no secret that she had a crush on you
back in high school.

43
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,310
And you too.

44
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,880
Before we started going out,

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,980
I thought you had a crush on her too.

46
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,450
When I asked you out,
you said yes right away.

47
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,690
Do you know how surprised I was
when that happened?

48
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,990
Now, I know that I was your first love.

49
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,260
But back then, I didn't.

50
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,060
Oh, please.

51
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,400
Anyway, you need to be careful.

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,630
Don't try to help your friend's wife
and then let the neighbors...

53
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,400
spread absurd rumors about the two of you.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you understand?

55
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,670
What? Rumors?

56
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,510
That won't happen, so don't worry.

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,620
Why did Hye Sook show up
right at that moment?

58
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,990
That was so awkward.

59
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,960
Anyway, how did that happen?

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,860
How is it possible that
we both received notes we never wrote?

61
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,600
Gosh, whatever.
It's all in the past anyway.

62
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,730
What's the use of talking about it now?

63
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,100
What's this sound?

64
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,970
Who is it?

65
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,640
(Kim Dae Sik)

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,250
What? I swear I heard a weird noise.

67
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
What is this?

68
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,630
My gosh. They're plums.

69
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,600
Mi Ja, I got you some plums
because I know you like them.

70
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,470
I'll keep dropping off snacks for you
from time to time.

71
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,310
Good night.

72
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,880
Hey, Choi Gyu Tae. You jerk.

73
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,880
You said you liked me.

74
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,650
How could you date another woman?

75
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,490
You. You're so mean. I hate you.

76
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,060
I'll teach you a lesson.

77
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,290
Why, you... Get a taste of this!

78
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,730
Did that hurt?

79
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,060
I'm hurt too.

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm hurting even more.
I'm so hurt, you jerk!

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,040
Ouch, why do I feel like
someone's poking me nonstop?

82
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,310
What?

83
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,940
Hey, Min Yong.
Did you enjoy the party today?

84
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,280
What did you think of Mrs. Taylor?
Isn't she pretty?

85
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,880
Ms. Hwang is much prettier.

86
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,620
Also, don't invite your guests
to my birthday party anymore.

87
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,320
You punk. Why are you so cranky?

88
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,660
Hey, do you seriously think
Geum Ok is pretty?

89
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,790
What is wrong with your eyes? My goodness.

90
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,400
Why? Geum Ok is pretty.

91
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,470
I've always thought she was pretty.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,570
Hey, go and see an eye doctor
if you have some time tomorrow.

93
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,040
Pretty, my foot!

94
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,770
I have good eyesight.

95
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,780
Goodness.

96
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
What?

97
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,950
Oh, hello.

98
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
That thing?

99
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,650
It's at my office.

100
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,590
Now?

101
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,760
Got it.

102
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,760
Hey, I need to quickly go to my office.

106
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,180
Darn it. Why won't this open?

107
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,080
Hey! Your master is here. Open up already.

108
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,990
Why won't this open?

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,160
Darn you. Open up!

Hey!

Have you lost your mind?

What? It's Choi Gyu Tae.

Darn it.

Hey!

115
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,370
A man should never say something
and then go back on his word.

116
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,110
Didn't you say
I was the prettiest woman in the world?

117
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,340
You said I was the prettiest woman
you had ever met.

118
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,110
Did you not say that?

119
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,650
Yes, I said that.

120
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,490
So, let's go. Let me take you home.

121
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,790
Darn you. Let go!

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,020
I have something to say to you.

"That night?"

out of those clothes?

- Why would you do that? Get out.

- Okay.

to get that money from Dad?

183
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,940
I mean the five million dollars.

184
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,950
This is just my opinion,

185
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,590
but I think it would be a little too much
to ask for that money right away.

186
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,520
First, you could take the 500,000 dollars
and set everything up well.

187
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,060
So, how about you show Dad
how well you're doing...

188
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,590
and ask for more money later?

189
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,200
What's that supposed to mean?

190
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,470
If you ask for five million
without much of a plan,

191
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,730
it might put Dad in a tough spot.

192
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,740
As you know,

193
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,310
Dad didn't willingly give
Seok Jin his investment.

194
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,640
Mom did it behind Dad's back.

195
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,250
Did you tell Dad that you'd accept
your 500,000 dollars?

196
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,980
No, I didn't.

197
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,450
Are you really not going to accept it?

198
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,750
That's right.

199
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,960
I told you. I don't need that money.

200
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,790
Do you know
you sort of act stuck-up sometimes?

201
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,030
What?

202
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,030
"Stuck-up?"

203
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,270
He's giving us the same amount of money,
but someone accepts and someone doesn't.

204
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,470
Then, what would that make
those who accept the money?

205
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,470
Didn't you think it would only make
Seok Jin and me look materialistic?

206
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,240
"Materialistic?"

207
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,410
Still, I can't just take money
that I don't even need.

208
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,380
Why don't you need it?

209
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,850
You could take that money
and do whatever you want with it.

210
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,050
You could expand
your restaurant business...

211
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,490
and do whatever you want.

212
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,820
Why on earth don't you need it?

213
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,520
Mi Jin.

214
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,230
If you really don't need money,

215
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,060
you could just take it now
and lend it to someone who does need it.

216
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,000
You just had to say you wouldn't take it
in front of the whole family.

217
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,670
That's called being stuck-up.
Either that, or you're just selfish.

218
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,970
So, do you mean...

219
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,040
I should accept that money
and lend it to you?

220
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,380
What? When did I ask you
to lend me the money?

221
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,180
But that's what you mean.

222
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,990
Don't you mean I should take the money
and lend it to you?

223
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,590
What's wrong with you two?
Is something the matter?

224
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,630
Hey, do you think I'm a joke?

225
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,230
Just because I have no money
and I'm mooching off our parents,

226
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,600
do you think
I'd try to take your money too?

227
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,330
Mi Jin, what's wrong?

228
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,800
I'm so disappointed in you.

229
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,300
Are you even my sister?

230
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,810
What does that money mean to you
that you've changed this much?

231
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,840
Who says I've changed?

232
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,210
What do you know?

233
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,550
What do you even know
to provoke me like this?

234
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,380
Both of you, enough!

235
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,970
What's with all the noise
so early in the morning?

236
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm going to work.

237
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,190
What on earth is wrong with you?

238
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,920
You've never done anything
like this before.

239
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,920
Ah Jin is completely right.

240
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,860
Just take the 500,000 dollars
while you can.

241
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,100
What if your dad takes back his offer
because you get too greedy?

242
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,530
"Greedy?"

243
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,170
Do you think I'm being too greedy?

244
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,470
To be honest, yes, I do.

245
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,740
If not for our lottery winnings,

246
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,410
you guys wouldn't have dreamed
of starting a business.

247
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,880
Hey, not everyone is cut out for business.

248
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,980
I'm living proof of that.

249
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,680
Anyway, I know you.

250
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,450
You should just get a job
at a small company...

251
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,490
and get regular paychecks.

252
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,520
So, are you saying
I don't deserve that money?

253
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,460
Well, that's not what I mean.

254
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,560
Sure.

255
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,770
I haven't studied much,
and I'm not that good at anything.

256
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,870
But have you and Dad...

257
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,800
ever truly supported me until now?

258
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,170
You remember, right?

259
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,540
I used to be a good artist.

260
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,480
I wanted to major in design
and study abroad too.

261
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,180
But what did you say to me?

262
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,050
"You're not a good student,
so it won't work out for you."

263
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,050
"Let's just give Seok Jin all our support
since he gets good grades."

264
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,860
That was why I gave up going to college
and got a job.

265
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,990
With my paychecks,
I paid for Seok Jin's tuition...

266
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,260
and gave Ah Jin pocket money.

267
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,870
If you and Dad had supported me somehow,

268
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,040
my life
would've turned out differently too.

269
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,310
I might not have been able to go
to a good college like Seok Jin,

270
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,240
but I could've found success
in some other way, don't you think?

271
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,120
You never even gave me a chance.

272
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,080
Why do you just look down on me
and tell me I can't do it?

273
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,150
I'm saying I want to do what I want now.

274
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,090
Is that so hard? Is that so impossible?

275
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,160
Goodness, Mi Jin!

276
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Oh, dear.

277
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,030
Oh, dear.

278
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,970
What?

279
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,180
What is this?

280
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,380
Where am I?

281
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,380
Oh, what?

282
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,280
What am I wearing?

283
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,080
Why am I...

284
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,920
Gosh, my head.

285
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,350
Hang on.

286
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,990
I was drinking last night.
What happened after that?

287
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
What is this?

288
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,510
This is Gyu Tae's house.

289
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,040
But what am I doing here?

290
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,250
Why won't this open?

291
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,150
Darn you. Open up!

292
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
Hey!

293
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,550
Goodness, hey!

294
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,990
Hey, Hwang Geum Ok. Are you all right?

295
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,260
Hwang Geum Ok.

296
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,790
Gosh, it's hot.

297
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,930
How would I know that? Hey, Hwang Geum Ok!

298
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,100
Hwang Geum Ok, what's your door code?

299
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, I can't...

300
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,210
Hwang Geum Ok!

301
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Gosh, I can't believe this.

302
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,310
Come out and have breakfast.

303
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,930
Try the bean sprout soup.

304
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,400
Uncle made it. It tastes great.

305
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,400
All I did was cook.

306
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,370
Gyu Tae went out and bought
the bean sprouts this morning.

307
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,210
I see.

308
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,540
Thanks, Gyu Tae. You too, Jin Tae.

309
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,620
I didn't think
I'd get so drunk last night.

310
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,720
Goodness, it's fine. You're no stranger.

311
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
- Go on and eat.
- Okay.

312
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,860
Then, I'll enjoy the meal.

313
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,140
Oh, I must still be hungover.

314
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,940
I'm fine, so go ahead and eat.

315
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,140
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

316
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,020
Hey, Min Yong.

317
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,420
That's not how you debone a fish.

318
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,590
Goodness, give it here.
I'll do it for you.

319
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,460
There. You know,

320
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,560
I always wonder
why men can't debone fish even as adults.

321
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,630
Seriously.

322
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
Hold on.

323
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,200
Here. It's ready. You can eat now.

324
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Thank you.

325
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,210
My gosh.

326
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,020
I love that
you enjoy everything you eat, Min Yong.

327
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,420
Hold on.
Are these the only side dishes you have?

328
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,060
This is not good. How about I bring you
some spicy dried squid strips?

329
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,860
I'd love that. That's all I need
to finish a bowl of rice.

330
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,100
Yes, I know that. It's your favorite
of all the side dishes I make.

331
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,770
Oh, should I also make
some pan-fried anchovies while at it?

332
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,080
You love crispy pan-fried anchovies.

333
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,440
Yes. Your pan-fried anchovies
are the best, Auntie.

334
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,650
- All right.
- Hey.

335
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,750
Why are you calling her "Auntie?"

336
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
What?

337
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,820
Hold on.

338
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,990
Wouldn't "Auntie Geum Ok" be appropriate
since she's like your little sister?

339
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,290
What?

340
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,690
Oh, never mind. It would be better
to just address her by her first name.

341
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,730
What?

342
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,560
What, then?
Do you want him to call you "Ma'am?"

343
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,270
Hey, Uncle.

344
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,870
Sorry.

345
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,870
This is my first time asking you for help.

346
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,080
I've always put
Seok Jin and Ah Jin first...

347
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,610
and never got my turn, so I gave up.

348
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,750
This is my first time
claiming what I rightfully deserve.

349
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,790
Is it that hard to give it to me?
Is it that difficult for you?

350
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,300
Oh, that's Mi Ja.

351
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,940
That was why I thought...

352
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,950
Why is he in such a bad mood?

353
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,680
Did something happen with Mi Ja?

354
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Hey, Dae Sik.

355
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Yes?

356
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,030
Well, you've been sighing nonstop.

357
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,070
Are you worried about something?

358
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,270
No, it's nothing.

359
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,140
Actually, I passed by
your house last night...

360
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,710
and saw you with Mi Ja in the front yard.

361
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,080
Oh, you saw me?

362
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
What did you two...

363
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,420
talk about?

364
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,320
Nothing important.

365
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,850
You should've come in. Why didn't you?

366
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,460
I thought Mi Ja wouldn't like it.

367
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,590
Are you sure...

368
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,200
you talked about nothing important?

369
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,360
Come on, man. I already told you.

370
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,430
Why?

371
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,700
What do you think we talked about?

372
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,770
What? No, never mind.

373
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,510
Oh, hey.

374
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,510
You said I was
three million dollars in debt, didn't you?

375
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Yes, what about it?

376
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,820
After seeing those creditors yesterday,

377
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,920
I almost feel desperate enough to steal
just to pay it all off.

378
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,050
Then I wouldn't have to
run away like that.

379
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,860
I'd tell myself to stay strong
and pull myself together,

380
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,600
but when I think about that...

381
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,330
I feel completely drained.

382
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,370
I doubt much will change...

383
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,770
even if I do manage to regain my memory.

384
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,680
Oh, boy.

385
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,490
I guess you're going to work.

386
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
Yes.

387
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,720
Hey, what time
did you get home last night?

388
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,360
Why do you keep staying out late?

389
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,390
What? It was just one night.

390
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,860
My friend's birthday party went late.
What was I supposed to do?

391
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,970
Besides, I got home at midnight,
which isn't too late!

392
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,570
From now on,

393
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,710
be sure to always come home,
no matter how late it gets.

394
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,510
It could be dangerous to be out alone
at night, so call your mom,

395
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,640
and I'll wait for you outside.

396
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,080
What about Dad's housewarming party?
Is it happening?

397
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,620
We should visit his new place
at least once.

398
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,850
Yes, we should.

399
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,120
I couldn't get in touch with Dad
because he doesn't have a cell phone.

400
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,590
I'm going to visit him at Jackpot Chicken.

401
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,100
Why are you suddenly interested in Dad?

402
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
Just because.

403
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,810
- I'm so excited.
- I heard their kimchi stew was good.

404
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,670
- Really? We should order it.
- Yes.

405
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,980
- Oh, my.
- Let's go inside.

406
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,180
(Buddumak)

407
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,710
- Come this way, please.
- It looks good. It's here.

408
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,310
- My gosh.
- Excuse me.

409
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,550
- This way, please.
- Nice.

410
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,520
Here's your food.

411
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,490
- You can sit here.
- Thank you.

412
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,490
Hey, Ah Jin!

413
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,490
What? Dong Min.

414
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,330
Here, congratulations on the reopening.

415
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,860
You didn't have to bring anything. Thanks.

416
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,870
Come on. It's nothing.

417
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,530
I'm here to eat, but I see
that there are no tables available.

418
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,640
Please wait outside.

419
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,380
I guess he's angry again, as usual.

420
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,610
Hello...

421
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,320
Are you here to see Seok Jin?

422
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,750
Pardon? Who... Are you Ms. Park?

423
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,690
You look so different.
Is today some kind of special day?

424
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,260
I just wanted to change it up a bit.

425
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,370
Oh, did you end up
talking to Seok Jin that night?

426
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,730
The night he and I went out for drinks.

427
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,800
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

428
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,540
Please refrain
from answering his phone from now on.

429
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,980
I'll be honest with you.
It really upset me.

430
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,880
Oh, did it?

431
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,350
We always used to answer
each other's phones...

432
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,320
when we were busy,

433
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,890
so I did it out of habit.

434
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,860
What? So, that wasn't the first time?

435
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,860
No, we're close friends,

436
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,060
so it happens often.

437
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,930
And I have a favor to ask as well.

438
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,300
I'd appreciate it if you could avoid
visiting our office whenever you please.

439
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,240
This is our place of work,
not your personal playground.

440
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,270
What? I just...

441
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,740
It's not like I affect your work.

442
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,080
You know I just come here
to see Seok Jin briefly.

443
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,920
That's what you think.

444
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,780
You should be more considerate
of our employees.

445
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,790
Even if it makes them uncomfortable,
they wouldn't say anything...

446
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,920
because you're their boss' girlfriend.

447
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,590
Hey, Seo Woo. What brings you by?

448
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,430
I'll call you later.

449
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,670
Seo Woo, wait.

450
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,640
Why is Seo Woo so upset?
I'll be right back.

451
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,710
Wait, Seok Jin.

452
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,640
About the 4.5 million dollars
you mentioned.

453
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,940
Why don't we give up
on the distribution center...

454
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,140
and just pay that off?

455
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,210
I might call them today
and back out of the contract.

456
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,450
Won't we have other issues
if we say we want to back out?

457
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,480
Come and sit here. Let's go through it.

458
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,560
You never even gave me a chance.

459
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,600
Why do you just look down on me
and tell me I can't do it?

460
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm saying I want to do what I want now.

461
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,640
Is that so hard? Is that so impossible?

462
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,640
My gosh. If I had any money,
I would give her all I have.

463
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,110
That's right.

464
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,550
I forgot about that money.

465
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
Yes.

466
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Mi Ja.

467
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,830
Mi Ja.

468
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,760
Yes. What's up?

469
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,100
I wanted to ask you something.

470
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,270
How much is your rent now?

471
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,040
Rent? What rent?

472
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,600
For this place.

473
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,070
I told my husband
not to charge you too much for rent,

474
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,080
but I left it up to him, so I don't know
how much he ended up charging you.

475
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,810
How much are you paying now?

476
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,910
I'm paying nothing.

477
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,390
What do you mean? You're not paying rent?

478
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,550
Mr. Kim told me
we didn't have to pay anything.

479
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,060
I'm living here rent-free.

480
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
You didn't know?

481
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
What?

482
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,510
(Good Luck!)

483
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,350
Do you just go ahead
and answer Ye Won's phone when it rings?

484
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,150
I hope you can keep
some distance from Ye Won.

485
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,860
- Hey, you!
- Why are you here again?

486
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,860
Who are you trying to hit on this time?

487
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,260
I wonder if her stomach is feeling better.

488
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,500
I said she should just take the day off,
but she insisted on going to work.

489
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm worried.

490
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,770
