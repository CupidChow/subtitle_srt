1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,270
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,050
(Episode 32)

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,050
So, how old are you...

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,980
Are you perhaps...

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,150
Hey, where is Han Tae Ha?

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,690
Han Tae Ha is hiding
somewhere here, isn't he?

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,090
We know he's here,
so hurry up and bring him to us.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,790
We're closed at the moment.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,560
Did you not see the sign
that we're on break now?

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,260
Quit the act. Hurry up and tell us!

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,030
We won't go easy on you anymore.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,830
I told you. I do not know.

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,970
Why do you keep harassing me like this?

14
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,840
Darn it. Hey, hold her arm.
You, come here.

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,300
- Come here.
- No! Why are you doing this to a woman?

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,640
- Why, you...
- Let go!

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,810
- Stop!
- Let go of me!

18
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,710
- Come here.
- No.

19
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,180
- No...
- Help!

20
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,450
- Some burglars are kidnapping a woman!
- Darn it. Hey!

21
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,880
- Shut it.
- Help!

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,650
- I told you to shut it. Darn it.
- Help!

23
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,720
- Hey.
- Help!

24
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,190
- Darn it.
- Help us!

25
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,860
You jerks!

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,140
Dad!

27
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,140
Hey.

28
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,910
Someone came to Buddumak
for a job interview earlier.

29
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,710
But he looked just like Mr. Han Mu Chul.

30
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,250
What?

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,580
He looked like Mu Chul?

32
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,950
He looked just like him.
My jaw dropped when I saw him.

33
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,160
I thought Mr. Han came back to life.

34
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,990
(Jackpot Chicken)

35
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,460
How's that possible? He's dead.

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,400
My point, exactly. You should've seen him.

37
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,770
Your jaw would've dropped
to the floor too.

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,900
Really?

39
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,100
Well, I am curious...

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,700
since you say he looked just like him.

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,910
Anyway, Dad.

42
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,410
You and Mom haven't made up yet, have you?

43
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,880
You know how it is.

44
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,120
It might be hurtful for you to hear this,

45
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,180
but I'll be honest. I can understand Mom.

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,920
There's something
Mom used to say to me all the time.

47
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,960
"I don't want my daughter to ever
have to freeload at someone else's house."

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,560
When Mom was young,
her family was so poor...

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,100
that they had to freeload
at Ms. Mi Ja's house, you know.

50
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,440
I think it made her very sad.

51
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,610
I would've felt the same way.

52
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,510
If I had to freeload
at my friend's house...

53
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,350
Gosh, my pride would be crushed.
I'd hate it.

54
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,080
She experienced that in her adolescence
when she was emotionally sensitive.

55
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,620
Think about what it must've been like.

56
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,720
Mom must've been hurt by that experience.

57
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,690
So, she told herself this.

58
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,530
"I will be sure to raise my children
in my own home."

59
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,430
But as you know,

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,430
Mom has never had her own house, you know.

61
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,240
If her first house...

62
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,840
is the very place
she used to rent from Ms. Mi Ja...

63
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,640
I wouldn't like that either.

64
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,280
So, Dad.

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,250
I don't want to move either.

66
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,180
But if that's what Mom wants,
I'll gladly move with her.

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,220
So,

68
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,720
make a little more effort
to understand Mom. Please?

69
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,030
Okay.

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,570
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

71
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,300
(Tae Hyung's father)

72
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,010
Hey, what's up?

73
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
Tae Hyung.

74
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,750
Your father isn't answering his phone.

75
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,280
Did something happen?

76
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,750
My father?

77
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,690
No, he's fine. Why?

78
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,450
Oh, really?

79
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,360
How should I bring this up?

80
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,060
Earlier in the day,
an attorney your father sent dropped by.

81
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,130
He said your father decided
to withdraw his investment in my company.

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,300
So, I want to talk to him in person
to find out what's going on.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,370
Do you know where he is now?

84
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,410
Well, I don't think you need to meet him.

85
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,870
I don't need to meet him?

86
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,040
I need to at least hear the reason
behind his decision.

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,850
Maybe there was some misunderstanding.

88
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,620
The reason?

89
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,350
I told him to do it.

90
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,790
- What?
- I told Dad...

91
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,660
to take back the investment.

92
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,860
But why?

93
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,160
I thought you were my friend,

94
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,230
but you didn't.

95
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,900
I thought
I shouldn't have to be so generous...

96
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,930
to a jerk who chose a girl
over our friendship.

97
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,470
That's why I told him.

98
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,310
A girl?

99
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,010
You mean, Seo Woo?

100
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,940
Are you saying you told your father
to withdraw his investment...

101
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,150
because of Seo Woo?

102
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,780
I have nothing else to say,
so I'm leaving.

103
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,620
Tae Hyung.

104
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,620
Tae Hyung!

105
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,630
Right.

106
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,670
Tae Hyung is his friend,

107
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,540
and Tae Hyung's father
invested in his business,

108
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,670
so I understand it was hard for him
to tell me everything honestly.

109
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,140
I'll forgive him just this once.

110
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,480
Anyway, he told me I was pretty,

111
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,720
so he probably had a crush on me.

112
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,520
Of course, he'd fall for my beauty.

113
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,100
Hey, wait. Let's talk.

114
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,070
Hey, didn't you hear what I said?

115
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,280
That looks delicious.

116
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,220
Are you making food
for that rite for Seok Jin's business?

117
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,650
Yes.

118
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,490
Mom.

119
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,230
Are you still angry?

120
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,560
I don't know. Let's not talk about it.

121
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,000
Goodness. You sound scary.

122
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,030
Fine, I won't bring it up.

123
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,500
I'm home.

124
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,570
Seok Jin is home.

125
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,140
Hey, Seok Jin.

126
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,810
What's with Seok Jin?

127
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,910
Not sure. He seems to be in a bad mood.

128
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,580
The opening day is tomorrow,
so I guess he's nervous.

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Dad, you're going too, right?
That rite is tomorrow.

130
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,290
Of course, I should be there.
You'll be there too, right?

131
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,390
Yes, I should be there.

132
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,790
Come to think of it, it'll be
my first time visiting Seok Jin's office.

133
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,400
Seok Jin is home, right?

134
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,730
Yes, he's in his room.

135
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,610
Seok Jin, I prepared all the food
and a pig's head too.

136
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,940
What time should I arrive
at your office tomorrow?

137
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,950
Seok Jin, can't you hear me?

138
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,810
Don't come.

139
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,250
What?

140
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,420
We can't launch the site tomorrow,
so don't come.

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Why?

142
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
Did something happen?

143
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,360
Seok Jin.

144
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,530
Like I said, it is not happening,
so ask no more!

145
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,130
Please leave me alone. I'm tired.

146
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,870
Oh, okay. Get some rest.

147
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,220
Mom, what's wrong with Seok Jin?
He just yelled at you, didn't he?

148
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,720
Your brother isn't opening
his business tomorrow.

149
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,660
What? But why?

150
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,960
I don't know either.

151
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,330
Dad.

152
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,240
So, you mean you couldn't find a job?

153
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
No.

154
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,910
Goodness, I knew it.

155
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,480
Do you think it's easy to find a job
at your age?

156
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,450
At age 60,

157
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,090
most people retire from their jobs.

158
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,720
You can't help it.

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
You should keep collecting
scrap cardboard and boxes like before.

160
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
Who knows?

161
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,530
You might run into a rich old lady
on the street...

162
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,430
and become a Cinderella grandpa.

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,940
- You know?
- My goodness.

164
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,640
What did you say, Grandpa?

165
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,280
I'm having lots of fun teasing you.

166
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Gosh, that makes me feel much better.

167
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,120
My goodness.

168
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,690
I'm going to go outside
and organize some stuff.

169
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,150
Get some rest.

170
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,930
All that time I've lost...

171
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,400
How on earth am I supposed to get it back?

172
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,420
Once the buyer pays off
the cost of the house,

173
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,050
they could move in as early as tomorrow.

174
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,120
Han Mu Chul.

175
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,760
How could you drive my life
to the edge of a precipice?

176
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,130
Was this what you wanted?

177
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,770
Was it?

178
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,510
Is he really not opening his business?

179
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,850
What am I supposed to do
with all this food?

180
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,290
Gosh, did something bad happen?

181
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,960
Mom.

182
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,360
Seok Jin was supposed to open
an online shopping mall tomorrow,

183
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,470
but I guess something isn't going well.

184
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,970
I don't know what it's about,

185
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,370
but please look out for him from above.

186
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,310
And about this house.

187
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,450
Honestly,

188
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,250
I was very happy while living here.

189
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,350
Mom.

190
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
You remember, don't you?

191
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,830
You spent your last days...

192
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,000
in this neighborhood.

193
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,030
Her last days?

194
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,170
My wife doesn't really know.

195
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,170
She just knows that I lived
in this neighborhood with Dad.

196
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,240
She doesn't know...

197
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,410
that you also lived here...

198
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,110
until you passed away.

199
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,580
That's why this neighborhood means
so much to me.

200
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,550
But it's not easy.

201
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,630
I'm not really sure what to do.

202
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,870
This is...

203
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,050
the place where Mother passed away?

204
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,360
So what, though?

205
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,100
If we live here,

206
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,200
will his late mother come back to life?

207
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,670
The living should go on living.

208
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,040
How much longer will he live
in his past memories?

209
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,050
No, this isn't right.

210
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,920
I'm going to do what I want to do.

211
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,590
Even if his mother and grandmother
used to live here,

212
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,990
I still won't live here.

213
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,630
Where are you going, Mom?

214
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,730
I'm so anxious. I'm going to a temple.

215
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,700
Okay, see you later.

216
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,570
She's suddenly going to a temple?

217
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,780
What do you think you're doing?

218
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,950
Do you know Han Tae Ha?

219
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,120
That's my son.

220
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,850
Who are you,
and why are you looking for Tae Ha?

221
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,290
Han Tae Ha is home right now, isn't he?

222
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,650
I asked you first.

223
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,090
Who on earth are you
that you're asking for Tae Ha?

224
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,160
Han Tae Ha borrowed our money
and isn't paying us back.

225
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,930
So, bring him here now!

226
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
What did you say?

227
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,300
Tae Ha borrowed money from you?

228
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,270
Who are you people?

229
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,940
Are you loan sharks?

230
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,140
That's right.

231
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,880
So, bring Han Tae Ha here
while we're asking nicely.

232
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,540
Tae Ha isn't home right now,

233
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,180
so stop this and just leave.

234
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,550
Where do you think you're going?

235
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,910
Hey, let go of me.

236
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,450
What are you doing here?

237
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,980
- Darn it.
- Let go of her!

238
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,590
Who in the world are you to do this
in front of someone else's house?

239
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Do you know these people?

240
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
No, I don't know them.

241
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,760
Leave this instant.
If not, I'll call the police.

242
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,270
Didn't you hear what I said?

243
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,270
We warned you.

244
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,170
Let's go.

245
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,680
Thank you.

246
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,650
Are you all right?

247
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,250
By the way,
is something going on with Tae Ha?

248
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,020
From what I heard earlier,

249
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,520
they seemed to be looking for Tae Ha.

250
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,260
I'll head inside first.

251
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,500
Gosh, I'm hungry.

252
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,170
Is there anything to eat?

253
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,740
Mom, where were you?

254
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,910
Mom, why are you back already?
Weren't you going to the temple?

255
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,910
Tae Ha.

256
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,350
Did you borrow money from loan sharks?

257
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,620
What? How do you know that, Mom?

258
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,850
Are you insane?

259
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,790
How dare you borrow money
from loan sharks?

260
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,590
Gosh, that hurts!

261
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,230
Seriously, was your dad's mess not enough?

262
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,730
Do you want to do this too?

263
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,790
Hey, what will you do now?

264
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,030
Those loan sharks are outside the house.

265
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,100
What are you going to do now?

266
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,600
What? Those guys are back?

267
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,340
Gosh, I can't believe those jerks.

268
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,110
Why are you all doing this to me?

269
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,380
What am I supposed to do?

270
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,940
What am I supposed to do?

271
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,310
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Mom.

272
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,550
Don't cry.

273
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,150
Well, I didn't know.

274
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,120
I didn't know my friend would run off
with my money.

275
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,990
Gosh, seriously! I don't need any of you!
Not my children,

276
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,760
or my husband!

277
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Get out, all of you!

278
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,430
Will this end when I die?

279
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,130
No, Mom. Don't say that.

280
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,270
- Mom!
- Don't cry.

281
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,400
Mom!

282
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,870
Why did you give birth to me
just to make me suffer?

283
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,680
Seok Jin.

284
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,720
When did he leave the house?

285
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,760
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

286
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,790
Please leave a message after the tone.

287
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,200
Seok Jin.

288
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,170
It's Mom.

289
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,300
There isn't anything going on, is there?

290
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,740
When you get this,

291
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,470
please call me back.

292
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
Honey.

293
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Honey,

294
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,950
do you really hate living here so much?

295
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,890
Are you trying to persuade me again?

296
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,060
Go ahead and try. I won't live here.

297
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,730
To me, my future is more important
than your past memories.

298
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,130
Lee Hye Sook's life
that I will be living in the future.

299
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,430
Tell me.

300
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,100
Do you really hate this place so much?

301
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,140
That's right.
How many times must I tell you?

302
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,710
Okay. I understand.

303
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,680
So, you want to live separately?

304
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,280
Fine. Do you think that will scare me?

305
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,790
I'm already prepared.

306
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,890
I'm certain I can live well on my own.

307
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,860
Let's move.

308
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
What?

309
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,500
You want to move?

310
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,000
Well, I could rent this place out
or sell it to someone else.

311
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,400
Let's move to a place you like.

312
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,270
Are you sure?

313
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,780
Do you really want to move?

314
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,550
I didn't think everything through.

315
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,280
You know me.

316
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,320
I feel particularly attached
to my late parents.

317
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,360
I think that was why I got so obsessed
with this house without realizing it.

318
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,660
But I thought about it,
and your happiness...

319
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,960
matters more to me than my own.

320
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,300
What good would it do for me to enjoy
nice things on my own without you?

321
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,670
To me, nothing matters more
than you, Lee Hye Sook.

322
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,280
So, I'll follow your wishes.

323
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,810
If that can make you happy,

324
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,080
I will gladly give up my greed.

325
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,490
You know this, right?

326
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,790
I can't live without you, honey.

327
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,230
I can't even imagine my home without you.

328
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,230
So, let's move...

329
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,800
and live a very happy life, the two of us.

330
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,950
What? What's the matter now?
Did I do something wrong again?

331
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,990
I can't believe you!

332
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,030
I seriously can't believe you!

333
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,160
I haven't been able to hire anyone.

334
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,930
Why not? No one is coming in
for an interview?

335
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,170
It's not that.

336
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,940
I haven't found anyone
who'd be a good fit.

337
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,510
Yesterday, this man came,
and he looked like he was in his 60s.

338
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,940
What? Oh, no. What should we do?

339
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,280
Do you have any friends
who'd be interested in the job?

340
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,050
No, I don't.

341
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,650
All of my friends are either in school
or working...

342
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,950
Oh, right. Let me call you back.

343
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
What's up?

344
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,690
I have a proposition to make.

345
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,330
What is it?

346
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,270
Hurry up and say it.
I'm not in the mood to deal with this.

347
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,470
How dare you snap at me like that?

348
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,240
Have you forgotten that you owe me money?

349
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,640
Even yesterday, those loan sharks
came here and caused a scene.

350
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,810
What? They came here too?

351
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,880
Those jerks. They're ridiculous.

352
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,480
You're the one who's being ridiculous.

353
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,450
You're the weird one
for not paying back the money you owe.

354
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,420
Isn't it only natural
that they want their money back?

355
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,290
Well, anyway,
what did you want to talk to me about?

356
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,730
Read this.

357
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,730
What is this?

358
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,770
"We're hiring. Buddumak?"

359
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,500
Boss hurt his back,

360
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,140
so we're looking
for a temporary part-timer.

361
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,410
I know your situation,
so I'll be generous...

362
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,040
and give you 36 months
to pay me back in full.

363
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,150
You should work here.
With the money you earn from this job,

364
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,320
you can pay me back
and those loan sharks too.

365
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,720
- I can't do this.
- What?

366
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,220
Hey, I'm working on something right now.

367
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,990
It's something you wouldn't understand.
It's a very special,

368
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,430
delicate, and professional project.

369
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,460
Give me just a little more time.

370
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,530
I'll pay you back
and those loan sharks very soon.

371
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,400
Mr. Han Tae Ha. You don't understand
what's going on here, do you?

372
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,440
Do I look like
I'm asking for your agreement right now?

373
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,980
If the loan sharks
show up here one more time,

374
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,710
I will take them to your house.

375
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,320
I'll make a poster saying
Han Tae Ha ran off with my money...

376
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,020
and put it up
in every corner of the neighborhood.

377
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,060
I'll also report you to the police.

378
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,760
- What?
- So,

379
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,890
you'd better get your act together.

380
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,430
If there's something you can do
to earn money, just do it.

381
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,970
If you say something else later on,
I will really...

382
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,330
You'll really, what? My gosh.

383
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,970
What? Hey.

384
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,010
Hey!

385
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,310
Here.

386
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,720
Do you feel better now?

387
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,020
Stay home and rest up.
I'll go to the restaurant.

388
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,090
Honey.

389
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,030
Let's just...

390
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
stay here.

391
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,800
What? What do you mean?

392
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,640
I'll stay here.
That's what you want to do.

393
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,380
We won't move.

394
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Honey.

395
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,150
Thanks.

396
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,480
Thanks a lot.

397
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,990
Whatever.

398
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,360
This is all because of you.

399
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,090
I was only thinking of myself,

400
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,760
so if you say things like that,
what am I supposed to do?

401
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,260
Seriously, you're so mean!

402
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,710
What brings you by, Geum Ok?

403
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,740
I was worried about you,
so I stopped by to check in on you.

404
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,010
Here, I made
the multigrain shake you like.

405
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,750
I see. Thanks.

406
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,880
Mi Ja.

407
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,790
I heard you were planning
to move out soon.

408
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,520
Yes, that's the situation now.

409
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,290
You must be really upset.

410
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,190
Moving is so stressful.

411
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,530
On top of that,
Dae Sik owns this house now.

412
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,430
What? What do you mean
Dae Sik owns this house?

413
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,970
You mean Hye Sook's husband, Kim Dae Sik?

414
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,010
You didn't know?

415
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,910
This house.
Dae Sik is the one who bought it.

416
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,580
What? Hye Sook's husband
won this house in the auction?

417
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,150
What? Mi Ja.

418
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,850
I thought you knew too.

419
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,590
Oh, no. Should I not have said anything?

420
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,360
If you stay here,

421
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,390
this place will keep reminding you
of your husband.

422
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,360
Try to look on the bright side.

423
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,470
So, she said stuff like that...

424
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,900
because she owns this house now?

425
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,170
What? What do you mean?

426
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,110
Did someone say something?

427
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,580
My gosh!

428
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,650
Mi Ja. My goodness.

429
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,750
Geum Ok, why are you coming out of there?

430
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,790
Hey, so you won this house in the auction?

431
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,290
Yes. Somehow, that happened.

432
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,660
Gosh, Hye Sook.

433
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,390
And you had the nerve to comfort me?

434
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,230
You must be very excited these days.

435
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,330
I bet you're getting a kick
out of seeing me in this mess.

436
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,000
What are you saying? What did I even do?

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,170
You sly witch. You're always so two-faced.

438
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,910
That's why I never trust a word you say.
Do you know that?

439
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,980
Hey, are you done talking? "Sly witch?"

440
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,480
Yes, you sly witch!

441
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,080
My gosh, both of you.
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

442
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,950
Please don't fight, okay?

443
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,950
- Hey.
- Mi Ja.

444
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,650
I never wanted to stay here.

445
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,820
That's why I didn't bother telling you.

446
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,090
Don't make me laugh!
You must be very excited,

447
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,960
thinking that you can finally kick me out
now that you own this house.

448
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,900
Fine! It's all yours now, you witch.

449
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,230
Even if I end up on the street,

450
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,200
I'll move out of this house right away!

451
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Mi Ja. My goodness.

452
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,200
- Unbelievable.
- Mi Ja!

453
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,970
My gosh. What is her problem?

454
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,480
Hey, Jin Tae. I'm home.

455
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,810
Hey, you're home.

456
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,180
No, don't get up. Is Min Yong in his room?

457
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,020
He stepped out to meet a friend.

458
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,890
Did he? I came home
to fix you guys some lunch.

459
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,120
Did you have lunch?

460
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,060
Oh, there's a lot here.

461
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
Sir, I'll take these.

462
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,930
Yes, thank you.

463
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,970
Thank you!

464
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,440
Hey, what are you doing?

465
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,810
I said not to take them.
Did you not hear what I said?

466
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,910
What? I thought
you said I could take them.

467
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,680
When did I say that? What's with you?

468
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
Hold on.

469
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,220
Aren't you the one
who stole those boxes last time?

470
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,560
No, I'm not.

471
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,690
Yes, you're that man I saw
in the security footage.

472
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,060
You thief. I caught you.

473
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,070
Sir, why... Why are you doing this?

474
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,540
So, this man here stole your boxes
a while back too. Is that it?

475
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,710
Yes, that's correct.

476
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,710
No.

477
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
I am not a thief.

478
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,580
- Your resident registration number.
- Pardon?

479
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,380
What's your resident registration number?
You don't know what it is?

480
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,080
I don't know.

481
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Let go!

482
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,650
- It wasn't us!
- Let us go!

483
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,250
- Darn it.
- What's your problem?

484
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,990
- We did nothing wrong.
- Let go of me, and we can talk.

485
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,990
- It wasn't us.
- I told you. It wasn't us.

486
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,690
Seriously, what's your problem?

487
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,770
Hello, thank you for calling
Number One Real Estate.

488
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
Pardon? The police station?

489
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,310
Choi Min Yong.

490
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,410
Why did you go there?

491
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Min Yong.

492
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,810
What happened?

493
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,780
Did these punks hit my son, Min Yong?

494
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,620
Please calm down and wait.

495
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,650
What's your name?

496
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,450
- I'm Choi Min Yong.
- Then what is your name?

497
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,290
- Why did you go there?
- I'm Han Mu Chul.

498
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,720
- That's my name.
- It wasn't us.

499
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,530
- Han Mu Chul?
- We didn't go there.

500
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,830
You punks. Stop lying.

501
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,530
Are you sure that's your name?

502
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Yes!

503
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
All right.

504
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,970
- Mu Chul?
- What did you say?

505
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,240
(Good Luck!)

506
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,670
Why don't you ask her?

507
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,610
Ask her if she has a place to go.

508
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,980
I can't believe
I'm seeing those two together here.

509
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,080
- Now, we have a place to move to!
- What?

510
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,480
Would your friends welcome you
if you showed up dressed like that?

511
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,380
I will visit you soon.

512
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,390
I promise.

513
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,520
